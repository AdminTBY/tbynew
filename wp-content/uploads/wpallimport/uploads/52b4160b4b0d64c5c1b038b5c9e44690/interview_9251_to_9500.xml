		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights for Medco in its over 100 years of history?<br></h4><p>Medco is 103 years old, and we are part of the third generation of the company. It is a family-owned business, but it acts and behaves like a corporation; it has corporate governance and strict rules of engagement. Medco is part of the group of seven companies that exist in the importation, storage, and downstream petroleum sector. We import, store, and deliver products to the end consumer, using our own fleet of trucks and through a network of service stations, of which we have 183 throughout Lebanon. We have a full line of products and we are the only company in Lebanon that offers LPG, gasoline, gas oil, fuel oil, and lubricants. We are a fully integrated company and we do our own imports, we store the product in our own tanks, and we deliver with our own trucks just to ensure that the quality and integrity of the product is respected all the way along the chain to the consumer.</p><h4>Where do you mainly import from?</h4><p>We import from ENI in Italy. This is mostly gasoline and gas oil, and other products we import from different sources. We also have a very strong footprint not only in service stations, but in convenience stores. Many of our stations have convenience stores, and we started that back in 1995. We provide service 24/7, 365 days a year. We believe that the service station is a point of sale, not just to sell gas, but to provide a service to customers.</p><h4>What have been your main initiatives in 2013?</h4><p>Most recently we introduced Propel, a fuel additive that is immediately mixed with gasoline and provides many advantages. Firstly, it helps take away the deposits that are formed by compression in the engine. By taking the deposits off the engine, it allows for better engine performance and less fuel consumption because when the engine is working at its full capacity, it provides better combustion and better combustion provides more energy for less consumption. The market reaction was very good, the advertising was clear, it was simple to understand, and consumers that have tried it are coming back, so that is good news. Furthermore, it is provided immediately with the gas, without any additional cost to the consumer, and it is part of our effort to provide a better quality product for the same price. Also, in the past year we acquired a small chain of convenience stores that we added to our network, and so we are in the process of expanding that particular business, which we believe is profitable.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the Lebanese energy sector, and what do you think Lebanon must do to tap into this potential?</h4><p>The numbers are quite significant, but we would only know once the exploration process starts. I believe it is a game changer for Lebanon. It could mean a lot to the economy, including a reduction in the country's public debt. It would mean better services as well, investment in infrastructure, better living conditions for the people, and, at the end of the day, new jobs being created by the different business that would be created around exploration, such as logistics, transportation, and hotel accommodation—it is a game changer. It is important that this process, which has already started, is not stopped or delayed and that transparency and governance over the wealth is managed properly. This is one of the major concerns of all the Lebanese people. So far, it looks as if things are on track; there may be some delays because of the political situation, but I think that at least the overall political climate on this particular subject is one of agreement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the establishment of economic zones drive Qatar's economic growth and help in the diversification effort?</h4><p>Many countries have employed the concept of economic zones, especially those that seek to further enhance economic activity and development. Economic zones have both a policy and an infrastructure rationale. In terms of policy, an economic zone can be a useful tool as part of an overall economic growth strategy to enhance industrial competitiveness and attract both local and international investments. Thus, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030, Manateq, an autonomous government company and part of the Qatar Authority for SMEs, was established to play a vital part in the country's overall economic growth strategy. By piloting new policies and approaches, Manateq aims to develop and diversify the production of goods, the delivery of services, and the creation of jobs. It also enables efficient government supervision, the provision of off-site infrastructure, and environmental controls. Additionally, Manateq has been mandated to develop and manage several economic zone projects in order to aid and stimulate substantial private sector investment, both local and foreign, into mid-sized activities such as manufacturing. And, through Manateq, Qatar is likewise able to focus on non-oil related industries, with an emphasis on economic development through a competitive, knowledge-based, and diversified economy.</p><h4>How are the three current zones positioned to encourage a long-term trend of diversification?</h4><p>Manateq is driven by its vision of creating a future with sustainable growth for everyone. By using resources wisely, supporting diversification, caring for the environment, providing access to growing markets, and making it easier to do business, Manateq creates the right conditions for clients for smooth, long-term operations, as well as further opportunities for excellent returns. It is for these reasons that each of the three economic zones—Ras Bufontas, Abu Nakhla, and Um Alhoul—have been clearly clustered to provide infrastructure and services that cater to specific industries and business sectors. As clustering provides further distinct advantages, Ras Bufontas, for instance, has been defined to cater to advanced technology and logistics businesses, Abu Nakhla for specialized industries and logistics, and Um Alhoul for light manufacturing. A significant factor in the clustering of each zone also involves its size and location. Thus, with Ras Bufontas being approximately a 4.01 square kilometer area that adjoins the New Doha International Airport, this cluster targets business sectors such as logistics, information and communications, healthcare, energy and the environment, high-tech building, and global warehousing. Meanwhile, Abu Nakhla, which is approximately a 11.95 square kilometers in size, just south of the current Doha Industrial Area, targets businesses involved in building materials, machinery and fabrications, specialized spill-over industries, safety and maintenance, and specialized warehousing and logistics. On the other hand, Um Alhoul, which is 33.5 square kilometers in area and adjoins the New Port Project, just south of Wakrah, targets businesses involved in petrochemicals, building materials, maritime operations, metals, logistics, food processing, and many others. Given such focus, it is intended that each of these three economic zones will be able to provide long-term benefits for customers.</p><div class="quote">“Manateq is driven by its vision of creating a future with sustainable growth for everyone."</div><h4>Where does the economic zones project fit into Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>One of four key pillars of Qatar National Vision 2030 is economic development. On this pillar, the ultimate objective is to develop a competitive and diversified economy that addresses the needs of its people and creates for them a high standard of living. Thus, Manateq and its economic zones clearly have a vital role to play in the realization of Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its foundation in 1973, what role has Expreso played in transforming the local media landscape?<br></h4><p>Expreso has positioned itself as an innovative newspaper. It was a pioneer of the subscription system in Ecuador, and has developed benefits for its subscribers, penetrating the digital world and the mobility of tablets. Ever objective, Expreso is known for its well-researched editorials and coverage of the major stories in domestic and global politics and economy. We aspire to maintain our strict standards of journalistic integrity, and continue to deliver quality news content to the Ecuadorean public.</p><h4>What prompted Expreso's shift from a focus on Guayaquil to a wider national coverage?</h4><p>Expreso is basically a Guayaquil newspaper. And while it does address national and global issues, it's focus remains on Guayaquil, which is Ecuador's main port and economic capital. Naturally though, we cannot be estranged from the wider issues of our country, and so we cover news from other regions to keep our readers informed.</p><h4>How would you characterize the changing nature of demand for information in the local market?</h4><p>Readers increasingly want more concrete information that is personalized to their interests and needs. They also want immediate access, which explains the huge popularity of social networks. Of course, these networks lack the high quality research capability of a newspaper, which is what makes us indispensible for our readers. As a newspaper, we have to reinvent every day and create the best product so that our readers feel the need to buy a copy every day, confident of finding well-written and accurate stories.</p><h4>Has Expreso sought to increase its international presence?</h4><p>It's a complicated business for a newspaper to have a high international presence, although we provide the many Ecuadoreans living abroad news coverage via our e-paper, website, and on tablets. By these means, they feel connected both to their country and to the paper.</p><h4>How would you describe the newspaper's readership base and how many people subscribe to it?</h4><p>We have an important subscription base that guarantees our readership, mainly from Guayaquil and nearby cities. Subscriptions go beyond being a mere payment system, as they allow is to become familiar with the reader, and more informed in terms of what kind of service they want from us. This is important when it comes to developing new products and content.</p><h4>How has Expreso adapted to technology in terms of marketing and newsgathering?</h4><p>Expreso has always been closely associated with technological advances, be it for printing, distribution, merchandising, or other forms of marketing. Today, when considering the news business, digital technology immediately springs to mind, but let's not forget that behind the technology is a team of professionals that has led the company to its achievements. And concerning the content itself, having access to imagery and agency texts, and being associated with newspapers such as Le Monde, El Paí­s, and El Mundo, among others, guarantees that we produce the best possible coverage of international affairs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The country has tripled its investment in the public health field since 2007. What have been the key projects implemented by your Ministry?<br></h4><p>The current government of Ecuador has invested around $7 billion in public health projects from 2007 to 2012. The project that represents the largest investment is the construction and rehabilitation of hospital infrastructure across the country. For example, in Guayaquil, the largest city in our country, the Ministry of Public Health had not invested in the creation of more hospital beds for the last 30 years, and that needed to be addressed. Overall, the demand for public health services and infrastructure has grown in the country; however, the supply of health services has not followed. Up until now, we mostly focused on rehabilitating existing infrastructure, whereas from now on we will put an emphasis on the development of new projects. In 2013, we have a geographical strategy that provides the framework and guide to what and where needs to be built in Ecuador in terms of hospital infrastructure. At the same time, we have revised bureaucratic processes in order to facilitate and speed up the above-mentioned processes and dynamics. In 2013 alone, we will invest $930 million in ongoing and new projects, which represents the largest and most significant investment in public health carried out in Ecuador for the last two decades. We have a strategic development plan for the next 10 years, we are constructing 100 health centers now, and we plan to build over 900 new health centers over the next four years. In this context, and since we are the most important health service provider in the country, we always aim to raise quality standards to international levels. In 2012, we provided over 40 million services, which represented around 110,000 services per day. In parallel, we put great efforts into continuing to facilitate the access of Ecuadorean citizens to the public health system. The main idea and mission of our Ministry, based on the 2008 Constitution, is to provide universal health care to the citizens of Ecuador regardless of their background, and that requires high levels of investment if we want to achieve positive and productive results in the short term. Another cornerstone of our work has to do with human capital; a field that the current government has always prioritized. We have doubled the number of professionals working in the Ministry of Public Health, we have increased the salaries of many specialists and health professionals, and we have strengthened the quality control processes for our employees. It is important to recognize their work and role in society, especially in terms of wages. In this context, such changes have attracted back many Ecuadorean specialists and doctors working abroad. In only the first three months of 2013, over 300 health professionals have come back to Ecuador. In addition to that trend, we have experienced increasing interest from foreign professionals in coming to work in Ecuador.</p><h4>What are the current human capital needs for Ecuador in the health field?</h4><p>We need a qualified work force for the health industry, both nationally and internationally. We welcome all those who want to come back to Ecuador and those who want to come here for the first time, because foreign expertise clearly contributes to the improvement of our professionals and system. However, we do not actively recruit from abroad. We also have strengthened the education programs and financial tools for students to get the best education at the international level, because for many years we lacked the level of graduate students the industry requires. It is all about providing a clear, medium-term vision for the development of the public health system.</p><h4>How is the work implemented by your Ministry contributing to the development of Ecuador?</h4><p>Our work and projects help to increase the productive working life of our inhabitants and the quality of life. We provide society with all the health tools and services required at any time during their lives. In addition, we contribute to reduce poverty levels and the living expenses of Ecuadorean citizens.</p><div class="quote">“  From now, on we will put an emphasis on the development of new projects.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Quito was named one of the top-20 destinations in 2013. How has the tourism industry evolved in the city?<br></h4><p>Overall, it has been a positive and successful evolution. Around 11 years ago, when the Metropolitan Corporation of Tourism was established, we saw a significant change in terms of promotion and priorities in the sector, as there was no such municipal/city organization. The city's institution gave a boost to both private and public engagement in terms of tourism, and today we have a public office in charge of promoting Quito as a tourism destination, coordinating everyone's efforts toward the same goal. In this context, the tourism sector was named back in 2011 as a strategic sector for the development of the city's economy: La Mariscal, La Floresta, and the city's historic center were labeled as key areas. Such a move is a clear sign of the evolution of the tourism industry in Quito, because it implies common efforts led by local authorities through public policies and city laws. In terms of numbers, in 2012 Quito received 570,000 visitors, which is the highest figure of the last decade and represented 7% growth as compared to 2011. Also, this figure puts Quito above average world growth in terms of tourism. In addition, internationally recognized media and publications, such as National Geographic, Lonely Planet, and tripadvisor.com, named Quito as one of the top tourism destinations both in 2012 and 2013. I would also like to mention that The New York Times included Quito in the list of the 1,000 places to see before dying. These recognitions emphasize the good work done by Quito's Municipality authorities and also the private sector to boost tourism in Ecuador's capital city, while making sure that visitors feel at home when visiting the city.</p><h4>What are the main strategic plans to continue promoting Quito as a tourism destination in 2013?</h4><p>Quito will be hosting the TravelMart Latin America in 2013. It is a very specialized event within the tourism industry where tour operators, countries, and other agents from the entire region gather together to share their experiences and offerings. TravelMart Latin America will be happening from September 18-20, 2013. Quito will also be hosting the 4th Iberoamerican Meeting of Digital Cities. These are just two of the main events to happen in Quito in 2013. Our main goal for the next few years is to consolidate Quito's position in the US market as an attractive tourism destination. Also, we will increase efforts toward promoting the city in South America, with special attention to Brazil and Argentina, as well as some European markets. Additionally, we are implementing a very ambitious strategy in terms of press and leisure trips. We invite specialized press from different countries to come to Quito and find out more about the city. In 2012, we organized 46 press and leisure trips with 150 journalists. The media value of what these professionals published after the visit was worth $6 million. Also, we will increase efforts toward MICE tourism; Quito's old airport will become a MICE center. I think Quito has a huge potential to become a regional hub, a door to South America, and also become a regional reference point within the MICE industry. Finally, all the ongoing infrastructure projects such as the new airport and the future Quito metro, among others, will be a major push for the development of the tourism industry in the city. We hope to close 2013 with a growth rate of around 5% to 7%, driven mostly by events like TravelMart Latin America 2013.</p><h4>Where are travelers coming from, and what is the average expenditure of travelers visiting Quito?</h4><p>According to our reports, we calculated around a $500 daily expenditure for an  average stay of seven to eight days. In terms of country of origin, 27% of our visitors are from the US, followed by Colombia, 12%; Spain, 7% (mostly linked to returnees); Venezuela, 5%; and the rest is divided among many other countries. In this regard, Brazil and other countries from the Southern Cone are gaining relevance, and that is why we are increasingly focusing our promotional efforts on these markets.</p><div class="quote">“  In 2012, Quito received 570,000 visitors, which is the highest figure of the last decade.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Constructora Valero sought to position itself since it was established over two decades ago?<br></h4><p>We started operations 24 years ago, and back then we were just a family-run company that was developing construction work for friends. Over the next five years, we started growing, and little by little we entered the real estate business and handled small projects. We have always been a family-run business. During the economic recession that affected Ecuador in the early 2000s, we started working with the Municipality of Guayaquil, one of the most reliable public administrations in the country. From that moment on, we started handling key projects for the development of the city as well as re-urbanization and planning works in suburban areas of Guayaquil. Slowly, we also entered the real estate market in the city, and we have already constructed over 100 hectares of residential area.</p><h4>What are some of the main projects you are currently involved in?</h4><p>Right now, we handle four different real estate projects: Castilla, Compostela, Cumbres del Sol, and Bosques de los Ceibos. Additionally, we are working on the Holiday Inn Hotel near Guayaquil Airport, as well as Guayaquil's new prison building for 3,500 inmates. However, these are just some examples of our wide project portfolio.</p><h4>Who are the main clients of the company?</h4><p>Traditionally, we have targeted the middle to upper class; however, over the years, and thanks to our widening portfolio of projects, we are also increasing our range of clients. For example, in 2013 we will construct over 1,200 housing units for middle- to lower-income families. We build as all strata of society including the government, municipalities, and private companies. The only segment we have not entered yet is maritime infrastructure, and we do not have plans to do so in the future, for we believe that it requires specialized staff, equipment, and machinery. In addition to all this, 80% of our customers work with the Social Security Institution when acquiring a housing unit.</p><h4>What is the company's business strategy to further expand its activities?</h4><p>I would say that we are between the top five and top 10 in the market; however, the first three companies are one step ahead of the rest. It is difficult to reach such a level; nevertheless, we believe that by developing projects with value and high standards, as we have been doing, we will be able to keep growing.</p><h4>What is the size of your operations at the moment?</h4><p>We have 1,800 workers in addition to 55 professional engineers and architects.</p><h4>What measures should be taken to further develop the sector?</h4><p>I think it is very important to set a clearer field of action between the public and the private sectors, as well as strengthen ties between both. I believe we can all learn from each other and make the construction sector a stronger industry in Ecuador. I think that the government is aware of that, and it is taking appropriate steps. Additionally, further measures are needed to increase the housing offering for middle- to lower-income communities in society, especially for units whose price range is between $15,000 and $20,000. Also, I think we must reduce bureaucratic burdens for these and other projects, because they increase construction costs.</p><h4>What opportunities does the Ecuadorean construction sector offer to foreign investors?</h4><p>Ecuador offers plenty of opportunities for investors, and there is a wide availability of financial resources. For example, we issued debt not long ago to raise capital, and we reached very optimum levels. Ecuador has positively changed its image abroad and the government has played a key role in this process. Today, the rules of the game and fair competition are stronger than in the past. These steps have also contributed to strengthening business and legal security for investors.</p><h4>Does the company have any plans to expand its activities to other geographic areas?</h4><p>At the moment, we are working in five different cantons of Ecuador, and we are about to start a real estate project in Costa Rica—a large building in the La Sabana area. Also, we are part of a group of Ecuadorean investors developing a project in Cartagena, Colombia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of developing a high-tech IT infrastructure?<br></h4><p>The IT sector catalyzes development in the 21st century in all fields: finance, medicine, education, commerce, manufacturing, tourism, and communications. In the present era, any endeavor requires the support of a strong IT partner to be sustainable. The government of President Correa has been very proactive in its use of IT and has been visionary in recognizing the need for strong IT services of the broader economy. This is why the government is intent on building  substantial foundations for technological, and specifically, IT development. This is generating strong demand for young, capable professionals, and leading to a scarcity of talent. Thus, the main challenge is talent, and the solution is a focus on developing sufficient human capital to be competitive in the 21st century.</p><h4>How is Cobiscorp managing this growing scarcity of human resources?</h4><p>We are one of the leading employers of new IT graduates, and have been effective in attracting top talent. We have programs to collaborate with universities and aim to match the curricula with our needs. Cobiscorp also has its own in-house training programs, where we take fresh graduates and train them in financial technology, or fin-tech. This is how we bring them up to speed with our products and methods.</p><h4>What have been the company's major milestones?</h4><p>In 2013, we are celebrating our 60th anniversary. We were in the business of processing transactions long before becoming a software company. I have been with the company since the early 1990s, right around the time when we started developing banking software for the Latin American region. In 1956, my father, Richard Moss Howard, started the company as the exclusive representation of the National Cash Register Company. At the time, we sold mechanical, and later electro-mechanical cash registers, as well as accounting machines, which were used primarily by banks. We were seen as a company that brought innovation to the country, and catalyzed the inception of the self-service retail industry in Ecuador. We also worked very closely with clients in the financial sector, transforming their operations from hand-written annotations in journals to mechanical accounting systems. An important milestone for our company was our shift from electro-mechanical machines to the first era of computers in the early 1970s. This was a period of change and opportunity: to continue serving our primary clients, we had to meet the challenge of developing a computer-based solution for the local banking sector. This coincided with the start of Ecuador's oil exports, and a period of rapid growth for the economy. New banks were being established, and we became a leader in the provision of software banking solutions for the Ecuadorean market. By the end of the decade, more than 50% of the banks in Ecuador were using LABIS, our first core banking solution. Then the early 1990s brought another milestone for our company. New technological paradigms generated a shift toward open systems and client-server architectures, both of which became industry standards. Our challenge was to create a new solution based on this technology, and we decided that our focus would expand into the Latin American market. We, therefore, created COBIS. Both COBIS and the market have evolved, and today it is used by leading banks in 15 countries in Latin America, as well as by smaller clients in the US, Asia, and Africa. Everything has changed, but over our 60 years we have constantly innovated and reinvented ourselves to better serve our customers. Cobiscorp is a company that demands multiple talents and skills, including innovation, teamwork, entrepreneurship, deep technical knowledge, and long-lasting relationships with each of our clients.</p><div class="quote">“  Any endeavor requires the support of a strong IT partner to be sustainable.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What contributions has Sony made to Ecuador?<br></h4><p>At Sony, we see ourselves as part of the social fabric of Ecuador. We play an important role in giving back to society in various ways. We hire and train personnel to be productive members of this multinational corporation. We have many examples of members who were hired for an entry position as promoters, but who today are key players at our HQ. We have key talents, who have been given regional positions in marketing, promotion, and sales, and we currently have two local employees on foreign assignments as country managers. We provide constant training to our personnel to teach them new skills and improve on their current talents. We use our technical resources to grow tomorrow's technical companies. We have created an alliance with ESPOL, a local technical university in Guayaquil, to develop high-tech gaming software for the PlayStation 3. As part of this effort, ESPOL students are receiving guidance in developing and marketing tomorrow's software from our PlayStation Software Development headquarters in California. With ESPOL, we are also working together on creating widget applications to be used on smart televisions. In terms of local assembly, we launched our television assembly operations in Ecuador in 2013. This operation was developed with the support of all our technical groups around the world to develop a cutting-edge operation in line with the high-quality standards found at other Sony plants. In Latin America, Ecuador joined our other operations in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. We are always training and transferring knowledge to our local staff on issues such as assembly processes, quality control, technical record keeping, inventory management, and procurement. Our operations today have met our expectations in terms of professionalism and accuracy, which Sony has always been known for.</p><h4>What is the size of Sony's operation in Ecuador?</h4><p>In total, we have 168 employees at the company. They are all Ecuadoreans, except for myself and two other members. We have two Sony Stores; one is in the Mall de Sol in Guayaquil and the other in Quicentro Norte in Quito. These are our flag-ship stores, and are managed by our own staff. All of our promoters and store staff are 100% Sony employees. In this manner, we have full commitment from our staff, who receive all the benefits of belonging to the Sony family. Within the company we have many cases in which employees have worked their way up the ranks. Former promoters or store sales employees now work in sales and marketing; so our employees are people who have grown up with us.</p><h4>What innovation have you brought to the sector?</h4><p>Sony has brought 4K technology for our Bravia televisions into the Ecuadorean market. This is the next generation of high definition technology, which has a 4x better resolution than previous versions. In addition, we have developed the latest improvements to the reproduction of real colors with our Triluminos technology, introducing, for the first time, real colors as never before seen on a television. Sony has also brought the latest NFC technology into the market this year, which allows our products, such as cell phones, radios, headphones, audio devices, and computers, to communicate with each other without any complicated pairing process. This technology allows anyone to transfer data, music, photos, or movies with one touch. One of the best products to hit the market will be the Xperia Z mobile phone and tablet, which are both 100% water resistant, and can both withstand 30 minutes submerged. This is a dramatic breakthrough, since it is very common for phones to be destroyed by water.</p><h4>Which products are most in demand?</h4><p>We have seen continuous demand for televisions, computers, and tablets. Ecuadoreans are latecomers to the tablet market; the boom only occurred over the last year. Smartphones are big as well, and they're not just for the affluent consumer. This market is definitely a market in which consumers expect the latest in technology. It's seen as an investment; the average person does not have a large disposable income, so they like financing when they purchase, and thus they want a good product from a reliable brand, since the purchase is a big investment for most. This is why Sony is growing very well in Ecuador; it is a brand that is trusted, and one that always has the latest innovative technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Smooth Take-off]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-smooth-take-off]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the technical challenges facing the construction of the new airport in Quito?<br></h4><p>Geography is an issue. It was a challenge for the engineers to find a place for the airport close enough to Quito, but also far enough away for urban planning concerns, not to mention the challenge of finding a place to build a 4,100 meter runway, one of the longest in South America. To be able to shoehorn this kind of cutting-edge, modern airport design into this plateau, while at the same time ensuring that it abides by all criteria to render it a safe and efficient facility, was a big challenge, and amazing to achieve. Pilots have a very flat and calm approach when landing with the wind on the nose of the plane, which is ideal. The airport has a high-speed exit taxiway too, which means you have plenty of time to brake and slow down. All in all, design wise and engineering wise, the new airport is great. There have been concerns raised about crosswinds, but we don't think it is an issue. There is plenty of runway to safely operate the aircraft. At the old airport, there were more than 10 major incidents and accidents, as well as minor ones. In this new airport, we have a tremendous safety record. That was by far our primary concern. We have removed the risk factor of flying into Quito by applying very modern engineering. We also have future plans to expand the airport, which is easier to do. At this altitude, with the thinner air, it is harder to take off and land an aircraft. By extending the runway, providing rapid exit taxiways, implementing very modern air-traffic control systems and a control tower, as well as introducing Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) for both runways, we have taken the necessary measures to ensure that crosswinds are not a factor. Aircraft can land either from the south or north, depending on the wind conditions.</p><h4>How much was invested in the new airport?</h4><p>We have invested around $700 million. We had an Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contract with the municipality, which is like a turnkey contract. It means that when we contracted the project out to the Canadian and Brazilian construction firms that built the airport, everything was included; design, engineering, and architecture. The EPC contract is different from unit price contracts. According to the contract, they are going to give us a certifiable and safe airport, and then just hand us the figurative key.</p><h4>What is the airport's maximum capacity?</h4><p>The maximum capacity is for 45 aircraft parking positions, and over 5 million passengers per year. The number of employees at Quiport is 400. The airport is designed as a comprehensive system from landing to when the passenger gets in their cab. We will observe the airport in the first year to check for any bottlenecks or challenges, and then make adjustments, expansions, and improvements as required. Depending on how growth proceeds, and what the estimates for growth are, which we expect to be at around 10% within the first year, we will make adjustments to expand in anticipation of future growth. Usually, you can forecast airline passenger growth based on a country's GDP growth. These estimates will also enable us to add new routes and destinations. Cargo transportation is also a huge business here, and we are taking measures to facilitate large volumes. Ecuador is the world's third largest exporter of flowers, for example. We are building a consolidation facility, which should be finished by May 2013. Hundreds of trucks can bring tons of flowers a day, which can be kept fresh, cool, and safe, before being prepared and placed in boxes ready to be flown out. The old airport had many bodegas, which were very disorganized. We have completely transformed that. The consolidation facility wasn't a part of the turnkey project; it was a value-added project we undertook with Darby Private Equity, at a price of $23 million. All in all, Quiport is a very important project for Ecuador; it is effectively a window on the world. It is not just an airport. We work very closely with the municipality and the city, because an airport should fit into the overall transit and transport system of a city. The municipality and the federal government are working hard to help improve and expand access to the airport through new highways and traffic projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the core market factors that lead to the establishment of Servientrega in Ecuador?</h4><p>In the mid-1990s, Ecuador was enjoying an economic boom. Since Servientraga is from neighboring Colombia, we thought it was the right moment to take the company abroad. Colombia and Ecuador are two very similar countries and we also had future regional plans in mind, this being the first step. Additionally, the market research we conducted showed that companies operating in the logistics sector in Ecuador at that time did not properly meet the needs of the market. There were two key points in the industry—high-quality services and technology—that the Ecuadorean market lacked. Our slogan today is “Servientrega: Solutions Center: A Center For Solutions," since we provide our customers with integrated solutions to make their activity more efficient and qualitative. Servientrega is a logistics company that over the years has achieved great levels of success in Ecuador. Today, we are part of many different industries and processes; we work backstage in election processes, and we provide essential services for the key social and daily economic processes of Ecuador's life. This is Servientrega today, and despite the fact that our brand does not always show off, we are always present and ready to help out people and companies.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Servientrega?</h4><p>We always work to a five-year business plan, and at the beginning of each year we develop the main strategy to implement. Thanks to our activity, experience, and expertise in Colombia, we have always been able to import know-how into Ecuador. At the same time, our business model is based on the standardization of the brand and has always been an innovative one. Also, we have developed and implemented our own information system, which has a clear focus on Latin culture. I would like to stress that one of our main assets and competitive advantages is our human capital, which thanks to their qualities and our extensive branch network puts us in a better position than our competitors.</p><h4>How was 2012 for the company?</h4><p>Despite the slight economic deceleration, we managed to achieve positive results, consolidating our brand in the market. Trust is a key word in our industry, and only through trust in a brand can one grow their business activity. Servientrega has achieved more in this area as the years go by. A good example of this is the size of our operations in the country; we directly employ 1,243 people and approximately 2,500 indirectly.</p><div class="quote">“  Thanks to our activity, experience, and expertise in Colombia, we have always been able to import know-how into Ecuador. "</div><h4>What role does Ecuador play in Servientrega's global operations?</h4><p>In terms of volume of operations and turnover, Ecuador is the second most important country for Servientrega after Colombia, a country that is twice the size of Ecuador. For example, we expect $30 million in turnover for 2013.</p><h4>How has your product and service portfolio evolved over the years?</h4><p>There are two segments where our company has gained a very consolidated position: corporate mailing and packaging (including all types of administrative and logistics services), and premium cargo (medium cargo transport delivered across the country rather than to one single point). We also have mass delivery, where we can include items such as newspapers and other publications, and we have a significant market share in this segment. Apart from that, we have home-to-home packaging delivery, online order delivery, and regional and international delivery, a segment in which we have a competitive advantage due to our presence in several regional countries and the wide range of agreements with our international counterparts. For example, we manage import and export transportation, with Miami being one of our main markets. One of our main products is transportation of goods to and from Miami. Within these segments, we have many different products linked to time and countries of delivery. Our large branch network enables us to reach a wider range of people and niche markets than our competitors.</p><h4>What are the company's expansions plans at the local and regional level?</h4><p>Servientrega operates in Colombia, Ecuador, and six more countries. Currently, the company does not have plans to enter new markets. Our priority is to further consolidate the brand in these countries and create more efficient synergies between these countries. Also, starting from 2013, the company is implementing a new five-year strategic plan, in which sustainability is the key element. Regarding the local market, we are entering a new business segment: goods storage. Until 2012, we basically focused on transportation and delivery; however, starting from 2013, we decided to explore this segment, linked mainly to clients that also need transportation and goods and packages distribution. In this regard, we have already signed a contract with a Chinese company operating in Ecuador, and we hope this to be the first step of a very successful venture. Additionally, we also have plans to enter the hazardous materials transportation segment, a small market in Ecuador, in which there is not much competition. I think we could enter this sector by 2014, especially on the main national route from Guayaquil to Quito and vice versa. Finally, we need to continue strengthening our marketing channels and make sure our clients are 100% satisfied with our brand and services, which would help us to reach new clients. For example, our information system enables us to keep a constant eye on the inventories in our offices and those of our clients. We know of the importance for our clients to have their inventories updated with the required products, which underpins the satisfaction of their own clients. Nestlé, Colgate, Unilever, and Cerveceria Nacional, among others, are clients that use our services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to you establishing Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf in Ecuador, and how has the company evolved since?</h4><p>The company started in 1973. We are in a business that is very dynamic; the market and our targets change constantly. It's been changing from housing to rental and commercial projects. It is very difficult to say what our core business was 40 years ago compared to today. Currently, our position is that we are a housing company and our main business is to build residential projects. We have a specific target in the market and we are always going after that. We also build housing projects; not individual houses, but urbanization schemes. We also build many commercial buildings, and we recently built our first shopping mall. In addition, we have built and managed hotels. Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf's main focus is on housing, and it is expanding in Quito and the surrounding areas.</p><h4>Who do you define as your target market?</h4><p>It is an open target. We aim for the middle and upper class. We like to work very closely with the banks and the social security organizations since they provide most of the mortgages. We always realize projects that fit their financial products. Approximately 70% of the people that buy from the company use mortgages to finance their purchases.</p><h4>What are your main competitive advantages?</h4><p>Our main competitive advantage is our brand. Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf has never been late on a project. The maximum overrun was two or three months, which is normal for a large residential project. Over 30% of our clientéle come back to buy another unit from us. We have an excellent customer support team that helps consolidate our brand and gives value-added services that are better than our competition. Another thing is that we do everything in-house here, such as our architecture, sales, building, marketing, and mortgages. We provide many services to our clients based on their financial situation. If you want to apply for a loan from the social security institution, we help you do it via our owncredit department. We also have an internal legal company so that all the paperwork and contracts can be officiated here. It is like a one-stop shop. At the moment, we don't have our own interior design section, but I want to one. Right now, there is a lot of competition in the country. The last two or three years have been very good because of the money that the banks and social security organizations have been lending; it is like a pump for the business and now the market is steady and growing. The middle class is growing because they have access to credit, and the first thing they do is buy a house or property. The price of land has increased, and so has the price of commodities. The price of prime land has risen two fold in just a year. Also, the final price of housing for the customer has gone up; not as much as we would like, but in some sectors it has risen 15%-20% a year.</p><h4>There are many people trading between Guayaquil and Quito. Do you see this as a big opportunity?</h4><p>Yes, it is, and we are aiming projects at investors. I can see now that people have liquidity, and they have a mind to invest. Many clients come to buy units for rent and that has been a good business for them. We are targeting projects at those kinds of clients from all over the country, not only in Quito. It is always going to be a good investment and the prices are going to go up. Quito is still the cheapest capital in South America for real estate. That is a good thing about our business—it has never had a boom. It has gone up step by step, which is good because there is no speculation or false business expectation. In regards to office projects, we conducted a study and found there was a lack of quality space available. The growth of the country is attracting more projects from mining companies. Everybody is going to start looking for offices.</p><h4>What are your plans for the short to medium term?</h4><p>We are planning a huge project that is going to be the biggest we have ever built, namely Ciudad del Sol. It will contain one of the tallest buildings in Ecuador. It will have a hospital, hotels, commercial space, and residential areas. It is a dream project for everybody in this business. It will probably start in 2014 because we need to plan it carefully and budget it right to start selling the units. It will probably take six to eight years to build. Residents will belong to a city within a city, and that is the concept we are trying to sell. Before this, the biggest project we did was Parque Real, which was a residential project consisting of 15 buildings that we finished in 2012. It took us eight years to finish. It has two buildings of suites, one office building, and 12 residential buildings. It was the biggest project up until Ciudad del Sol, which is a different concept because that is more like a city within a city.</p><h4>How do you promote the company and get involved in your work?</h4><p>We have always innovated in our projects. We change the architecture and always offer different ideas or services inside a building for our clients. For example, we are introducing small movie theaters, spas, or gyms inside our buildings. We do something better each time and we innovate. That is the key; being different from the competition. If you buy from us you have something different. We have a good history in building, as well as always offering good value in our properties and maintaining their value over time, which is very important for our repeat clients. We try to maintain that for the future so our buildings sell well. Our target market is the first-time buyer and real estate investors. Our vision is to always try and maintain our buildings at the highest standards.</p><h4>How would you rate Ecuador's human capital?</h4><p>Our company has been here for 40 years and the majority of our employees have been here for over 20 years. We have very steady human capital here and very low staff turnover. We offer internship opportunities for young people because we need new innovations, and young architects come with fresh ideas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-exporters-tile]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about Graiman's background and evolution?<br></h4><p>It all began 55 years ago as a family business, like most of the businesses here in Latin America. Graiman was the answer to the group's need to obtain an income in hard currency, mainly in US dollars. At that time, Ecuador's currency was the sucre, and, like most of the currencies from developing countries, it was ever subject to devaluation. Our main business at that time was importing steel as a raw material and producing steel pipes and structures for the construction industry. We bought raw materials in US dollars and sold them in sucres, and while we collected our sales, the price of our basic raw materials was subject to international demand. Obviously, this was a big problem at that time. Around 20 years ago we developed an industry that used raw materials produced in the region, like clay and sandstone. We started exporting our finished products, including ceramic tiles for walls and floors. This activity gave us an income of much needed dollars. Since then many positive things have happened. Ecuador opened up its economy to the world through capital investment in new and modern technology directed at many industries to produce for local consumption, as well as for exporting finished products. We continued to search for new resources to optimize our production process, and we identified long ago that our bottleneck was our sources of energy needed for the industrial process. The main issue then became very clear; Graiman needed to change its energy suppliers. Until then, we relied on the use of LPG, but today we use natural gas. At that time, natural gas as a source of energy was not available for industry. We did our research and found out that Ecuador had 20 sources of natural gas, but as there was no infrastructure for exploitation; the industry was not using it. We worked with the government to develop these projects and we are proud to be the pioneers of natural gas usage. This cost us around $10 million, just for the infrastructure.</p><h4>What was the impact of having your own source of natural gas to use?</h4><p>It allowed us to compete with our neighbors. Our competitors in Colombia and Peru already used natural gas in their ceramic and porcelain industries, as well as in their surrounding industries. Graiman uses a lot of energy to produce and transform raw materials into finished products. If you don't have the right energy source or the right cost base, you won't be able to compete or invest in the future.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of Graiman's exports?</h4><p>Our exports have been successful. We started exporting in 1993-1994 and now export 40% of our porcelain production. We can do more, because right now the economy of the region is really hot and demands many products from us. We are currently investing in production capacity. In a couple of months, we will inaugurate two kilns producing 20,000 sqm a day of porcelain or red clay products. Right now, we produce it all here in Cuenca. We have deals with other factories in Europe to produce our products; however, what we sell under our name is manufactured here in Cuenca.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand into other markets?</h4><p>There is a very good market in Central America, but it depends on macroeconomic development. Ecuador just signed a trade agreement with Guatemala, which opens a market for us because it allows us to sell our products without restrictions. We also have one with El Salvador. For us, Central America is very interesting. There are some markets that produce the same products, but they have different structures. For us, Central and Latin America are very important, as well as North America and the Caribbean. Those are the markets that are developing and we can enter if we have the right product at the right price with the right marketing, and at the right time. I think we are ready.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your personal view of Ecuador's current economic situation?</h4><p>Ecuador has gone through several years of favorable economic performance and there are interesting opportunities to capitalize on in the future. It is noticeable that the government has made significant investments and advancements in roads, public health, and education, as well as in public security, adding value to the principles of El Buen Vivir, endorsed by President Correa. Likewise, the private sector has recently experienced some prosperous years for business; however, to continue contributing to economic and social development at an adequate pace, it needs assurance that a stable and healthy business environment will be promoted in the country. A strong and competitive private sector is one of the best instruments a government has to stimulate economic expansion and job creation.</p><h4>What are your near-term economic expectations?</h4><p>It is essential that the government and the private sector continue working together and strengthening constructive relationships to generate growth opportunities that improve the living conditions of Ecuadoreans. We believe that 2013 will be similar to 2012 in terms of business performance. However, we cannot ignore the implications of the European crisis and the slowdown of certain important Asian economies, which could impact growth in our region. Similarly, the recent visit of President Correa to Germany raised expectations regarding the possibilities of creating commercial agreements with the EU. The strategic decision to change Ecuador's productive matrix may also bring investment opportunities that could stimulate sustainable economic development.</p><h4>What do you foresee for the health sector in the years ahead?</h4><p>Our business is related to healthcare and wellbeing in the pharmaceutical and convenience retail sectors. Our two main retail brands are Fybeca and SanaSana; both are emblematic and recognized in Ecuador as the service and trustworthiness leaders of the industry. Pharmaceutical retail is very important for society as it contributes to public health, thereby improving living standards. Currently, this sector is quite competitive in Ecuador, with thousands of retail businesses of different sizes participating in the market. Available data estimates over 6,400 points of sale nationwide. Therefore, it becomes crucial to have updated regulations that account for the consumer's growing needs in a fair and ethical competitive environment that promotes fair prices, product availability, and quality of medicines and health products. Corporación GPF exclusively participates in the retail business, making medicines and healthcare products available to consumers nationwide, with the highest levels of quality, service, and value.</p><div class="quote">“  Since 1930, we have honored our founder's philosophy; integrity fosters trust. "</div><h4>What reforms are needed in your sector?</h4><p>In Ecuador, most medicine prices in the pharmaceutical retail sector are regulated and one of the industry's main challenges is to remain competitive and profitable. We consider that an essential reform for our sector is improvement in the efficiency and timeliness of health permits granted by state authorities for medicines, non-medicine supplements, and food products. This process has historically been overly bureaucratic and time consuming, obstructing the offering of the latest and most innovative products to the market. We are aware that the government is carrying out several important reforms to address this situation, and we look forward to adding value during the socialization of those projects.</p><h4>How did your company grow and what are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>Corporación GPF has been a pioneer in the pharmaceutical retail sector serving the community medicines and complementary products for over 83 years, making us the most experienced company in Ecuador in this field. Our retail business started back in 1930 with a small drugstore located in the historic center of Quito, and thanks to ethical and devoted hard work, it grew to become the leading brand in the Ecuadorean pharmaceutical retail sector. Ever since, we have honored our founder's business philosophy: “Integrity fosters trust." Our business strategies are focused on providing solutions to our clients and not just products. In addition to pharmaceutical and health goods, we deliver value-added convenience with the guarantee of quality at the right price. Furthermore, Corporación GPF employs over 5,000 people, making us one of the largest employers in Ecuador. We apply consistent corporate responsibility standards contributing not only to our client's health, but also improving the living conditions of the communities we serve. The latter is reflected in our Sustainability Report, “Memoria Corporativa 1930-2011", granted A+ by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).</p><h4>What are the main goals and objectives for the coming years?</h4><p>Corporación GPF will continue implementing its philosophy of bringing pharmaceutical and health solutions with value, accessibility, and social responsibility as widely as possible throughout Ecuador. We are present in every province of Ecuador, including the Galápagos Islands. We are an efficient convenience retail group that goes beyond medicine supply with several other complementary health and convenience retail products that provide high-value solutions to our clients. Currently, our expansion strategy is concentrated in Ecuador and we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering top-quality service, innovation, and high value in everything we undertake.</p><h4>Who are your suppliers?</h4><p>Our suppliers are leading local and international pharmaceutical laboratories and distributors. Our goal is to offer the broadest possible product availability with competitive prices and quality assurance.  We highly value our suppliers and aim to establish long-term relationships. We are always looking for ways to improve cooperation with them to offer innovative and better-value products and services to our clients.</p><h4>Do you consider the entry of new distributors and retailers to be possible?</h4><p>This market has many competitors at the retail level. New companies are coming in all the time and there are also several pharmaceutical distributors that have relatively recently entered into the retail business. Competition is good for everybody, as long as it is exercised on an ethical and level playing field. We have been doing business for over 83 years, exceeding our clients' and market expectations. We have also been acting as an ethical and responsible partner with our employees, customers, allies, and the communities we serve. These attributes of Corporación GPF are widely recognized and respected in Ecuador and constitute our most valuable asset.</p><h4>What types of medicine are the most popular?</h4><p>The most demanded medicines in Ecuador are those used to treat respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, and locomotive apparatus conditions. Baby milk formulas are also highly demanded. We always strive to offer our clients a one-stop-shop for all their prescription requirements. Customers are not only looking for a prescription, but for good service, convenience, trustworthiness, and value.</p><h4>What trends do you see in your clients?</h4><p>Ecuadorean consumers are following the trend of the retail business in other countries. They are not just looking for products; they are looking for solutions. They do not just want a client-to-supplier relationship; they want to establish an emotional connection with the companies they are buying from, particularly in purchases as important as medicine and health products. They want excellent service, convenience, and good value. Assortment is an important aspect and clients expect more solutions at a single location. We are working toward meeting these trends and exceeding our customers' expectations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the business environment for foreign investors in Ecuador?<br></h4><p>Among the 185 economies across the globe, Ecuador ranks 139th according to the World Bank Doing Business 2013 edition, which is an increase of nine positions on the previous year's edition. The rank reflects group topics regarding evaluation criteria to determine the ease of doing business, and its feasibility. To constitute an enterprise, 13 mandatory events are necessary to fulfil all the legal and tax requirements, a process that approximately requires 56 days. Other considerations that need be taken into account at the start of business in Ecuador are: construction permits require 16 procedures and take around 128 days; registering property comprises nine mutually dependent steps, which are indispensable; paying taxes involves 654 hours per year; and enforcing a contract on the judicial level requires 39 actions and instances to occur. This approximately takes 588 days, and on average the cost represents 27.2% of the claim. From a regional point of view, Ecuador has reached an average performance whereby the country has set a precedent of locating itself in a regular Doing Business position.</p><h4>What must Ecuador do to maximize its knowledge and human capital potential?</h4><p>Education plays a leading role in the maximization of knowledge, and should also be seen as a key factor in the attainment of corresponding human rights, as well as in  helping achieve the UN's millennium goal of universal primary education. To do this, Ecuador must constantly develop a sense of responsibility, cultivate an autonomous culture, increase students' range of possibilities, and exercise the ability to face and deal with challenging situations. Conversely, regardless of the implementation of a new legal framework for tertiary education, a more binding course of action to reach an optimal R&amp;D for universities and colleges, as well as assuring better academic or technical studies and publications must be addressed. In other words, we need to produce knowledge, instead of just learning it, in addition to making this new data accessible in different segments of society. Therefore, more accurate information will be used as input for decision-making processes. On these grounds, the Council of Evaluation, Accreditation and Quality Assurance of the Higher Education System in Ecuador (CEAACES) promotes the continuous assessment of existing universities and colleges in order to maintain and provide proper development and sustainability criteria for the attainment of a noticeably improved service.</p><h4>What is your midterm outlook on the evolution of the non-oil trade balance?</h4><p>According to the Central Bank of Ecuador, the non-oil trade balance of January 2013 registered a rise in negative trade balances from $833.2 million to $863.5 million, which represented a larger non-oil commercial deficit of 3.6% than in the previous year.  Additionally, at the end of the same period, compared to the previous one, the non-oil trade balance grew 37.6%, from $627.6 million to $863.5 million. Furthermore, as an expected outcome of the four-year national budget program, the Ministry of Finance of Ecuador forecasts the non-oil trade balance improving. Based on data from the Ministry for the Coordination of Economic Policy the deficit, at $8.8 billion in 2012, is estimated to rise to $8.9 billion in 2013, but then decline to $8.2 billion and $7 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. To be able, in the short term, to mitigate the deficit of the Ecuadorean non-oil trade balance it is advisable to open up the Ecuadorean economy to markets where domestic products, such as flowers, coffee, and seafood, have an extensive quality advantage. It would also be beneficial to intensify business and commercial relations with countries whose trade balances are largely positive.</p><div class="quote">“The overall outlook seems promising based on the bills that have been passed into law."</div><h4>What are the most important specifications of the Ecuadorean Commercial Code that foreign investors should be aware of?</h4><p>Effectively, the Ecuadorean Commercial Code is inadequately promoted; hence, investors are not able to fully understand the rights, obligations, and benefits enshrined in this law. Despite this, circumstance regarding the existing commercial code considers the following:</p><p>• Art. 2. - Those deemed to be merchants or traders</p><p>• Art. 3. - Trade actions (16 different types)</p><p>• Art. 7. - Who are forbidden to conduct trade actions</p><p>• Art. 26. - Period allowed to obtain business registration (15 days)</p><p>• Art. 140. - Business registration mandatory nature</p><p>• Art 154. - Ecuador geographical jurisdictional hierarchy.</p><h4>Do you anticipate further changes to the legal framework for investment?</h4><p>Currently, the legislative environment of Ecuador may see the approval of approximately 63 bills or drafts laws impacting certain sectors of society. Among those connected to the legal framework for investment are: the law on the securities market, the currency regime and the state bank law amendment, as well as the financial system institutions law amendment, the law for the defence of labour rights (Procedure No. 108924), and the social security law amendment (Procedure No. 121679)</p><h4>Where do you foresee the main growth opportunities in the Ecuadorean economy?</h4><p>In 2012, according the four-year national budget programme (2012-2015 indicates a progressive decline of GDP, until a 3.3% level has been reached by 2015. As for the various sectors of the economy, there is a positive perspective regarding infrastructure and construction. This segment of the economy has seen the highest growth over the past two years on a 15.6% average, and signifying 10% of the GDP. Finally, there are more sectors promising growth in the upcoming years, such as aquaculture, fisheries, shrimp processing and preservation, and forestry, which will altogether reach an average growth of around 15%.</p><h4>What are your expectations for M&amp;A activity in Ecuador?</h4><p>The overall outlook seems promising based on the bills that have been passed into law. The most relevant industrial sectors to be consolidated due to transactions and mergers are health, finance, and education. PwC highlights the presence of regional players, for instance Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, primarily in the field of potential purchasers and acquirers in the floriculture and aquaculture, construction, retail, and tourism sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ExxonMobil has a strong legacy in Saudi Arabia and firm relationships here today. How have your operations developed?<br></h4><p>ExxonMobil is delighted to have been a partner in the country's growth for more than 80 years. We started years ago selling kerosene for lanterns. In 1948, we joined the Aramco Consortium, which of course, both of our heritage companies were part of Aramcoand which ultimately became Saudi Aramco. We are truly proud to be a part of that history. The footprint that we have today came about just over 35 years ago, when we undertook investments in major refining and petrochemical facilities. The investments on the petrochemical side were carried out as 50:50 joint ventures with SABIC, while the investment in the refinery is a 50:50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Since then, there have been additional investments in each of the facilities to expand capacity and improve performance. Currently, we are in the midst of two multi-billion-dollar projects. In the case of our refining operation, SAMREF, we are near completion of a clean fuels project that should reach mechanical completion in early 2014. At Kemya petrochemical plant, a joint venture with SABIC, the Elastomers project is in its early stages. As the country develops, it is looking to expand its downstream footprint into the production of synthetic rubber or elastomers for the domestic market. This project, when completed, will provide the Kingdom with the ability to produce elastomers for the very first time. We are excited about this as it is complex technology and is certainly a step further along the value chain.</p><h4>What needs do the elastomer project and the new refinery project meet in a global sense, and where are they taking Exxon and the country?</h4><p>Let me start with cleaner gasoline. The specifications for fuels are increasingly strict. If refineries are to remain competitive in the global economy, they are going to need the ability to produce fuels that meet the increasingly stringent specifications that are being enforced globally. In addition, Saudi Arabia has already laid out its vision of increasing the stringency of fuel specifications here in the Kingdom. The goal is to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline and diesel to 10 ppm. Overall, this improvement and investment will give the refinery the ability to meet the Saudi specifications when they are introduced within a few years, while at the same time maintaining its competitiveness in the global market. On the elastomers side, the Kingdom today uses many elastomer products, but they are almost all imported. Elastomers are a key step in the evolution beyond commodity chemicals that the Kingdom has predominantly produced thus far. The impetus behind this investment is to provide the raw materials that can then be used by other investors to build local businesses. It is a complex challenge, but the elastomer project creates the opportunity to build out the downstream elastomer industries as independent investors, whether local or international, and to recognize the opportunity to create and market and sell elastomer-based products in the Kingdom.</p><h4>Where will the Higher Institute of Elastomers Industries (HIEI) and ExxonMobil's other vocational training ventures fit within its operations in the Kingdom?</h4><p>We are particularly pleased about the HIEI, an institute in Yanbu, that it is now up and running. It has welcomed its second year of students, having opened its doors in the fall of 2012 with 63 students, adding a further 70 students this past fall. The whole course is a 2.5 to 3 year curriculum that focuses on higher technology-based skills that the students will need to work in industries that manufacture elastomers. In setting up the HIEI, we partnered with the University of Akron in the US, as it is the world's leading elastomer technology institution. HIEI also hired Saudi university graduates who had an interest in teaching and sent them to the University of Akron for two years of training. As a result, today, we have 15 Saudi instructors on the ground in Yanbu. Having Saudis training Saudis, and having put in all the hard work up front to develop a strong curriculum, will make this one of the best training institutes in the Kingdom.</p><h4>Moving forward on all these fronts, where do you hope to see ExxonMobil in Saudi Arabia in the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>I am confident that you are going to see ExxonMobil and its partners continuing to operate world-class joint ventures, as we have done in the past, safely, efficiently, and with a Saudi workforce. We are pleased with our history in the Kingdom and look forward to further opportunity as Saudi Arabia continues its impressive growth and development.</p><div class="quote">“Saudi Arabia has already laid out its vision of increasing the stringency of fuel specifications here in the Kingdom."</div><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Mexico's fiscal dependence on oil revenue and the US market changed or improved over the past year?</h4><p>On those two points I would note some positive momentum. On the fiscal front the government has presented a reform package that explores alternative sources of revenue to limit the nation's oil dependence. The proposal that was approved by congress was more conservative, but I think it raised awareness nonetheless. In fact, while this step toward reform did not completely address the issue, it made it clear at least that more needs to be done.  Structural changes in the economy take time, and you will not see major changes from one year to the next. We observe policies, proposals, and signals that are going in the right direction. On the trade front, the relationship with the US is well established and long standing. One of the first signals that the administration was aware of the importance of this issue was when the Minister of Finance became the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He has been much more engaged in sourcing trade partners and looking for ways to begin firmer partnerships with other countries.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the impact of the fiscal reform?</h4><p>Many areas need addressing for reforms to have effect. I think that the positive aspect of this administration is its recognition of the need and willingness to work in parallel on several fronts. They seem capable of going further than their predecessors on this occasion, although it's not fully within their power to do so as they require congressional approval.</p><div class="quote">“The engagement model that we have with countries of the World Bank encompasses more than loans."</div><h4>What was the reason for the contraction of the Mexican economy in 2013, and what needs to be done to expedite economic growth?</h4><p>A difficult external environment and certain domestic issues created this contraction. Fortunately, we are projecting growth of between 3% and 4% for 2014. There are determining factors that lead to the acceleration of the trade relationship with the US and these have been slower than expected recently, which has impacted exports. Internal issues are to be expected for the first year of an administration. Public investment has been slower. There has been a gradual deceleration of the construction sector because of issues within the sector itself. For 2014, higher growth is forecast for the US, which will impact trade. Clearly there is movement in terms of public investment, and there is an infrastructure plan in place that will assist the process. As the macroeconomic climate itself remains healthy, and there is flexibility on the fiscal and monetary sides and the exchange rate, we are optimistic.</p><h4>What are your most important projects in poverty alleviation and rural development in Mexico?</h4><p>The engagement model that we have with countries of the World Bank encompasses more than loans. We start with the national development plan and agree with the government on priority areas. Based on that we develop a program to establish the optimum instrument in support of the country. This is usually a combination of financial and knowledge products, and the dissemination of global experience. There are four areas on which we are focused and our strategy for Mexico for the next six years starts with productivity. We are working with the financial sector, competition, and innovation. The focus is on how to support smaller companies. The second area is related to increasing social prosperity. We are working with the government on offering second-generation social protection, and Mexico is known to be proactive on this issue. The third major area concerns strengthening public finances and government efficiency. This is closely related to enhancing service delivery, particularly at the local level, and to working with states. Integrated risk management, which includes not only traditional fiscal risk management, but also disaster risk management, will come to the fore. We feel that when disasters occur the poor are hurt the most. The fourth area has to do with sustainability and promoting green and inclusive growth. We are working on specific sectors like water and solid waste, once again with a focus on poverty, especially in poorer states. For example, we have a comprehensive program with the state of Oaxaca. We want to focus the next six years on working with Guerrero and Chiapas.</p><h4>What is the importance of disaster relief and climate change for economic development?</h4><p>It is very important particularly in the case of Mexico because it has an impact on the economic side, specifically on GDP. Mexico is one of the countries in the world most prone to natural disasters. Around 40% of its territory and 30% of its population are exposed to hurricanes, storms, floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. This, in economic terms, translates into about 70% of GDP considered to be at risk. A number of studies we've done show that 70% of the poorest 125 municipalities are highly prone to disaster. This is a huge burden for the government so we are working not only on financing, but also on prevention. We have been working with the government on non-traditional products. An innovative example is the bond we developed for catastrophes to cover risks, focused on bringing in global expertise. The insurance market remains undeveloped in Mexico, which is why the financial burden falls on the government.</p><h4>What are your expectations for education reform and its likely consequences for future generations?</h4><p>There are two main issues to address here: the quality of education and the links between the education system and the labor markets. Implementation will be very important, and highlights government recognition that education plays a major role in reducing poverty. We share the government's concern that national labor productivity has risen by just by 2% over the past 20 years, compared to more than 60% among its competitors. Up to 40% of Mexican employers say they have difficulties in filling job vacancies for want of qualified people. The education sector must urgently play a role in filling these gaps. Most of these reforms will take some time to take effect, but it's important that this administration is willing to start the process.</p><h4>Considering the global crisis, what are the particularities of Colombia as a market suited to foreign investment?</h4><p>Colombia has been experiencing very solid growth and really has become one of the main Latin American investment hot spots. One factor is the stabilization of internal security, as well as recent policy reforms in Colombia over the past three years. Notable, too, is stable macroeconomic management. This is a country of considerable flexibility in fiscal monetary policy in response to shocks, and also one that has high commodity prices. This has allowed it to sustain higher GDP growth than the Latin American average. For 2013, we project growth of 3.9%, while the Latin America average is 2.8%. For 2014 we project a growth rate of 4.3%, while the overall average growth rate of Latin America is projected at 3%. One of the other important elements that has lead to this investment interest in Colombia is that, since 2010, President Santos' administration has made continuous efforts to open up the economy. The recent trade and investment agreement has strengthened the environment, brining a sense of confidence to foreign investors. There is a long list of stand-alone agreements and bilateral investment treaties that Colombia has worldwide. The government has also done a very good job of diversifying its markets between the US, the EU, and Asia. There are still challenges ahead, but the fact that investors have been willing to enter has helped considerably.</p><h4>What are the main factors behind Colombia's sustainable advance?</h4><p>Colombia's economy has been able to withstand external shocks thanks to four shock absorbers: the flexible exchange rate, a very manageable public debt, modest deficits, and a solid financial system. One of the main impacts of the crisis in many emerging countries has been a decrease in the credit extended to the private sector. Yet the robustness of Colombia's financial system has prevented a duplication of this. The high commodity prices have also helped.</p><h4>What is your outlook on future World Bank support in Colombia, and in which areas are further reforms required?</h4><p>We also have the flexibility, amid volatile conditions, to come in and support the country. Thus, we have a very stable lending relationship. Our business model combines finance with knowledge, and we are focused on expanding opportunities for social prosperity. The reason is that, notwithstanding the advances in Colombia, it is still a very unequal society. The coefficient in inequality, compared to other countries in Latin America, is among the lowest. We are improving education, citizen security, and social services. We focus on improving sustainable urban development and have also been focusing on innovation agenda. Both the government and the private sector are very interested because they need to lower their dependence on commodity exports in the future. They need to innovate so that more high-value products are available for production.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk about your vision for developing business ties with the UAE?</h4><p>Our vision of ties between Australia and the UAE is clear and positive, because there is already a multi-faceted relationship that seems to be growing rapidly. The base is already robust as the UAE is our largest trading partner in the Middle East. The UAE is very familiar to many Australians, and there are over 350 Australian firms operating there. And the UAE's presence in Australia is also increasing. The UAE is a major infrastructure investor in Australia, and there are two important partnerships: the Emirates-Qantas partnership and the Etihad-Virgin partnership, which both link to the UAE. These partnerships are increasing person-to-person contact, which is very important for furthering economic relationships and developing some depth and sustainability. Education is a prime example of an area where we are moving beyond simply seeing students arrive in Australia to study. For example, the Abu Dhabi Vocational Education and Training Institute are developing a new framework of qualifications for vocational training using Australian standards. This is an area where real depth and substance is being added to the relationship. We are very positive about it, and view it as one of the areas where Australia needs to be devoting its efforts. We are planning to hold a major program that will bring together businesspeople and others in April 2014 in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi around the theme of “Australia Unlimited," which will give us an opportunity to talk about trade, investment, cultural ties, and the opportunities that lie therein.</p><h4>What are Australia's competitive advantages as an investment destination for UAE investors?</h4><p>The most important consideration is that we are a low risk proposition and provide stable returns. We are in a competitive world for investment dollars; yet we remain a substantial market. We are the fourth largest market in the Asia-Pacific region, and have experienced 22 years of economic growth. Australia has an innovative economy, a skilled workforce, a strategic location in the Asia-Pacific region, and a stable and transparent business environment. Yet while all of these are important parts of the mix, the key factor is a stable environment of low risk and solid returns. We have already seen this investment happen, with major commitments in tourism, infrastructure, and in the New South Wales ports, which are highly significant. We are keen to ensure our competitiveness. The government is placing much emphasis on attracting investment and lowering costs in Australia. We want to make sure everyone understands that we are open for business and that we want to do our utmost to encourage investment from all our partners. It has put into play a very strong portfolio of major infrastructure projects; the government itself is investing and looking for others to do so. I foresee considerable potential here. We know that we have to work out how to be competitive and how to attract investment, but the key message is that the UAE is a very important source of wealth, and we hope we are providing the right environment to attract that to Australia.</p><div class="quote">“There are something like 350 Australian companies in the UAE and more than 16,000 resident Australians living and working."</div><h4>Do you anticipate seeing more Australian companies participating in the energy and industry sectors of Abu Dhabi itself?</h4><p>Yes, I think so. There are already Australian companies involved in power plants, solar farms, and wind energy plants. We are working with the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority to share some of our expertise and to help address some of the challenges to reduce carbon footprints. Part of this is based on the fact that we face somewhat similar climatic issues and water scarcity. Those are some of the areas where we think we have solutions or technology that is relevant. Work is already underway with Abu Dhabi on that front.</p><h4>What are the factors that have encouraged so many Australians to do business in the UAE?</h4><p>There are something like 350 Australian companies in the UAE and more than 16,000 resident Australians living and working. People tell us that this is because the UAE is very welcoming, and that Australians feel very comfortable living and working in the country. The openness of the UAE to the skills and expertise that others can bring is an important part of that, as are the connections that the various airlines provide. The way in which some of the business networks are working, such as the Australian Business Council in Dubai and the Business Group in Abu Dhabi, contribute to it. Therefore, as a result of that, many Australians in areas including construction, financial services, banking, agriculture, and health are finding something to contribute in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been 2013 Year of ICT's legacy in terms of improving interconnectivity and advancing the use of technology in the country?</h4><p>The year opened up new opportunities for the future development of the ICT field in Azerbaijan, and was fertile with a number of distinguished events. HE Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, declared 2013 as the Year of ICT and, once again, emphasized the ICT sector as a priority for ensuring the reliable socio-economic development of the country. On February 8, 2013 Azerbaijan launched its first telecommunications satellite, Azerspace-1, into orbit. This was one of the greatest achievements that Azerbaijan has accomplished since its independence. Azerspace-1 enables us to render telecommunications, internet, television, and radio broadcasting services to Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. Now, all of the state TV channels of Azerbaijan and some private channels are broadcast via Azerspace-1. The transition to digital broadcasting has almost been completed in the country and, currently, 96% of the population can access digital TV broadcasting. Enormous actions have been taken to enable citizens to benefit from the opportunities created by the application of state-of-the-art technologies. Consequently, 70% of the population uses the internet, half of which are broadband internet users. There are 110 mobile subscriptions for every 100 people. The application of 3G and 4G technologies is also being extended. Preparatory works for the implementation of a project to install a fiber-optic network, making providing high-speed broadband internet services through the “Fiber to the Home" project possible, have been already completed and the project will be implemented this year. With the successful implementation of the project, internet access at speeds of 10-100 MB per second will be provided to the whole country, including rural areas. Last year will also be remembered for the foundation of the Azerbaijan Information Technologies University. Approximately 60 students with high admission grades already study at this university. The competence and experience gained at this university will enable young people to meet the demands of an information society as well-qualified specialists. There have been some great achievement as a result of the development of e-government. The usage of e-signature and e-payments has been largely extended and the quality and coverage area of e-services provided to citizens by state bodies on a one-stop shop principle has been increased. With the view of the further continuation of legal and expedient measures in this field, state programs on the extension of e-services in state bodies in 2014-2016 and the development of e-government have been drafted and are planned to be adopted this year. Considerable steps have also been taken regarding the provision of information security in the country. The State Agency for Special Communications and Information Security, and the Electronic Security Center, have started their activity with the purpose of improving works being carried out in this field, protecting the information resources and systems of state bodies from possible threats, and raising nationwide preparedness and awareness on cyber security. Evidently, outstanding works have been carried out in the field of ICT in 2013, thus making the Year of ICT successful in Azerbaijan. I am confident that all the initiatives and the results that we obtained over 2013 will increase the role of ICT in the overall development of the country.</p><h4>Startups play an important role in creating an innovation-driven culture. How does the Ministry support startups and entrepreneurs active in ICT?</h4><p>In order to reach our macroeconomic goals in the ICT sector, we have to firstly develop the ICT industry and ICT businesses in the country. In this regard, supporting the smallest business units, i.e. startups, as well as other entrepreneurs, carries much importance for the development of the sector. As a Ministry, we have carried out specific tasks for this purpose. In order to provide financial support to startups and other business units in the ICT sector, a State Fund for the Development of Information Technologies was established under the Ministry. Starting from this year, the Fund will financially support business units via grants, long-term concessional loans, and direct investments. Additionally, ICT companies can take advantage of the special tax and customs incentives of the recently established High Tech Park. Moreover, the Park has a special business incubator meant to support the successful development of startups through an array of business support resources and services.</p><div class="quote">“The formation of a strong ICT sector in Azerbaijan in the next 8-10 years is one of the directions of our global development."</div><h4>Could you elaborate on the significance of Azerspace-1?</h4><p>Azerbaijan attaches great importance to the idea of the establishment and development of a national space industry over the past few years. Our country has succeeded in launching its first-ever telecommunications satellite, Azerspace-1, into orbit. That was one of the most remarkable events on the 2013 calendar. During the realization of this project, Azerbaijan managed to establish and effectively maintain fruitful relations with leading states in the global space industry. The launch of Azerspace-1 has laid solid groundwork for the formation of a national aerospace sector within the structure of the local economy. Currently, Azerbaijan is successfully commercializing its satellite resources in international markets. To speak picturesquely, our country is in the process of extending its economy into space. All of these achievements have been made possible as a result of the strategic economic policy pursued by HE Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, who, in 2010, decreed the establishment of the Azercosmos Open Joint Stock Company, the national satellite operator, consequently providing modern infrastructure for upcoming satellite projects. Thus, today, Azercosmos is efficiently managing the operation of Azerspace-1 from its own premises. The satellite projects of Azerbaijan have been primarily designated for its own needs and expectations. In this respect, and considering the novelty of this sector in the country, we envision a growing demand from local government and private institutions for satellite-related services in the following years. We see great potential for strengthening the position of Azerbaijan in the satellite industry, and have plans in place for future projects in terms of a low-Earth orbiting remote sensing satellite and a second telecommunications satellite. The new satellites, which are scheduled for launch in 2016 and 2017, respectively, will fortify the image of Azerbaijan as a reliable partner in the satellite business community around the world. While the second telecommunications satellite, preliminarily intended to function in Ka-band, will open up new business opportunities and will serve as a back up point for the first one, the low-Earth remote sensing satellite, which will grant Azerbaijan an entrance into the international space imaging market.</p><h4>Azerbaijan manages the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway (TASIM). What is the importance of this project and similar initiatives aimed at improving connectivity in the region?</h4><p>In the Eurasia region, there is a problem of isolation from the two major internet backbones, which stretch from Japan to New Zealand and North America to Europe. In that respect, Azerbaijan is uniquely located, in terms of ICT, between developing and developed countries. Backed by two special UN General Assembly resolutions, the TASIM project was created in order to get closer to the level of developed countries. The TASIM project will connect Hong Kong with Frankfurt, and will thus provide high-speed internet to the large Eurasian region. On December 3, 2013 the participants of the project signed an MoU in Baku, Azerbaijan. The document aims at outlining the further implementation of the project and determining the participants' roles and responsibilities, financial expenditures, and legal status. However, the establishment of information highways is not the only important task. Their appliance to advanced development such as the introduction of e-education and e-health carry as much, if not more, importance. Therefore, we need cooperation between countries and between different sectors such as governments, businesses, and society. We believe that the business community is willing to cooperate; however, we sometimes face barriers from individual governments. For this reason, the third UN General Assembly resolution of September 4, 2013 (A/Res/67/298) unanimously supported the creation of the Eurasian Connectivity Alliance (EuraCA), which will serve to strengthen and develop relations between two countries involving government participation in these projects. EuraCA will contribute to the creation of an open information society in the region by increasing the speed of internet connections and the number of internet services, and will support economic diversification and competition by creating new ICT enterprises and sectors in the field of software engineering and the creative industries. It will facilitate the emergence of new intra- and inter-regional cooperation areas, for example in the field of trade and entrepreneurial development, and will create a common multi-stakeholder platform for high-level policy dialogue within Eurasia to tackle complex issues regarding the social impact of ICT.</p><h4>As one of the most interconnected countries in the region, how can Azerbaijan position itself as an ICT hub in the Caucasus?</h4><p>The formation of a strong ICT sector in Azerbaijan in the next 8-10 years is one of the directions of our global development. Experience shows that firstly becoming a user of ICT technologies, along with other high technologies and services, and then turning into a producer and exporter is a vital necessity in order to join the leaders in the field of ICT and ensure economic development. Only in this way can countries ensure development within the scope of high standards. Today, the need for information services increases continuously in the Eurasian region, and one of our intentions is to become an exporter of all the main information services in the region. There is a need for joint cooperation and allied states today, and Azerbaijan endeavors to become one of these allies. Therefore, in addition to the enhancement of network infrastructure in the region, we are interested in the creation of new, as well as regional, content. The content of digital information is continuously increasing today and large opportunities are provided for information services. In our opinion, the creation of regional content and the organization of information services under cloud technology is effective from an economic point of view and is attractive for investors. There are some initiatives in this direction as well. Preparatory works are being carried out in our country regarding the creation of two centers: the International Internet Exchange Switching Center and the Telehouse International Telecommunication Center, as well as a regional data center for some well-known companies and organizations.</p><h4>BakuTel is the most important ICT event in the region. How is this a good way of promoting international exchanges?</h4><p>The government of Azerbaijan views the development of the ICT sector as part of its broader plans to diversify the economy and sees the ICT sector as an opportunity to reduce Azerbaijan's dependence on the oil and gas segment in the future. Therefore, Azerbaijan is determined to become one of the global players in the ICT market and BakuTel, annually organized under the patronage of HE Ilham Aliyev, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, plays a significant role in achieving this goal. Besides being one of the most important ICT events in the region, BakuTel is the largest flagship ICT event in the Caucasus and the Caspian basin in terms of the participation of the region's key governmental and business executives. During the past two decades, the event has become a springboard for public, private, as well as international organizations and well-recognized international NGOs. It has already proven to be a high-quality professional event and plays a valuable role in facilitating and promoting an irreplaceable business environment for cooperation, collaboration, and partnership in the field of ICT. BakuTel offers powerful opportunities for companies to showcase their latest products, services, and technologies, and introduces them to emerging markets as well as accumulates strategic business relationships between the partners and delineates partnership prospects. For instance, BakuTel 2013 harmonized the participation of more than 300 leading ICT companies from 28 countries and facilitated the involvement of many high-ranking guests, including regional ICT ministers, representatives of several international organizations, as well as representatives of the scientific community. Moreover, I can firmly say that side events such as last year's Global Cyber Security Cooperation: Challenges and Visions conference, organized with the kind support of ITU, have turned BakuTel into a global platform for agenda setting, sharing best practices, and facilitating interactive discussions on various facets of present challenges and opportunities in the use of ICT at the national, regional, and international levels.</p><h4>The construction sector is growing at unprecedented rates. To what extent is the Ministry of Communications and High Technologies working to promote smart buildings?</h4><p>Currently, this field is rapidly developing in the world. More than ever, the application of LTE technology and M2M devices has opened up great opportunities. Whereas today the income related to M2M devices constitutes $200 billion all over the world, it is expected that this figure will be $1.2 trillion by 2022. While the expenditures for smart building projects were $5.5 billion in 2012, this figure is expected to be $18.1 billion in 2014. Evidently, this field will become more developed in the next 10 years. Today, the state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure installed in our country and the application of LTE and FTHx technologies offer ample opportunities for rendering new value-added broadband services, smart buildings, and even the construction of smart settlements. A number of companies are already offering their own services. For example, one of mobile telecommunications companies has recently introduced its smart home project on the basis of an M2M platform at the BakuTel 2013 exhibition. Through this project, while away from home it will be possible to control power, gas, and water supply, and home owners will be able to open the door for guests, turn off electric devices remotely, operate the security system, turn on the air-conditioner in hot weather before returning home, and carry out a variety of other tasks. It is even possible to control the smart home by mobile phone from any location in the world. Today, a large smart home project is being carried out in Baku. Located in the center of Baku bay, a preeminent, modern, and large-scale residence will be constructed over an area of 221 hectares. The Ministry of Communications and High Technologies is actively participating in this project. State-of-the-art IT infrastructure will be built and internet speeds will reach 100 MB per second, while telecommunications and multimedia services will be provided to everybody on the basis of FTHx technology. It should be also noted that the necessary infrastructure will be set up in new buildings constructed in Baku to render these services.</p><h4>What do you expect will be the highlights of 2014 in terms of ICT and innovation in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Last year being one of the most successful years for ICT made us aim even higher for 2014. This year, in accordance with our goals for the development of broadband internet, we will give the fiber-to-home project a start and its successful implementation will increase the penetration rate of broadband internet in the country by 85%. At the initial stage, the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) plans to allocate AZN103 million ($131 million) for its implementation. Moreover, the digitalization of TV broadcasts will successfully be completed in Azerbaijan this year. All these tasks will lead to us reaching our pre-defined goals and will increase the annual income of the ICT sector in Azerbaijan to $8 billion-$8.5 billion by 2020. Recalling the fact that the first ever computer-to-computer ARPANET link was established between the University of California, Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute on October 29, 1969, which initially led to the internet, I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate the global community on the 45th anniversary of the internet. May inventions like the internet promote continuous progress, peace, and prosperity to all the citizens of the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-solid-blueprint]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the next 18 months, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) intends to invest over $1 billion in Kazakhstan. What are its investment priorities?</h4><p>There are three basic areas that we will be focusing on in Kazakhstan. One is diversification in support of the non-resources sectors; we are already the largest investor in this area and will continue to support it through financing projects that enhance corporate sector productivity, in particular those that improve the business environment, modernization in the agro-business sector and the entire value chain, and that facilitate growth in the SME sector. We will also work intensively with the banking and non-banking financial sectors, particularly with micro-credit and SMEs. The second pivot of the strategy is balancing the role of the state and the market by supporting the growth of private enterprises. We will also be working with public enterprises to help commercialize them, boost efficiency, and bring the private sector into what was state dominated, primarily through policy instruments like PPP and fair and transparent procurement policies. The third pivot of our strategy is the green economy, through the promotion of low carbon growth and energy efficiency. We worked very closely with the government of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Environment and Water to put in place the new energy strategy, and we will be supporting this as the top priority through projects in energy renewables, agriculture waste, waste management, transport, and other sectors.</p><h4>With the support of the EBRD, in 2013 Kazakhstan adopted a feed-in tariff law supporting the use of renewable energy sources. How important is the law for furthering Kazakhstan's planned transition to a green economy?</h4><p>We consider this to be a big success and we are really quite impressed with the way the government has moved forward in a very responsible direction. I think that with Astana 2017, there are a lot of areas where Kazakhstan can really be an example, not just to the surrounding countries but also to the Western world. The ministry has done a superb job of getting the movement off the ground and gauging the best consultants globally for the project. The EBRD is also contributing to the green economy's transition through numerous projects across transport, urban municipal transport, district heating, wastewater, power, and more. It all fits very nicely under the green economy theme, and it's very timely with Expo 2017 coming up. We have seen a lot of interest from foreign investors in all of these projects. I recently met with delegations from Spain, France, Germany, and the US, and quite a few of them are particularly gearing their trade missions toward renewable projects and infrastructure development around green economy themes. Green energy is really gaining traction because Kazakhstan is one of the few economies where GDP is growing relatively rapidly and there are large infrastructure projects to undertake. We are highly optimistic about the opportunities available to foreign investors here in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>In which non-energy sectors do you see the greatest opportunities for foreign investment?</h4><p>I'd say the infrastructure sector because of the massive size of the country. There are huge road projects underway. The EBRD has financed a portion of the Shymkent-Tashkent road, which is part of the West China-to-West Europe project. In terms of airlines, I believe there is room for a regional firm to complement Air Astana on routes that airlines do not cover. There are huge opportunities in the agribusiness sector, too, that I think have not yet fully been exploited. In the southern part of the country, there have been quite a few agricultural missions from Western Europe related to irrigation systems, green houses, and other projects. In terms of manufacturing, the key for Kazakhstan will be the ability to open up the market to surrounding countries; Kazakhstan has just 17 million people, but if you start to include countries like Uzbekistan and the surrounding Central Asian countries into its market dynamics, then you have a much broader base for production. Many people also overlook the services sector. Kazakhstan has a highly educated populace, together with over 10,000 people who have gone through the Bolashak program and have studied at the best universities in the US and Western Europe. In Almaty, you will find the big four accounting firms, and each has between 400 and 600 people on staff. This country is used as a service center for many of the other Central Asian countries, as well as Mongolia. Combined with the solid air transport offered by Air Astana, there is a real potential to make Almaty into a services center.</p><h4>How could Kazakhstan further leverage PPPs to its advantage?</h4><p>To be successful in PPPs, you really need open and transparent international tendering, a balanced contract between the government and the operator, and the engagement of both local and international consultants for the tender and PPP preparation. In Kazakhstan today, the key issues really are—and there has been considerable progress with new legislation that came into effect in 2012—the inability to pursue international arbitration. For PPPs to truly be successful, one needs recourse to international arbitration, and also less state support. Projects essentially need to be commercially viable. What we have suggested to the government is to take two or three of the large projects that would particularly appeal to international attention and then work through the remaining issues with those projects. I think that the first real test for PPPs could well be a project like the Almaty Ring Road (BAKAD), which is something that will really attract the big international players—we need proof that Kazakhstan is seriously open for PPPs and then the investors will come themselves.</p><div class="quote">“To be successful in PPPs, you really need open and transparent international tendering."</div><h4>What steps need to be taken to make Kazakhstan's capital markets more attractive?</h4><p>The first thing needed is trust amongst the banks. Right now, there is a real problem in terms of tenge liquidity, rendering medium- or long-term borrowing very difficult, and of course the successful growth of SMEs requires longer-term funding available to finance the investments. First of all, by cleaning up the banking universe, the banks will establish trust amongst themselves, enabling the healthy growth of a real money market among the banks. Then, the ability of companies to raise funds in tenge is absolutely critical. What we are finding now is that many companies are primarily borrowing in dollars, which is unsustainable in the long term due to exchange rate risks.</p><h4>Central to the government's 2050 strategy is transforming Kazakhstan into one of the world's 30 most-developed countries. What do you consider the key steps in realizing this?</h4><p>It is quite an ambitious goal, but not impossible. None of the economies that the bank operates in currently rank within the top 30, but several are now actually just outside that group and in the top 40; that would include the Czech Republic and Slovenia. If you look at the tables, Kazakhstan has actually made quite a lot of progress over recent years. In terms of per capita income, it now ranks between 55th and 70th in the world, depending on the metrics. Investments in oil and gas production and the rising price of hydrocarbons have contributed to Kazakhstan's rise; however, it cannot reach the levels of Qatar or Norway due to population and reserve size, which makes it all the more important that Kazakhstan works to diversify its economic matrix, and not just diversification in terms of production away from non-oil and gas, but also in terms of regional diversification. Currently, there is a huge disparity between what you find in Astana and Almaty and in the regional centers, so it is critical to develop Kazakhstan more evenly.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for private investment in Kazakhstan's regions?</h4><p>Places such as Shymkent are growing rapidly—there are around 1 million people in the city and the surrounding areas. Were you to open up border controls and make import/export to Central Asia easier, I think there would be even more growth in the Shymkent area. There are quite a number of multinationals already in the region, for instance in the cement segment. Another region, for example, is Kyzylorda, which has a very progressive mayor who was previously in Aktau and who has set up a foreign investor center to actively promote the area. CNPC and PetroChina are located there, too, and there are huge opportunities in the float glass area because of the sand necessary for glass making. The region also boasts half of the minerals on the periodic table, while the Baikonur Cosmodrome is a tourism boon. Kazakhstan has a lot of opportunities for attracting tourism to the region. Delhi is only a three hour and 20 minute flight from Almaty, and currently the only place close to India for skiing is Kashmir. If a second ski area were opened up, I truly believe it could attract regional Asian skiers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the EBRD and Kazakhstan's economy as a whole?</h4><p>On the economy, we recently moved up our forecasts for the year. Over the medium term, we expect growth in the 5%-6% range over the next couple of years. And we believe it can be sustained at least in the medium term by future developments in oil and gas; Kashagan is coming online soon. The risks are, of course, a possible drop in oil prices and a continuing overhang of non-performing loans. But, in general, we are quite optimistic, and our outlook for both Kazakhstan and the EBRD is particularly positive.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

What makes the Dominican Republic attractive to foreign investors?</h4><p>Macroeconomic stability is necessary to sustain achievements in welfare over time and to encourage economic growth. Also, we must ensure fundamental equilibrium in terms of the external, monetary, financial, and tax sectors. In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, the authorities approved a budget that reduced government spending and the deficit and passed a tax reform to raise revenues and keep public finances on the right path. Also, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic adopted an inflation-targeting scheme that uses interest rates to signal the monetary policy stance. This scheme was envisaged as a framework for implementing monetary policy. The most attractive sectors for private investment have been ICT, mining, and tourism, which have experienced dynamic growth. These sectors will remain attractive to foreign investment in the near future. The climate, history, and accessibility make the country one of the biggest tourist attractions in the Caribbean region. Also, we have important open mineral deposits that make environmentally sustainable mining activity viable. The country also wants to attract foreign investment to its logistics and manufacturing industries to created higher value-added.</p><h4>The country expected economic growth of around 3.6% for 2013 and 5% inflation. How do you see investment evolving?</h4><p>During 2013, the government had to adopt a more restrictive fiscal policy, increasing taxes and reducing spending, which has had an impact on the decisions of private agents and economic activity. It is a period of adjustment that, once over, should see economic activity and investment returning to natural levels. Growth levels in 2013 reached 3%, having had a slow first half of the year, but there was much more dynamism in the third quarter. We are optimistic for both growth and investment over 2014. According to the latest Business Barometer by Deloitte, 44.1% believe that the economic situation will be better in about a year, whereas 35.5% believe that the business and investment environments will also improve.</p><div class="quote">“Strategic programs to support SMEs are one of the main priorities of our government."</div><h4>What actions are being taken to promote greater specialization and modernization in the Dominican economy?</h4><p>The Ministry has assumed two major challenges to boost economic growth in the country and make this process a more inclusive one. Firstly, we developed the National Development Strategy 2030, which defines the country Dominicans want for 2030 and the policies to be implemented to achieve it. In this context, we consulted over 7,500 people and 1,425 civil society organizations and they all expressed their views on the country's image in 2030, including goals and policy guidelines. Secondly, we strengthened the National Planning and Public Investment System and implemented the National Development Strategy 2030. It was hard work that required training and coordination, and has already been reflected in three versions of the Multi-Year Plan for the Public Sector, which ensures the consistency of government investment guidelines to meet the goals of the National Development Strategy.</p><h4>Since you recently reviewed projects in the country funded by the World Bank worth $274 million in the Dominican Republic, what will be the impact of these projects on the local economy?</h4><p>The relationship with the World Bank, like with other multilateral cooperation agencies, has been designed to support the country in its efforts to further develop its economy, financing projects in priority areas such as education, health, social care, energy, and governance, as well as supporting our budget and contributing to the country's fiscal and macroeconomic stability. We are in the process of defining the new strategy with the World Bank. We want to prioritize two sectors: education and electric energy.</p><h4>SMEs are one of the main economic engines of the country, employing more than 850,000 people. What policies are in place to strengthen Dominican SMEs and facilitate their access to credit?</h4><p>Strategic programs to support SMEs are one of the main priorities of our government. In this context, we created the Vice-Ministry of SMEs within the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which is responsible for the formulation and implementation of programs to promote and support this sub-sector. Currently, there are some ongoing plans, programs, and projects to promote the sustainable development of SMEs and facilitate their formalization in terms of business activity. As per access to credit, we created a portfolio of public credit for SMEs in the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, which has Ps4 billion available for SMEs and an extra Ps600 million and Ps500 through the Foundation for Microfinance Reserves and PROMIPYME, respectively. Similarly, we created the Solidarity Bank with the objective of providing better access to quality financial services for low-income people, thereby facilitating the democratization of credit and the creation of social capital. We have also eased the regulatory requirements for the assessment and granting of credit to small borrowers through the adoption of the Rules of Microfinance. In addition, we amended the Regulation of the Law on Procurement and Public Contracting ct Procurement, aimed at simplifying the requirements for the State Register of Providers. This initiative has allowed the formal registration of a significant numbers of SMEs that supply the government. Furthermore, we implemented the virtual window platform at the national level and physical stop shop for the formalization of SMEs, which offer all services for the registration process, significantly reducing registration time and revoking the mandatory legal assistance in drafting the bylaws of SMEs.</p><h4>What is the importance of new technologies to improve the management of government and its relationship with citizens?</h4><p>Recently, we launched a new website, accessible from mobiles and other portable devices. The existence of open data requires availability and free access at any time, and no restrictions in terms of using and distributing data. For this purpose, we have established guidelines to standardize access to information, and our commitment is to implement them as soon as possible. Open data encourages the active participation of citizens not only with suggestions and proposals, but also with the generation of citizen content such as photos and videos. These are tasks that the General Government Directorate of Ethics and Integrity, under Decree No. 486-12, follows up in terms of implementation.</p><h4>The National Development Strategy is presented as a tool to advance the development and cohesion of society, expressing the vision of the country in 2030. What are the cornerstones of this strategy and how does it determine the policies implemented by the Ministry?</h4><p>Proposals for the National Development Strategy 2030 are articulated around four strategic pillars with institutional, social, economic, and environmental themes. In this context, we want to develop a social and democratic state in which institutions act ethically, transparently, and efficiently, ensuring safety and promoting equality, peaceful coexistence, and national and local development. We want to promote a society with equal rights and opportunities, in which the entire population has access to education, healthcare, decent housing, and quality basic services, progressively reducing poverty and social and territorial inequality. We also want to integrate regional economies, boost innovation, diversity, and quality, create the base for sustained high growth in a competitive local market within a global economy. Finally, we aim to consolidate a society with sustainable consumption and production, managed with fairness and efficiency, protecting the environment and natural resources of our country. These actions are complemented by crosscutting policies aimed at ensuring public sector action and the guarantee of human rights, environmental sustainability, territorial cohesion, social participation, and the widespread use of ICT.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the creation of Corporación Maresa in Ecuador, and how has the group evolved since?</h4><p>The Maresa Group started its operations with Maresa, an assembling company, over 35 years ago. We started assembling Mack trucks, and over the years incorporated other clients and products, such as Fiat and its vehicles and trucks, as well as Mitsubishi, Mazda, Toyota, and Ford, some of which we no longer work with. However, the success story behind our group shows that, thanks to our evolution, we established other business divisions like leasing for Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and the automotive division, in which we have constantly grown our clients' portfolio. Our main objective has been to widen our business activity in order to cover all the market's needs and demand, both product- and service-wise. Today, we are the official distributor for Fiat, Chrysler, and Mazda nationwide, and for Ford on the coast and in eastern Ecuador. For the other brands we work with, we mostly perform specific distribution or commercialization activities. In terms of percentages, we distribute 35% of Mazda vehicles and 100% of Fiat and Chrysler vehicles.</p><h4>What specific role does each of these brands play in your global activity?</h4><p>Currently, Mazda plays the most important role in our group's activities, as we have long managed its operations in Ecuador. For example, Chrysler and Fiat have been with us since 2012, and, therefore, their weight in our overall activities is rather low, especially because they are subject to import quotas established by the government. However, our main goal for the near future is to consolidate their activities and brands in the market, while we expect the authorities to lift the import quota.</p><h4>What is the company's growth strategy?</h4><p>Our strategy in the distribution segment is to become as multi-brand as possible, in order to cater to the market with different products. Regarding the assembling business line, we aim to operate at full capacity in the near future. With Mazda, for example, we assemble vehicles that are locally sold, and also export to Venezuela; however, we do not operate at 100% capacity. In this context, we want to close a partnership deal with another automotive brand to start assembling its vehicles at our plant and then try to operate at full capacity. Among our top priorities is the consolidation of our companies' mission to meet consumer needs. For that reason, we need to further strengthen our post-sales services. Maresa Group was established with that purpose; to serve the needs and demands of consumers while bringing together the wide portfolio of brands we represent. We also expect to close partnership agreements with other related companies in the industry, such as insurance companies or banks, which would enable us to offer a comprehensive package of services to our clients. Such a step would enable us to generate further value-added for our services, and the brand in general, in the consumer's eye. We would also like to increase the segments in which we operate in Ecuador, such as low-price cars.</p><h4>What role do exports play in your distribution activity?</h4><p>Last year, we assembled 12,000 vehicles, 5,000 of which were exported to Venezuela. In this regard, we are open to looking at export activities to neighboring countries; with Mazda, the activity is solely focused on Venezuela. Maresa also operates in Colombia and Peru, though this activity is purely focused on the leasing division of our business. Currently, our leasing division represents 10% of our overall activity, whereas the automotive assembly and distribution division represents 90%.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Maresa Group as compared to its main competitors?</h4><p>We are the only company offering the multi-brand business concept to its clients under the Maresa Group umbrella. We complement this with our capacity, training, and post-sales services.</p><h4>What is the company's expected turnover for 2013?</h4><p>We aim at closing the year with a $350 million Group turnover. If we break down the figure into national and international operations, I could tell you that, nationally, we will close the year with similar figures to 2012, as we must keep in mind the so-called import quotas, which pose a barrier to our growth in the domestic market. For that reason, exports and rental activities are driving the Group's growth today. In this context, the size of the Ecuadorean automotive market stands at around 145,000 units per year, and, right now, supply in the automotive industry cannot meet demand, especially because of the quotas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How extensive are Grupo Synergy's operations in Latin America?<br></h4><p>We currently have operations in two different mature fields in Ecuador; one in the Santa Elena Peninsula and another in Eastern Ecuador at the Tiguino field. We also have operations in Colombia—a small condensate gas field for which we have been granted exploitation and operations rights for 20 years with a very ambitious investment plan. In Brazil, we operate in three different states: Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Alagoas. Returning to Ecuador, we have recently renegotiated our contracts due to changes in the hydrocarbons law in 2010. These contracts are set to expire in 2016. In this regard, we are holding talks to extend one of the contracts, especially in the Santa Elena Peninsula, until 2029. This particular field is very mature, and it has been exploited for 100 years already. We currently produce 1,240 barrels per day (bbl/d). We have been operating in this field since 2002, with 1,463 wells and around 345 staff in that field. The new operating and investment plan for this field foresees a $56 million investment in order to drill approximately 30 wells before the current contract expires. At the same time, we are to carry 2D and 3D seismic studies that will determine future developments in the field. Regarding the Tiguino field, we have been operating there since 2004 and current production figures are 3,400 bbl/d with 13 productive wells and around 123 staff in that field. Thanks to high levels of investment in Tiguino, we have recovery levels of around 25%, which are above the average. Our exploitation contract in this field expires in 2016, and we are in the process renegotiating with the government to extend this contract with our company.</p><h4>Could you describe the company's current operations regarding natural gas?</h4><p>In the last 20 years, people have become more aware of natural gas thanks to its natural conditions and advantages versus other hydrocarbons. In addition, transportation techniques have improved dramatically, and that has played a key role in making natural gas a worldwide commodity. Thanks to the shale gas infrastructure developed over the years, the US is the world's leading producer of natural gas, and in terms of reserves overcoming even Russia. In terms of Ecuador, the country has traditionally focused on oil, leaving aside gas. However, the government has realized the potential of this natural resource and it has already started investing in this area. For example, the government came to us to develop a pilot project to implement a fleet of 100 taxis run by gas. We are just waiting on licenses to start this project. We currently have one service station operating and we believe that thanks to this pilot project we could expand the overall number of taxis up to 400 and build a new service station. We are also about to sign an agreement with Hyundai to provide it with natural gas.</p><h4>What are the main activities the company is implementing in terms of social responsibility?</h4><p>Over the last few years, we have strengthened our social responsibility activities toward the communities where the company operates. For example, not long ago we put together a book with the history, traditions, culture, and pictures of the Waorani community. The book is available for sale and all the proceeds from it go directly to the community. Additionally, we also have workers from this community among our staff. Synergy Group Ecuador is characterized by consistent respect for stakeholders, ethical behavior, transparency, accountability, the rule of law and respect for the principles of social responsibility embedded in the international standard ISO 26000:2010, on which we are working.</p><h4>What are your future business plans?</h4><p>We will take part in the many tendering processes in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. At the same time, we will look into expanding partnerships with other companies. Additionally, in Cuba, where we have been working with the government for the last five years, we are considered an A-Class company—the highest level—and we have optimistic future perspectives to start exploitation work in the near future. In Mexico, we are also considering many potential activities. In Ecuador, we aim to become a leading player in managing mature fields within the natural gas industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When is Fruta del Norte going to enter into production?<br></h4><p>Fruta del Norte is a mineral deposit that has fantastic potential for Ecuador. It is expected to be the first major large-scale underground gold mine in the country's history. In order to actually put the mine into production, we have to go through a number of steps, including signing a contract with the government of Ecuador. Apart from that, there are a lot of technical studies, environmental studies, and permits of a wide range in nature that we need to obtain to move the project into the production stage.</p><h4>What has been the contribution of investments by Kinross in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have been here almost 10 years. Mining has the curious characteristic of taking a very long time from when you start exploring to putting it into production. Since 2003, we have explored a large area in the southeast of Ecuador, and in 2006 we found a gold and silver deposit—Fruta del Norte. The deposit is about 200 meters below ground and it is a very high-grade deposit. In a mine, the grade is rated on how many grams of gold you have in every ton of rock. There are many mines around the world now, such as in Chile and the US, for example. Usually those mines have a grade of about 1 gram for every ton of rock. Fruta del Norte has an average grade of approximately 8 grams per ton, which is very high. That is one of the reasons why this deposit is so important. Right now, we have reserves in Fruta del Norte defined at almost 7 million ounces of gold and almost the same amount in silver.</p><h4>What is the relevance of Ecuador to the global operations of Kinross?</h4><p>Kinross has mines in many parts of the world. We have mines in South America, North America, Central Asia, and Africa. Right now, South America represents about 36% of our global gold production from our mines in Brazil and Chile. We produce around 900,000 ounces of gold every year in South America, making it a very important region for us on a global basis. When you add in the potential production from our project in Ecuador, that makes South America even more important for us. Fruta del Norte is a mine that could be producing for 20 years or more. When you see that kind of long-term production of a very high-quality ore deposit, it means Ecuador is important for Kinross.</p><h4>What does Kinross do to help the local communities?</h4><p>We have worked with the local communities for a long time. The fundamental objective is to always base a relationship on trust and transparency. As part of the relationship, we have developed a very clear, long-term community investment strategy. It is the people of the parish, not us, that say how they want to develop their community over the next five to 10 years. Right now, the region that hosts us in Ecuador is one of the poorest in the country, making our development priorities revolve around good planning execution: building better schools, clean water supplies, stable electricity, and better roads. There is a lot of basic infrastructure that cities take for granted, which villagers lack. We help them develop the project and then the plans are implemented. We wanted to avoid the old paternalistic model. We are part of the community and need to contribute responsibly to long-term development, but it is their plan, not ours. It is a very constructive way to have the relationship. We have completed many projects on a participatory basis, as letting the community take the lead fosters ownership and accountability. We have had many fantastic experiences, and we have some excellent infrastructure and education projects on the go. For example, an important part of our commitment is to favor local employment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation (SENESCYT) contributing to the development of the country?</h4><p>SENESCYT is putting a great emphasis on higher education, technology, science, and innovation in order to contribute to the change in the economic axis of the Ecuadorean economy toward more knowledge and creativity; thus, contributing to the process of building a knowledge-based society. In this context, we have evaluated the quality of the higher education sector through a very detailed process that led to the closure of 14 institutions in our country. Such measures were much needed in order to confront the commodification process that the Ecuadorean higher education system underwent in previous years. The main reason for their closure was the lack of quality standards. This process, coordinated and funded by the Ecuadorean state, also led around 40,000 students from these institutions to look for another university, which resulted in an improvement in the education process. In addition, these students went through a quality control process in order to assess whether the level of knowledge they had corresponded with reality. Overall, 87% of those students from institutions that had to close successfully continued their education at other centers, which in general terms represents a success, despite the fact that 98% of the students were offered an alternative to continue their studies. Additionally, we set up a national admission and leveling system for prospective higher education students, which broke with past admission trends on social features. Also, we have strengthened the access to scholarship and financial tools available to students. In 2012, over 8,000 students received some form of financial support. Overall, we can see a very positive picture, because we have seen a 50% increase in terms of access to the higher education system by lower income and minority students. Today, Ecuador has a higher rate of low income and minority group students in the higher education system compared to the rest of the region, at 27%. In 2012, we also saw the number of researchers triple. In general terms, the current administration is investing large amounts of money in the higher education sector, and in the scholarships segment alone, we are talking about an average of around $550 million worth of investment. This is very attractive to universities.</p><h4>What are the main destination countries for the students who enjoy these scholarships?</h4><p>Many of them are in the EU and the US; however, Australia, South America, and some Asian countries are also destinations for Ecuadorean students. Overall, 60% of our students go to Europe. In addition, around 1,000 teachers from primary and secondary schools have enjoyed scholarships to travel abroad and improve, among other things, their English level. Finally, we encourage high-level researchers from other countries to come to Ecuador through the Prometheus program, and we provide financial and bureaucratic support to institutions. Ecuador is investing 1.83% of GDP in higher education, representing an increase of 1.11 percentage points over the last six years. It is the Latin American country that invests the most in this sector.</p><h4>What are some of your future plans in the education field?</h4><p>We will start providing financial support based on quality, efficiency, and excellence in order to contribute to the further development of the sector in terms of quality. By the end of 2013, we will also revise the license granting process for undergraduate and post-graduate courses. Those students that do not pass the test will be eliminated. The idea is to move toward a higher education system in which universities and programs aim at the generation of knowledge. In this way, we are implementing some reforms for the academic regime, and providing some incentives through resources assignment. We also plan an investment of around $308 million in technical programs, as they are the future of our country, and we need to improve the level and number of annual graduates. We also plan a large investment for Yachay, the first planned city of knowledge in Latin America, which provides a friendly ecosystem within the technology and innovation fields geared at attracting foreign investment. For example, several international, and over 50 national companies have already shown their interest in establishing operations in this area of around 4,500 hectares.</p><div class="quote">“  Yachay sums up Ecuador's identity and will lay the foundations for the country's future development. "</div><h4>Could you tell us a bit more about the ambitious Yachay project?</h4><p>The Yachay project combines the public and private sector, higher education institutions, innovation, technology, and R&amp;D. It has 82 heritage areas, and we are in the process of recovering this particular area; the campus will be one of the first elements, along with laboratories, and we plan to invest around $220 million in this project and $1 billion at the initial stage, which involves the building of the university, the public research institutes, and the residential neighborhoods. The construction work for these elements will start during 2H2013. Overall, it is a unique area in the entire Latin American region, and we aim for it to become a true knowledge hub with several clusters from among strategic sectors of the national economy. It is difficult to give a time schedule for the project; however, we expect to have the basics constructed by the end of the current administrative term. The university we envision in this technological and innovative city will be very much focused on technology, science, and innovation. For example, we plan to have one of the largest computer centers in the world as part of providing companies based in Yachay with the necessary services for their operations and development. Yachay sums up Ecuador's identity, knowledge and learning, and we are sure it will lay the foundations for the country's future development. This smart city will also comply with international environmental commitments in terms of carbon emissions. It should be emphasized that Yachay is envisaged to be a knowledge city oriented to the development of scientific innovation not only for the benefit Ecuador, but also the wider Latin American region. In this way, Yachay, being conceptualized as a Special Zone of Economic Development, offers some specific incentives.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for the IT sector over the medium term?</h4><p>We need to encourage both the private sector to boost research and innovation expenditure and the higher education institutions to look for greater levels of excellence and strengthen quality standards and processes. We need to do so by increasing expenditure in research, and by articulating with the private sector. For this purpose, it is necessary to move forward in terms of the national science, technology, and innovation code, which will provide the right regulatory framework for the industry to further develop, and to have a major dialog between academia and research institutes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background story to Kimberly-Clark's presence in Ecuador?<br></h4><p>We entered the Ecuadorean market 18 years ago, and have been operating in two main segments: diapers and bathroom tissues. Today, we are a leading company in the market with our consumer brands known worldwide, such as Huggies®, Kleenex®, Scott®, Kotex®, Poise®, Kimberly-Clark Professional®, Flor®, Jackson Safety®, Kleenguard®, and Wypall®. For example, in Ecuador we own 71% of the market in the diapers segment, 49% in bathroom tissues, and 27% of the market in the female sanitary products segment. Over the years, we have also invested significantly in a production facility in Ecuador. At the moment, we produce mainline diapers (we only import premium products in this range) and certain sanitary products. Quality standards are one of our main concerns and focuses, and we invest every year in making sure that we present our clients with products meeting the highest quality standards. Our mission is to lead the world in essentials for a better life.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in your business activity?</h4><p>We have innovation centers across the world, the main task of which is to develop new products for our portfolio. They also conduct detailed market research to establish strategic lines when it comes to importing products from other markets, and developing production facilities in operating countries. We apply innovation in our product portfolio, production lines, and commercial strategies. For example, Kimberly-Clark Ecuador has been a pioneer in electronic billing for the wholesale segment, and we apply innovative strategies to the production chain to give our products added value and make them more competitive and attractive for consumers.</p><h4>What are the particularities of the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>Our regional market research reveals more similarities than differences between South American markets; however, it is crucial for multinational companies to understand the commercial behavior of local markets. In this context, Ecuador offers the perfect scenario in which to implement regional pilot projects. In our particular case, Ecuador was the country where we implemented—for the first time in the Andean region—a very innovative planning strategy, and we have exported many business practices from this country to other regional markets. This is a great advantage for Ecuador, as recognized multinationals like us can showcase and export successful practices and strategies.</p><h4>How have operating profits evolved in recent years?</h4><p>We have been in a very positive double-digit trend in terms of gross profit growth over the past few years. For example, in 2012 we grew by around 10%, which has been our average figure for the past five years. Regarding market share, we are constantly growing, and have experienced a very positive recovery in portfolios of particular value for consumers, which confirms that people really value our products.</p><h4>How relevant is social responsibility in your business model?</h4><p>Sustainability and social responsibility are two of the main pillars of the company's business model.  We take into consideration all the stakeholders of our value chain, supporting the communities we operate in, while generating Kimberly-Clark's brand visibility. We dedicate many resources to environmentally-friendly practices and production activities. Our innovative activity is also heavily geared toward reducing the impact of our production activities on the environment. Furthermore, we prioritize the human side of business, rather than just the economic. This is one of our most precious competitive advantages, and we are among the top companies to work for in the entire Latin American region, if not the world.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the further expansion of the company in Ecuador?</h4><p>Our main objective is to continue our sustainable growth experienced over the past few years, as well as to continue expanding our product portfolio in the best interest of consumers. That will allow us to grow our activities and market share in the country. This can only be achieved with the contribution of each individual involved in our activity in Ecuador, from administrative staff to specialized workers and partners. Ecuador holds huge potential, and we can continue providing our company with skilled and qualified Ecuadorean employees in relevant positions within the regional and international operations of Kimberly-Clark.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main contribution that the Hydrocarbons Secretariat of Ecuador (SHE) makes to the country?<br></h4><p>Since 2010, the Hydrocarbons Secretariat has been responsible for administering the country's assets, including the contracts and areas covered by our state-owned company, Petroamazonas. We encourage investment by oil operators, whether they are NOCs or IOCs. We identify potential contracts with new contractors, promote investment, and control those investments in light of the contracts signed. We are also the counterpart of any investor or contractor for the state.</p><h4>What approach is needed for success in exploiting Ecuador's natural reserves?</h4><p>Exploitation of our reserves requires short-, medium-, and long-term thinking. We estimate that the country will experience a decline in production, and believe that the development of the southeastern region is the key project for long-term oil production. For that reason, we established a related strategy in 2011. Accordingly, we are building a strategy of 21 blocks, 13 of which will be listed as part of a historic bidding process.</p><h4>Will this new round increase production in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have been producing for more than 40 years in the north and central area of the Amazon. The area that we are currently priming for development is almost identical in size. We believe that the fields in the southeastern region could be as lucrative as those we have in the north and in Peru, which would double our production. In the first round of studies, we discovered that about 1.6 billion barrels could be added to form a combined total of 1.8 billion barrels of proven reserves.</p><h4>What does Ecuador need to do in order to maximize its oil and gas potential?</h4><p>In the short term, we have to focus on the production fields and work on how we can help Petroamazonas and other new ventures to increase production at mature fields. In the mid term, investments in technology, new technical procedures, better warehousing, and the potential for more oil, would be helpful. However, in the long term our reserves will not yield new production, and it is important to focus on exploration in the southeastern region.</p><h4>What is the main challenge in the hydrocarbons sector?</h4><p>For exploration, contracts are normally production sharing deals or concession funds. The main challenge then, is that we are for first time ever, presenting a unique service contract for a pure exploratory region with a tariff system. The challenge is to understand the system and assign the appropriate technicians. We trust in the geology of the region, which is probably one of our strengths. One out of every three projects in exploration is successful, and operational costs are low. Naturally, despite our strengths the contract is a challenge as it is difficult to reopen an investment after 25 years.</p><h4>How do you maintain relations with local communities in the country?</h4><p>When we devised the strategy for oil development in Ecuador's southeastern region, we identified two main tasks: communicating with communities, and extracting oil. It is the constitutional right of every community to be informed before a decision is taken by the state that could impact the environment. We hired and around 50 people from local communities as local communicators. Our “social environmental diagnosis" tool explained the need to utilize out natural resources to improve living standards in Ecuador, and also our policy for oil development in the area. The results were amazing, and we signed agreements with most people in the area.</p><h4>What can foreign investors coming to Ecuador expect from SHE?</h4><p>We present ourselves as partners and help them understand the system and the law, our geology, our economics, and our legal issues to enable informed investment decisions. We want investors that we share a common vision with; a vision of sustainable economic development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Sertecpet's operations evolved in Ecuador since it was established in the early 1990s?<br></h4><p>During the 1990s Ecuador lacked a clear industrial policy associated with appropriate stimuli, generating a dependent economy centered mainly on the import of goods and services both for consumption as well as for industrial inputs within the oil sector. Additionally, relations between the public and private sector were extremely weak, and the lack of public-private cooperation gave way to an economy that favored commercial over industrial initiatives granting greater benefits to activities devoted to the import of goods and services, rather than to the development of the local industrial base. Taking into account such economic and social contexts, Sertecpet was born as a positive response to the lack of national incentives. Our goal was to address the situation by developing a national industry fueled by the contribution of local skilled professionals in the oil and energy industry. We are a family-run business that has undergone some transformations during the first 10 years, transformations that have included changes to our corporate scope, vision, mission and brand positioning, as well as to the instauration of innovative processes and technologic improvements. The end result of this evolution is today's Sertecpet, a company at the forefront of innovation and the industrial process in Ecuador whose vision is to excel in the provision of integrated energy solutions. We have earned our leadership through the development of world-class products with great added value and the highest international quality and safety levels. Today, we provide services with our products and technologies under a very recognized and reputable brand; we have our own patents and we are a unique company worldwide.</p><h4>What role does technology and innovation play in your overall activities?</h4><p>During our first years of activity, the latest technology to produce our products was wholly imported from the US, Canada, Spain, Japan, and Germany. Over the years, we have been able to develop our own, patented technology and get our systems internationally certified. We operate like any other multinational company that produces technology and systems for the international market. Additionally, we have also developed unique regional projects in the field of basic, conceptual, and detailed engineering for onshore and offshore, and bottom hole tool assembly that are installed in large fields at a regional level. We firmly believe that our know-how and technology allow us to become a strategic partner of the operators.</p><h4>What are the services you have specialized in during the last few years?</h4><p>Because of our expertise and know-how, our technology and products are excellent for operating mature oil fields. These fields are low in production and, therefore, are less profitable and require high levels of technology. Sertecpet, thanks to its integrated solutions, makes these fields more profitable, generating positive contributions for the economies in which we operate. We are usually able to increase production levels by considerable amounts, generating the corresponding impacts in revenue growth and profitability. Currently, we employ over 1,200 engineers. Our qualified staff and the software systems we have developed can carry out detailed reports and studies prior to starting operations. Our clients are provided with a range of alternatives and solutions adapted to their needs, based on increasing production and reducing costs.</p><h4>What is the future growth strategy of the company?</h4><p>Hydroelectric activities are the most relevant section of the industry for us, and in Ecuador they represent the main activities we develop. However, as part of our growth strategy, we will soon enter the renewable energies sector, targeting our participation in solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy projects. We also consider that the geothermal segment has great potential. Such growth will enable us to further consolidate our company as a provider of integrated solutions for the entire energy industry. The further expansion of the company will be based on continuing the provision of engineering and production services with the latest technology and our own developed systems and products with a worldwide projection.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the Ministry's future perspectives and its role in the government's efforts to change Ecuador's production matrix?</h4><p>The change in the production matrix, as stated by President Correa, is one of the top government priorities. Several ministries in addition to ours, such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing, the Ministry of Transport and Public Works, and the Ministry of Tourism, are also involved in the operational committee. Our Ministry is in charge of coordinating and boosting synergy between all the teams involved in the national effort to change the national production matrix. Our main objective is to increase productivity levels, diversify production, products, and markets, generate further value-added for our exports, and increase the range of exportable products. Overall, we want to become a country that exports products with value-added, strengthening Ecuador's profile in international markets. Today, Ecuador exports a large amount of non-renewable energy products, and we need to diversify our export portfolio in order to reduce dependence on oil exports and increase our industrial profile in terms of exports. I would like to add that the country has already been engaged in such efforts and activities for the past six years, a period of time in which Ecuador has completely changed for the better. For example, we have adopted a new Code of Production, which gives us a better and clearer regulatory framework for investors, and introduced tax reforms to attract both domestic and foreign investment. Along with that, we provide many types of support to entrepreneurs. We have renewed over 90% of the national highway network, thereby contributing to the development of the logistics sector. In this regard, Ecuador is the leading exporter in segments such as bananas, shrimp, flowers, and cocoa, and our products are regarded as being of the highest quality. However, we know that we must improve upon certain technical issues to increase productivity per hectare.</p><p>Additionally, we have improved airport facilities and we have started as many as eight different hydroelectric plant projects, worth $8 billion, which will fully make Ecuador energy sufficient, as well as the cleanest energy producer in the world by 2018, the year in which we expect these projects to be completed. Ecuador has also achieved a great level of political stability, which has diversely contributed to national development. We are growing at a faster rate than the regional average, and Ecuador currently enjoys its historically lowest unemployment rate, which is also one of the lowest in the region, too. The country has also improved both the quantity and quality of employment. Another one of our main goals is to increase the Ecuadorean component of productivity. In other words, we want to manufacture more products in our country and strengthen the “made in Ecuador" brand. For example, we have noticed increased interest in manufacturing companies within the car assembly and components industry to invest in Ecuador. It is important to note that the public sector should be the engine boosting all these efforts; however, the private sector also plays a part in order to achieve common goals and drive development from an industrial point of view. In other words, the private sector knows how to market and commercialize the products the country produces, while the public sector provides regulation and incentives. It is all about creating synergy. In that regard, we have already had successful experiences such as the cardboard production plant in Guayaquil, which has an expected $130 million investment plan for 2013; it recycles material to make cardboard boxes, for banana exports, for example. This plant had imported 60% of the cardboard before we started exploiting synergies between the public and private sector, and we have now reduced that figure to 45%. Ecuador has to take further steps to become self-sufficient in as many areas as possible, and reduce the import of products that we are large producers of, such as rice, coffee, and quinoa. Ecuador is a unique country in terms of geography and biodiversity—visitors can travel from the high mountains to the coast in just half an hour by plane, and enjoy the great biodiversity of our small, but compact, country. Ecuador has completely changed its image over the past few years, the best proof of which is the rising number of senior officials visiting our country to express interest in investing here. Ecuador is clearly on the right path to achieving further growth and development, and I have no doubt that the above-mentioned efforts will lead us to a better and promising future for our country.</p><h4>How can international trade agreements contribute toward increasing the country's competitiveness?</h4><p>The more trade agreements we have, the better. In respect of the agreement with the EU, I can say that we have advanced negotiations considerably. We are very hopeful of reaching a common agreement in the near future. This agreement should open the doors of Ecuador to many European companies, and vice-versa; we should see an increasing presence of Ecuadorean products on EU shelves that are even more competitive. For example, we have unique fruits and agricultural products found only in Ecuador, and perhaps Colombia, which spells huge potential for the near future. Biodiversity is one of our main competitive advantages, and that is something we have to further exploit from an industrial perspective.</p><div class="quote">“The change in the production matrix, as stated by President Correa, is one of the top government priorities."</div><h4>What are your main priorities as a Minister for the short to medium term?</h4><p>First of all, and as President Correa has already stated, we need to consolidate the process I mentioned before and the work achieved over the past six years; we have four years ahead of us, and it will be a good period of time in which to make a notable change and contribution to the country. Ecuador today enjoys the best economic and social conditions yet seen, and we have to take advantage of this ideal situation to achieve more and become less economically dependent on oil.</p><h4>What economic sectors hold the greatest potential for the further development of Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador and Latin America are achieving a great and positive transformation, quite unique in history, and investors already have their eyes on the region. I believe that Ecuador is leading this developmental process and that we offer the best conditions for investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>General Motors Ómnibus BB Del Ecuador has been in Ecuador for almost 40 years. How has the company evolved during this period?</h4><p>Around 37 years ago, a Hungarian entrepreneur set up OBB's first plant in Ecuador to assemble buses. His vision and leadership drove the company's first years, and in 1981 General Motors Corporation became a shareholder. This strengthened both companies in the Ecuadorean market, giving the brand a wider and more attractive portfolio of products, and developing the automotive industry in Ecuador. Ever since then, we have been constantly innovating and remaining at the forefront of the industry, which has brought about a preference for our products among Ecuadorean consumers. We are the leading company in terms of variety of products; currently we have around 50 models available on the market, ranging from small vehicles to trucks. Our assembled products are highly recognized in Ecuador for their quality. Some 80% of what we sell is assembled at our plant. In terms of distribution and after-sales services, we are the brand with the highest penetration in the entire country. We have wide coverage in points of sale and service, being present in most of Ecuador's provinces, and at the same time we continue to expand our network of after-sales service points. We believe that a company with such a long tradition as General Motors must look after its clients, and we do so by combining high-quality products with an extensive distribution and after-sales network. GM OBB enjoys well-deserved prestige in Ecuador. It is also a major employer, with 1,500 people employed directly by the company and approximately 9,500 workers in the automotive industry supported indirectly.</p><h4>How large is your distribution and after-sales service network?</h4><p>We are constantly expanding this network by signing new partnerships, or building new dealerships. We currently have 14 franchises, composed of 17 dealerships, as well as 70 points of sale, and 80 after-sales service points.</p><h4>What are some of the most popular models in your portfolio?</h4><p>The Chevrolet Sail model, launched over a year ago, is the most successful model in our portfolio. We have sold over 1,000 vehicles of this model every month since its launch. With our large product portfolio, we have been able to reach all segments of society in all regions of Ecuador, paying special attention to the five cities with most market penetration: Quito, Guayaquil, Ambato, Ibarra, and Manta.</p><div class="quote">“In 2012, we were the first CKD plant in the world to reach Level III, the highest quality level in GM."</div><h4>Is the company planning to launch any new models in the near future?</h4><p>In 1H2013, we launched the 4x4 Trailblazer and the Chevrolet Tracker, and we will soon surprise the Ecuadorean market with another new model. Innovation is our motto, and we have no doubt that this coming model will be highly successful.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the automotive industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>The industry has clearly benefited from the growth of Ecuador's middle class, and experienced very significant and sustainable growth from 2009 to 2011. However, in 2012 the government introduced new legislation seeking to redress the balance of trade, bringing in quotas and new duties on assembly vehicles, which has regulated the market.</p><h4>How have sales figures evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>Sales in the industry were high in 2011 and 2012 (with 136,000 and 122,000 units sold, respectively). However, as mentioned above, the quotas and new taxes introduced by the government have had an effect on growth. We estimate sales of roughly 105,000 to 110,000 units throughout the automotive industry in 2013.</p><h4>How will the assembling industry in Ecuador evolve over the next few years?</h4><p>The raw materials that we use for vehicle assembly are imported CKDs and local parts. The government has recently promoted local manufacturing to supply assembly plants in Ecuador. We support this strategy, and are speeding up the inclusion of more locally manufactured parts in our assembly lines. In line with the government's policy of developing a more competitive industrial sector in Ecuador, we have invested a total of $71 million in new products, facilities, and cutting-edge technology over the past two years. A total of $31 million of this was invested in the third phase of a painting plant, focusing on modernization and automation. At the same time, last year we invested $9 million of our own resources in third parties, whose business is directly related to our assembly work. Last but not least, I would like to mention quality levels at our company. In 2012, we were the first CKD plant in the world to reach Level III, the highest quality level in GM. Furthermore, we have very high levels of compliance with the global manufacturing system. For these reasons, we are currently ranked among the top-three vehicle manufacturers in Latin America.</p><h4>What role do exports play in your overall business activity?</h4><p>Exports continue to play a very important role in our business. We export mainly to Colombia and, traditionally, we have also exported to Venezuela. In 2011, we exported products worth over $200 million, but in 2012 this figure fell to $140 million, due to restrictions in the Venezuelan market.</p><h4>How important is human capital in the sector?</h4><p>We have always believed that one of the keys to success is the happiness of our employees, and we constantly implement programs for the welfare of our staff and their families. At the same time, we provide ongoing training opportunities. Human capital is very important in our industry, not only as an internal policy, but also regarding our stakeholders. We paid special attention to our sales, and especially after-sales segments, due to their proximity to the customer. We know that good service makes a difference. Finally, we should mention General Motors Ómnibus BB Del Ecuador's corporate social responsibility policy. We have four pillars guiding our projects: internal social responsibility, relations with stakeholders, protection of the environment, and community relations. Some of our main projects are: Safe Driving Practices, volunteer programs focusing on education and the environment, and “Chevrolet Siempre Conmigo," a program for our employees and their families to enhance their sense of belonging.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are behind the rapid development of Bahrain's industrial and commercial sectors?</h4><p>Bahrain has the most central location in the GCC region and is more outward looking and open minded toward the attaining of its economic, cultural, and technological development. Over the course of her long and colorful history, the Kingdom of Bahrain has served as a gateway between trading nations and civilizations. This is reflected in the attitudes of both people and government, as they strive to overcome obstacles concerning welfare, prosperity, and progress. Bahrain's drive toward industrialization and economic development testifies to this fact. Consistent, flexible, and rewarding programs were adopted in the late 1960s to establish and foster a viable industrial base. It was the first in the region to attract oil exploration investments and discovery and the first to achieve public education, health, social, and financial services. Lacking any sizable agricultural or oil resources prompted Bahrain's early embracement of economic diversification. Both the manufacturing and service sectors gained early attention and priority, and have consequently yielded the highest share of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) and employment opportunities. Having been ranked as one of the freest economies in the region reflects the liberal economic, trading, and fiscal policies of Bahrain. The lack of corporate or income taxes, near duty-free imports, and 100% private ownership of most investment activities, coupled with its properly regulated business friendly environment, have also contributed to the expansion of trade and investment inflows into Bahrain. Such a pioneering performance has been even more invigorated over the past decade by the economic and social reforms initiated by HM King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa, as well as through the launch of Economic Vision 2030, a plan aimed at attaining a knowledge economy and renewable energy, green economy, and vertical agriculture technologies.</p><h4>Manama was named the Capital of Arab Tourism in 2013 and it hosted the International Conference on Exploring New Cultural Horizons for Tourism, receiving 6.7 million of visitors in 2011, almost 50% of them from Saudi Arabia. What role do you envisage for the sector in Bahrain as a stable growth driver?</h4><p>Certainly, tourism is one of the most vibrant service sectors with sound growth prospects in Bahrain. Its returns extend beyond hotels and restaurants to impact a wide range of other service sectors including transportation, retail, trade, exhibitions, family entertainment, and telecommunications services. Over 10% of the country's workforce is also dependent on this sector. The fact that Bahrain hosted 6.7 million tourists in 2011 is a source of pride and gratification. The Bahrain tourism strategy envisages the improvement and expansion of tourism infrastructure, facilities, and attractions, with the active participation and involvement of the private sector. The enlargement of the King Fahd causeway to Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries will be complemented by the new causeway connection to Qatar, and supported by the GCC railroad network. Such logistical improvements will easily double the tourism inflows to Bahrain. The energetic heritage, cultural, and creative initiatives, projects, and events run by the Ministry of Culture have been among the most attractive factors for awarding Bahrain the Capital of Arab Culture in 2012, and the Capital of Arab Tourism in 2013.</p><div class="quote">“Besides its pronounced economic freedom and trade liberalization, Bahrain is the most diversified economy in the Gulf."</div><h4>The merchandise exports and imports of Bahrain were $19.7 billion and $13.9 billion in 2012, according to the WTO, a share of 0.11% and 0.07% of the world's total exports and imports. What actions do you plan to reinforce the trade position of Bahrain in the region and at a global level?</h4><p>While these rates seem small compared to other regional or international trading entities, they conceal the fact that Bahrain is among the highest merchandise trading countries worldwide in relation to its GDP, and second only to the UAE in this regard. Bahrain is a traditional trading country. Being a historic world navigation port of call has established the trading culture and transit standing of Bahrain. Yet, the far-sighted vision and open mindedness of the Bahraini leadership helped to establish a rewarding economic, investment, and trading relationship with many countries worldwide. Accordingly, Bahrain enjoys most-favored nation (MFN) status and preferential trade pacts on bilateral, regional, and multilateral levels. Moreover, Bahrain is fast becoming a regional depot, where goods are warehoused for transshipment to other locations in the Middle East, and it is also the most convenient center for handling business in Iran and Iraq. Manufacturers can take advantage of our new Hidd Industrial Area, which is conveniently situated close to the air and seaports, and lease out land at very competitive rates. And, for service providers and other businesses, there is an abundance of high-quality offices, with new landmarks springing up all over the island, most notable being the new Bahrain Financial Harbour and World Trade Centre projects.</p><h4>Bahrain is ranked the 12th most open economy worldwide by the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal's 2013 Index of Economic Freedom. How does this promote the development of the economy and what actions for further openness do you plan?</h4><p>Besides its pronounced economic freedom and trade liberalization, Bahrain is the most diversified economy in the Gulf region and has achieved this by maintaining an investor-friendly environment and adopting a policy of open markets as an economic development tool. There is zero taxation, no exchange control, and 100% foreign ownership permitted in all activities. Bahrain is also undertaking serious and sound steps toward the materialization of its economic strategy and its Economic Vision 2030, through which it hopes to achieve competitiveness, sustainability, and fairness objectives. Moreover, Bahrain has the best legal and regulatory infrastructure in the region, and our new Commercial Companies Law will be one of the most progressive in the world—we most certainly have the most stable and supportive political environment and world-class infrastructure that provides good logistics in terms of communications and transport. Our workforce, which has been nurtured over the years by substantial government investment in the education and health systems, is healthy, educated, and willing, and we have also used our excellent foreign relations, such as with other GCC countries, the US, Singapore, and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) countries, to expand our internal market by means of free trade agreements.</p><h4>Low value-added products historically dominate Bahrain's exports. What is being done to boost value-added?</h4><p>There has been consistent growth of industrial output in the Bahraini economy and there is enough room for future expansion as this economy is geared to acquire a leading position as a global center for private business and an attractive destination for FDI. Despite limited natural resources, the Kingdom has a strong presence in industrial sectors such as aluminum and petrochemicals and a good network of light industries with all raw materials being available within easy reach. A very distinguishing factor in Bahrain's industrial development is the share of the manufacturing sector in total exports. The manufacturing sector accounts for more than 30% of total export earnings, compared to nearly 4.3% for the entire GCC. While Bahrain pioneered oil refineries in 1936, most mega energy processing, petrochemicals, and metal manufacturing started in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. Numerous downstream industries have consequently flourished in Bahrain. As a result of consistent high quality, Bahrain's aluminum metals and engineering, with current production output levels of 830,000 metric tons per year, has made its way across the globe, exporting to 25 countries and even venturing into outer space, when Alba's aluminum was used to build the Mars explorer Sojourner.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the most potential for commercial integration between Bahrain and Turkey?</h4><p>Bahrain and Turkey have a long-standing trade and economic relationship. Both economies are growing at over 4% annually, in contrast to contractions in many other countries in the world. There are several agreements between our two countries in trade, investment, double taxation, and economic cooperation. Our private sectors and the business communities in both countries could contribute to the enhancement of our mutual beneficiary relationship with the help of the Business Councils' encounters, trade visits, and other platforms. Joint investments and industrial cooperation projects could be profitable to the two parties and should be enhanced in most of Bahrain's established industrial sectors, as well as in the fields of food processing, engineering, metalworking and car parts, feed industries, fiber-glass products, SMEs, and some service sectors like finance, telecommunications, and tourism. In addition to the growing Bahraini market, we have duty-free access to the larger GCC and Pan Arab Free Trade Area (PAFTA) markets, as well as duty-free access to the huge US market through a free trade agreement, which could have wide implications for Turkish businesses to take advantage of opportunities to manufacture products or provide services to the US from Bahrain.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>My December 2013 visit to Turkey, as the first Mexican President ever to make a state visit, marks the beginning of a new era in Turkish-Mexican relations, formalized by the Strategic Alliance for the 21st Century. This institutional framework will allow us to build upon our complementary development trajectories and strengthen our bilateral relations.</p><p>One of our primary objectives within the Strategic Alliance for the 21st Century is to increase bilateral trade and investment. While it is true that trade between our countries has increased over recent years, the total amount reached merely $785 million in 2012. Nonetheless, we are optimistic because the current context of our economies and our vast similarities allow for increased trade and investment. Firstly, our countries are strategically located within their respective regions, and are willing to serve as bridges between vast markets. Turkey is a vibrant, fast-growing economy, and Mexico now has an opportunity to benefit from this renewed relationship in order to expand and consolidate its economic presence in the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey is a vibrant, fast-growing economy, and Mexico now has an opportunity to benefit from this renewed relationship."</div><p>Similarly, Turkey has a new partner in America. Mexico is endowed with a highly skilled and growing work force, and it stands as one of the most open and dynamic economies in the world. We have a strong domestic market and a network of 10 free trade agreements with 45 countries. Furthermore, Mexico's position in the world's value chains makes our country an ideal base of operations to access the North American, Latin American, and Caribbean markets.</p><p>To take full advantage of these favorable conditions, Turkey and Mexico have signed important agreements to protect investments, avoid double taxation, launch direct air services, and promote tourism. For instance, ProMexico and Invest in Turkey, as well as Bancomext and Turk Eximbank, signed instruments to boost reciprocal trade and investment. As a firm believer in free trade, I reason that these innovative agreements will enhance development, promote sustainable growth, and create well-paying jobs in both countries.</p><p>Furthermore, Mexico is undergoing major structural transformations to become a more competitive nation. In order to unlock our country's full economic potential, my government has signed into law vital reforms to transform the education, telecommunications, finance, and energy sectors. These changes are the result of a major consensus building agreement among the country's main political parties. Through their implementation, we will promote productivity across sectors and enhance our economic growth. Indeed, the education reform will increase the quality of education by focusing on teachers' professional development and performance evaluation. The telecommunications reform will expand coverage, lower consumer prices, and improve the quality of digital services. As for finance reform, it will enable financial institutions to grant more loans at more favorable rates; small and medium-sized businesses will have the means to grow and prosper. The fiscal reform will guarantee sound public finances and promote growth by increasing public investment in infrastructure, education, research and development, and welfare services. And finally, the energy reform is crucial in increasing our energy security and economic growth, since it allows for more private investment in the energy sector, while guaranteeing Mexicans' ownership over their vast natural resources.</p><p>By allowing more open markets and leveling the playing field, we seek to increase productivity and ensure that companies operating in Mexico have access to strategic inputs. Mexico is also actively pursuing a complementary foreign policy strategy. In this context, I believe that both Turkey and Mexico must keep playing an active role internationally, as members of the G20 and MIKTA. Comprised of Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, Australia, and Mexico, MIKTA can serve as a common platform to exchange opinions, articulate shared policy strategies, and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations. Through increased cooperation, our emerging economies can play an increasing role in future global growth, as many analysts and investors already foresee.</p><p>For these reasons, my government will continue working closely with its Turkish counterpart to encourage forward-looking and innovative thinking, and identify areas of collaboration. We must translate our mutual interests into concrete business opportunities. After all, we have worked to strengthen our relationship and reaffirm the ties that bind our economies, cultures, and people toward a better future.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main milestones over the past few years?</h4><p>We've been around 20 years and we're still on top in terms of readership and circulation. We've also improved our portfolio of products.</p><h4>How do you think evolving technologies will affect your editorial in the near future?</h4><p>Online content is already an intrinsic part of the future and will continue to be so. We have to take into account that our readers are much more tech-savvy. The percentage of tablet, smartphone, and computer owners among our readership is a lot higher than you see in the readership of other magazines. So we have to take that into account and grow in that particular segment. We'll start charging for our online content some time in 2014, because that's the trend now. That being said, the paper edition won't disappear in the foreseeable future.</p><div class="quote">“Online content is already an intrinsic part of the future and will continue to be so."</div><h4>Through which platform do most of your readers access Portafolio?</h4><p>We've seen 45% growth in access through smartphones in the last year. That's where we've seen the biggest growth. We want to set up a platform where people will have access to some free content, after which they'll start paying for content, and that platform will be accessible through all digital means. How they access the content will ultimately be irrelevant to us, be it tablet, smartphone, or computer.</p><h4>What is your average reader profile?</h4><p>Male, 35-50 years old, with a university degree or higher. Our readers are mostly car owners, take vacations, go on international trips, are heavy technology users, are mainly bilingual, and follow other newspapers and journals, both Colombian and foreign. Our media customers tend to be younger, but generally there isn't much difference between those who read our print edition or online content.</p><h4>What has been the cause of your success?</h4><p>We try not to report the previous day's news. We open the newspaper with something that we believe will be in the news for the coming days, weeks, or months. So we try to look ahead. Secondly, we have a very strong analytical section with very good columnists and commentators who provide spirited editorial content. This gives us a good mix of both coverage and analysis.</p><h4>What is your competition like in Colombia?</h4><p>There's very good competition. La Republica is a very fine newspaper, well-designed and aggressive, although with a different focus than our newspaper. Dinero is also I believe very well written, although it is not really our competition because we are a daily. But overall, a newspaper needs good competition to stay ahead, stay on top of its game, and remain focused.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the freedom of the press in Colombia?</h4><p>If you work for large media groups in Colombia, you have full access. However, if you work for small regional papers or radio stations, you are subjected to threats and life is much harder than it is for us in the big cities, where we have access to big advertisers and have large circulations. It really depends on what part of the media you work in, and at what level. Compared with the rest of Latin America, I believe Colombia has a high degree of press freedom. Sadly, there is a trend toward an increased repression of the press in many countries, including Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, and Nicaragua. That, however, is not the case here.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Portafolio Awards?</h4><p>These awards were designed for people whose work benefits their community and society. Portafolio was founded when we had a much more closed economy. Our awards were a way of giving recognition and exposure to companies that did things a different way. Nowadays, it has become one of the most respected awards in the country.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the Colombian economy, and what do you think are the segments with the most potential for development?</h4><p>I believe our economy is in much better shape than Colombians think it is. For years we've been used to hearing promises of building this and doing that, but they would often just never happen, so we Colombians have always been naturally skeptical. But now, for the first time, I do believe we will be undertaking major infrastructural projects and public works. Not just roads and highways, but also bridges, railways, dams, and a whole range of other projects. In terms of the exchange rate, I think that when the US Federal Reserve takes the appropriate decision, it will alleviate the pressure on maintaining competitiveness and go toward solving this mild case of Dutch Disease that we've been experiencing for some years now. Overall, I think the Colombian economy will continue to expand, and as it does I believe our readership will also grow.</p><h4>Focusing on the ICT sector, do you see the opportunity for foreign investment?</h4><p>Yes I do. We've gone through our learning curve, and we've seen some interesting public sector development. Broadband accessibility has really improved in most of the country. I think a little more competition is needed, because we have high prices for broadband access that increased competition would fix. I have high hopes for the beginning of 4G in Colombia. Regulation is also getting better, the Comisión de Regulación de Telecomunicaciones (CRT) was very feeble for many years, but it is stronger and more active now, and that will be for the benefit of the sector. I also have my concerns, though, such as a recent ruling on the part of the Constitutional Court, which I think made a huge mistake that sends out the wrong signals. But overall, I see more entrepreneurship now. I see young people doing interesting things and being successful, and that will have a snowball effect.</p><h4>So what will Portafolio's role be in this climate of development in 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>We'll be doing what we always do in terms of content and reporting, and we'll be using the latest and most popular platforms in terms of reaching our audience, focusing more and more on innovation.</p><h4>What is the size of your operation?</h4><p>We're still growing. Revenue is up 12% so far in 2013. Circulation is stable. Our online readership is growing. We have one of the top five economic and business websites in the Spanish-speaking world. We have 25,000 subscribers, and employ 15 full-time journalists. Additionally, we share some services with El Tiempo, including reports, photographers, and correspondents.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Tecniseguros play in Grupo Futuro's overall activities and strategies?<br></h4><p>We are an insurance brokerage company, and we provide services to the other insurance companies of the Group, as well as other companies in the sector. Therefore, we are a very active player in the entire industry, with annual turnover of $110 million in premiums. In terms of the percentage contribution to the Group, our role has evolved over the years. At the beginning, we contributed the most to the company's portfolio in terms of production and distribution. Today, we still play a very important role in the generation of dividends for the Group.</p><h4>What is the state of development of the reinsurance industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>The percentage of reinsurance in Ecuador is actually high, because the capacity of local insurance companies to support such eventualities is rather low. For that reason, we have seen many investments from local and foreign companies in this segment. Today, I would say that both the insurance and the reinsurance sectors in Ecuador are very competitive, and the beneficiary of such competitiveness is the consumer. As Tecniseguros, we welcome such competition in the market, as it helps us become stronger. In this regard, I think the market will see positive and sustainable growth in the future, and we will witness a further increase of regulatory control from the main national body.</p><h4>Who are some of your main clients?</h4><p>Tecniseguros has a strong focus on the corporate segment of the market. In this regard, we have clients in a wide range of economic sectors such as oil, engineering, and construction. We provide cover for both large corporates and for SMEs. However, we have to keep in mind that public works projects have driven the growth of the sector over the last few years, and we cannot access that segment. In addition, the health and individual insurance segments will assist the growth of the sector in the near future, as trends have already shown in the last couple of years. In this context, Tecniseguros has, in many cases, taken the lead in terms of innovation in the industry. Currently, corporate companies represent 80% of our client portfolio, whereas the remaining 20% are individuals. Our main future strategy is to attack this segment to further grow our presence in the market.</p><div class="quote">“Currently, corporate companies represent 80% of our client portfolio, whereas the remaining 20% are individuals."</div><h4>What is your business strategy to maintain your leading position in the market?</h4><p>Being the market leader for over three decades now is very difficult and demanding. Our main challenge is to maintain such a leading position in the future, for, we have been the reference company in the sector. We believe we have plenty of opportunities to do so by further expanding our presence in the individual insurance segment. Our aim is to provide services and products to each Ecuadorean family. At the same time, we have to keep up our hard work in the corporate segment and for SMEs. We have done much to professionalize the industry by investing considerable time and money in training professionals. We will continue to do so, as for our most valuable asset is our human capital.</p><h4>What is your general outlook on the insurance industry for the future?</h4><p>The insurance industry has considerably evolved over the last two decades, and consumers have become more aware of their needs and the availability of products. For that reason, we have seen a specialization process among insurance companies in order to better grab market share. Competition has increased, causing positive outcomes, and that has contributed to better manage the risks of our customers. In other words, we had to become better counselors for them. The increasing purchasing power and the large amounts of investment injected by the government have created many opportunities for the industry. That has and will continue to drive the expansion of the sector. The growth of the industry has been supported by an increase in the sale of cars and the fact that finance institutions have incorporated and promoted insurance activities. This will also increase the sale of insurance as the per capita consumption in Ecuador is low compared to countries like Colombia and Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Ecuador realize its mining potential over the medium term?</h4><p>Traditionally, Ecuador has focused on exploiting the oil industry. Five years ago, we also prioritized the development of such strategic sectors as mining, boosted by high mineral prices around the world and investors that looked at Ecuador as a key investment destination within the mining industry. We see the mining sector as a key industry in changinge the energy matrix of the country and further creating a competitive economy in Ecuador at the international level. Today, the mining industry still plays a minor role in the country's economy—2.5% of GDP as compared to 14% for the oil industry—and that is why we have yet to fully exploit the potential of the mining sector, which is still focused on the small scale. Due to the high prices of minerals in international markets, and the rising interest in investing in the Ecuadorean mining sector, we currently have five ongoing strategic projects that we believe can give the sector the push it needs and develop rural areas of our country. In addition, we have an additional 20 junior projects that are small to medium scale in size but require high levels of investment to exploit their reserves. The government is to update the mining regulatory framework to facilitate the development of these projects, and we expect to see results in the short to medium term. Right now, the sector is structured according to a technical categorization; artisanal mining, mines with production limits, and large-scale mines. We are in the process of adding a new category, medium-scale projects, which is the key element to boost productive activity in the sector, as well as provide more room for development and production in the small-scale mines. Small- and medium-scale mining projects don't need a 25-year contract and can start producing immediately. A better categorization, which will be accompanied by clearer rules of the game, will be beneficial to the development of the entire sector, from small-scale projects to the largest ones.</p><h4>What roles does the National Mining Company (ENAMI) play in the development of the mining sector?</h4><p>Constitutionally, natural resources are preferably exploited by the government through either public companies or so-called mixed economy. Ecuador is still in the first stages of developing its mining industry, and we believe that it is not the best option for a public company to get involved in projects that require large amounts of capital with high risk levels. In this context, we set up ENAMI some two to three years ago. Today, this company already has an attractive exploration and operating portfolio, and when it comes to large-scale projects, its main priority is to seek partnerships at the international level. In future, we see ENAMI as an institution capable of handling and operating large-scale projects.</p><h4>What are the main ongoing projects regarding oil refining for the short to medium term in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador has three oil refineries: two very small, old and outdated plants, and one medium-sized refinery. They have an overall processing capacity of 175,000 barrels per day at the moment. The level of technology in these refineries is rather low and the output does not suit the country's current needs. In addition, Ecuador imports oil-related goods worth $4 billion a year, which poses a high risk to our economy. For these reasons, President Correa decided to develop a new project, the Pacific Refinery, to change this situation and become an exporting economy in terms of oil-related products. We have completed the engineering works after redesigning the project. We envisaged a refinery plant with an initial processing capacity of 200,000 barrels to be expanded to 300,000 barrels in the second phase. Right now, we are holding talks with several companies to secure the financial resources to develop the project, and we expect to close a deal very soon with Chinese company CNPC, which would enter the project as a partner and stakeholder owning 30% of the company; 51% would belong to Petroecuador, and the remaining 19% to Pedevesa. We hope to close a funding agreement with the  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China based on 70% financing and 30% equity.</p><div class="quote">“Natural resources are preferably exploited by the government through either public companies or the so-called mixed economy."</div><h4>What does Ecuador need to maximize its potential in non-renewable natural resources?</h4><p>We need to launch more extensive and in-depth exploration and exploitation campaigns in both the oil and mining sectors. In the case of the latter, I think the key would be to conduct geological reports and studies across the country, which would give us a better picture of the country's future potential in the field. In terms of oil exploration, I think there is room to expand activities in the country without entering territory within the national parks of Ecuador. The new tender process is vital for the future of the industry. In this context, we have a clear strategy to diversify financial resources for the industry in order to attract more foreign investment and combine it with public capital. We also need to apply the highest international standards and technologies in these two strategic sectors through international partnerships and agreements. In addition, we increasingly promote the use of clean energies to produce electricity as well as in other productive activities in the energy sector.</p><h4>What role can the Gulf of Guayaquil play to attract more investment?</h4><p>We already have several companies conducting exploration works in the area, and we believe that in the near future we will see further developments in terms of production. I believe that Petroecuador could soon look for potential partners to carry out both exploration and exploitation activities. In this context, we have a proposal from Gazprom to come to Ecuador to develop exploration activities in the gas industry, and we will also tender some areas of the Gulf of Guayaquil very soon.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the oil industry in Ecuador for the short to medium term?</h4><p>The tendering process will bring new contracting models under tariff structures. Although we know the first round could be the hardest one, around 50% of the area already has exploration proposals. I believe that in three to four tendering rounds, we could cover the entire area. Such contract models have already been applied in countries like Iraq, Angola, and Mexico. In this context, cooperation and technological transfer between the public and private sectors are key to further boosting activity in the sector. For example, recovering techniques must be improved through new and more advanced technology and methods. In addition, by boosting capital investment, we will be able to improve production and recovery figures. We think we can double production figures and the proven reserves in the country. Ecuador welcomes international companies to come to our country and invest in the oil industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Petroamazonas EP contributed to the success story of Ecuador?</h4><p>Petroamazonas has been exponentially growing since it was established in 2006. We have gone from producing 88,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) to around 320,000 bbl/d at the moment. In 2013, we expect to close the year with 325,000 bbl/d. After several business agreements, our company currently manages 65% of the overall oil production in Ecuador, and we are the main company managing Ecuador's oil strategy. We have to keep in mind that about 30% of the country's budget comes from oil production, which means that we are a key player in the national economy, and, therefore, we play a vital role in the development of the country.</p><h4>What is your expected investment for 2013?</h4><p>We have a $3.2 billion investment budget for 2013; this is very indicative of the level of investment we dedicate every year to consolidate and increase oil production in Ecuador. Part of the budget is designated to explore new potential oil fields that will enable Ecuador to increase its oil reserves. At the same time, we will conduct more perforation and facilities installation work in 2013 in order to keep up the oil production figures of recent years. In other respects, we have operative expenses of around $1.2 billion.</p><h4>How many fields does the company currently operate?</h4><p>We have 13 oil fields in eastern Ecuador, plus three other fields on the coast as well as natural gas operations in the Amistad field, in the Gulf of Guayaquil.</p><h4>What roles does Petroamazonas play in the development of the Pacific Refinery project, and what will be the impact of the project in the industry?</h4><p>The main activity of Petroamazonas is exploration and production work in oil fields, and, therefore, we expect to become the main supplier of the new refinery plant. In this context, the main future developments are focused on opening potential oil fields in mid-2013. We have been working very hard to put together a very ambitious team with other investors in order to present attractive and ambitious proposals for the Southeastern blocks to the Hydrocarbons Secretary. Petroamazonas definitely thinks it can play a key role in the future development of the industry in the country. We foresee these processes as very relevant for the company's activity and the expansion of our business presence in the industry.</p><h4>What role can neighboring countries play in Petroamazonas' future growth strategy?</h4><p>We are a relatively young company and, therefore, our focus has been on consolidating our presence in Ecuador. In fact, this has been a period of large and sustainable growth, which made us pay special attention to our business structure. However, we have already approached some neighboring oil companies in the region, as it is the next natural step in our growth, and we have held positive conversations with companies such as Ecopetrol, Petroperu, and Enap, among others. We believe that we will become stronger as we start consolidating formal and business partnerships with other oil companies, both public and private, in other countries. We think that in the short to medium term we could enter foreign markets.</p><h4>What challenges does the oil industry face in Ecuador to maintaining its development?</h4><p>In our opinion, there are several challenges facing our operations and the industry in the country. These include maintaining sustainable oil production levels in existent fields, optimizing resources and production levels in Ecuador, performing enhanced oil recovery works in mature fields using the most up-to-date technology, and strengthening exploration works. This would enable Petroamazonas to expand its operations and the country to increase its oil reserves. We have been a pioneering company in terms of applying new technologies in the sector and we will continue doing so. Also, another challenge for the company is its internationalization over the medium term, which is something we are already working on. Today, our company is already internationally recognized, and we want to expand our presence abroad.</p><h4>How would you assess the future development of the oil industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>The oil industry plays a very important role in the national economy and will keep doing so in the near future. However, the government is increasing its efforts to diversify the economy by boosting industrial activity and promoting a change in the energy matrix. I believe the national economic panorama will gradually change in Ecuador; however, the oil industry will continue to play a key role overall. In this context, we will see a further technology advance in the industry and the national economy.</p><h4>What is the size of your workforce at the moment?</h4><p>In December 2012, we had 1,500 employees; however, once we finally took over Petroproducción's activity, we increased that figure to around 5,000 people. Overall, I believe we are one of the largest employers in the country.</p><h4>Is it easy to find a qualified workforce for the industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>It is hard to find a technical and qualified work force for the industry not only in Ecuador, but worldwide. The current demand for qualified workers at the international level is very high, and Ecuador is no exception in this context. We are working on training new, young professionals to face the future of the industry.</p><h4>How does Petroamazonas engage with local communities in the regions where it operates?</h4><p>Since our first day of operations, we have implemented social and community programs with local communities that are directly related to the areas where we operate. These programs offer support to local communities from different perspectives such as health, education, economic, and social welfare. In this context, we have to praise the government's effort, which is dedicating 12% of the industry surplus to the development of local communities.</p><h4>Could you describe your business relationship with Petroecuador?</h4><p>In 2011, we started a process of upgrading the systems and processes of the national oil companies. That initiative led to an in-depth report on both companies, which concluded that it would be better for one company to focus its activities on the upstream segment, and the other one on the downstream. Petroamazonas was named the company with the highest levels of technology in its systems and processes of infrastructure, as well as the enterprise with the most integrated and stable management system in order to take over Petroecuador's upstream activities. Overall, we have absorbed the business activities of four public companies already. So far, we have been in charge of Petroecuador's activities for several months, and we are pleased with the results. However, there is still a lot of work to do.</p><h4>What steps should the government take for the further development of the energy industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>Petroamazonas only executes oil policies adopted by the government, and we do not take part in the decision-making process. In this context, we follow the guidelines drawn up by the government, which aims at repowering the oil and energy industry so it can be the basis on which the country sustains its diversification and development in all sectors. I believe that is the right decision and the government has intelligently proven that it knows how to manage the economic resources of our industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your general outlook for Ecuador and the oil and gas industry for 2013?<br></h4><p>Within the difficult economic context at the international level, in which the EU and US economies are having problems restarting, Latin America represents a positive island. Overall, Latin America is growing faster than its peers as well as representing large consumer markets of its own. In particular, Ecuador offers many opportunities because it has numerous national sectors that have yet to be fully exploited and others that have room for further development. Therefore, the country holds unique economic potential. In terms of its oil and gas sector, I think that Latin America is rapidly developing. The new contracts provided much needed stability to the sector by laying down the foundations for the development of the industry, especially in terms of equipment and infrastructure. At the same time, I think that in 2013 we will see new developments thanks to the tendering processes that took place in 2012, which were set to be awarded in the second half of 2013. We have to keep in mind that the oil and gas industry is key for the Ecuadorean economy. Therefore, Repsol plays a very important role in the development of the sector, and we are open to further involving ourselves in different fields of the industry.</p><h4>What are Repsol's current production figures in Ecuador?</h4><p>At the moment, we produce 45,000 barrels a day, about 5,000 barrels more than expected due to the recent addition of a well in the AMO area in Block 16 of the Amazon region. In the future, we might increase our production figures depending on the declaration of the tendering processes. Such decisions will clearly mark the future developments of the company, and we will focus our business strategy according to those resolutions in the latter part of 2013.</p><h4>What are some of the main activities Repsol currently implements in terms of social responsibility?</h4><p>We have been developing a collaboration agreement for the last two decades with the communities that are close to our in-field operations. Overall, I would describe those relationships as perfect and long lasting. We are fully aware of their concerns and needs, and that is why Repsol does everything it can to make sure that we contribute to community development.</p><h4>How was Repsol's performance in 2012, and what are the company's priorities for the next few years?</h4><p>We signed a national contract in 2010, which will expire in 2018. Therefore, at the moment our activities are framed in that agreement. We committed ourselves to investing around $300 million, and I have to say that in only two years we have already invested $180 million. However, we are currently holding talks with the government to look into ways to expand our collaboration until 2021 and further invest in our activities around the production area.</p><h4>What are some of the greatest opportunities the oil and gas sector offers to international investors?</h4><p>For foreign companies aiming to establish operations in Ecuador, the current legal framework provides the best tools to sign business agreements with national companies in order to start operating in the country. Ecuador is a country of opportunities, and in terms of the oil and gas industry, the current potential within the fields that are being exploited. I have to say that the national companies here in Ecuador are very willing to cooperate with their foreign counterparts as a way of contributing to the transfer of knowledge, expertise, and technology. Business partnerships are always win-win situations for all the parties involved.</p><h4>Who are the main partners of Repsol in Ecuador?</h4><p>Currently, Repsol operates in Ecuador's Block 16 and the Tivacuno oil field, and these contracts expire in 2018. We hold a 35% share in the consortium operating the blocks, and we are the operator. Our other partners are China's Tiptop Energy Ltd, a subsidiary of Sinopec, with 20%; Taiwan's Opic, with 31%; and China's Sinochem, with 14%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-affiliate-with-me]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have led to your ongoing success in Saudi Arabia, especially over the recent past?</h4><p>I became CEO of the Saudi Investment Bank (SAIB) in mid-2009, and in January 2010 the bank implemented a new five-year strategy; by 2013 that plan is almost 100% complete. Thankfully, we have already achieved 100% of the strategy in 80% of the time. We will now establish a strategy to focus on growth in all areas of banking: investment, retail, and corporate, in addition to growth through our subsidiaries. We are covering all financing businesses of the bank through our affiliates, and we will capitalize on the cross selling of products between our customers and affiliates. In addition, we are focusing heavily on the retail segment. The bank used to be mostly corporate with a small amount of retail, but in the last five years we have grown our retail market share to a good size in terms of the percentage of our portfolio. If you look at our numbers in the first three quarters of 2013, we have optimized our balance sheet and we will continue to penetrate and gain a larger market share. We expect SAIB to be one of the top-five banks in terms of equity, as well as one of the best banks for both customer retail and corporate banking. We are investing more in technology as we want to reach out to customers in new and innovative ways.</p><h4>Who are your main shareholders?</h4><p>We have two major government institutions, GOSI, and the Public Pension Agency. We also have several foreign shareholders such as JP Morgan and Mizuho Bank of Japan. However, they are not represented on the board. This is a completely Saudi company.</p><div class="quote">“I think the measurement of an institution depends on the size and quality of returns for shareholders."</div><h4>How did you select the joint ventures you have brought into Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The strategy set before I became CEO was that when the bank made the decision to enter the credit card market, it wanted the best name and the best shareholder. The chosen brand was American Express, even though we started to offer our own Visa and MasterCard credit card options at the bank. In terms of leasing, instead of having it in the bank as a department, it is better to have a partner with a shareholder who has the know-how, the platform, and the name; that is why we went with ORIX. In insurance, instead of offering our own insurance, we have MedGulf, one of the biggest companies for insurance. Alistithmar Capital is a spinoff of our investment and brokerage subsidiary. Instead of doing the leasing or development for the housing or real estate market, we do it with a good shareholder; that is why we work with Amlak International. It is a good strategy, and now it represents more than 15%-16% of the banked income from our affiliates and subsidiaries.</p><h4>How do you plan to take advantage of your sharia-compliant banking arm?</h4><p>We are going to continue as we are; we are not going to convert to become an Islamic bank. What we are doing is the right strategy for this stage. We can offer both conventional and sharia products as the customer needs; we are flexible in that way. We offer sharia and conventional banking for both our retail and corporate clients. We will continue to grow in both sectors based on the needs of our customers.</p><h4>Your ratings have been reaffirmed recently. What does that mean and what do you expect going forward in the next few years?</h4><p>The rating agencies have indicated that this bank is financially solid, providing good profitability and impressive returns. This was a recent rating, but we have been rated by the agencies for the last six or seven years. Our shareholders have an outside indication that the bank is going in the right direction. The positive points in these reports are good indications. There are 10 banks rated in Saudi Arabia out of the 12 local banks. They have been grouped into three types because the rating also takes into account market share, so the top three banks have been grouped into one, then the three mid€sized ones, then the remaining smaller banks. I do not expect we will be upgraded significantly unless we grow our market share further.</p><h4>What are your goals for the bank in the next five years?</h4><p>I think the measurement of an institution depends on the size and quality of returns for shareholders. For the finance industry, it is the return on an average assets (ROAA). We want to maintain one of the highest returns on average equity (ROAE) and ROAA levels. We can achieve that with a good capital adequacy ratio (CAR). We also want to maintain our efficiency ratio to be a good percentage. We want to be an efficient bank. If we achieve these aims, there are many other initiatives that should lead to success. We are always taking the necessary risks to ensure our success.</p><h4>How do you see the financial market in Saudi Arabia evolving over the medium term? </h4><p>GDP growth for Saudi Arabia is going to be in the 4.5%-5% range for 2014. This is good for us. Over the last five years, the Saudi banks have experienced double-digit growth in their balance sheets, meaning the banks are growing faster than GDP, which is a good indication. Government spending, GDP growth, and oil prices are going to be in this range, so that is a good indicator that the market will be positive for the banking industry.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Hispana de Seguros built up its local business operations?<br></h4><p>Our business strategy is based on strong, client-oriented products with suitable marketing, giving us a necessary advantage in the Ecuadorean insurance sector. This sector is very competitive; today, there are over 40 active companies in the country. Despite the intense competition, Hispana de Seguros, a company that was started from scratch, has achieved a high level of success in the Ecuadorean market. Thanks to our aggressive strategy, we have positioned the brand and our products in the market and we are now among the leading insurance companies in niche markets such as Guayaquil within the automotive insurance segment. We have also expanded our branch network and, at the moment, we have a presence in the main cities of the country, including Quito, Guayaquil, Loja, Machala, Santo Domingo, and Cuenca. Hispana de Seguros has always prioritized the provision of value-added products and services to its clients at the national level.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2013?</h4><p>We expect 2013 to be very important for us in terms of direct sales to customers; we have put a great emphasis on expanding our client portfolio through the expansion of our sales staff and the implementation of other strategies such as call centers. This strategy has enabled us to better address the needs of the market and facilitate direct communication with clients. Overall, we expect the sector to continue growing, given that the purchasing power of Ecuadoreans is increasing and penetration rates of insurance products in many segments are continuously growing. We expect to close the year with a 12% growth rate—an aggressive figure, but consistent with our background.</p><h4>What is the breakdown between individual and corporate customers in your client portfolio?</h4><p>Our current client portfolio has over 15,300 clients, of which 13,300, or around 87%, are individuals. It also includes 1,500 private companies, or 10% of the entire portfolio, while 3%, or 500 companies, are public entities. This gives us a tremendous diversification in terms of client base and business production, reducing our dependence on any client or entity. It also mitigates risks due to the diverse location, activity, and business of our clients.</p><div class="quote">“Our current client portfolio has over 15,300 clients, of which 13,300, or around 87%, are individuals."</div><h4>How would you assess the state of development of the insurance sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>The economic and social expansion of the Ecuadorean middle class has positively impacted the development of the sector in the country. The penetration of the insurance sector has grown along with this middle class and, as a result, it has generated many opportunities for all players in the market. In this regard, our strategy is focused on generating the greatest value-added services to this population segment. The Ecuadorean insurance sector is very competitive and consumers also look for competitive prices. The company's niche has always been to offer competitive price and value-added products, and we can proudly say that we have achieved significant growth in this market. Looking forward, I think the Ecuadorean insurance sector holds a very attractive and promising future and there are opportunities to grow in all the segments of the industry, provided that companies have a very well structured strategy.</p><h4>What are some of your key goals?</h4><p>We want to continue being consistent in our business approach, as we believe that efficiency has to be among our top priorities. In this context, it is important to keep informing consumers about our activity and services. For 2013, we plan to expand our presence in the banking insurance segment, while continuing to be a very innovative company in terms of products as well as adding value to our services. For example, Hispana de Seguros is continuously complementing its offering in the automotive segment, as we believe this is the way to expand our presence there. At the moment, we do not have plans to expand our branch network, given that we have more than adequately coverage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role is the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) playing in the economic transformation of Ecuador?<br></h4><p>First of all, we have to mention that the BCE, as compared to its counterparts in other countries, is not an independent institution and we have chosen to play an economic development role as a central banking institution. According to the constitution of Ecuador, we are a financial institution responsible for the monetary, credit, and financial policies of our country. Overall, the BCE is solely responsible for managing the aggregate liquidity and the payment systems in the country, both public and private. In addition, we also manage the public central securities deposit, macroeconomic statistics, the regulatory framework of the finance sector, the administration of foreign exchange reserves, and the monitoring of public debt levels. Last but not least, the BCE also plays a very important role in expanding finance penetration rates and modernizing payment systems in Ecuador.<br></p><h4>How is the BCE strategically tackling financial integration in Ecuadorean society?</h4><p>We are the main institution responsible for this ambitious strategy. However, we work closely with several other institutions to achieve our strategic goals. Basically, we are modernizing the tools for the promotion of this financial integration.</p><h4>What is the BCE's interest rate strategy for the upcoming period?</h4><p>The BCE is the institution in charge of setting the maximum interest rate that can be paid, and we implemented a very ambitious strategy to lower these rates in 2009 and 2010. In this context, in 2010, we introduced some changes, for the BCE has to maintain rates at a reasonable level to keep the economy growing at a good pace, encourage the productive system, and ensure economic soundness for the country. It is important to note that in the last few years we have implemented several changes and reforms in the financial sector around rates and commissions, while keeping in mind the need to safeguard the development of the national economy. For example, we implemented the liquidity pool to make sure banks in Ecuador have a sufficient availability of financial resources, deposit guarantees, and stricter control of the inflow and outflow of dollars in the country. This is a much-needed measure for a dollarized economy like ours, which does not have its own currency, and in which consumers have traditionally opted to make savings deposits abroad. Ecuador today enjoys the highest liquidity levels in its history—around $15 billion, which is 15% to 16% above GDP. In addition, we repatriated a large amount of savings that Ecuador had abroad, and we are channeling it through public banking to fund the country's development.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador today enjoys the highest liquidity levels in its history—around $15 billion, which is 15% to 16% above GDP."</div><h4>How would you assess the development of the trade balance in Ecuador over the next few years?</h4><p>The trade balance is the main structural challenge for Ecuador and we have to tackle it; the government of Ecuador has already stated its strategic goal to change the country's productive structure and that would enable the country to shift its trade flows. Measures adopted in recent years to tackle the country's dependency on the oil industry have enabled us to be in a better position today and say that the weight of oil in our economy has to be put into context. Its relative significance is decreasing thanks to, for example, the increase in tax and other such incomes. The best example is that Ecuador avoided recession for the last few years, despite low growth in developed countries, and that we closed 2012 on 5% growth, estimating that we will close 2013 on around 4% growth. We also know that the trade balance deficit in non-oil products is significant, and our main goal is to reverse this trend. We started posting positive results in 2012. The main way to address this challenge is to change the productive structure of the country in the short to medium term; the government is committed to bringing in such changes and we are doing all that we can to contribute to this goal.</p><h4>How would you assess the business climate for foreign investors in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador is a very attractive investment destination. Factors supporting this include stable interest tax management, robust growth, increasing purchasing power, the lowering of the unemployment rate, and a sound and stable economy. The regulatory and tax frameworks are very much favorable for the establishment of new investments. The government also introduced the Law on Regulation and Market Power, which is essential to attracting foreign investment. Ecuador is not a risky destination, and the most important thing is that we have a long-term vision. Over the last few years we have improved the quality and level of productive and logistics infrastructure across the country. In addition, the country is putting a lot of emphasis—more than any other regional country in terms of population—on enhancing its human capital through scholarships and the strengthening of the higher education sector, as well as the IT and research industries. We believe that these items are key in the transformation of the country and its economy. Finally, Ecuador has considerably reduced poverty levels and we have a bright future ahead, with the government leading the transformation from all points of view and encouraging the arrival of foreign investment. It is a rather small country that nevertheless aims very high, despite the challenges ahead. Ecuador is in a constant transformation and we are on the right path to achieve success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In a time of important political reforms in Mexico, how does lobbying ensure that all actors of the various sectors benefit from them?</h4><p>It's not so much about benefiting from the reforms as it is being a part of those reforms and having a voice and the possibility to express your point of view. The final decision is always in the hands of the authorities and the legislature. As lobbyists we have to be very respectful of that. The most important aspect of the lobbying process is to provide the right information for those key actors. When a country is changing, it may not be possible to have a say in some of the decisions. If you have a say in them then you have the possibility of helping to change or shift policy. That is why lobbying is so important, and such a good instrument, and if an industry understands the importance of lobbying, it has a timely say with the correct information. Otherwise, is too late for the company to have that discussion, and is unable to make proper use of the tool.</p><h4>What are the parameters of lobbying in Mexico? When should foreign investors resort to a lobbying firm, and what can they expect?</h4><p>We recommend being proactive. Always lobby proactively, and lobby broadly over a long period of time. Reactive lobbying is insufficient, as you're always late to the table and unable to effectively deliver your message. It's best not to convey your message in a crisis situation. I always tell my clients that in-house lobbying in your firm is always as important as your lawyer, your accountant, or your marketing or finance chief. You have to have that assessment all the time when you're making a decision or an investment. If you don't understand the politics, laws, and fiscal scheme of the place you're investing in, then you're in trouble.</p><div class="quote">“If an industry understands the importance of lobbying, it has a timely say with the correct information."</div><h4>What is PROCAB's role in promoting lobbying in Mexico?</h4><p>The National Association of Professional Lobbying (PROCAB) is an association with different committees in which we discuss the way we work and the way we should work, as well as our code of ethics, how to transmit our messages regarding lobbying in Mexico, how to be an efficient interlocutor, and how to propose good regulations that work.</p><h4>Corruption remains an important challenge for Mexico, but at the same time there are increasing efforts aimed at formalizing activities like lobbying. In such a context, how is lobbying perceived and how do you think you can improve the public awareness and perceptions of lobbying?</h4><p>Perception is everything in this sector, and we have to do things correctly. My company was investigated for over a year to see if we had any ties to corruption. Only after that yearlong investigation were the government, politicians, and statesmen ready to work with me. In this line of work it takes just one mistake to end your business. It's a thin line often, but you have to determine where that line is and never cross it. Once you have the reputation of stability in that regard, nobody will ever propose anything irregular again; it will never come up again in conversation. I've been doing this for many years, and I've never been offered any illegal incentives to vote a certain way. The good thing about the Mexican Congress today is that there are so many parties that nobody can guarantee a successful vote. It makes Congress incorrigible in a way.</p><h4>You represent a large portfolio of clients from many different sectors. Which sectors do you think have the greatest need for lobbying?</h4><p>Insurance companies are always on the minds of policy makers, and so are always important clients. Being highly regulated they always have to keep abreast of legislative developments concerning their sector. The food industry is also on the minds of policy makers, not only due to the obesity issue, but also from a taxation perspective. The wine and liquor industry is another in need of lobbying worldwide. Overall, every industry and every sector is subject to rules and regulations that affect its constituent companies and players. Lobbying is an important resource for all these industries and sectors. Taking part in the making of national laws is rewarding. Through lobbying, we are looking out for an entire industry's interests, and having our efforts come to fruition for the benefit of the people we represent makes it all worthwhile.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the government's policies and the strategies of the Tanzania Airport Authority (TAA) helped with the current boom in Tanzanian airports?</h4><p>We operate according to the National Transport Policy of 2003, which is currently under revision. We also operate to a five-year plan. These are the factors contributing to the preparation of our strategic plans. Finally, we are guided by Vision 2025. Tanzania has 385 airfields and airports. The TAA manages 60 of them, and these account for 90% of total air traffic, with the exception of Zanzibar; when combined with Zanzibar, the figure rises to 99%. The National Transport Policy states that in each of the country's 30 regions, a regional airport should have the capacity to handle an aircraft of 70-100 passengers. Every city in this country requires an airport that can cater for aircraft capacity of 100-150 passengers. And as we border seven countries, each border region should have an airport that can handle 150-passenger planes. We also have international airports at Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar, and plan to upgrade Mwanza and Mbeya Songwe to that level. By 2018, we should have five international airports, including Dar es Salaam. And due to the discovery of energy and gas resources, there is also the likelihood of Mtwara being developed and expanded.</p><h4>Just how central is airport infrastructure for Tanzania's future?</h4><p>It is very simple. I have always believed that employers and investors fly, rather than drive. Therefore, if an investor from abroad visits Dar es Salaam and needs to fly to Mtwara the next day, there must be an airport to enable this. In short, decision makers fly. Our own executives also need to travel efficiently. Within the country, they may need to transport their goods from one point to another, which cannot efficiently be done by rail or road. Another important factor in developing the aviation industry is tourism. We cannot expect a tourist to fly from Europe, and then ride a bus for 12 hours just to visit an attraction. We have to build up our air infrastructure to facilitate their stay. Once you develop air transportation, you fully open up your country. As a good example of this development, Dar es Salaam airport is growing at a rate of 16% per year, while Mtwara is growing at 30%, and Mwanza at 40% in step with the mining industry.</p><div class="quote">“In terms of passenger numbers, I foresee a doubling from the current 4 million to 8 million passengers annually."</div><h4>Could you describe the Terminal 3 project at Dar es Salaam Airport and it's financing?</h4><p>The project is being developed using the export credit agency model. Following the 2008 crisis, an opportunity arose to trigger growth again; we acted on this. How the scheme works is that you work with a country, which guarantees it, and then you borrow from one of the major banks, and complete the project. In our case, the Netherlands and the UK have guaranteed our loans. Of the related financing, 50% came from these two countries, via a mutually beneficial agreement.</p><h4>What other projects does TAA have in the pipeline?</h4><p>In Mtwara, there is a project ready for private sector involvement, as indeed there are in Mwanza, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Songwe. We will have a better sense of what type of investment is most appropriate in light of a current study being conducted by Nathan Associates.</p><h4>What challenges exist for the TAA in Tanzania?</h4><p>Flying is still often seen as a rather elite mode of transportation, and its importance is still overlooked by some. There is currently a degree of political will to develop the industry in Tanzania, but when you compare it to other forms of transportation, such as rail and shipping, it is not considered to be of equal importance. Statistically speaking though, $1 invested in air transportation brings a return of $12. This is definitely not the case with rail. In Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Dubai, we clearly note how airports have transformed their cities. Another obstacle to overcome is the cultural reaction against private sector control over utilities, although I think that this mindset can be changed. I am a big believer in private sector participation, which is why I had opted for a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract for Terminal 3, although I faced considerable hostility toward this idea. We need only look to Hong Kong or Dubai to realize that private sector ownership is not the issue, so long as the airport concerned is a good one. Unfortunately, I did not win the support I needed from my colleagues, which is why we changed to an enterprise collaboration architecture (ECA) model.</p><h4>In terms of investors, airports, airfields, and aircraft, where do you see the country in five years time?</h4><p>Within five years, all regional airports will have sufficient lighting systems to allow for flights 24 hours a day. Our international airports will also be able to cater to any of the world's largest aircraft. Currently, we are only connected to Europe by one daily flight of KLM. We should have at least five airlines connecting us with Europe, and Turkish Airlines will hopefully soon be one of them. For the Middle East, we are well covered in terms of Dubai and Qatar. I expect to see intercontinental flights from Dar es Salaam to Europe and North America before too long. In terms of passenger numbers, I foresee a doubling from the current 4 million to 8 million passengers annually. I would predict no less that 12 million within the next decade.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2009, the World Bank named Invest in Bogotá the top investment agency among emerging economies. What did this international recognition mean to you and your work?</h4><p>The award acknowledged our efforts to realize our main goal of contributing to the development and attraction of FDI into the city's economy. Our role includes involving social and private agents in boosting investment in the city, while maintaining a methodology that allows us to establish the strategic sectors for the development of the city and carry out intensive research in foreign markets to attract companies to Bogotá. In fact, much of the business activity we have attracted came directly through such initiatives. The rest came from other channels, such as our website.</p><h4>How would you assess Bogotá's competitiveness and the incentives that exist to attract FDI?</h4><p>In the World Bank's Doing Business report, Bogotá climbed from 12th position to third last year for competitiveness, consolidating our work and the commitment of the city to increasing the level of competitiveness every year. We have to keep in mind that these rankings take into consideration a wide variety of elements ranging from legal stability to ease of obtaining permits and public services. Currently, Bogotá is among the top eight cities in Latin America in terms of attracting foreign investment and doing business, and our goal is to rank among the top five.</p><div class="quote">“Sectors evolve and Bogotá is currently seeking its true vocation as a city."</div><h4>Which of the economic sectors offer the greatest opportunities?</h4><p>Sectors evolve and Bogotá is currently seeking its true vocation as a city; we put much emphasis on the services industry, which, along with commerce, represents 75% of the city's GDP—without commerce the percentage is about 62%. In terms of services, our priorities are related to IT, the oil and gas industry, services that generate value-added, and creative industries, among others. For example, Bogotá currently invests considerably in new technologies applied to public transportation and is in the lead at the regional level in the implementation of a sustainable and environmentally friendly public transport system.</p><h4>How does Bogotá benefit from growth of the oil and gas sector at the national level?</h4><p>This is definitely a sector that has been very important for our agency; we have taken part in several international oil and gas events in Aberdeen, Houston, and other cities. The importance, for example, of being in Aberdeen, Europe's oil capital, is that the UK is the second top investor in the Colombian oil industry, and such events allow us direct contact with other international players in the industry, such as Australia and Germany. Our role is to attract them to Bogotá and ease their landing in the city and the country in general.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the city's workforce?</h4><p>Bogotá has the largest number of higher education institutions (115) in Colombia, and approximately 100,000 people become part of the qualified workforce every year in this city. Additionally, 55% of the country's PhDs are earned in Bogotá, and 30% of those 100,000 people graduate here. Therefore, Bogotá is a highly attractive city for new companies in any sector that requires qualified employees. One of the challenges is to strengthen the education sector in terms of orientating it toward the future industrial needs of the city such as IT and the need for international standards for those earning qualifications in this field. In this context, we work closely with the private sector to organize so-called “employment roundtables." For example, we think that business process outsourcing (BPO) is a sector with much potential in the city, and we pursue activities that identify human capital for this sector. Moreover, we need to reinforce value-added within the city's human capital in terms of new technologies.</p><h4>What is the potential of Bogotá as a regional hub for the food and agribusiness industry?</h4><p>In this sector the potential lies in the region of Cundinamarca, which surrounds Bogotá. We approach it as a city-region. We implement strategies that identify the strategic sectors at the regional level, of which this is one. In this context, Dole Food, the fruit and vegetable multinational, has announced the biggest investment in the Colombian agribusiness industry of the past five years; an $18 million processing plant that will directly employ 80 people. Therefore, we work on building Bogotá's profile of a regional hub, and on underlining its international profile to globalize the industry and its logistics capacity—Bogotá's airport handles the largest volume of cargo in South America.</p><h4>What role can biotechnology play in the further economic expansion of the city?</h4><p>Bogotá's main features are entrepreneurship, top-quality higher education institutions, and innovation—we are the fifth most innovative city in Latin America. At the end of 2013, we hosted the first Latin American biotechnology event that brought together over 200,000 specialists from this sector. Biotechnology's main characteristic is its transversal impact; it can apply to food and agribusiness industries, as well as to the health sector. There have been some investments and initiatives in this sector not only in Bogotá, but also in Colombia, and we want to channel those efforts through the city and position Bogotá as a regional hub, while creating synergies with other countries and companies.</p><h4>What are your main objectives as the new Executive Director of Invest in Bogotá?</h4><p>This institution has matured over the years, and as the country's identity has evolved—so too has the challenges it presents. We are currently in the process of identifying the city's real vocation and the most strategic sectors for Bogotá's economy in the long term. Infrastructure remains one of the key challenges and we work on the quality of the human workforce and on adding value, transforming sectors, and making them more competitive at a domestic and international level. For example, the Bogotá Metro project represents the best example of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead; it requires an urban transformation, and such a major project will attract foreign investment from large companies and contribute to positioning the city as a regional hub. Invest in Bogotá embodies the belief that we can open new markets and sectors in the near future thanks to the image the world has of the city, which today is extremely positive and promising. It is important also to further strengthen collaboration between industries and players in the private sector, so they pursue contacts abroad as a united entity to sell the city itself.</p><h4>What makes Bogotá a unique place for working and living?</h4><p>We are involved in a city-branding strategy that focuses on identifying the main advantages of Bogotá. We are looking to other major metropolises such Sío Paulo and Santiago, which offer good examples for us to better understand our unique advantages. We have a city with a strong commitment to sustainability and environmentally friendly transportation, such as bicycles. For example, we have over 340 kilometers of cycling lanes and are promoting more efficient transportation through a comprehensive and integrated system that aims at reducing pollution and emissions. Additionally, we are one of the top cultural capitals in Latin America.</p><h4>Bogotá currently accounts for 25% of Colombia's GDP. What is your vision regarding the evolution of this percentage over the medium term?</h4><p>The reality of Bogotá is that of Colombia itself, and although we have managed to remain slightly above the national average, our unemployment rate is just slightly lower and our GDP growth slightly above that of the country overall. We believe that we can grow GDP by around 4% to 5% over the next few years, and that the purchasing power of the city's inhabitants will rise along with that of most middle-class citizens. Bogotá is a clear example of how the country evolves; there are increasing numbers of tourists arriving, investment in the hospitality sector is growing, and the number of SMEs is rapidly expanding (today, there are above 300,000 companies in the city), as is that of multinationals with a presence in Bogotá. The city will definitely continue to play a vital role at the national and economic level in the years to come.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Qatari Olympic Committee?</h4><p>The Qatar Olympic Committee (QOC) was founded on March 14, 1979. The first participation of Qatar was at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada, where Qatar was represented by an administrative delegation. In 1980, the QOC officially joined the International Olympic Committee (IOC) followed by our first participation in the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles by our football and athletics teams. Since then, Qatar has participated in various Olympic Games, as well as at continental and regional games. Until now, Qatar has won four medals at the Olympic Games. London 2012 also represented the first time that Qatar sent female athletes to participate.</p><h4>What other initiatives are being made to encourage women to participate in sport?</h4><p>Female participation has always been strongly encouraged in Qatar, and we are fully committed to supporting the universal movement in promoting women's participation in sport by establishing the Qatar Women's Sports Committee. Since its inception in 2001, programs and initiatives to promote women's participation in sports have been carefully planned and implemented, and we have noted a significant increase in the number of women that participate in these programs as well as consider sport as a professional career. In the past, the Qatar delegation has been represented by female athletes at regional and international events such as the 2006 Asian Games, the West Asian Games, the 2011 Arab Games, and the 2012 London Olympics, to mention a few. We are certain that these athletes inspired others to get involved in sport activities, and soon we will have more women who will consider sport on a professional basis.</p><div class="quote">“We have developed a 10-year sport event strategy that includes bids on major sport events."</div><h4>How have initiatives such as National Sport Day propagated a deeper understanding of sport among the local community?</h4><p>In 2012, declaring February 2 as National Sport Day through an Emiri Decree implied a very strong message regarding the government's support for social development, mandating citizens, organizations, companies, and the authorities to practice sport. We have witnessed a tremendous increase in participation by the citizens in 2013 and an encouraging rise in the level of awareness in sport. We have also witnessed the collective engagement of all national federations, sports organizations, public authorities, and private companies in conducting a number of programs, activities, and initiatives. Awareness and engagement has been remarkable, with an even more promising involvement of the public in sport activities following the National Sport Day events.</p><h4>What efforts is the QOC focusing on in order to promote sport amongst the Qatari youth?</h4><p>We have identified several initiatives and strategies to carry out our mission of promoting sport among the Qatari youth. We created the Aspire Academy for Sports Excellence with special sport programs supervised by some of the best experts in the world to discover talented individuals and elevate their performance. We adapt the “Sport for All" approach in developing world-class sporting facilities like the Al Farjan Playgrounds. In cooperation with Qatar Museums Authority, a dedicated Olympic and Sports Museum will open its gates in the coming years, while temporary exhibitions related to the Olympics and sport have already started with a satisfactory social impact. This will enable our youth to appreciate the history of sport. Also, we have our successful national program that involves all schools in Qatar—the Schools Olympic Program. In this program, Qatari youth and other students take part annually for six months through sport competitions in individual and team sports.</p><h4>How has the sporting environment evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>We have seen the sporting environment rapidly evolving in Qatar. We have hosted a number of major sporting events including the 2006 Asian Games, the 2011 Arab Games, and other international sporting events. This has had a great impact on the development of our sport industry and the society at large. This year we have registered a record of 81 sport events, with 50% being at an international level. A number of major events bids have been successful and we are looking forward to their organization.</p><h4>What other international sporting events are you planning to host in the coming years?</h4><p>We have developed a 10-year sport event strategy that includes bids on major sport events based on carefully selected criteria. Based on this plan we are proceeding with bids in coordination with the local federations and in cooperation with other partner organizations. We managed to successfully secure the rights to host major sport events, namely the 2014 FINA Swimming World Championships (25 meters), the 2015 IHF Men's World Handball Championships, the 2015 World Boxing Championships, and the 2016 UCI World Road Cycling Championships. Currently, we are preparing the infrastructure for the 2015 IHF World Championships and other requirements are in progress as planned.</p><h4>What role does sport play in putting Qatar on the world map?</h4><p>Sport plays an essential part in putting Qatar on the world map as it aims to become a global sporting hub. Winning the rights to host several international world-class events has certainly reinforced our commitment toward sport on a global scale.</p><h4>Moving forward, what are the medium-term strategic plans and initiatives that the QOC is focusing on?</h4><p>We are currently on track with the implementation phase of the 2011- 2016 Sport Sector Strategy, which form part of the 2030 National Vision. We are paying attention to our grassroots programs in order to nurture sporting talent. Also, we are focusing on elite sports and in securing the rights to host major sporting events.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SABIS® member schools are present in 15 countries on four continents. What is behind the company's success story?</h4><p>SABIS® member schools around the world have always been driven by a clear vision to raise education standards. The first school in what later became the SABIS® School Network started in 1886 with a view to providing girls in the village of Choueifat, Lebanon, with an education. Very soon after that first school was opened, the villagers asked the school to admit boys because girls were starting to learn more than their male counterparts. In 1975, due to the civil war, the first school outside of Lebanon was established. The SABIS® School Network, through its various offices around the world, has continued on an expansion path since then. Fuelling the successful expansion of the network is the fact that SABIS® member schools have access to the right methodology and assessment tools, which allow them to ensure that learning is happening in the classroom. With a new school set to open in Panama in 2015, the SABIS® School Network will expand to include a 16th country. Expansion is an ongoing process and comes as a result of a commitment to raise education standards around the world regardless of the challenges. SABIS® is driven by the realization that education can basically change the world.</p><h4>What different models does SABIS® follow?</h4><p>SABIS® member schools are college-preparatory schools that serve students from pre-school and kindergarten to grade 12. Schools within the SABIS® School Network operate under one of three operational models. There are private schools, public schools, and schools that license the SABIS® Educational System. Private schools that are members of the SABIS® School Network operate all around the world, from the US to Pakistan. The SABIS® School Network in the US also includes public charter schools that are overseen by SABIS® Educational Systems. The global SABIS® School Network also includes public schools in the Kurdish region of Northern Iraq. These schools start as primary schools, and upon renewal of the management contract, gradually expand to serve students up through grade 12. The SABIS® franchising or licensing model was introduced six years ago and offers schools the opportunity to license the proven SABIS® Educational System. The SABIS® US office currently works with two licensees in the US; one in New York City with three existing schools and plans to add two more schools in 2013-14, and one in New Jersey. The network also has another licensee in Romania.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon differentiates itself from other countries in that its private education sector is strong and well established."</div><h4>What role does technology play for SABIS®?</h4><p>The SABIS® Educational System is performance-driven and fuelled by ongoing access to data. Teachers and administrators in SABIS® member schools around the world use proprietary SABIS® IT tools and systems to monitor student learning on a daily basis. Individuals employed by SABIS® regional offices around the world also access the data to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the system. At any moment in time, through the comprehensive IT systems available, it is possible to monitor performance across the network, in member schools in Lahore, Pakistan, New Orleans, the US, Frankfurt, Germany, Dubai, UAE, and Lebanon.</p><h4>What are the Lebanese education system's weaknesses and advantages?</h4><p>Lebanon differentiates itself from other countries in that its private education sector is strong and well established. That, unfortunately, is a result of the weak public education sector. Having said that, public education worldwide is not performing the way it should. This is why the US came up with the charter school model and is privatizing public education or introducing the private sector to the public sector. In Lebanon, we have a strong private sector. Through the competition that SABIS® member schools have helped spark, the private education sector in Lebanon has been strengthened. What differentiates SABIS® schools from all of the other private schools is that SABIS® member schools implement a non-selective admissions policy. Most private schools—in Lebanon and indeed around the world—tend to be very selective in nature. SABIS® member schools, on the other hand, pride themselves on being academically non-selective. As long as an applicant does not have any major disabilities that the school is not equipped to handle, SABIS® member schools can work with almost any student to raise his or her education level.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Saudi Arabia is predicted to have seen a growth rate of 4.3% in 2013, a figure that is expected to stabilize over the coming several years. How does the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (RCCI) promote strong and stable economic growth?</h4><p>If we look at the Kingdom's economy in general, and its GDP in particular, we find that the economy consists of products and services that are mostly produced by the private sector. That means that the major components of the economy are derived from the private sector of the economy, including the collective products and services of those companies that constitute the sector. Therefore, supporting and helping companies to grow in the Riyadh region, which comprises more than 300,000 registered enterprises, about 116,000 of which are members of the RCCI, essentially means enhancing the national economy. Our services, however, are not limited to members only; they extend to all businesses within the Riyadh region as well. By helping enterprises, the RCCI indirectly participates in achieving the country's economic objectives through our liaising and coordinating on behalf of the private sector to facilitate their issues and transactions with the government. Our training programs and statistical database help in spotting business opportunities and overcoming difficulties encountered by members and non-members of companies and enterprises. This results in companies producing more goods and services for society in general, which is reflected in the GDP. This is how the RCCI looks at the issue.</p><h4>International investment and cooperation in businesses is an important part of Saudi Arabia's future. How do you facilitate these connections?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is one of the largest economies in the region and is a member of the G20. It is also one of the major oil producers and an influential player in the global economy. We, in the RCCI, are aware of these facts and act accordingly in the best interests of the national economy as well as those of national investors and international entrepreneurs. We believe that international trade is important for the Kingdom and knuckle down to develop the terms of trade both at the national level and the international one. We receive worldwide attention from almost all countries. In 2012, for example, the RCCI received around 150 high-level trade delegations that generally visit the Kingdom for two main reasons: general interest in the country and the pursuit of potential opportunities in both trade and investment. On the business front, and in cooperation with the Saudi Council of Chambers, we are working relentlessly to form a delegation that will take on the responsibility of promoting and marketing Saudi Arabian investment opportunities abroad as well as showcasing our own services. In 2013, the RCCI established the International Cooperation Committee, which includes the chairmen and CEOs of a number of major international companies doing business in Saudi Arabia, through which we aim to officiate more functions and further the cooperative effort.</p><h4>You have just won an award for corporate responsibility. Why is that so important?</h4><p>The RCCI initiated a corporate social responsibility (CSR) program and holds a department that is dedicated to this end. One reason why we believe that the private sector should take part in this program is that beyond the benefits to be reaped by the participating companies, there is also a national interest to consider. Therefore, social responsibility became a major part of the RCCI, and that is why we are devoted to encouraging companies to participate in this program, benefitting all segments of society including the companies themselves.</p><div class="quote">“The government is fully supportive of the private sector by way of providing for huge opportunities all over the country. "</div><h4>How are companies coping with the new labor reforms?</h4><p>For some companies, it is an issue; however, regularized companies and those that comply with Saudi laws will not suffer. There are some companies that may be benefitting from daydreaming about a continuation of non-regularization, but I think that, inevitably, any reforms applied can be said to have their plusses and minuses in relation to different stakeholders. However, the Saudi economy has long required such labor reforms, as both the country and the economy at the end of the day will clearly grow stronger.</p><h4>The government has announced that it will spend over $100 billion on renewable, nuclear, and solar energies over the next 15 years. What opportunities will this present for companies, and how will you promote them?</h4><p>Nuclear energy is a major issue that will be taken care of at the right time. We need to promote and nurture any viable opportunities in the country and present them to potential investors. Saudi Arabia is moving in the direction of nuclear and renewable energy. We do have initiatives at the RCCI and also run our own research center that conducts feasibility studies on any potential opportunities that might be expedient to private sector enterprises.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see the Chamber in Riyadh in the next five years?</h4><p>The Kingdom's economy is growing at higher rates and the government is fully supportive of the private sector by way of providing for huge opportunities all over the country. Therefore, we should be able to reflect this situation at the cutting-edge of all levels, aspects, and fields. The capital city of the country is on the verge of becoming a dynamic hub for regional business. If you look at the Kingdom's favorable geographic location, political stability, economic reputation, and societal solidarity, you will undoubtedly notice that Saudi Arabia is moving in the right direction. Almost 60% of the population is aged below 30 and is well educated; the Kingdom has sent around 200,000 students abroad for education. All these are good signs that make Riyadh eligible to be a major regional focal point for business and trade, with the RCCI playing a key role as a facilitator. I believe we should consider the bigger picture of the country, including the Saudi economy and the government, as we ultimately need to help Saudi companies achieve their objectives, especially where this would help the government set and carry out its business polices and future development plans.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As an important investor in the industrial sector in Azerbaijan, how has the Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) contributed to the development of industry this year?</h4><p>The year of 2013 has been immensely successful for Azerbaijan. We saw the launch of our first telecommunications satellite earlier in the year. Some 20% of the 3.2—ton satellite capacity will be used to meet local demand in Azerbaijan, whereas the remaining 80% will be offered for international commercial purposes. As recently as on December 17, 2013, Azerbaijan hosted an official signing ceremony of the agreement on construction of the $45 billion Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) for natural gas deliveries to Europe, which will serve to enhance Europe's energy security—the 520-kilometer Southern Gas Corridor will carry natural gas from Azerbaijan through Turkey, Albania, and Greece to Italy. TAP, a project of Norwegian Statoil, Swiss Axpo, and German E.ON Ruhrgas, is due for completion in 2019. The total project cost is approximately $2.2 billion. The annual capacity of the pipeline will be 10 bcm, while in the future it will reach 20 bcm. The jewel in the crown for AIC though was the Baku Shipyard Company LLC, a new 62-hectare shipyard that is jointly owned and developed by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), AIC, and Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine Ltd. (Keppel O&amp;M), a Singapore-based world leader in the maritime industry. It was inaugurated by the President of Azerbaijan, HE Ilham Aliyev, on September 20, 2013. The new yard is designed to undertake construction of a wide range of specialized vessels and merchant ships, including subsea vessels, anchor handling tug/supply vessels, and multi-purpose offshore support vessels such as platform supply vessels, as well as tankers and cargo vessels. The yard also has ship repair and conversion capabilities. Although Keppel O&amp;M owns just 10% of the yard, it has full responsibility for management and operation. The largest shareholder, at 65%, is SOCAR, followed by AIC, which owns 25% equity in the company. Phase I of the yard was built at a cost of $470 million. When operating at full capacity, it is able to undertake up to 100 repairs and conversions per annum and is estimated to achieve an average annual steel output of 25,000 tons. Plans for Phase II include the construction of a graving dock with added facilities for offshore projects. With highly skilled human resources, world-class expertise and know-how, as well as well-structured capital investments, we will not have to wait too long to see the shipyard becoming a globally recognized center of excellence in shipbuilding, repair, and conversion. Baku Shipyard Company LLC will be serving not only local demand in Azerbaijan, but also that of the littoral countries of the Caspian basin, as well becoming an important production hub for maritime industries in the region.</p><h4>In what ways is the government helping to support agricultural producers in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>With over a 6% of share in GDP, agriculture is a major contributor to economic growth, diversification, food security, and poverty reduction, and takes an obviously important position amongst priority sectors for state investments in Azerbaijan. Agriculture in Azerbaijan is very diverse due to geographic and climatic conditions. The fertile lands, abundance of water, and climatic diversity create favorable conditions for a strong agricultural sector. Azerbaijan has 4.7 million hectares of agricultural land, which comprises over 50% of its total territory. Approximately 38% of the agricultural lands are arable. Crop production accounts for around 52% of agricultural production, with livestock farming making up the remaining 48%. Meanwhile, the food-processing sector constitutes an important component of the national economy and accounts for around 37% of total manufacturing industry. Agriculture is the largest employer in the country, accounting for around 40% of the active labor force, while 99.7% of the produce is generated in the private sector. Azerbaijan trades intensively in agricultural and food products. Traditionally, the main destination and the largest consumer of agricultural and food exports from the country has been the CIS market, but in recent years this market has expanded to include many other countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The main export products are fresh vegetables and fruits, vegetable and animal oils, sugar products, tea, processed vegetables and fruits, beverages, tobacco products, cotton, and others. To promote the further development of business in this sector, the state has been encouraging the introduction of different financial and non-financial schemes. Agricultural producers do not pay any taxes beside land tax, which varies depending on the quality and location of the land. Businesses engaged in the food processing industry are subject to the statutory tax regime, which is still quite competitive. All companies registered in Azerbaijan, even those with 100% foreign interest, may benefit from numerous subsidies, discounts, and other privileges provided by the state. Such subsidies and discounts can scale up to 70% of the value of goods, products, and services producers may require in executing their business. The state has established a strong institutional mechanism aimed at sustaining economic growth and stimulating production and development in the non-oil sectors of the national economy. Recent disbursements of soft loans in the agricultural sector by the National Entrepreneurs Support Fund total over $930 million. As another part of the institutional mechanism, the establishment of AIC was a showcase of one of the first public-private partnership (PPP) initiatives by the government. Projects in agriculture add great significance to the structure of our portfolio, coming second only to industry and representing nearly a fifth of our total investments. So far, AIC has invested over $28 million in various projects in the sector. One such project is Aghstafa Agroservice. Launched in 2012 and with an overall value of just under $6 million, a quarter of which is owned by AIC, the project serves the purpose of establishing an advanced agro-technical services facility to help improve productivity and promote the efï¬cient use of soil. Having partnered with RAO Global Group GmbH in this project, we at AIC are pleased to have been able to facilitate local farmers to access modern technology and machinery for daily use. Yet, another project AIC has invested in in the sector is Davachi Broyler, a poultry production facility with an overall value of over $60 million. The AIC investment of about $15 million back in 2010 helped the renovation and capacity expansion of one of the largest poultry production farms in Azerbaijan. The facility today occupies 135 hectares of land and employs over 800 people, who contribute to the production and processing of poultry products in excess of 13,000 tons a year. Azertokhum is one of the greenfield projects AIC joined in 2010. The $24 million investment was aimed at the construction of the ï¬rst modern seed processing plant and granary, and the cultivation of highly reproductive, elite, and super-elite seeds using advanced technologies. Three years later, Azertokhum today occupies a 70,000 sqm of territory in the central part of Azerbaijan. It has a production capacity of 86,400 tons of seeds per annum. The plant also has dry and wet grain silos, as well as a drying tower with a capacity of 36 tons and a 10-ton-per-hour packing unit. These, and the other new projects that we are currently considering, help to put AIC in a privileged position as a part of the mechanism established to support the non-oil sector of the national economy.</p><div class="quote">“Last year was particularly productive in terms of building new partnerships with foreign investors."</div><h4>What are the benefits for companies to co-invest in projects together with the AIC?</h4><p>AIC offers extensive knowledge of the local economy, experience in investing in projects of varying scale and magnitude, in-depth knowledge of the local legal framework, a value-added investment approach for maximum returns, joint due diligence and cost sharing pertaining to investments evaluation, sourcing additional funding from a range of internationally renowned lending institutions, and an extensive network within public and private sectors. In all the projects we invest in, AIC always remains a minority shareholder with full representation at the board level.  Being a state-owned equity investment fund, AIC's engagement in any project is a result of a very long and hairsplitting due-diligence process, detailed feasibility study, and market research and fulfillment of rather specific AIC requirements by the investee companies, which include submitting independently audited financial statements, adherence to international financial reporting standards, and an established tradition of corporate governance best practices. For foreign investors, partnering with AIC in any project is an additional reassurance of the safety of their investments. Local partners, on the other hand, benefit from AIC's outstanding expertise and unlimited access to a vast database of globally accepted innovations, know-how, and new technologies on top of the additional funding that they require to ensure the successful execution of the project. Foreign or local, AIC partnership offers an overall winning formula to all co-investors in our successful projects.</p><h4>What has your collaboration with AZPROMO consisted of this year?</h4><p>AIC and AZPROMO are like two hands of the same clock. They move in unison to point at the opportunities for investors in the country, as well as export potential for local businesses, and offer a reliable partnership for those who wish to join the story of economic success that Azerbaijan showcases to the world. Our colleagues at AZPROMO are doing a tremendous job organizing a great number of successful events in Azerbaijan and overseas, while also creating opportunities for local businesses to be heard beyond national borders. They are also encouraging potential foreign investors to join in by providing them with a comprehensive insight into the endless opportunities that help to firmly establish a prominent spot for Azerbaijan on the global investment map. Over the past year alone, AIC and AZPROMO have participated together in various forums and B2B gatherings with representatives of various businesses from Austria, Italy, Germany, the US, the UK, Russia, China, Slovenia, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, and so on. Such events held in Azerbaijan as well as overseas have given AIC several potential promising leads that we are considering at present.</p><h4>Azerbaijan has reached out to a number of relatively new partners this year. What are your expectations regarding the contribution of foreign investment and trade to economic diversification?</h4><p>Last year was particularly productive in terms of building new partnerships with foreign investors. Here, I would like to refer to a quote by Mark Zuckerberg, who defined the basis for Facebook's partnership strategy thus: “We build the social technology, they provide the music." In Azerbaijan we offer mutually beneficial and potentially highly profitable investment opportunities, and a dependable partnership, in return of globally attested and recognized new technology, know-how, and innovative ideas that will serve our goal of fostering the development of the non-oil sector of the national economy.</p><h4>Azerbaijan will be the host of the first European Games in 2015. What will that mean in terms of investment in the economy?</h4><p>The forthcoming European Games is just another story of success in Azerbaijan's effort toward gaining a well-deserved reputation as a host country for large-scale international events. Each such event opens up new development avenues in Azerbaijan, including the construction of multiple venues for various sports and games, such as a new football stadium with a retractable roof to house 65,000 spectators, a state-of-the-art National Gymnastics Arena with a seating capacity of 12,000 people, a new Baku Aquatic Centre, athletes' villages, roads, and other related infrastructure. The government has spared no expense in the development of this infrastructure, which will serve local people and attract a good number of returning visitors, thereby helping to boost tourism for many years beyond 2015.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you contribute to financial education in the country?</h4><p>Financial education is advancing in Mexico. We take part in BBVA Bancomer's Financial Education Program. This is a comprehensive program that comprises 11 different products, including life insurance, and has accumulated more than 800,000 participants in different interactive outlets during 2013 and more than 2.3 million since 2009. We were the first to include an insurance product as part of the financial education effort in Mexico. The program has tools that make it highly interactive for the participant, and that allow simulations of costs and coverage. You can estimate the amount your coverage will cost, depending on your needs. It helps people to understand the purpose of insurance and how it can be of great help when an unexpected event occurs. I believe that we are moving in the right direction to develop financial education in Mexico.</p><h4>Do you think that higher preventative insurance penetration is achievable in Mexico?</h4><p>We still have a lot of work to do as a sector. We are advancing, however, and in this respect the bancassurance business has really been an important factor in this development. We have reached segments of the population previously not served by traditional channels of insurance. The increasing offers of non-traditional insurance products like accident, travel, hospitalization, or cancer insurance have also been a relevant factor in increasing the penetration of insurance products. The number of our banking clients that own insurance policies is increasing. The number of direct-sale insurance products is also on the up.</p><div class="quote">“I think we have good products and a strong understanding of our market."</div><h4>What is your target position in the market?</h4><p>Our objective is growth. I think we have good products and a strong understanding of our market. We have models that allow us to create differentiated offers for our clients. We also benefit from being a part of the BBVA group. We try to complement the group's banking products and services, offering insurance products that are aligned to client needs. Having major business in the mortgage sector is also a benefit for our portfolio.</p><h4>How will the new road regulations affect the insurance sector?</h4><p>Mandatory insurance on federal highways is a positive development in the regulatory framework. We believe that this should be expanded to become mandatory for every vehicle in general. When you see the cost of having mandatory auto insurance and you compare it to the cost of filling up your tank, the annual cost of the insurance is equivalent to, for an average car, two-and-a-half tanks of gas. There are many instances of injuries from car accidents, where people end up without coverage. Only about 26.5% cars are protected by insurance. There are some states that have mandatory insurance, but it is not really enforced. We are working with the Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions (AMIS), presenting arguments to government officials and supporting mandatory insurance for autos. Mandatory insurance is often seen as simply a way to provide more business to insurers, but the benefits gained from coverage in the incidence of traffic accidents is good for the whole of society.</p><h4>How competitive are foreign companies in Mexico's insurance sector?</h4><p>In most countries, the large global insurance companies have a strong presence, but in México there are strong local players, too, which are highly competitive and efficient. In any country, each player has its own history. Some of the companies that today belong to international groups were originally local entities. International groups have the acquisition power that a local player probably does not. But, in the end, the success of the company lies in the people within the organization and the methodologies they have operating in México. There are benefits to being part of an international group, but I would not say that Mexican companies are at a disadvantage; they know the market, they have talented people, good processes, and they are efficient.</p><h4>What is your view of the Mexican loan insurance sector and its potential for growth?</h4><p>We are very optimistic about the future. The insurance sector in Mexico is still not well developed. It represents less than 2% of GDP and is at one of the lowest levels in the Americas. Compared to other countries, this indicator is affected by the fact that auto insurance is not mandatory and the disability/life coverage related to pension programs is not private. I believe that the market has much potential. People are becoming more aware of the benefits of insurance products, and more knowledgeable. If the banking penetration rate of a country increases, then the insurance sector also grows with it. México is one of our strongest bets for the future.</p><h4>What are the challenges of the Mexican market?</h4><p>The big challenge for all participants in the insurance business is to better understand the changing needs of our customers, and to run lean and efficient operations. We have to move from traditional products toward having a wider portfolio. We need to offer what the clients need and not what we want to sell. We also need to be willing to cover the needs of customers in a transition or temporary situation, such as being away on vacation. The challenge for us is to become a company with a more dynamic product offering. We have to adjust our products to new needs, provide offers at the right time, and be able to make these offers using the latest technologies. If you can understand the needs of your current and your potential clients, you can make the right offer.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar Foundation (QF) has been an essential part of Qatar's rise to prominence. What changes will your leadership bring to the organization's strategy?</h4><p>I have been closely involved with the operations and building of the QF since 1995. I believe that my experience and intrinsic understanding of the unique needs of my nation, its youth, and the vision and mission of QF will be vital in carrying forward the legacy of success and prominence that has been established by Qatar's wise leadership and my predecessors at QF. My role as the new President of the QF is part of the natural evolution that takes place within a maturing organization that seeks to refine its strategic objectives without altering its overarching mission. Our ongoing aim is to promote a culture of excellence in Qatar and to advance it by developing sustainable human capacity, as well as social and economic prosperity that can benefit the local and international community. My intention is to continue cultivating and nurturing the needs of this globally respected institution and the people that constitute the heart of our nation. In my earlier role as Vice-President of Capital Projects and Facilities, I worked alongside an energetic team to ensure the effective planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all QF buildings and supporting infrastructure on its 15 million sqm campus. The site today has the biggest collection of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified buildings in the Middle East, which is an unprecedented achievement. This is a reflection of the innovative excellence that Qatari leaders seek to bring to the nation today. Having served as a member of Qatar Foundation's Board of Trustees, I intend to ensure that every member of the organization continues to play a pivotal role in achieving the key pillars and vision set forth by Qatar's leadership. Our collective aim is to transform Qatar into a knowledge-based economy by 2030, capable of sustaining its own development for generations to come.</p><h4>Becoming an R&amp;D hub is one of Qatar's key goals. What additional steps is the QF planning to take to achieve this in the coming years?</h4><p>Qatar has made a commitment to be a leading global center for R&amp;D excellence and innovation. Qatar Foundation Research and Development (QF R&amp;D) is spearheading this national endeavor as a world-class hub for technological innovation and prominent research institute that is operating at the frontiers of science. QF R&amp;D oversees several capacity-building initiatives, which aim to support and sustain a vibrant ecosystem of research and innovation in Qatar. The QF considers research to be a catalyst for expanding and diversifying the country's economy, enhancing the education of its citizens and the training of its workforce, and fostering improvements in the health, wellbeing, environment, and security of people in Qatar and across the world. Part of our strategy for the coming years will be to further strengthen the role of our youth in the midst of a stimulating, research-based environment. Our goal is to provide them with the training and discovery-orientated education that is necessary to become leaders in science, business, government, and a range of other sectors in Qatar. To further our mission of developing a thriving scientific culture in Qatar and across the region, we have implemented, and will continue to expand upon, a multitude of initiatives that benefit students and researchers both in Qatar and abroad. QF R&amp;D recently launched its first PhD program, entitled the Qatar Foundation Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program in Energy Sciences. This competitive doctoral program is a collaboration between QF R&amp;D and Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU), the first university to join the program, and will provide its graduates with an excellent platform for a successful career in the field of energy sciences. Through the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)—a member of QF—we run a number of funding programs aimed at providing opportunities for young researchers. QNRF recently launched the Graduate Student Research Awards (GSRA), a new funding program that will help to develop human capital in research for Qatar, and encourage PhD programs inside the country. Our aim is also to build a collaborative research culture. At this year's Annual Research Conference (QF ARC'13) we will once again be engaged in problem solving by bringing together renowned researchers, academics, and scientists with the aim of finding solutions to challenges outlined in the Qatar National Research Strategy (QNRS). Crucial themes will be explored and addressed, among which are the protecting Qatar's cyber infrastructure, developing and deploying solar energy solutions, ensuring sustainable food supply, and supporting Arabic culture, arts, heritage, media and language. Qatar's research culture continues to thrive and we are greatly encouraged by the increase in student participation at the Annual Research Conference year after year, reflected in the quantity and quality of student research that is presented. We intend to ensure that the nation's research needs are prioritized and that we can nurture Qatar's innovations from conceptualization to commercialization.</p><h4>Qatar Foundation has made extensive use of joint ventures and partnerships over past years. How effective has this strategy been, and how will you develop this approach in the future?</h4><p>We believe that this strategy has been highly effective and valuable to all parties. The QF sets up joint ventures with well-respected global partners and forges strong partnerships with institutions that share common values. This approach has served us well and we intend to continue collaborating with like-minded partners in order to advance our mission and the objectives outlined in Qatar National Vision 2030. Thanks in large part to the steadfast commitment and support of Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of QF, we have been able to develop the creative potential of our young people by collaborating and working with renowned institutions across the world. We actively seek to build new alliances and partnerships throughout the year by organizing networking opportunities, conferences, and gatherings that bring together academics, researchers, and experts from the public and private sectors. We also invite leaders from across the world to visit Qatar Foundation's numerous centers, which allows us to develop further connections. I believe it is imperative that we continue to build and develop platforms for knowledge exchange and to expose students to experiences and skills that will help them become the country's future leaders. A few of our successful partnerships include the launching of an exclusive training program in partnership with the University of Oxford's prestigious Saïd Business School earlier this year, which has been designed to enhance the expertise of our top-tier managers. The program has been carefully tailored to suit QF's strategic objectives and will help our leaders apply their problem-solving skills to address complex challenges. Our partnership with the Economist Group has also been fruitful and has flourished through a series of engaging discussion-based forums and events. Our closely aligned values and goals have formed the basis of our relationship and this has allowed our employees to benefit. Our students have also taken part in enlightening internship program, through which they learned key skills that will prove vital to their ongoing education and future careers. Qatar Foundation's partnership with FC Barcelona has also encouraged people all over the world to follow their passions through the pursuit of excellence in sports and education. By extending many of the positive values from sport to youth of all ages, the QF and FC Barcelona have succeeded in fostering a spirit of teamwork and healthy, active lifestyles.</p><div class="quote">“The mission of our organization is to unlock human potential."</div><h4>The environment is a major concern for countries across the globe, and the QF has made environmental sustainability central to its activities. How is the Foundation working to achieve a higher level of sustainability in Qatar, and what role will technology play in promoting it?</h4><p>The QF is committed to sustainability and its centers are actively involved in numerous areas of research, technology, and education. They also promote international collaborations that support the development and implementation of sustainability ventures. The QF is eager to strengthen public awareness by creating a landscape that is conducive to learning about environmental protection. This is being achieved through the use of environmentally sound technologies and values, and by implementing beneficial research to mitigate any adverse effects on our surroundings. The environment is one of Qatar National Research Strategy's key pillars and we are keen to advance this area of study. In December of last year, the QF launched a strategic partnership with the globally renowned Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), to set up the region's pioneering Climate Change Research Institute and Global Climate Change Forum in Doha. We believe the creation of a world-class research institute that specializes in the field will help tackle the impact of climate change and improve the science and technology available to address this global challenge. Some of the important research topics that will be explored by the new institute include water systems, ecosystems, food production, public health, and sustainable urban development. The institute will seek to fill critical gaps in research on mitigation, adaptation, and climate resiliency for key regions such as tropics, sub-tropics, and dry lands. Furthermore, through the efforts of the Qatar Green Building Council—a Qatar Foundation member—we are striving to effectively integrate green building practices in all of our developments and this is a true testament to Qatar's growth and advancement in the field. All QF properties play a major role in minimizing the carbon effect by using sustainable technologies and every building at the development stage has been designed with the environment in mind. The unique student complex at QF is a perfect example of sustainable living. It has been equipped with solar-paneled roofs and wind turbines that generate energy in 10-kilometer gusts or higher. Its 12 buildings make up the highest concentration of independently registered platinum LEED buildings as acknowledged by the US Green Building Council, and the only student housing complex anywhere in the world to have achieved this benchmark. With human behavior posing a substantial challenge to sustainable living, a monitoring system has also been installed in each housing unit to help students track their own energy and water consumption. This project serves as a valuable tool for students, as it engages and teaches younger generations about sustainability and encourages accountability toward the environment. By sharing knowledge with our students and fostering collaborations, we are confident that we can build the technology required to address the challenges at hand, to adapt and to mitigate environmental risks.</p><h4>The QF is well-known today for its achievements not only in education, but also research, health, culture, and even real estate and construction. How will you ensure that the Foundation's contributions have an impact across Qatar's economy and culture?</h4><p>The mission of our organization is to unlock human potential. Our main priorities have been designed to serve a national purpose and to have a widespread impact on Qatar's economy and culture. At QF, creativity, intellect, and critical thinking are foremost, and ensuring the development of human capital will remain our key focus. The transformation to a knowledge economy is progressing well and we have made significant headway over the past decade. I believe that by equipping the Qatari youth with every opportunity possible and offering them a wide range of resources to tap into their potential we can ensure their increased participation in the workforce and in the development of the country's economy. We have every intention of continuing to build a solid platform for progress and innovation, while fostering a culture of quality and excellence that can benefit our region and the wider world.</p><h4>What legacy would you like to leave Qatar Foundation with?</h4><p>As Qataris, we take great pride in our nation's deep-rooted traditions and enduring history. There is immense opportunity for the youth today and we have been entrusted with their future. We are all united in creating the most sustainable path for their development—one that is compatible with the vision of our country's leadership and the aspirations of our people. The QF is a beacon of knowledge today and will remain so for generations to come. We aim to create an even better and brighter future for our youth by nurturing a passion for education and enlightenment, while keeping in mind the heritage of our beloved nation. That is the legacy we all want to leave behind and one that I am certain will make our children proud.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background story of Mario Hernandez?</h4><p>We opened the first stores under the name of Cuerolandia in the early 1970s, whereas the factory, Marroquinera SA, only opened in 1978. The story of Marroquinera is a complex one, as it was born out of a merger between two small companies, Cuerolandia and Marroquinera, after I acquired a majority stake in of both of them from close friends. We incorporated the production of Swiss Bally. Over the years, we also opened in New York; an experience that helped me open my eyes and see that Marroquinera was not perhaps the best trading name. After some international market research, I decided to change the name of the company to Mario Hernandez. That meant a fresh start for the company, and it has been 17 years now since then, a period of time in which we have been growing both nationally and internationally. We now employ over 500 people and have manufacturing activities in several countries, as we always aim to produce using the best raw materials.</p><h4>What is the extent of your international presence?</h4><p>Today, we have 55 stores in countries Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Aruba. In all these countries, we are present with Mario Hernandez stores in the most successful shopping malls. In terms of future expansions, we prioritize remaining for the long term. Our five-year plan foresees the company reaching 120 stores and increasing its international activity, with a special focus on the US, which will be our top priority.</p><div class="quote">“I think we are unique in terms of service, quality, as well as manufacturing methods."</div><h4>How would you assess the development of the Colombian leather industry?</h4><p>The number of players has declined compared to a few years ago. Previously, we had been commercializing rather cheap leather, and there were many manufacturers, thanks to high demand from countries like the US. However, that changed some 15 years ago, as leather became a more expensive product, changing, too, the manufacturing patterns in the industry toward more traditional and unique methods. That drove prices up and reduced the number of players in the industry, leaving those with brands focused on consumer experience. Over the past decade, Colombia has been working hard to promote its leather among the finest quality in the world, trying to knock down old stereotypes and make our leather production highly recognized in the international arena. The supply chain is diminished due to the flight to lower labor cost countries. However, the biggest challenge is procuring raw materials and hardware.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of your company?</h4><p>I think we are unique in terms of service, quality, as well as manufacturing methods. We believe that differentiation is the only road to success in today's globalized world, and for that reason we have worked very hard to achieve the denomination of origin in Mario Hernandez, something we proudly achieved some years back. Another of our distinctive features is our products' unique identity. And our challenge for the future is to ensure that our business grows.</p><h4>How has the company evolved over the past five years and what are your main future plans?</h4><p>We have been growing at an average annual rate of between 15% and 20%. In terms of future priorities, we plan to expand our international profile, while acquiring more international expertise in the industry with some of the best professionals out there. Additionally, we will continue investing in customer experience, technology, research, innovation, stores, manufacturing methods, product differentiation, promotion, and PR. That's the only way to survive in such a global and exigent world. We will continue producing in those countries with the best raw materials for the manufacturing of our products, as well as import the finest leather to produce locally. We are on the way to building a global and international brand, and we have already won the attention of several global investors. Thus far, we have refused any potential deals, as we believe we still have a long road ahead of us, and that there will be a moment, in the future, when we will be in a stronger position. So far, we are prioritizing re-investing in our utilities and continuing our expansion in terms of international activity and number of stores.</p><h4>How closely do you work with Marca Colombia and Proexport Colombia?</h4><p>They both feature us as a good business example of companies that want to expand their activities to other international markets. Overall, we collaborate closely with them, as the government has offered its hand to many companies to grow internationally. We are regularly invited on commercial trips to countries like Russia, Venezuela, and many others to share our experience, and who knows, perhaps open new and potential markets. Our company takes part in negotiations for the Pacific Alliance as one of Colombia's four representative companies; this initiative will bring together over 210 million people from four different countries—Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Mexico—and remove visa requirements, reduce custom tariffs, and create commercial opportunities across many different industries.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for the future of Ecuador's external economy?</h4><p>The trade agreement with the EU will be one of the most significant issues of my term as Minister of Foreign Trade, and international negotiations are a must. The EU is one of our main markets for non-oil exports, and based on the President's instructions, we're working toward restarting negotiations with the EU. We went on a trip to Brussels in July 2013 to meet with members of the European Commission and the European External Action Service to discuss the desire that Ecuador has to restart negotiations as soon as possible, as well as the political and technical necessities. I'm very optimistic and confident that we can successfully finalize these negotiations and reach an agreement by the first trimester of 2014.</p><h4>What will be the economic impact of your efforts to geographically diversify trade?</h4><p>We're going to continue our efforts to diversify the destinations of our exports. We'll concentrate on the areas where we've been working until now, like Latin America, especially the parts of the continent where we've yet to realize our full potential, such as Central America and the Caribbean, as well as countries in Mercosur and Mexico. The Andean Community and Chile are our traditional markets, and we're already strong there. The aim now is to branch out into parts of Latin America where we have little presence in terms of exporting Ecuadorean goods. Another country we want to work with more in the Americas is Canada. Outside of the Americas, we're going to accelerate our diversification in Europe, concentrating especially on those member states of the EU where we're not very strong at the moment, mainly the Central and Eastern European countries ­­­—such as Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Austria, as well as the Scandinavian and Baltic countries. Outside of the EU, we're going to work with countries in the CIS region, including Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and others—countries that have enormous potential, are growing rapidly, and buying Ecuadorean goods. We also want to work with Turkey and expand Ecuadorean goods through Turkey to the region surrounding it. Finally, we'd also like to expand in Northeast Asia, Japan, South Korea, and China in particular. Those are the main markets where we seek to diversify exports.</p><h4>How important is membership in the Pacific Alliance for Ecuador, and how important is South-South cooperation for your country?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance is a very interesting initiative in which the main objective from the trade and commerce point of view is to strengthen relations between countries that are part of the alliance, looking to work together to expand their capacities to export goods and services to the other side of the Pacific, Asia, and Oceania. Ecuador is naturally very interested in following the process and seeing how we can get involved based on our vision of international trade and showing our interest in the process. That's why Ecuador first chose to enter the Pacific Alliance as an observer. We were accepted in that status at the last meeting in Cali, Colombia. Now that we're a part of the process, we'll analyze the possibility to continue, advance, and participate directly in some areas. We could begin by participating in export promotion activities and strategies. This would involve joint promotion of our member states' goods in areas of the world where we don't have so much experience, or where the overall supply we offer as a group is more important than our individual capacities, so we can all work together to be able to satisfy that demand. We have to look into the future and see the possibilities of stronger integration. One possibility we're working to have in the future is a free trade zone (FTZ) in goods with other countries in the Pacific Alliance. The only member of the Pacific Alliance with whom we need to strengthen relations at the moment is Mexico.</p><div class="quote">“We're going to continue our efforts to diversify the destinations of our exports."</div><h4>Ecuadorean exports to Andean countries increased 11% in 2012. What role do you envision Ecuador playing in Latin America?</h4><p>I believe Ecuador will play a leadership role in the region. The country has been very successful both from a political and economic point of view. We have a stable economy that is expected to continue growing, especially as we develop. We should be able to grow 5%-6%, or maybe even 7% in the next few years. That will help us reduce the gap between developed countries and Ecuador, and will give us more regional influence. On the other hand, we're at the middle point between countries such as Cuba and Venezuela, which have very specific political systems and an important state role in planning the economy, and countries such as Chile and Colombia, which are very free-trade and free-market oriented. This gives us the chance to enable the two systems to coexist in the region, acting as a kind of pivot. Hopefully, Ecuador will have a role in strengthening the new institutional structures that exist in the region, such as UNASUR for South America, and CELAC in the Latin America and Caribbean region. We should be able to influence those institutions for the sake and interests of the Latin American and Caribbean regions.</p><h4>What are your main priorities during your term, besides the trade agreement with the EU?</h4><p>Our priority is to change the economic and productive matrix of the country. To influence and help this process is the main objective of the ministry. We want to change the matrix to one that is based on higher value-added goods, where the main factor of production is talent and knowledge. For that, we need economies of scale and large markets. It's not possible for us to build that kind of project as Ecuador alone—we need to find adequate international partners in order to achieve this goal. At the Ministry we have to be the ones to help those new industries to open up to the markets and we keep track of what the tendencies are in the market for the goods and services that consumers demand. Besides, we are aiming to diversify Ecuador's international market for goods and services. Our trade depends mainly on the Andean Community, the EU, and the US. We want to expand into new markets, and this lessens our exposure to risk, which is otherwise significant if we are dependent on just one or two markets. There's still instability in the international arena, and we've yet to completely overcome the latest financial crisis of 2009-2010. We also want to introduce new actors to the international marketplace. We want more democracy in our international trade sector. Right now, international trade is concentrated in a few hands in Ecuador, and we want to introduce more actors—especially SMEs and even micro enterprises.</p><h4>What is your mid-term outlook for the Ecuadorean economy?</h4><p>We have the economic resources to continue to grow. Our GDP will continue to increase, and there will be greater welfare in Ecuadorean society. We'll have a stable economy with a better introduction to international markets and more investment coming into the country, with Ecuador coming back to the international capital markets and being able to attain better financial access. The country is planning for fantastic infrastructure and a more skilled labor force with high levels of education and training. There will be political and economical stability, with sustained economic growth. We'll continue to focus and develop South-South relations, considering the most growth in the 21st century will not be seen in the developed world but the developing world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America. Overall, the country will change for the benefit of the majority of our country, and Ecuador will be well placed between two future economic powerhouses: Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has PRO ECUADOR evolved since it was established?<br></h4><p>The fact that the Ecuadorean government took a leading step in promoting its exports and investments was essential. PRO ECUADOR was created to strengthen the work of and interaction between the public and private sectors, as well as build up the country's presence and its exportable offer abroad. We have grown and consolidated our commercial offices network. In 2009, Ecuador had 14 commercial offices and nine commercial sections, with only one member of staff working at Ecuadorean embassies abroad. Nowadays, PRO ECUADOR has 31 offices in key markets, and we have at least four officers in each country, which allows us to provide a better response to exporters and investors. We also are continuing to create a network of national companies that want to be international. We can offer information, training, and commercial opportunities. We have taken a look inside our work, making our services more effective. For example, PRO ECUADOR is now targeting specific needs, identifying what type of information is relevant for companies and whether or not they are receiving it.</p><h4>Where does Ecuador have commercial offices operating, and what markets offer the most potential for the near future?</h4><p>We have 31 commercial offices in Latin America, Central America, the US and Canada, and in Europe in markets such as Spain, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Turkey, and Russia. We also have three offices in China, one in Japan, Korea, Singapore, and India, as well as a new office in Dubai.</p><h4>What are your main activities planned for 2013, and what is the operating budget for the year?</h4><p>The national budget assigned $18 million to our institute, which includes two investment projects in institutional strengthening and to accompany Ecuadorean companies when doing business abroad. This project is called Exporta Paí­s, and seeks to diagnose the national foreign trade situation, identify who is involved in the process, evaluate how we can strengthen Ecuador's presence abroad, and then implement a correct strategy. The objective is to create efficient PRO ECUADOR services in technology and knowledge. The other project was created to target specific investment opportunities at a national level.</p><h4>What investment opportunities does Ecuador offer to foreign investors?</h4><p>In this context, the industry and petrochemicals sectors offer many opportunities, because the government is encouraging a change in the country's production matrix. Ecuador's focus is set on industrial development, investing in new energies, and long-term investments. Sectors such as metallurgy, shipbuilding, agricultural production, and tourism offer very interesting opportunities for investors. In tourism, we want the presence of international companies seeking our diversity in climate and habitat. At the same time, we continue to encourage the export of signature products such as bananas, coffee, cocoa, and shrimp. We see market niches in our region for textiles, electromechanical activity, services, and the automotive sector—new production with high possibilities in the international market.</p><h4>What role does the private sector play in boosting Ecuador's economic growth?</h4><p>It is essential. The role of public institutions is to facilitate these activities. We have to set rules and help with services and guidelines, so that the work of exporters work can be easier. As we work on being more effective, we will see short-term results. We have also worked on presenting Ecuador as a place to do business, where people can buy and invest, see the wonders of the country, and live our reality. Another role is to organize business events and fairs such as the Andean Business Meeting in partnership with the four countries of the Andean Community, the Business Matchmaking Ecuador, and Aromas del Ecuador, specialized in coffee and cocoa.</p><h4>What trade agreements could the country sign in the near future, and how would they contribute to boosting foreign trade?</h4><p>We have many agreements in discussion, and there are high expectations for all of them. Our efforts are focused on regional markets, especially Mercosur, and we are keen to start negotiations. We have signed an agreement with Guatemala, where many companies are seeking new opportunities. We are also looking to hold meetings with China and Korea. We think it is essential to continue negotiations with Europe. In the case of Turkey and Central America, we are waiting for the final agreements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[some-capital-ideas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important aspects and regulatory changes from the new Capital Markets Law?</h4><p>The previous Capital Markets Law dates back to 1982, meaning the new capital markets law brings us up to date with all the changes we have seen both in the global and local capital markets over the last 30 years. The new law also harmonizes our regulations almost 100% with those of the EU. Furthermore, during the preparation of the new law we took into account the lessons learnt from the 2008 global financial crises. Another reason is that while the last decade saw huge growth in the Turkish banking sector, the capital markets lagged quite a ways behind. This new law adjusts our capital markets to the times, as it were. Some of the new changes and novelties brought in by the law include: In line with the 2023 Istanbul Finance Center Project, the legal framework regarding markets has been restructured to enable markets to operate within the one-stop-shop financial supermarket concept, allowing all financial instruments to be traded on a single exchange; investment services and activities have been redefined, enabling intermediary institutions to perform higher value-added activities; the Capital Markets Board (CMB) has been authorized to establish rules regarding corporate governance principles; regulations regarding squeeze out and sell out have been introduced and the legal framework regarding mergers and acquisitions has been updated with global standards; to enhance competition, return performance, and investor trust in the institutional investment sector and to increase the weight of institutional investors in our markets, the establishment and management of mutual funds have been designed as separate areas of activity; the Investor Compensation Center was established in order to secure investors' capital market instruments and cash assets of up to TL100,000.</p><h4>The law has been in effect since early 2013. What changes have you seen in terms of asset management?</h4><p>The new Capital Markets Law brings in a new regime—fully aligned with EU regulations—for collective investment schemes. Immediately after the law came into force, we commenced work on the enactment of sub-regulations, in other words “communiqués." However, all the secondary regulations that will lay the groundwork come into effect as of July 1, 2014. Regarding institutional investors and collective investment schemes, the three most crucial regulations are those that set the rules for the investment funds, the portfolio management companies, and the depositories. As for mutual funds, assets under management (AUM) are valued at, as of September 2, 2013, approximately $15.6 billion. Generally speaking, money market funds have been dominating the Turkish mutual funds industry. However, due to the recent limitations we imposed on the total expense ratios of mutual funds, there has been a decline in the proportion of money market funds' portfolio size since 2012. With their growing number in the market, hedge funds are becoming an attractive investment alternative.</p><div class="quote">“In the first 10 months of 2013, 1 million people joined the new private pension scheme."</div><h4>With the new law in effect, how would you evaluate the state of investor confidence in Turkey?</h4><p>During six of the past 10 years we were undergoing a global financial crisis; yet, not a single bank or company in Turkey required government intervention or subsidies to stay in business. This has also had a positive effect on foreign investor confidence in the Turkish economy. Be it FDI or portfolio investments, I don't think you will find a single foreign investor who was unhappy with their investments in Turkey over the past decade. Our government's approach to investor protection is similar to its attitude toward protecting Turkish citizens' rights. With respect to international investors' confidence in our markets, there is draft legislation on international arbitration currently being considered by the Turkish Parliament. In addition to this, we are working on courts that will solely be dedicated to capital markets issues and financial disputes, aiming to shorten the time period of judicial processes.</p><h4>What are your predictions with regard to sharia-compliant investment products in Turkey?</h4><p>Currently, on a global scale, there are $274 billion worth of outstanding unredeemed sukuk issues, of which Turkey has a share of 2%. We believe that Turkey has huge potential to become one of the most dynamic Islamic finance markets in the world. Turkey is very well positioned both geographically and culturally in this respect. For this reason, one of the pillars of our Vision 2023 is dedicated to becoming a center of Islamic finance. We have made the necessary amendments to the Capital Markets Law to be able to introduce new Islamic finance instruments, which the Turkish public has generally shied away from until now. From the beginning of 2013, we have introduced five new kinds of sukuks, or Islamic bonds. With the introduction of these new investment opportunities, the real sector issued $3 billion worth of sukuk products, and the Turkish Treasury also issued $3 billion worth. Furthermore, we have introduced a new private pension fund scheme whereby the Turkish government matches 25% of every TL100 invested in this scheme. This has caused a huge leap in private pension investments; the number of investors has increased substantially with this new scheme coming into effect. There are currently 4 million accounts, of which 1 million were added less than one year after this new government scheme was introduced. We believe we have one of the best private pension schemes in the world in terms of standards, customer protection, and transparency.</p><h4>What effects do you see this new pension fund scheme having on the overall economy once it reaches maturity?</h4><p>Turkey's savings rate is far below the OECD average. It's at around 12% of GDP, which is a problem for Turkey that shows up in our annual current account as a deficit of around 6%-7% of GDP. One of the reasons the savings rate is so low is that Turkey has a young population; the average age is 28 compared to 42 in the EU. That means that there is a large tendency to spend, especially considering that spending was suppressed over the past decade. Furthermore, the political and economic stability of the past 11 years has led to a tendency to invest, rather than save. Keeping these trends in mind, certain measures are being implemented regarding credit card spending and consumer credits. From now on, our target is to increase savings, particularly via the capital markets.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2014 and beyond in terms of increased savings?</h4><p>In the first 10 months of 2013, 1 million people joined the new private pension scheme, and we expect public interest to further this momentum. By 2023, our target is to have reached 10 million participants. We aim to have a GDP of $2.5 trillion by 2023 and for the AUM in pension schemes to comprise 5% to 10% of GDP, hence between $125 billion and $250 billion. We believe that these mid- to long-term targets are reasonable and attainable when our current status is compared with other emerging market economies.</p><h4>What remains to be accomplished to make Istanbul a regional and global financial center?</h4><p>This is a 10-year project, branching off to 60 sub-projects in diverse fields such as banking, insurance, capital markets, Islamic finance, technology, legal infrastructure, and financial literacy issues, to name a few. The legal basis for 38 of those 60 sub-projects has been completed, while some have yet to be implemented. The remaining 22 will be finished over the next couple of years. And as markets evolve, we will be responding to new needs as an ongoing process. This being said, we don't envision Istanbul merely being a financial center, but also a cultural and trade center, with a population of 18 million, making it bigger than many European countries. We have strong cultural ties with countries and people from the Balkans to Central Asia. Istanbul's proximity and central position in Eurasia provides us a unique advantage when compared to most other cities. Geographically, I would position Istanbul as one of the most strategic trade gateways in the world. And I would go so far as to say that between Frankfurt and Singapore, there really is no city to rival Istanbul.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for Aya, due for completion in 2015, and why did you choose Mar Mikhael as a location?</h4><p>When we first purchased the land in Mar Mikhael, the area was very poor; however, we believed that there was huge potential in this street because of the alignment of old houses and buildings and the atmosphere. We believed that we could sell a high-end project in this kind of area. We have very few offices and 44 apartments. We have already sold 70% of the project. We do not sell our retail spaces; we rent them. We have around 2,000 sqm of retail space that we are trying to develop into a dynamic area. Hence, we created a pedestrian “piezetta" in the center of the project, meaning people can walk around and enjoy coffee shops and restaurants. The architecture of the project is unique; it was designed by a French architect who took into consideration the urban aspect of the street. We tried to position the building in such a way to maximize views and spaces. There are two things that make this building stand out: preserving the original facade of the building currently on site and integrating it with the new building, which was really a challenge. The other challenge was how to build a tower that was not intrusive and in a way that reduced its visual impact on the street.</p><h4>In what ways is Har Properties committing to sustainability?</h4><p>When we started in Aya, I wanted it to be a green building. So, I contacted the LEED operator in Lebanon, and we decided to go green. There were only two or three buildings with this certificate. It is a challenge because there are many aspects that unfortunately cannot be avoided. The first being the electric generators, which are the biggest source of pollution. In order to get LEED Certification, there are a certain number of achievements that need to be reached, such as the white facade and the double-glazing, which helped us get our green building certification. However, for other developers, it can be a challenge to get this far.</p><div class="quote">“The authorities have to work on the urbanization of Beirut, because there is no plan."</div><h4>What is your vision for the future of Beirut's cityscape?</h4><p>The authorities have to work on the urbanization of Beirut, because there is no plan. Few developers are sensitive to the aesthetics of architecture; most of them do not care and are only concerned about profit. When your concern is profit, you do not care about the look of the city and the authorities do not control this. It really is a mess, and I hope that they work on an urban plan for Beirut to avoid more of the bad construction that you can see in the city. However, there are a few developers that do try to create pleasing projects, green buildings, and even contribute to the infrastructure in the area.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Upark, and what makes this project different?</h4><p>Many developers count on the diaspora, and for many years we tried to avoid the local Lebanese sector and target the diaspora; however, now we are targeting the Lebanese at home and we try to attract them here as well. That is why the size of apartments is smaller, because the purchasing power of local Lebanese is much less than the Lebanese living abroad. We try to encourage Lebanese expatriates to return and buy small apartments. This is why in one of our projects, Upark, we have started selling 76-sqm apartments, which is a studio apartment in Europe, although it is a little bigger than a studio in Paris, for example. Upark also has a 2,500-sqm garden. It is a very interesting project that we are trying to promote in a new area, which was previously an industrial zone. If you think of the evolution of London and New York, much of those cities were once industrial areas that have transformed into residential areas. We are trying to do the same for this area.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Raising Oman's competitiveness and productivity is at the heart of what the Public Authority for Investment Promotion &amp; Export Development (PAIPED) does. Boosting productivity is a matter of creating better links between education and industry and between technology and work. Indeed, we recognize that our prosperity depends on the wellbeing of our private sector. As part of the government's Vision 2020, we aim to create sustainable development and a macroeconomic framework that empowers the business community and develops our human resources capacity. We've made significant progress in this area, and here I should like to highlight the outstanding and important work that is being carried out in specific sectors. The Public Establishment for Industrial Estates (PEIE), the umbrella organization for the management of industrial parks in Oman, introduced a long-term strategy for 2011-2025, which plans to add a total of 133 million sqm of new land to its current industrial estates. The goal is to make the private sector the engine of growth for Oman's economy, and we at PAIPED are helping PEIE to attract foreign participation to meet that end. In the coming period, PEIE intends to invest over $180 million in large-scale extensions at industrial zones, which will provide more than 500 new plots to investors. Growth has surged in recent years, with total investment in industrial estates reaching $9.4 billion in 2011. Geography has proved to be a useful ally, as Oman is situated close to international trade routes. Opportunities as a global transshipment hub have been identified, and two of the most successful diversification projects of Vision 2020 have been the development of seaports. Today, Salalah Container Port competes with Abu Dhabi as the premier regional container hub. Our position as a trade hub has been exploited further by the establishment of free zones adjacent to the ports of Salalah and Sohar. So far, the zones have collectively attracted $3.5 billion in investment.</p><p>The 1,700-square-kilometer special economic zone (SEZ) at Duqm is another significant initiative for Oman and, with world-class infrastructure, we expect it to have a significant impact on our efforts to diversify Oman's economy in line with Vision 2020. According to the zone's master plan, there are numerous investment opportunities in Duqm, and over the next five years we expect it to receive between $6 billion and $8 billion of direct investment. The area around Duqm is also mineral rich with vast limestone, gypsum, salt, and dolomite deposits—this offers the possibility of it becoming a focus for mining and other associated industries. Given the work of the SEZ at Duqm, PEIE, and Oman's industrial base, the Sultanate's logistics and supply chain sector continues to grow and benefit from significant investment in infrastructure, warehousing, and transportation. The growth prospects and job opportunities in this positive sector are considerable as Oman seeks to take advantage of its strategic location outside the Strait of Hormuz and in close proximity to major shipping routes.</p><div class="quote">“Significant investment commitment has been made in regional areas, such as Duqm."</div><p>And you may ask what's driving Oman's logistic sector? The proposed GCC railway network will open up new, efficient, and cost-effective transport routes into the GCC market. The development of the railway network will be a game changer for Oman's logistics industry. The proposed GCC Customs Union, which is scheduled to happen in 2015, will be vital to allow the free movement of goods within the GCC. The continuing development of Oman's ports, roads, and airports are constantly increasing Oman's logistics efficiency and capabilities. Following on from the development of the industrial port at Sohar and the adjoining free zone, we see a significant and increasing demand for warehousing, particularly as freight traffic is pushed up from Port Sultan Qaboos and the free zone develops. The Port of Salalah has developed rapidly to become a major global transshipment hub, with the focus now shifting to further development of the neighboring free zone. The development of Duqm as a new industrial port and city is still in its nascent stages. However, we fully expect large-scale logistics facilities demand and development in Duqm over the coming years. The current development of Muscat International Airport includes increasing the freight handling capacity from 100,000 to 260,000 tons per year. These projects clearly demonstrate the significant potential for Oman's logistics sector.</p><p>Looking at tourism, the Ministry of Tourism predicts that more than 2,000 resort and hotel rooms will have been added in the 2012-13 period. The capital, Muscat, will experience maximum growth with nearly 726 new rooms, and there is an even spread of investment across the rest of Oman with niche resorts opening in Salalah, Khasab, and the Hajar Mountains. We are seeing strong investor demand in the tourism sector, especially in niche properties. This is a result of government-sponsored joint ventures through Oman and other private players. Overall, our approach is to ensure that five-star developments are located in natural landscapes. This approach gives us a competitive edge and fuels investment demand. Additional room supply also generates demand for improved products, with a recent example being the opening of Almouj Golf, a Greg Norman signature 18-hole golf course at The Wave, Muscat.</p><p>Significant investment commitment has been made in regional areas, such as Duqm, where three new hotels with a total of 391 rooms will be opened. Duqm City Hotel, Oman's first pre-fabricated 120-room business hotel opened mid-2012 and Crowne Plaza Duqm is now open for business and will host the Muscat Youth Summit in December 2013. There has also been huge interest in Oman's high altitude Hajar Mountains, where both government and private sector investment are on the rise. In response to the increasing number of tourists, three major resorts in Jebel Akhdar have been invested in. This is in addition to the Sunrise Resort on Jebel Asarh near Jebel Shams, which opened in early 2012. Property group Muriya opened its Sifawy Boutique Hotel at Jebel Sifah, 50 kilometers east of Muscat, in early 2012. Its Juweira Boutique Hotel at Salalah Beach opened mid-year. And this year we will see more hotels opening at Jebel Sifah and Salalah Beach.</p><p>Oman's entry into the global business and meetings market will also accelerate with the opening of the $400 million Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre (OCEC) in 2015. The OCEC project comprises a 3,000 seat plenary hall, 40,000 sqm of exhibition space, a business center, and four hotels totaling 1,000 rooms. Moreover, the re-development of Port Sultan Qaboos as a cruise-liner facility will have a major economic impact on both Muttrah and Muscat.</p><p>Fueling Oman's tourism, industrial, and logistics sectors is government spending in infrastructure. The government implemented 12 new projects from its Eighth Five-Year Plan at a total cost of $4.23 billion in 2012. These will add to the on-going Five-Year Plan projects, currently totaling $17.9 billion in value. Projects include the construction of the $2.59 billion Al Batinah Expressway and the Sur-Bidbid and Mahdha-Al Rawda dual carriageways. It is also important to mention the road-link project between Oman and Saudi Arabia. The road will pass through the Empty Quarter, one of the largest deserts in the world, and will facilitate trade between the two countries as well as pave the way for the economic development of the Dhahirah region.</p><p>The planned $16 billion railway project will also boost Oman's economic growth and sustainable development at the national and regional level and enhance economic integration, while also facilitating trade. The total length of the railway project in the Sultanate will be approximately 1,061 kilometers, extending from the line that connects the wilayat of Al Buraimi and Al Ain in the UAE to the wilayat of Sohar (136 kilometers), Sohar to the Muscat Governorate (242 kilometers), and Muscat to the wilayat of Duqm (486 kilometers). To ensure better connections with airports, ports, and power plants, the project will also include a number of sub branches in Al Buraimi (27 kilometers) to Sohar Industrial Port (8 kilometers), the central train station in Muscat near Muscat International Airport (20 kilometers), and the wilayat of Ibra (84 kilometers).</p><p>The railway line has been designed to carry passenger trains running at speeds of 200 kilometers per hour, and between 80 kilometers to 120 kilometers per hour for cargo trains.</p><p>With 3,165 kilometers of pristine coastline and a deep drop-off ocean shelf, Oman is a prime candidate for aquaculture. In recent years, the Omani government has expressed a desire to grow aquaculture operations, both as a means of diversifying the national economy and as a way to ensure domestic food security needs. The Omani aquaculture sector offers an array of potential opportunities for investors. Musandum and the Al Batinah, in particular, offer maximum potential.</p><p>Spearheaded by the Information Technology Authority, the use of IT to make government more responsible and in the process empower the citizens of our growing nation to make more of their lives is imperative. And, by 2015, we aim to move all government services online.</p><p>We believe that a government that is excelling in IT services is more productive, competitive, and efficient. Indeed, in recent years, the government has taken steps to make Oman an attractive place for high-tech businesses and innovation. In 2003, we opened Knowledge Oasis Muscat, a 68-hectare technology park that is today home to IT businesses from the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and North America. We are conscious that investors need certainty and transparency and Oman offers that. And my organization is busy working with international investors and businesses to ensure we can deliver on our plans and attract the right investment. I encourage prospective investors to make contact with PAIPED, and work with us to build new partnerships and support shared ambitions. By working together, we can seize the opportunities for mutual growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania's mobile market is growing at an incredible rate. What role has the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) played in facilitating that growth?</h4><p>The growth has been exponential. Right now, there are about 27 million SIM cards in the market. Yet, back in 2000, there were 284,000  and in 2004 there a mere 2 million. The regulatory framework has made this possible by allowing competition, which has played a great role in growth. We have over five active operators, including Vodacom, Airtel, Tigo, ZANTEL, and TTCL Mobile, as well as Sasatel and Benson Informatics. Competition is crucial and cannot thrive without a strong regulatory framework. Our framework is highly conducive to encouraging competition and our regulations highly detailed in terms of quality of service, consumer protection, and tariffs, amongst other considerations. I should also mention our licensing framework: the Converged Licensing Framework, which is technology and service neutral. There are four licenses; the first is the highly detailed Network Facility License for construction of communication infrastructure, be it wireless, fiber optics, towers, or other. There have recently been several major developments in this area, such as the landing of submarine cables in Dar es Salaam. Second, there is the Network Services License for the provision of voice, video, and data services. Third, there is the Application Services License, which is open-ended and includes internet provision, mobile banking, and other applications. Fourth, there is the Content Service License, which concerns radio and television, with digital broadcasting being the key focus in this area today. ICT policies have also been instrumental in growth in recent years.</p><h4>How, as a regulator, do you structure a framework conducive to new innovation?</h4><p>The Application Service License is deliberately very open-ended. If an operator comes to us with a new value added service or product, we do not require separate licenses, but merely an additional appendix to an existing one. In 2004, it was impossible to browse the internet on your mobile phone here. However, in 2005 we introduced a converged licensing framework, which included several types of license. In terms of financial transactions, ï‚‡ï‚‡ for example, institutions require central bank authorization, but in using the communications network they obtain authorization from the TCRA through application services licenses.</p><div class="quote">“ICT policies have also been instrumental in growth in recent years."</div><h4>Regulation-wise, how does Tanzania compare to its neighbors?</h4><p>The converged licensing framework was introduced in 2005, and many countries in the region have adopted the idea in other licensing frameworks.</p><h4>In terms of the goals for Tanzania's Development (Vision 2025), how do you plan to foster a greater level of technology, innovation, and competition?</h4><p>Our people have identified priorities such as agriculture, education, health, water, and transport among others. However, the issue in the ICT sector is crosscutting. In education, students can use ICT to facilitate learning. In health, telemedicine is set to gain importance thanks to its capacity to, say, enable a doctor to remotely direct an operation. In agriculture, it is also important, as it allows farmers to learn the price of goods electronically, and much more. There are priorities, but ICT has a crucial crosscutting role.</p><h4>What challenges does the ICT sector face?</h4><p>An example is cyber-security, which is a global dilemma. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) will be a unit dedicated to tackling cyber threats to all major stakeholders, such as mobile companies, banks, the police, and critical infrastructure including energy, water, transport, and so on. Another challenge is to combat the misuse of ICT, an example being individuals or companies generating unwanted SMS messages. To deal with this, we are introducing SIM registration. We also need to be more vigilant in content regulation for radio and television. There is a need for balance between freedom of speech, privacy, and security. The internet is a good tool that can be used in education and many other fields, but one that can also be misused. This is true for all ICTs, and there is need to promote peaceful uses for social and economic development.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Drydocks World (DDW) is one of the most important shipyards in operation, and the largest of its kind in the Middle East. To what extent does its success increase regional wealth and development?<br></h4><p>DDW is one of the world's largest and busiest shipyards. Its success lies in receiving vessels from all over the world, including some of the largest. It has contributed greatly to the reputation of the Emirate as a key destination for the maritime and offshore sectors by handling projects of great significance, not only for the maritime industry, but also for the oil, gas, and energy sectors.</p><h4>The company has seen rapid growth in different business lines. What were the drivers behind this incredible development?</h4><p>The company has a very clear vision and strategy. Our leaders built on this strategy by developing implementation and action plans, which positioned the company as a competent, trustworthy, and reliable choice among global players. Our marketing initiatives are driven by a value-added proposition and enhanced benefits for our clients, whom we consider our business partners. We encourage innovation in all fields of our activity that would help us in streamlining and increasing the efficiency of our operations. We have implemented processes that are best-in-the-business to increase efficiency, meet targets, and achieve our goals.</p><h4>DDW has continuously grown through new expansions. What new initiatives are you most excited about?</h4><p>We have grown from strength to strength in the last few years, and have managed not only to sustain the business, but also to raise the level of service delivery. I am particularly excited about our recent initiative to establish the Dubai Council for Marine and Maritime Industries in collaboration with major regional players. This Council plans and implements economic strategies to promote Dubai and the UAE as a global hub for marine and maritime industries and services, as well as sea transportation.</p><h4>How does DDW collaborate with government entities toward common success?</h4><p>DDW is itself a government of Dubai entity, and all of our initiatives are aimed at promoting Dubai as an increasingly important global hub for the maritime industry. We work extremely closely with the Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs-Dubai and Dubai Customs, with whom we have signed MoUs to facilitate closer cooperation on a daily basis. We also work closely with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Roads and Transport Authority, National Transport Authority (RTA), the UAE Navy, and other departments that share our vision.</p><h4>DDW is not only present in the Middle East, but also in Southeast Asia through its joint venture DDW-PaxOcean Asia. What kind of synergies do you develop among your different regions?</h4><p>The synergies are clear. Both DDW and DDW-PaxOcean are aligned in the strategy and business-planning process. In addition to repairs and conversion, the yards are focused on the oil, gas, energy, and offshore new building and construction areas, including the building of highly sophisticated marine vessels and structures.</p><h4>Why is it important to have a strong presence in Dubai?</h4><p>We were set up in Dubai, confirming the far-sighted vision of our leaders. We have moved forward from merely being a repair yard to being one with an established and global reputation for conversions, shipbuilding, and offshore construction. The yard has implemented not only some of the largest projects ever undertaken, but also a number of world-first initiatives. The connectivity afforded by the Emirate, combined with its user-friendly business environment, is unmatched anywhere in the world.</p><h4>How does DDW fit into the UAE's Vision 2030?</h4><p>Our vision and strategy for the year 2030 is clearly defined. We are driven to achieving the four Rs; re-focused thinking, re-engineered solutions, re-energized interest, and re-positioned execution, which we as a company continually strive to achieve. Our core theme is “Business Transformation through Continuous Innovation."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant will operations at London Gateway and Embraport be to the company's overall portfolio?<br></h4><p>DP World operates more than 65 marine terminals across six continents including new developments underway in India, Africa, Europe, South America and the Middle East. London Gateway and Embraport represent DP World's commitment to invest in line with customer and market demands, wherever they may be. These two projects, on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean trade route, embody our focus on emerging markets with continued involvement in more mature markets. The significance of London Gateway cannot be over-emphasized. It is one of the newest and brightest stars among the world's deep-sea port and logistics centers with the port's initial capacity of 1.6 million TEUs when it opens in 4Q2013, and a logistics park of some 9.25 million square feet—Europe's largest, located on London's doorstep and the heart of the continent's largest economic zone. As a hub, it will benefit UK business by allowing importers and exporters to take advantage of a more cost-effective, greener way of getting the nation's goods to consumers, adding an estimated £3.2 billion to the economy each year, taking around 2,000 trucks a day off the road, and thus reducing carbon emissions by an estimated 148,000 tons and creating 12,000 jobs directly. Embraport is built adjacent to Porto de Santos, Brazil's largest container terminal, 90% of whose cargo is destined for Sío Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, some 80 kilometers away. When it opens in 2013 with an initial capacity of 1 million TEUs, it will play a significant role as a contributor to the world's sixth largest economy by delivering DP World's signature productivity gains and increased competitiveness. It will also strengthen our position as a gateway to South America in partnership with our other terminals in Buenos Aires in the south, Callao on the west coast and Paramaribo in the northeast of the continent.</p><h4>What does the strength of being globally present mean in terms of providing the widest range of solutions?</h4><p>Connectivity is the hallmark of global trade, around 90% of which is carried by sea. With our extensive network of facilities globally, we are able to offer traders and shipping lines the widest choice of logistics solutions supported by our proven efficiency and customer service. Our vision is to create sustainable value through global growth, service and excellence, and we aim to be where our customers need us to be.</p><h4>What has been the development strategy of DP World in the region over past years in light of the tremendous growth in the UAE?</h4><p>DP World's development strategy is underpinned by a global approach to a local business environment. Our focus on exceptional service, innovation, and commitment to our people and our customers has helped retain our position as the Middle East's leading port operator for more than a quarter of a century. The fact that our Dubai ports handled more than 100 million TEUs between January 2003 and January 2013 reflects the role our ports have played in supporting the tremendous growth experienced by the UAE. We continue to invest in Jebel Ali for the future. In June, we added 1 million TEUs by extending the quay wall of Container Terminal 2 (T2) by 400 meters. Across the harbor the brand new 4 million TEUs Container Terminal 3 (T3) is on schedule for opening in 2014, taking the capacity at Jebel Ali to 19 million TEU.</p><div class="quote">“Our vision is to create sustainable value through global growth, service and excellence."</div><h4>Why have volumes fallen in the Asia-Pacific and India subcontinent, the Americas, and Australia?</h4><p>In fact, volumes grew in 2012, including in the second half. We handled a record 56 million TEUs globally, with the Asia Pacific and Indian Subcontinent region up 6%, and the Americas and Australia region up 4%. Volumes in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe region fell by 2% due to the challenging climate in Europe.</p><h4>What other services does DP World provide in order to offer a complete service?</h4><p>As a market leader in the global marine terminal industry, DP World provides a range of services designed to enhance customers' supply chain efficiencies, including bringing together container, general cargo, bulk, and other terminals, free zones, intermodal, logistics facilities, customs services, infrastructure developments and consultancy services. We also operate two cruise terminals in Mina Rashid, Dubai and Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p><h4>How strategically important is India for the company's operations?</h4><p>We have a long-term commitment to India, and it is a very important part of our global network. We were delighted to have bid successfully to build a new 800,000 TEU terminal adjacent to our existing facility at Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, the subcontinent's busiest container gateway. We were the port's first private partner in 1997 with Nhava Sheva International Container Terminal (NSICT), and together with the port we have played a key role in serving India's growing trade over more than a decade. Our new development, which comes barely two years after the inauguration of the brand new port we built at Vallarpadam, Cochin, reflects the trust India places in our ability to support its development plans.</p><h4>What kind of an impact has increased security and counter-piracy tactics had on operations at DP World?</h4><p>Piracy has had no direct impact on our business. However, it adds a huge economic cost in trade, and an enormous humanitarian cost in attacked and captive seafarers and their families. DP World has taken the lead, in partnership with the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to bring governments and industry together to focus international attention on the issue through our counter-piracy conferences held annually since 2011. During this period piracy in the Gulf of Aden has dropped notably, and we continued our efforts with the third conference in September 2013.</p><h4>What is your outlook for shipping volumes in China, Europe, and the Middle East in 2013?</h4><p>As a publicly listed company, we do not make forecasts. Various commentators are suggesting something of a slowdown this year. Drewry Shipping Consultants have reported continued low levels of cargo growth in the trade lane between Asia and the Mediterranean in 2Q. Westbound containerised exports were at 1.24 million TEU, 7% up on the same period of 2012, while eastbound were at 524,000 TEU, still 14% up on 2Q 2012.</p><p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) expects international trade growth to remain sluggish at around 3.3% in 2013, suppressed by the Eurozone slowdown. And the IMF has recently reduced its forecast for global growth to 3.1% from 3.3%.</p><h4>What are your growth targets for 2013-2014?</h4><p>We are confident about the long-term outlook of our industry and our growth prospects, and are well positioned to deal with the changing economic environment. We remain focused on new capacity to add value to our customers, as we did throughout the recession. We also remain dedicated to improving efficiencies, handling higher margin containers.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Dubai as a hub?<br></h4><p>Dubai is a hub, which brings a few benefits; however, it is not the only hub that we operate from. We also have another hub in the region; Salalah in Oman. Dubai brings one major benefit, which is a very large local market. Not only do we have the ability to service the rest of the Gulf, but we also have a large local market, which means that we are not only bringing products to Dubai to move them out further afield, but are also bringing assets here to support large local business. Dubai has a very unique position in this sense.</p><h4>Do you provide tailor-made solutions for different companies?</h4><p>The shipping industry is a very low-margin business. Some people would argue that it is even commoditized. In that respect, going tailor-made in our part of the supply chain is not ideal. Our business is about volumes. We need to have fairly high utilization levels to make the market function. Like an airline, our products are perishable. Once our ship has left the port the product disappears. We cannot put it in a warehouse and sell it next week. We have to sell it this week. If there is no cargo on the ship this week, then that opportunity has disappeared. That means tailor-made products are not something that you see a lot of in this industry. We meet our clients' needs in terms of service offerings around the product. This service aspect is more tailor-made.</p><h4>What has been your development strategy in the region for the past few years, and what is it today?</h4><p>The major change in the focus of the industry, and for us as a company, is that exports are growing at a faster rate than imports. As a shipping company, we have to be much more focused on being able to service export needs. Traditionally, the region has played host to import-driven business because there is limited production, and consumables are mostly imported. There has not been much export cargo. But that is now changing. The companies here in Dubai and the region are now increasing their output. We have observed the flows in our business changing. It used to be that for every container leaving the Gulf two would be coming in. That is changing now. We are now down to a ratio of 1.6 or 1.7. The balance of trade is starting to shift.</p><h4>What is your relationship with Jebel Ali Port and other government authorities?</h4><p>I meet with the authorities fairly often. They visit and I participate in various forums and discussions. Officials have recently been here to discuss their ideas related to creating a green economy, and wondered if we would become a partner in that. As to our relationship with DP World, I think it is well known that Maersk is one of its biggest customers both locally and around the world. We have a very close relationship.</p><h4>What is your relationship with Safmarine?</h4><p>Safmarine is owned by Maersk. We keep it as a separate commercial entity, since it offers a different, more personal product experience, despite offering largely the same product as Maersk Line. As a brand, Safmarine is better suited to smaller companies, whereas Maersk Line is more suited to large industrial companies. It's all about branching out and covering different needs in the market.</p><h4>How do you assess Dubai's relationship with Africa?</h4><p>Personally, I think it is really important that Dubai does not lose its affiliation with Africa. I say this because we are very involved on that continent—we have many people on the ground there. In fact, we are present in practically every African country. Africa is big business for us, and is a market that we expect to continue growing in the future. Dubai has a long-standing tradition of facilitating trade to and from Africa, and I think its important that Dubai continues to nurture and protect this position in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the vision to further develop infrastructure in combination with the World Expo 2020 bid impact Dubai's logistics industry?<br></h4><p>From day one, Dubai was built on trade, and the vision has always been to facilitate and expand the Emirate as a business base. Dubai has always led the region with this vision, even as far back as 100 years ago. Dubai seeks to create a platform for business people to do business with minimum bureaucracy and maximum efficiency and speed. As part of the supply chain and the logistics industry here—and it's truly a huge industry—we want to contribute our share to building a platform in which business runs as easily and smoothly as possible through a multitude of platforms. Dubai is all about trade and services. Our task is to make sure Dubai keeps going forward and remains a worldwide hub for trade and services, serving a region of nearly 2 billion inhabitants. In terms of World Expo 2020, an Expo needs the efficient and effective logistics and transport platform to be successful, as it involves more than 25 million visitors in six months, and thousands of companies setting up activities. We are working hard to make sure that this is being facilitated in the most efficient way possible. Thus, we are building infrastructure, integrating processes, developing technology, and doing everything in our power to make sure that whenever there is demand for moving and transporting goods, be it by land, sea, or air, we are there to take care of it in the most efficient manner.</p><h4>What is the significance of Dubai as a logistics hub for DP World's activities?</h4><p>Jebel Ali is the flagship port of DP World, and the success of DP World is based on the success of Dubai. The Emirate's mindset and ours is the same—it's about providing the best business practices. We were even asked by our customers' shipping lines to extend our operations beyond Dubai because they needed the same philosophy that Dubai and DP World followed to be extended and applied in other places—they could see the value that this unique mindset and philosophy added to their businesses. We met the requirements of our customers, and that is what this business is all about. Now, DP World has a portfolio of more than 65 marine terminals across six continents, including new developments underway in India, Africa, Europe, South America, and the Middle East. When people hear that we're from Dubai, they are interested in us. Customers come to us and ask us to handle or examine their port because they know the success that we've brought about here in Dubai. In 2012, we handled 13.3 million TEUs at Jebel Ali Port, which is huge in comparison to the population of Dubai or the UAE as a whole. These containers are serviced and transported to other regions, countries, and cities in the GCC, the Gulf region, India, Central Asia, East Africa, and beyond. Dubai has become an international hub; both passengers and cargo are arriving and passing through. The biggest businesses and new businesses have a presence or are setting up shop in Dubai, because it is in the right location between East and West, North and South.</p><h4>How is the maritime industry beginning to change?</h4><p>The industry is mainly driven by the transport and shipping industry, but the dynamics are now changing, and the shipping sector is changing along with it. Ships today are massive. Whereas a ship from 1991 could carry only 6,000 containers, today there are ships that can carry 18,000 containers. As these ships today have become bigger, they have also become longer to the point where they can only access certain ports that have the capacity—ports like Jebel Ali. By 2014, if 10 of those 18,000 TEU ships arrive—the largest ships in the world—we can handle them all simultaneously at Jebel Ali Port. We handle more than 170 shipping lines where more than 90 plus weekly services connecting the Jebel Ali port to over 100 ports worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the authority with regard to creating an investment environment for the maritime and logistics industry?<br></h4><p>The Dubai Maritime City Authority (DMCA) is a tribute to the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. The creation of this authority represents the pioneering spirit of the city itself, as it provides world-class infrastructure complemented by seamless and progressive policies that will allow businesses in the maritime industry to meet their commercial objectives. The DMCA authority provides a platform for excellence and quality, as it nurtures the ambitions of Dubai to build on its leadership position within the region as the ideal business hub for the maritime industry. DMCA's aim is to connect all aspects of the maritime industry by providing rules and regulations that build on best practices in a consistent and responsible manner. The authority aims to play an important role in promoting the maritime industry to both government and non-government bodies, and is positioned to be the catalyst of growth for the maritime sector. DMCA's posture of cooperation and dialogue allows companies and individuals to navigate through operational complexities, while focusing on their strategic goals within this dynamic sector. DMCA is the gateway to Dubai's maritime sector. In line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, DMCA has a mandate to create and provide efficient processes and protocols that will allow companies to interact and operate effectively within the sector. The authority takes responsibility for establishing rules and regulations, as well as providing administrative infrastructure allowing businesses to operate efficiently. Our core strategic objectives are aligned to add value to all stakeholders by collaborating and nurturing partnerships among government entities, private companies, and NGOs.</p><h4>How will the vision to further develop this sector in combination with the World Expo 2020 bid impact Dubai's maritime industry?</h4><p>In Dubai, we have successfully developed what I can safely say is the first of its kind; a 360-degree approach to developing the maritime cluster in the Emirate of Dubai. There are many hidden treasures that we are trying to cultivate and bring together to create the world's leading maritime center here. Dubai has a very rich maritime heritage, and the city is aware of the fact that the maritime products that it offers now need to continuously expand. The Emirate has to be constantly renovated and always focused on bringing new products for it to succeed globally and sustainably. This is exactly what we are doing with the maritime sector strategy in line with the World Expo 2020 bid. In Dubai, there is a vision of excellence that we take from His Highness, who pushes us daily to be innovative and creative in developing regulations that help businesses thrive and make their lives easier, and thus they become more interested in investing in Dubai.</p><h4>Considering the fact that maritime traffic in Dubai is expected to increase exponentially until 2020 and beyond, what needs to be built to facilitate this development?</h4><p>If you look at the waterfront and coastal areas of Dubai, it is extremely busy relative to our size. There are many larger ships as well as individual yachts and traffic around Dubai Creek, and there are also traditional dhows that come and go every day. It is clear that things will continue to expand. We realize that there is huge growth coming our way and that there will be more traffic. According to the marine map that we have developed, we have four main achievements that will make this increase in traffic run smoothly. Firstly, we regulated maritime operations. All maritime specialists know that larger ships, when they come to certain ports or cities, need to perform certain activities, such as bunkering or ship-to-ship transfers. We have dedicated specific zones for these operations. The larger ship traffic will therefore never interfere with passenger traffic, for which we have also designated particular areas. Individuals with jet skis or yachts also have dedicated sailing areas. Finally, we have clearly marked all of the passenger and work areas with hundreds of buoys and floating navigational devices, creating a 300-meter buffer zone from the beach for individual sailors and pleasure sailing. Our main product offering is maritime regulation, and we work with the best of global and regional consultants to develop it in such a way that we do not enforce, but “engage" industry leaders in a negotiated regulatory process to develop forward-thinking maritime relations.</p><div class="quote">“We educate the public on a regular basis with simple, straightforward messages that will save lives."</div><h4>How do you distribute the new regulations to the people they affect?</h4><p>We have a multi-fold strategy of communication. For example, implementing regulations for Law No. 11 of 2010 for licensing and registering marine craft in Dubai were issued in May 2013. The moment such by-laws were implemented we started with a multi-layered strategy. We approach private sector companies operating in the maritime sector, retail maritime companies, and governmental bodies that will be affected, and conduct one-on-one meetings with all of them. We also carry out mass media communication, advertisements, and sponsorships—all kinds of marketing activities—to try to get the message out. We also work with the Dubai marine police and our friends in the coast guard to make them aware of what needs to be done.</p><h4>How does the maritime sector benefit from the significance of Dubai as an international maritime hub?</h4><p>On the one hand, the Dubai equity of excellence is strong. Dubai has succeeded in establishing itself globally as a paradigm of success and a beacon of achievement in business, tourism, and commerce. We have developed dynamic, forward-thinking, and business-friendly maritime regulations that maximize business oportunities, and make it very easy for maritime investors to do their work in Dubai. This is what Dubai is all about; enabling people to make the most of their business.</p><h4>What are the major achievements of the authority in regulating the maritime sector and providing people with a regulatory framework?</h4><p>The maritime authority is working closely with all of the different actors, and this way of working is an achievement in itself. We do not live and work alone—everything we do affects other organizations. For this reason, a close working relationship is important. We think in a young, progressive, forward-thinking way, which is focused on maximizing success for commercial enterprises. Our vision is to create a safe and vibrant maritime environment. One of our achievements in safety has been establishing that life jackets at sea are as important as seatbelts in a car. We educate the public on a regular basis with simple, straightforward messages that will save lives. We go to schools and give lectures, we develop and publish boating best-practice documents that we make available, and we work to improve awareness of safety at sea. On the corporate side, we develop regulations that would never hurt businesses.</p><h4>What kind of relationships do you have with other maritime authorities in the region and the UAE?</h4><p>Our philosophy is to address the needs of the maritime industry with all parties concerned. The UAE is blessed with a very stable political system, and we enjoy that. Each Emirate has its own priorities when it comes to maritime strategies, but all share an important vision, which is to develop a unique and pioneering maritime center in the UAE. A recent example was a meeting with the Abu Dhabi Department of Transport, at which we shared our best practices when it comes to registering marine craft, and its officials shared with us how they are approaching the same topic.</p><h4>What is your future outlook for DMCA?</h4><p>The future is clear as it is mentioned in our vision statement. We aim to create a safe and vibrant maritime environment. We are creating a maritime context that is competitive, successful, and sustainable. It is competitive in that it will continue to be a first choice for investors in terms of maritime investment, successful in that it brings valuable contributions to the GDP of the Emirate, and also sustainable in that we are not working only to make Dubai's maritime sector competitive now, but to be successful for the next 50 to 100 years. We want to bring a lot of Emiratis into this sector, and share our excitement about its future.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Emirates NBD was listed in October 2007 on the Dubai Financial Market as a result of a merger between Emirates Bank International and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD). What strengths did the bank achieve by combining the second and fourth largest banks in the UAE?</h4><p>Through the merger, we became the largest bank in the UAE and one of the leading banks in the Middle East. We have achieved a great synergy between the two banks and this has added to the economy of Dubai, and the UAE as a whole. The rationale behind the merger was to create a large and strong bank that is capable of expanding both regionally and internationally. One of the focal points that needed to be highlighted was that the NBD was the first bank in the UAE. It began its operations in 1963, prior to the creation of the UAE Union in 1971. The bank has a long heritage, deeply rooted in the culture of the UAE, and this has allowed it to play a vital role in shaping Dubai. There are several companies that have made a difference in the city, and the bank supported many of the start-up projects from 1963 to the 1980s. The success of the bank is irrelevant compared to the success of the city. Without Dubai, the bank would not be as big as it is; therefore, we are linked. The success of Dubai, having the right business base and being a multinational economy, has supported the financial sector and guaranteed the success of the city's economy. Dubai's trade is international. A large majority of the imported goods to this country are coming in a transit capacity. Similarly, Dubai Airport is now the second biggest in the world, and has surpassed other prominent and leading airports around the globe. Dubai has created the right circumstances to become the international hub that it is, and this is reflected in the success of its financial institutions and our bank. Dubai has a unique character and a different flavor to other GCC countries. It is a genuinely multicultural place, but the locals still manage to keep their own traditions. As a modern and established city, Dubai has an excellent and unsurpassable infrastructure, allowing families to live comfortably and to prosper. Dubai's welcoming environment invites talent and business from around the world as well as a large number of tourists who visit the UAE for leisure purposes. Ultimately, it is the result of the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, as his vision for the city is what has brought about this success. His Highness is the strong driving force that is leading Dubai in the right direction.</p><h4>Which products do customers demand the most from the bank?</h4><p>Any customer that needs financial services looks for a full range of banking services. All customer needs, starting from opening an account to obtaining finance for cars, mortgages, credit cards, and travel, among many others, must be fulfilled from our side. The services must be accessible too, and Emirates NBD has excelled in terms of technology and the offering of technology platforms to its customers. Today, Emirates NBD has a physical side as well as a virtual offering, and we have focused on user-friendly services by developing applications for all platforms, namely the iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android. For our consumers, Emirates NBD offers a host of products and services as well as banking packages and investment opportunities that provide exceptional privileges for our Priority Banking and Private Banking customers. At the same time, we are a very sophisticated bank in terms of our corporate services making Emirates NBD a major player in the corporate banking arena.</p><div class="quote">“Emirates NBD actively participates, supports, and in many cases leads these sukuk projects."</div><h4>You won the “eBanking 2013 Excellence Award" for best mobile banking application. What is the customer profile of Emirates NBD?</h4><p>We cater to a wide range of profiles, and from a broader perspective, we are catering to every person in this country. Today, we are looking at being a fully fledged bank, and we look to every customer and do our utmost to address their specific needs. If we categorize our customers into age brackets, education level, and through other demographic statistics, we have profiles for these customers. For example, for the eldest category, these customers would not typically use technology, so for those customers we have our branches and staff that help them with everything they need. When it comes to our younger customers, we provide them with mobile banking services through enhanced platforms that allow them to easily and safely access their accounts and carry out transactions even when they are on the go. On the corporate front, we have platforms for SMEs as well as large local and international corporations and financial institutions.</p><h4>You are present not only in the UAE and GCC region, but also in China, Singapore, the UK, and Egypt, amongst others. What opportunities does Emirates NBD foresee in these markets?</h4><p>The opportunities depend on the country. Take Saudi Arabia for example. There are many financial institutions there, and it is a very large market. We are one of the financial institutions proud to have a presence in the country. It is a GCC nation with a huge economic base, and as a bank we have developed an excellent reputation in the market there. Emirates NBD has been there since 2003, and the bank is doing a successful business. The Saudi market is very sophisticated, and in fact we are learning a lot from this market. We do not see Saudi Arabia as being a different country, but rather a natural extension of our own market and economy. When we set up abroad, we do so with the intent of supporting our customers' expansion plans in new markets. Dubai, and the UAE, is a regional hub, so many of our customers already have established businesses in their country of origin. Unfortunately, we are not always able to set up in another country as most of them have restrictions on financial institution licenses. This idea of growing with our customers is part of our broader attempt to offer a complete range of services.</p><h4>HH Sheikh Mohammed envisions Dubai as a global center for the sukuk market and Islamic finance. Do you see any opportunities within this sector for Emirates NBD?</h4><p>Emirates NBD actively participates, supports, and in many cases leads these sukuk projects. We are certainly supporting His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai's vision to establish Dubai as a center for Islamic banking. Emirates NBD provides its clients a variety of Islamic banking offerings through its subsidiary, Emirates Islamic Bank, which has almost 70 branches across the UAE. We also have an Islamic banking window within Emirates NBD called Al Watani Al Islami, which offers sharia-compliant banking.</p><h4>Which products and services do you find your customers demand the most from your bank?</h4><p>Emirates NBD is a bank that caters to a variety of customer segments. After the merger, Emirates NBD has been able to provide its customers with services ranging from retail to corporate to private to investment banking. If the question is whether we can cater to any customer, I can proudly say, “yes," regardless of whether it is Islamic or non-Islamic banking. The merger has created a banking group that caters for anyone. We are seeing more activity on the corporate side for advisory services and more movement on the real estate front. I think many areas have seen significant improvements and growth, for example with credit cards. This area has seen significant growth, and this is also the case with SMEs. We have the biggest SME portfolio in the country.</p><h4>What efforts do you make to attract and retain skilled staff?</h4><p>We are in the service industry, and the most important part of that is the human talent. Therefore, we have made a huge investment in terms of human capital, as this is the organization's most valued asset. Emirates NBD has more than 9,000 staff, representing more than 60 nationalities, and we can proudly say that they will always be the pillars of the Group's success. We always focus on ensuring that our staff are happy and that they are sufficiently trained to be among the best in the region, and we do this by hosting a number of programs that cater to employee development and career growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the DCAA within the economy of Dubai, and the tourism and transport sectors?<br></h4><p>The DCAA is mandated by Law No 22/2007, as amended by Law No. 19 of 2010, to define the general policy of civil aviation in the Emirate of Dubai, manage civil aviation operations to secure aero-political rights for the designated airlines in the Emirate, and their implementation. Through the above functions and powers, the DCAA works toward achieving a safe and efficient air transport framework within Dubai, connecting it to the global network and facilitating and sustaining the growth of the local economy. The success of Dubai's aviation industry has a direct impact on the Emirate. It contributes around 28% of its GDP. The DCAA also coordinates with the other transport sectors and the tourism industry. The tourism industry goes hand-in-hand with air transport. While not directly visible as such, there is an indirect contribution of our role in the tourism sector. Multi-mode transportation in the cargo industry is prominent. However, compared to the growth of passenger air transport, there does not seem to be an equally great demand for multi-modal passenger transportation. The DCAA provides leadership in monitoring the implementation of the Dubai Aviation Sector Strategy to ensure that Dubai becomes the aviation capital of the world.</p><h4>How will the Dubai's vision to further develop the infrastructure, in combination with the World Expo 2020 bid, impact Dubai's aviation industry?</h4><p>Upgrades to Terminal 3 and the development of Al Maktoum International Airport (AMIA) are being carried out pursuant to the Master Plan 2020, which is designed to meet a projected demand of 115 million passengers and 570,000 aircraft movements per annum. The success of Dubai 'sairlines in providing global connectivity, and the demand to be created by World Expo 2020, have prompted the authorities to revise the strategic plans extending to 2045, and further develop infrastructure to facilitate growth. Through this process, we also contribute to the development of the aviation infrastructure for the benefit of the global aviation industry and the traveling public.</p><h4>How do the main airlines operating from Dubai cooperate to improve in terms of efficiency and the sustainability of the sector?</h4><p>Airlines as stakeholders will have their individual needs and concerns. The main airlines that operate out of Dubai are those designated by the Emirate to conduct international air transport. Their needs and concerns require projection in a strategic plan. Indeed, output would be meaningless without their participation. We have developed a shared understanding to formulate our policies in order to achieve the best results. Although our role differs from those operating out of Dubai and coming into it, we are committed to equally facilitating the airlines that are operating into Dubai.</p><div class="quote">“The success of Dubai's aviation industry has a direct impact on the Emirate."</div><h4>What are the biggest challenges Dubai's aviation industry faces?</h4><p>The exponential growth of passenger numbers, coupled with air traffic movements, pose a serious challenge to the aviation industry in terms of capacity on the ground and in the air. They are adequately addressed separately by infrastructure development bodies and through the negotiation of airspace structure enhancement.</p><h4>What needs to be built in order to facilitate development and maintain the open skies policy?</h4><p>The Strategic Plan 2020 is designed to support the expansion of Dubai International so as to meet envisaged demand growth. Approximately $8 billion in investment has been made to continue infrastructure development, which will respond to the 10-year traffic forecast. The development plan includes the expansion of Terminal 2. The construction of Concourse 3 has already concluded and it is in operation. The construction of Concourse D, which will be connected to Terminal 1, is also in progress. Furthermore, an additional 30,000 sqm of cargo space will be built. Upon the completion of the ongoing projects, Dubai International will have the capacity to handle 90 million passengers. Eventually, AMIA will be developed as a second hub to accommodate 160 million extra passengers.</p><h4>What are the major achievements that DCAA has reached in regulating civil aviation and providing an adequate regulatory framework?</h4><p>Dubai does not believe in an over-regulated industry. We adhere to the international standards and recommended practices of the ICAO, the aviation law, and the regulations of the federal government. We implement these, and also ensure stakeholder compliance. The framework established for a safe and secure air transport industry, compared to the number and volume of the movements of aircraft, passengers, and cargo within the Emirate itself is a major achievement. We also ensure that the industry functions with due regard to the environment.</p><h4>How do you orchestrate your policies in response to diverse requests for landing and operations in Dubai?</h4><p>Our policy includes the provision of excellent services to our customers. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, recently announced an innovative concept of “m-government" (mobile government), which transforms the e-government process to mobile. HH Sheikh Mohammed also directed federal and local government entities to implement the concept within a period of two years with a view to providing an efficient and excellent service to customers. Currently, we handle scheduled and ad—hoc operations through a 24/7 service and several other approval processes using the e-government system. We will be transforming the current processes to the m-government environment in the near future, keeping in line with the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed, and to enhance our customer-friendly service further.</p><h4>What relationship do you maintain with other local aviation authorities and government entities?</h4><p>We have an excellent relationship with the other emirates and the federal authorities. DCAA and the Dubai Travel and Tour Agents Group (DTTAG) recently signed an MoU to cooperate with travel business activities within Dubai.</p><h4>What common actions do you aim to take to facilitate the development of the tourism industry?</h4><p>We place importance on education and the development of leadership skills for the local community. This will ensure a productive, well-educated workforce in the tourism industry capable of contributing to the growth of the aviation industry in Dubai, and also have a significant impact on potential students, families, schools, and the broader community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will Dubai's Vision 2020 impact the logistics industry?<br></h4><p>Dubai's Vision 2020 aims to build on the economic and social progress of the city. Winning the World Expo 2020 bid, an integral part of the 2020 Vision, will have a tremendous impact on Dubai and the UAE's economy. Businesses of all sizes, from both the public and private sectors, will be involved in one form or the other, fuelling growth across all major industries in the country, including logistics. We expect demand for international and domestic shipping to increase as the country prepares to host the World Expo. This will be an exciting time for FedEx and the logistics industry in Dubai. The economic impact after the World Expo takes place will reinforce Dubai's position as a key economic and trade hub, attracting more SMEs and large corporations to set up their businesses in the city, which, in return, will sustain the need for express shipping and logistic solutions.</p><h4>What is the significance of Dubai as a hub for FedEx?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the largest trade hubs in the world, and the largest re-export hub in the region. With its excellent infrastructure facilities, Dubai plays an important role for FedEx's operations in the Middle East, Indian subcontinent, and Africa region. The city's access to large regional and global markets, its open trade and investment policies, transparent global business practices, as well as its strong macroeconomic environment are some of the reasons that make the Emirate a preferred business destination. It is also why FedEx chose Dubai as its regional headquarters in 1989. Dubai invests in its world-class infrastructure, such as global air connectivity, and creating a friendly business climate with the establishment of free zones such as Dubai Airport Freezone and Jebel Ali. Today, key sectors, such as oil and gas, engineering goods, food, metals, luxury goods, automotive, and aviation, are all major contributors to the growth of Dubai and its logistics sector. As a global aviation and logistics hub, Dubai plays an integral role in our global network. We fly 34 aircraft a week through our Dubai hub, connecting our region to global markets through our hubs in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p><h4>What does FedEx do to attract and retain talent?</h4><p>At FedEx, we put a lot of effort in being an employer of choice to attract the right talent. The positive word-of-mouth from our team members and being recognized among the top three places to work in the UAE by the Great Place to Work institute for three consecutive years are major factors that help us attract talent. Our people are always at the heart of everything we do. FedEx's People-Service-Profit (PSP) philosophy is based on the belief that by taking care of our people, they, in turn, will deliver the impeccable service demanded by our customers, who will reward us with the profitability necessary to secure our future. We continuously recognize and reward team members who demonstrate exceptional performance by going above and beyond their set roles and responsibilities. Additionally, as part of our corporate culture and philosophy of putting people first, managers are encouraged to remain available, open, and transparent. This fosters an environment of two-way communication between the managers and their team members. We also heavily invest in training our team members and encouraging promotion from within. FedEx recently won the INSIGHTS Middle East award for the “Best Career and Skills Path," which is a testament to our people development initiatives.</p><h4>What are FedEx's policies to respond to the different demands of its customers?</h4><p>The Purple Promise, “Making every customer experience outstanding," defines our service quality. We deliver this promise across every customer touch point, including our couriers, websites, and customer service team. As much as the fundamentals of every shipping need is the same, which is moving goods from one place to another in the fastest and most reliable manner, the requirements of various industries do vary. We look at each business' requirement individually, and adapt our operations and technology to meet the different demands of each customer. FedEx also supports the growth of local SMEs with tailored solutions. For example, the Dubai-based confectionary, Chocodate, expanded its reach globally by using FedEx's customized shipping solutions, enabling it to gain access to over 35 international markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the department reaffirm the ongoing support of the government for the real estate sector?<br></h4><p>The Land Department was established in 1960 by an order of His Highness Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the late ruler of Dubai, in order to safeguard the property rights of the city during the building of the UAE, and lay the foundations for the Union. With the establishment of the Land Department, the subsequent growth of one of the most important real estate hubs in the Middle East and the world emerged, giving birth to the brilliant boom of the sector. Falling under the umbrella of the Dubai Executive Council, headed by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, the Land Department continued striving to provide a comprehensive range of real estate services, most notably overseeing sales transactions, regulations, and the registration of all transactions. The Land Department offers exceptional services with the efforts of a qualified national workforce, operating under a client-centric approach. This work ethic is based on a corporate culture of productivity and competitiveness, which draws from the UAE Vision 2021.</p><h4>What is the role of the department in providing an attractive investment environment for the real estate sector?</h4><p>The Land Department seeks to become a beacon for real estate in the region and the world, with developments that will elevate the sector with help from active departments that include Real Estate Regulation (the regulatory arm), Real Estate Investment Management &amp; Promotion Centre (the investment arm), and Dubai Real Estate Institute (the educational arm). The Land Department provides over 164 comprehensive services to customers, going beyond registration and titling to provide a fully integrated experience for its customers. The department is also active in the development of the necessary legislation to propel the real estate sector in Dubai, along with organizing and promoting real estate investment, as well as the distribution of knowledge in real estate. The Land Department offers exceptional services with the efforts of a qualified national workforce, working hard to provide the best services and facilities for clients. This work ethic is based on a corporate culture of productivity and competitiveness, which draws from the UAE Vision 2021.</p><h4>How has Dubai's real estate market and solid investor confidence improved over the years since the credit crunch?</h4><p>The Dubai real estate market is back on track. Recently, we revealed figures that show the total value of real estate transactions in Dubai for 1H2013 at AED108 billion from a total of 30,469 transactions—an increase of 30% from the same period of the year before. This reinforces the positive trend of the market over the past two years, bringing the total number of transactions in 2012 to AED154 billion, an 8% increase from 2011. The high percentage of growth reflects ongoing real estate developments in the Emirate that continue to attract local and international investors to Dubai. The real estate market in Dubai continues to provide an ideal environment for investment in terms of durability, flexibility, and transparency. Investors continue to capitalize on opportunities that have arisen from price corrections witnessed in the market over the past two years. The price index has shown an upward trend over the past few months as a result of increasing demand to purchase land, villas, and apartments for distinguished projects in Dubai. We predict that as market recovery continues to unfold in the upcoming period, which has been backed by the increase in commercial and residential rental prices, investors will be encouraged to increase their spending in Dubai.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Dubai's bid to host the World Expo 2020?</h4><p>The Dubai Land Department continues to support the Emirate's bid to host the World Expo 2020, which represents a major meeting point for the international community to discuss issues related to the global economy and sustainable development. We are very positive that Dubai has a strong chance of securing a win under the campaign “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future" inspired from the vision and leadership of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and reflecting the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. The department supports this vision and strategy to strengthen Dubai's position globally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How do these numbers reaffirm the ongoing support of the government, and the success of your restructuring plan?<br></h4><p>The new Nakheel has been in business since 2010. Under our new, sustainable business plan we are focusing on customer delivery, while launching new projects and diversifying our business portfolio. We have successfully launched a number of new projects this year, and you will see a lot of activity on them from now throughout 2013, and well into 2014. We anticipate that all projects will be streamlined and ready for contractors by year-end. There will also be further announcements throughout 2013 and subsequent years.</p><h4>The history of Dubai itself is not complete without Nakheel. What is the spirit behind it?</h4><p>Of course, Dubai was here before Nakheel was. Nakheel benefited from being a part of Dubai, and we play a pivotal role in Dubai's real estate market. Addressing business matters at Nakheel helped to revive the entire real estate sector here. Investor and contractor confidence in Dubai real estate and in Nakheel is back. We continue to launch new projects and deliver on existing ones. We are on track to hand over 3,000 units to customers over 2013. We also continue to meet our financial obligations, as per our restructuring agreement. Additionally, we find the same people coming back to purchase from the new projects.</p><h4>What is the value of Nakheel, and how does it reflect in the company's philosophy?</h4><p>Nakheel is back and here to stay. However, let's not forget that the support and cooperation of the government was crucial for us to survive the crisis. The government of Dubai acknowledged the importance of Nakheel and made the decision to put the real estate sector back in business. People are now more careful and focused, which is good for stakeholders in the real estate sector. What is also helping the recovery is our move into the tourism sector. We have created a new hospitality and leisure division to focus on our growing number of hotels, beach clubs, and community recreation clubs. What makes Nakheel so special is its ability to put Dubai back on the map. Dubai is both a name and a brand, and we are honored and proud to play such a major role in helping that brand to grow.</p><div class="quote">“Investor and contractor confidence in Dubai real estate and in Nakheel is back."</div><h4>Dubai is developing its brand through this Vision 2020 and capitalizing heavily on tourism. What kind of synergies do you think will be created by expanding into the leisure sector?</h4><p>We announced our hospitality division after recognizing the business opportunities in this sector. The government's emphasis on tourism will give us even more encouragement. We have already announced the Dragon Mart Hotel, which is currently under construction, and the Nakheel Mall and Hotel on Palm Jumeirah.</p><h4>Why are Nakheel's products attractive for those investors seeking high-end projects?</h4><p>Many people want a second home; they see it as a long-term investment and a place to settle down with their families. Dubai has a clean, safe environment with excellent infrastructure. Many families are moving here, with some people commuting to and from other GCC countries for work, while choosing to live in Dubai. We are identifying niche markets in the residential sector, expanding our retail assets and moving into the leasing of residential properties. Our strategy is to increase our assets to ensure our business is strong, solid, and sustainable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Deyaar Development stay competitive in the property market?<br></h4><p>Dubai was one of the top five best performing real estate markets in the world, and ranked fourth on a list of the top 29 cities worldwide, according to a report recently published by Forbes Middle East. The rankings clearly indicate that the Emirate's real estate market is back on track. Our recent results speak for themselves; our revenues have grown, while our net profit for 1Q2013 has more than doubled when compared to the same period of the year before. In an industry that faces intense competition, innovation and customer care set any business apart from the peer group. These mandates are, and will always remain, Deyaar's primary focus and goal. Additionally, we remain competitive through concentrating on our core strengths, working tirelessly to foresee trends, and ensuring that all our stakeholders continue to see profit maximization, cutting-edge services, and real solutions that truly enhance the value of their investments. Undoubtedly, the growth registered by Deyaar is also the outcome of our continued commitment to excellence across our operations.</p><h4>Established in 2002, the company has become one of the leading real estate development companies in the GCC. What is the spirit underpinning this success story?</h4><p>Today, Deyaar stands at the forefront of the regional real estate sector, with interests in real estate development, property management, facilities management, and owners' association management. Deyaar's strategic solutions and deep market insights have helped create exceptional value for our investors. Our philosophy that has helped chart this phenomenal growth is fairly straightforward; at Deyaar, we place particular emphasis on understanding both our business and the external factors that hold the potential to impact it. Using this intelligence, we seek to build attractive developments in popular areas, while ensuring that we deliver unmatched management facilities that exceed the expectations of our residents. Focusing our attention on the important details is looked upon as a core imperative.</p><h4>What is the most common characteristic that we can see in your product portfolio?</h4><p>In Dubai, one of the region's most dynamic cities and a preferred business and leisure destination for people from around the world, we have created commercial and residential developments in key locations to meet varied customer preferences. Within our portfolio of Dubai-based projects, you can see that we are concentrated within free zones. These developments cater perfectly to people who look for close proximity to their offices and want to avoid commuting. Our research has shown us time and again that community living is growing in popularity, be it an entire development, or a single building, and this is something that we have focused on. To make sure we deliver only the very best to our customers across each project, we have developed a rigorous set of tests, from initial design plans to the finishing touches, to ensure that each project meets the highest quality standards. At Deyaar, we take pride in setting new industry benchmarks and exceeding our customers' expectations along the way.</p><h4>What makes your properties attractive to both local and international buyers, and how does the company manage different types of demand?</h4><p>Our footprint extends across varied geographies, which adds to our credibility among local and international buyers. Our residential and commercial developments set new industry standards, and offer our customers unparalleled quality, exceptional value, and a chance to enhance their lifestyle. Moreover, our emphasis on understanding market dynamics, coupled with our ability to integrate the latest innovative technology and design in communities developed in prime settings, create an attractive offering that distinguishes us as a company.</p><h4>What trends can you foresee for the market?</h4><p>The market recovery, marked by an increase in rents and property prices, has helped investors regain their confidence. Deyaar witnessed a strong response at our recent sales weekend, which registered over AED170 million worth of sales for over 200 units. The government plays a major role in influencing real estate market growth in the region. A number of government-backed developments in Dubai are further expected to boost the positive profitability of the property market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you found your company in 2004?<br></h4><p>At a certain point, every entrepreneur knows when he or she is ready for such a call. The desire to found the company was stirred in around 2002 by the momentum and the dynamics of Dubai, and the launch was in July 2004. The market proved to be calling for professional fit out specialists.</p><h4>Why did you decide to rebrand the company?</h4><p>The rebranding process started in 2011 when Emkay secured a major contract for a multinational oil and gas company outside of the UAE. I felt the need to get better recognition and a deeper impact while entering a new territory. Also, I wanted the brand to reflect our values and to be on par with our growth. All our staff, suppliers, and clients continue to feel the positive change of our new image.</p><h4>What are the characteristics of the project Emkay is working on in Iraq?</h4><p>It is a modular construction project, extremely effective in remote areas. It was an opportunity for us to showcase the benefits of this new and efficient construction method.</p><div class="quote">“New products and ideas and more efficient methods are helping us to achieve better quality."</div><h4>What major trends are you seeing in the local sector?</h4><p>Clients are more cost cautious and demand real value for money, and our role as construction specialists is to translate this approach into more research and better solutions. New products and ideas and more efficient methods are helping us to achieve better quality and faster implementation, and thus reduce costs and provide more value for money.</p><h4>Do you think that tourism continues to be important for the construction industry?</h4><p>Of course; tourism is important to the construction industry as well as the health, education, and energy sectors.</p><h4>What do you think the announcement of Mohammed Bin Rashid (MBR) City signifies?</h4><p>It is most welcome. We are excited about the opportunities that MBR City will lead to. At this stage and after what the markets have faced since 2009, I am sure better results will be achieved.</p><h4>How many employees work at your company and will that change this year?</h4><p>Currently, we have 110 employees. Our plans to expand to Oman and Saudi Arabia would change our workforce figures significantly. At the moment, our staff are active in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Basra, Iraq. In Oman and Saudi Arabia, we will be focusing on modular construction projects.</p><h4>Have you noticed rising demand for modular projects over the years?</h4><p>We have noticed growing demand, especially for projects in remote areas such as oil and gas facilities and government projects improving rural areas. The speed of construction and ease of mobilization is proving ideal for project managers. When compared to conventional construction, which requires heavy machinery and equipment, a modular building is based on smaller components and tools. In Iraq or Oman, where all these developments happen in remote areas, this type of modular construction is definitely an adequate answer.</p><h4>What type of growth did you experience in 2012, and what are you expecting in 2013?</h4><p>For the past three years, we have experienced double-digit growth. This is mainly because we have added modular construction to our portfolio. In 2013, the company is focusing on restructuring its capabilities to be able to cater to higher demand.</p><h4>Is there a competitive advantage to using modular techniques?</h4><p>This method is faster and saves a significant amount of construction time. It involves superior thermal insulation, superior sound insulation, factory-controlled production, and is environmentally friendly. It also produces less waste, is more lightweight, and is recyclable. All the components are pre-fabricated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dubai Health Strategy Plan includes the construction of three new hospitals and 40 primary healthcare centers. What can you tell us about the rationale behind this strategy?</h4><p>We look at healthcare as a service, similar to that of infrastructure or education. We provide this service through hospitals and health centers. We base our plans on the expected overall aims for Dubai and the UAE. We look at the broader region and the world as well, and base our plans on the anticipated growth of Dubai according to the Vision 2020. There are two parameters for the building of such facilities: population and distance. There has to be a specified distance between hospitals and people. Based on those parameters, we decided to build three hospitals and 40 healthcare centers. We believe that prevention is vital; therefore, we are hoping that these healthcare centers will change the mindset of society and encourage preventive healthcare. We want to make people happy, and healthy people are happy people.</p><h4>What are the benefits of being linked to the government in terms of promoting private and public sector cooperation in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>We believe that the private and public sectors should complement each other and not be so competitive that they cannot achieve their shared goals. Therefore, we put together a team from the private sector and the government, and they work to develop the private healthcare sector. When I issue a regulation or conduct an inspection, the two parties can find out what the reasons behind the decisions are. Serious people want quality regulations that provide them with protection. However, we do not draft regulations in isolation—we talk to people, identify what they need, and they find results. It is a win-win situation.</p><h4>How do these regulations affect the sector?</h4><p>We want to make people's lives easier in general in Dubai, especially those of business people. The regulator wants to impose many regulations, however, and thinks only theoretically. We need to have a balance between academic, theoretical, and pragmatic, people-focused regulations so that the industry and investors are protected. We protect customers first and foremost, as patients need good healthcare, and, after that, our focus is on the safety of private investments in the healthcare sector.</p><h4>The Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdam launched the Health Tourism Initiative in 2012. How do you see this initiative, and how will it develop in the future?</h4><p>Dubai has a unique position in terms of tourism. It is set up expertly with an airline, airports, hotels, and shopping centers. This makes the city an ideal place to bring in health tourists. There are many people in surrounding countries that simply do not have access to the healthcare they desire or need. Europe is far away and more expensive, meaning that Dubai can emerge as a powerful alternative. We should focus on improving services, and make Dubai a health hub for the region. We have participated in many international conferences, so we are learning from our colleagues around the world. I have high hopes for the plan.</p><h4>How do you attract international hospital chains to the country?</h4><p>Some hospitals come and invest without any partnership or help. Others approach us and say they will operate a facility if they are provided with the right infrastructure. We are open to both, and we believe that the knowledge that our partners provide is helpful. Those who invest here succeed. We have four public hospitals and 22 private hospitals, all of which have arrived over the past decade. This is because they trust Dubai and our ideology of keeping the patient in focus and serving them in the best way possible. Regarding investors, we have good legislation in place, and so they trust what we offer, and are confident of experiencing a comfortable business environment. Another important element is the introduction of insurance, which means that the financing of healthcare services will be guaranteed. If people have an insurance card, they can go to any hospital and receive the same treatment without rushing to a specific hospital. Once in place, this will create a more stable investment environment and guarantee our hospitals and patients. We already have about 33% of the population insured, and are in the process of making this obligatory because we need full insurance in order to optimize services. Meanwhile, the e-Claim service links all pharmacies, hospitals, and polyclinics. We are currently monitoring this to ensure that hospitals and insurance companies are using the service correctly. Today, 100% of hospitals have adopted this system, and 90% of polyclinics are also using it. We work together with insurance companies to create the necessary regulations and structures, thereby attracting investors and partners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the government push for an enhanced, well-rounded healthcare sector impacted operations at Dubai Healthcare City (DHCC)?<br></h4><p>Dubai Healthcare City, also known as DHCC, was launched in 2002 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, to become an internationally recognized location of choice for quality healthcare and an integrated center of excellence for clinical and wellness services, as well as medical education, and research. As the region's first healthcare free zone, DHCC has been at the heart of the nation's rapidly evolving healthcare system.</p><h4>What emphasis are you placing on educating local medical professionals?</h4><p>Medical education is at the core of healthcare excellence. We have invested heavily in education as part of our mission to establish DHCC as an internationally recognized leader in medical education. We need to ensure that our future medical professionals are trained and qualified to the highest international standards within state-of-the art facilities.</p><p>The Mohammed Bin Rashid Academic Medical Center (MBR-AMC), the academic and research arm of DHCC, is the foundation of Dubai's clinical, education, and research structure. Within the center, our portfolio of medical education facilities, resources, and platforms allows regional healthcare professionals to access high-quality medical, nursing, and allied health programs. By focusing on the development of a local pool of medical talent, and enhancing research within the UAE, we are building a solid base for advancements in medical education and research. We are also establishing a sustainable, home-grown workforce, which, in turn, provides the highest level of healthcare services, allowing UAE residents to be treated within the country, thus reversing the trend whereby Emiratis travel overseas and expatriates return home for medical treatment.</p><p>We have also established institutions of the highest standards through partnerships with key global healthcare players and renowned academic institutions. These partnerships have seen DHCC's portfolio of education projects develop into a medical hub of exceptional standing. Strategic global medical education partners include the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Dubai School of Dental Medicine, European University College, and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  These partnerships also allow us to offer a range of post-graduate courses across many medical specialties, essential in supporting an advanced healthcare infrastructure and meeting the needs of an ever-expanding community.</p><p>We recently held the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland's annual conferring ceremony within the Al Seddiqi Auditorium. Located within MBR-AMC, the auditorium is one of our many modern facilities and hosts a number of small- to medium-scale scientific exhibitions and conferences. Under the patronage of the Chairperson of Dubai Healthcare City Authority, HRH Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, wife of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, the ceremony saw Masters degrees conferred on 50 students who, thanks to their advanced training in healthcare management, are in an ideal position to contribute to shaping the region's healthcare sector.</p><h4>How is the University Hospital Project developing?</h4><p>The hospital, a multidisciplinary research and teaching facility located in the heart of DHCC, once completed, will be the crown jewel of Dubai's healthcare infrastructure. We are currently working with various partners to ensure the hospital provides high-quality care for patients and a wide variety of learning opportunities for students. At present, our main focus is to select the right partners to support this ambitious, ground-breaking project.</p><h4>What attracts students to study in DHCC?</h4><p>DHCC is committed to establishing world-class medical education and research programs in an effort to build a pool of specialized medical talent in the region. Today, such education, supported by dedicated research programs, is very limited within our region. Partnerships with elite multinational and regional institutions will attract more students to DHCC and offer an alternative to some of the more established names in Europe, Asia, and North America.</p><p>Dubai's central location, and its appeal as a tourism destination, is a key consideration for students, especially for those in the region keen on gaining international qualifications closer to home.</p><h4>What can DHCC do to address the shortage of doctors in the region?</h4><p>Given our specialized infrastructure, we have attracted over 4,000 licensed medical professionals that are working in more than 120 internationally acclaimed healthcare centers, hospitals, and clinics registered here at DHCC. Our free zone status continues to attract medical professionals who are looking to set up their own practices, while utilizing the related benefits and value-added services. As we continue to build our name as an international center of medical excellence, providing globally recognized education, we are confident that we will continue to attract more medical talent to the region, as well as develop home-grown professionals.</p><h4>Has there been a “brain gain" in Dubai based on what is happening in the region?</h4><p>Over the past 10 years, DHCC has attracted over 4,000 international healthcare professionals, speaking more than 50 languages and practicing under stringent DHCC-quality guidelines. We are confident that DHCC has witnessed a brain gain due to the strict professional and facility licensing guidelines that we follow, which include primary source verification for every professional. On top of the regulatory framework that has been developed to ensure the attraction of top-notch medical professionals and facilities, DHCC's educational initiatives play a key role in attracting medical professionals that value continuous development, promoting greater diversity in medical expertise and technology.</p><h4>Which projects will the Al Jalila Foundation be funding, and how might it help shape the future of healthcare in Dubai?</h4><p>We are working closely with the Al Jalila Foundation to help facilitate partnerships that support medical education and research projects, and will help DHCC and our partners realize our shared aspirations and vision for better healthcare across the region.</p><h4>How do you see the medical tourism industry shaping up in Dubai?</h4><p>The Crown Prince of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, launched the health tourism initiative in early 2012, geared at establishing Dubai as a global health tourism hub. DHCC, as the first integrated healthcare free zone, is spearheading this initiative. We are working closely with our counterparts in the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) and the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) to develop a strategy to effectively drive the Health Tourism Initiative. Global revenues from medical tourism are estimated at around $30 billion, and Dubai, as an emerging destination for healthcare tourism, generated revenues of more than $1.5 billion in 2012. That number is expected to increase in 2013. The medical tourism market is extremely important, and we are looking at an annual increase of 7% by 2015. In an effort to support the increasing number of medical tourists, a medical visa was recently introduced to the UAE. The existing three-month visa has been extended to cater for rest and recovery, meaning that patients can stay in Dubai for up to nine months. It allows for the patients' family to stay here, too. Dubai, essentially, with its infrastructure, resources, education, and multicultural society, represents the ideal, modern medical hub.</p><h4>What was the significance of the inauguration of the MBR-AMC?</h4><p>DHCC is the result of HH Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's vision. When His Highness first announced plans to build and operate the first healthcare free zone in 2002, he created a roadmap to establish a medical city that would meet the demand for high-quality healthcare in the region. As part of his vision, HH Sheikh Mohammed highlighted education and research as key priorities within the nation's healthcare offerings. Through the provision of education centers, facilities, and resources at MBR-AMC, we have been able to turn that vision into a reality and offer our students and professionals superb standards of medical education.</p><h4>What facilities does DHCC offer the local healthcare system, and what quality education is in place to produce a new generation of medical professionals?</h4><p>The MBR-AMC is home to DHCC's education and research facilities. The center is equipped with the most advanced facilities and resources in the region. When establishing our education projects, we collaborated with globally recognized academic institutions and medical boards to provide a world-class, integrated academic and clinical environment for excellent healthcare education and research.</p><p>The center is also home to the Al Maktoum Medical Library, Dubai School for Dental Medicine, Continuous Professional Development Programs, a research support office, and, last but not least, the Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor Medical Simulation Center (KHMSC). KHMSC is the first comprehensive clinical skills training center in the region, and features advanced technology including unique interactive patient simulators. It allows training for both experienced healthcare professionals and students in a simulated, risk-free environment.</p><p>Ultimately, our aim is to provide complete medical education and continuous professional development programs across the entire spectrum of healthcare professions through the MBR-AMC to instill a culture of research and knowledge sharing. By providing comprehensive local, quality medical education programs, we are developing a local, sustainable workforce, which will allow people in the region to be treated closer to home.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>HH Sheikh Mohammed has recently approved the ambitious new Vision 2020. How will the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) implement His Highness' vision, and how does it fit in with the government's growth strategy?<br></h4><p>The headline objective of Vision 2020 is to welcome 20 million tourists per year to Dubai by 2020, and treble the economic contribution tourism makes to the city's economy. We will achieve this by two means: firstly, by increasing Dubai's “destination offering" across events, attractions, infrastructure, services, and packages, and secondly by showcasing the Emirate to an even wider audience and increasing the conversion of awareness into flight and hotel bookings. The Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) has played a fundamental role in Dubai's tourism growth. Sheikh Rashid Tower was the catalyst for the development of the business district, which now stretches from DWTC to Business Bay. In regard to the MICE sector, Dubai is now the region's leading venue, not just in terms of size, but also in terms of diversity of calendar, scale of events, and the volume of business generated. Our figures show that in 2012, DWTC welcomed more than 1.85 million visitors and 37,000 exhibitors, and we intend to continue building on this.</p><h4>What measures are adopted by the DTCM to assist the sector and increase visitors to Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai's 10 million tourist arrivals of 2012 confirm its established popularity. Maintaining our existing market share in key source markets and increasing it in markets of growth potential will both increase tourist numbers. Vision 2020 sets us a further target to strive toward. We want to establish Dubai as the leading destination for families, events, and business, and to do this we will need to work with private and public partners to evolve the tourism offer across events, attractions, experiences, infrastructure, hotels, services, and packages. We will also develop more live events by leveraging the expertise of Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment, the creators of retail festivals, such as the Dubai Shopping Festival and Dubai Summer Surprises. And now that Dubai Calendar is part of DTCM alongside the Dubai Convention and Events Bureau, we can strengthen the coordinated approach to create, attract, and market a year-round program of events for residents, leisure, and business visitors alike. Similarly, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, has spoken about the importance of families, and we are working on campaigns to establish Dubai and the UAE as the top family destination. For example, we are creating segmented packages across different themes in addition to working with industry stakeholders to improve this city's already strong visitor experience. Strategic marketing is crucial, and we intend to develop a new city brand that better communicates the breadth of activities and attractions on offer here. Meanwhile, our new office in Sío Paolo, Brazil, will provide much better access to the South American market, boasting huge potential, particularly in the business tourism sector.</p><h4>What are the actions taken by the DTCM in order to encourage specializations in the sector's services?</h4><p>An excellent example of this was the governmental decree of May 2013 legalizing a new hotel classification system for Dubai. This provides a clearer choice for our visitors.</p><h4>How has the city's bid to host the World Expo 2020 influenced thinking and planning at the DTCM and DWTC?</h4><p>The UAE's bid to host the World Expo 2020 in Dubai has certainly increased our visibility. And while we would love to welcome the world to Dubai for the event, DTCM's Tourism Vision for 2020 is not reliant on winning the bid. With regards to DWTC, the World Expo 2020 has influenced planning to a certain extent, and DWTC is central in the planning of the Dubai Trade Centre-Jebel Ali, a key component of World Expo 2020, enhancing Dubai's appeal as a top destination for premier events. Elsewhere, Dubai Trade Centre-Jebel Ali would do much to accommodate growth in MICE business. DWTC is currently finalizing plans to expand the existing venue, building the largest indoor events arena in the city. This will greatly enhance our ability to host additional mega events, ensuring that DWTC remains an engine of the events industry of the city and the wider MENASA region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the development of infrastructure, like the new Terminal A and Al Maktoum Airport for Emirates Airline?<br></h4><p>Dubai has exploded onto the world stage. The government and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, have made Dubai and the airline global. HH Sheikh Mohammed set up Emirates Airline, and for seven years people thought that it would become nothing more than a regional carrier. It is amazing what has taken place. Gulf Air became less important and individual countries began to set up their own airlines, like Qatar Airways and Oman Air. Their business models are all the same as ours, and other countries have followed our lead, leaving groups like Star Alliance and taking control of their own destiny. When we built Concourse A, we had absolute control over what we were designing. Here, HH Sheikh Mohammed is my direct boss, and when we need to get something done, I talk to him directly. We do not waste time with inefficient board meetings and endless bureaucratic wrangling—he simply decides to get a job done, and in come the designers and engineers and whoever else is needed. London has been agonizing over building a new terminal for 20 years, and it still is not completed. Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, came here and asked how it was possible to complete an expansion of this magnitude. I explained that it was because we have a government that is 100% behind us.</p><h4>Why did you succeed when other airlines were failing?</h4><p>It is a question of timing, alignment, and understanding what was going on. It was a question of moving rapidly to do what we had always wanted to do, which was to take people from Yokohama to Sío Paulo, or from San Francisco to Hyderabad. The growth of Dubai up until 2008, mixed with the changing nature of international air travel demand, and a realization of the shift of economic power not just from West to East, but to Latin America and Africa as well, led to new opportunities that were not seized by European airlines and many others. We added destinations in Africa, and in the 1990s and 2000s Africa exploded. The Chinese came in droves, and the key was realizing that these new trends were taking place. On their way to Africa, the Chinese saw what was happening in Dubai and decided to set up shop. Now, the Chinese community here is huge, and this is due to travel to Africa. We had links to China and Africa and were able to become the carrier for this movement of people. The Chinese are looking to Brazil, the Brazilians are looking to Africa, and the Southeast Asians are looking to South Africa. We watch trends and keep records of our corporate travelers, and micro-manage individual passengers' experiences. Through this process, we understand global travel trends.</p><h4>Customer needs are related not only to service, but also to flexibility in terms of routes. How do you adapt to what people are demanding?</h4><p>We must adapt rapidly. People were very set in their ways in the past. There were some changes back in this post-war era; however, this was nothing in comparison with the enormous changes brought about by telecommunications and digital technology. Successful companies adapted to these technologies. Sitting at the center of an international communications web like Dubai, we could see all of the changes happening in countries right around the world. We watched these changes and adapted. We are making our brand ubiquitous in its international reach and are trying to make people think, “Does Emirates Airline fly there?" instead of “How can I get there?" when planning a trip. When we cross the Pacific, we will be a truly global brand. People are genuinely excited about us coming to new countries because they know about the variety of destinations we provide and the quality of service we offer. Ultimately, however, success is about people.</p><div class="quote">“We do not waste time with inefficient board meetings and endless bureaucratic wrangling."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Paris Gallery able to succeed during the global economic downturn?<br></h4><p>The recession of 2008 was short lived, contrary to the opinions of the media, which exaggerated the effects of the crisis in the UAE. Fortunately, it passed very quickly, with the leadership swift to respond and take pro-active steps to protect the economy. The banking segment helped keep afloat those sectors that were hit the hardest. For any company, regardless of whether you are a corporate or family-run business, if you have a strong set of values, a good understanding of how the industry operates, a good set of internal policies and procedures in place, strong and faithful management controlling the financial flow, and a firm relationship with business partners and customers, then you are on solid ground. In addition, a team of employees that acts in a highly professional manner, who are loyal and cooperative, and who stand with the company through thick and thin, is equally important. Paris Gallery has a great team. We didn't have any reason to panic. We did reduce spending during the downturn, but our employees were equipped with the tools that they needed to become more productive and effective. We were well positioned to weather the storm of 2008 because we had migrated from a family-run business model to a corporate one in 2006. We introduced internationally recognized standards with regards to processes, systems, and policies touching management, the value system, and the cultural environment. Culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other, and this includes the organization's values, visions, systems, beliefs, and habits. This is taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving, thinking, and feeling the Paris Gallery way. Switching to corporate governance was a major transformation for us, with changes applied to the legal structure, commercial systems, networking, distribution, and so on. It has so far prepared us to meet every challenge, helped us make good of every opportunity, and kept us on the right course.</p><h4>How has the cultural environment changed compared to the one you had before, and what are the values that you gained after the change?</h4><p>Changing the culture was a large-scale undertaking, which began with the vision, mission, and values. We defined our strategic direction and decided what the culture should look like to succeed. We encouraged our employees to change in order to create the desired culture. We defined roles, and introduced measurement and control systems. We got our executives to support the cultural change. Constant training helped members of the organization understand what was expected from them, and how to get used to their new behavior and roles. We practiced effective communication, keeping everyone informed about organizational changes, we reviewed the organizational structure, redesigned our approach to rewards and recognitions, and made changes to work systems that included pay practices, performance management, hiring employees, and employee promotions. We reviewed all the systems to make sure they supported the new culture that was adopted to accomplish our organizational goals. I am very proud of my team. They exceeded my expectations in understanding and accepting the new culture. Today, integrity is a fundamental value of our organization. Our employees work with passion, and they have a profound connection to the vision of the organization. They are ambitious, innovative, and great team players. Diversity is celebrated, perspectives respected, and fresh ways to address business issues encouraged. They feel empowered, and have a passion for excellence. As a team, we are constantly thinking ahead for ways to better serve our customers, learning from our past mistakes, and making sure we continue to improve.</p><h4>What makes Paris Gallery attractive to international brands, and how do you manage the relationship with the labels you work with?</h4><p>Mutual interests bring people or organizations together. Paris Gallery is a bricks-and-mortar business with decades of physical presence and face-to-face customer experience. Paris Gallery is a name synonymous with luxury. We have succeeded through a strategy that combines high levels of sales assistance by our dedicated and trained staff, specialized merchandise, and a shopping environment that is viewed by our consumers as luxuriously special. We offer the best products in stores located at prime retail spaces in the region. When brands partner with us, they gain a strong market share, build a loyal customer base, and grow their overall business. They choose Paris Gallery for its opulence, its preferred-luxury-retailer status, reach, organized approach, and large customer base. Luxury brands require luxurious space, and that is exactly what we provide in segments that include perfumes, cosmetics, watches, fashion apparel, sunglasses, and so on.</p><div class="quote">“Luxury brands require luxurious space, and that is 
exactly what we provide."</div><h4>Does the company change the way it interacts with partners and customers depending on the market in which it operates?</h4><p>Every business exists on account of its customers, who have specific needs that must be satisfied. And every business should satisfy those specific needs. Anyone entering Paris Gallery should receive the excellent customer service that we are widely known for. Though product offerings may differ in a particular area, market, or region, the quality of service is uniform. We hire people who we believe can be nurtured to accept these standards and values as their own. This is a tough task when you have people from different regions, cultures, and backgrounds, but our efforts have proven successful. Our guests enjoy the traditional Arabic hospitality that is central to how we treat them. Well-trained, polite, and attentive personnel make shopping at Paris Gallery meaningful and satisfying. We must understand the needs of customers in every market so that our offerings are meaningful, and customers are best served. This is the primary objective of segmentation; to win and retain the customers we can serve well. It is important that potential customers in a market are identified and placed into different groups or segments with the same or comparable set of needs that can be satisfied by a distinct marketing proposition. This also helps us ensure that we meet the customer's needs better than anyone else. We also take into account the newer or younger generations that increase by the year to cater to their needs as well.</p><h4>What value does Paris Gallery add to Dubai's retail experience? Why is it so popular among tourists and visitors?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the most visited places in the world, and its retail experience is unlike any other. There is so much more in one place than you could imagine. It is a shopper's paradise. It is where you get high-quality products and great customer service. And this is where Paris Gallery is a name to be reckoned with. Paris Gallery is synonymous with the word luxury. Our wide network of stores serves the needs of millions of tourists, expatriates, and locals. People travel from all parts of the world to Dubai for leisure and business, and they generally like to pamper themselves. We pamper our guests. We offer luxury with a distinctive, authentic Middle Eastern flavor, and reflect the opulence of Dubai. We are a local company that meets every international standard. We are the local flavor. We are where our customers need us, and we provide what they want, and more.</p><h4>Which kind of services do you provide for the clients of your creations that the competition doesn't?</h4><p>Paris Gallery is a local company, and hospitality is ingrained in our culture. Our customers are our guests. One thing that's unique to Paris Gallery is that customers can walk in, relax at the plush lounge, sip on Arabic coffee, feast on premium dates, be attended to by courteous personnel, get information on the latest products, and have a fantastic shopping experience. Our customers receive first-class treatment in elegant, spacious, bright, and airy retail space, unlike other stores that overfill their space. Our customers also get to buy the most exclusive luxury products that one can only find at Paris Gallery. Many of the niche international brands, and some of the world's most expensive perfumes are only available at Paris Gallery.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Dubai Duty Free maintain its stability during the economic crisis that hit Dubai?</h4><p>Despite the global recession of recent years, Dubai Duty Free has consistently managed to increase its turnover year after year. In fact, we are now in our 30th year, and have only had one year where sales didn't increase over the previous one, and that was in 1991 during the Gulf war; our numbers were unchanged from the previous year. During the recession of 2008 and 2009, we registered growth of 11% and 4%, respectively. We took a very conscious decision at that time to scrutinize our costs. And while we did not let any staff go, we did temporarily freeze recruitment. We also examined each of our processes to ensure that we were offering the best possible value to our customers. As part of this, we held surprise promotions whereby, for example, we would offer a 20% discount in one category on one day, and a different discount in another category the next. We observed that our business was doing very well as a result. We provided additional training, boosted staff motivation, and set goals and budgets; the scheme worked out very well for us. One key consideration in the duty free business is to sell to a larger percentage of traffic to boost sales figures. In comparison to the best airports around the world, we sell to 49% of departing passengers. In contrast, a good figure at Heathrow, Singapore, or Charles De Gaulle, for example, would be at around 17% or 18%; clearly we sell more. We do so because we offer good value for money, serviced by well-trained employees. We make sure that our retail offer is positioned very well in a convenient, accessible, and central location, and in most cases all departing passengers reach their flights by walking through the duty free area.</p><h4>Is the increase in sales linked to the influx of passengers through the airport?</h4><p>It is linked to the passengers; they are the crucial factor, and their number has continued to increase annually. Over the past few years, the passenger figure at Dubai Airport has risen notably from 47 million to 51 million in 2011, and 57 million in 2012. In 2013, the figure is set to reach 66 million passengers. That makes Dubai Airport the second largest in the world in terms of international travel. Some other airports have more passengers, such as Atlanta with 95 million; however, many of their flights are domestic. Traffic is very important to us, but, more importantly, we must also make sure to sell more per passenger than we have been doing. In our first year here, 30 years ago, per passenger sales were at $5.50. In stark contrast, by 2012, we were selling $47 to each passenger.</p><h4>How do you manage your portfolio?</h4><p>We have a team of about 30 people at our buying office, who liaise with our suppliers and representatives, and attend trade fairs to keep up with new product offerings. Indeed, we have spread our range of categories far beyond what use to be described as “traditional duty free offerings." Many years ago, there was liquor, tobacco, and perfumes, until other products crept in, such as electronics. We try to have a range of products that satisfies everybody, and do not confine ourselves to luxury brands as our customers have diverse needs. For example, we sell 1,000 tons of powdered milk every year at our confectionery shop. We also sell three tons of gold. In 2012, we sold 73 million items of merchandise amounting to 23.5 million transactions at our registers, which averages at 64,300 transactions per day. In 2013, we are completing 70,000 transactions each day. At the end of this year, I am confident of being able to announce the completion of 25 million transactions on sales of 80 million items of merchandise. The distribution of our merchandise at our distribution center is 90% automated, enabling us to deal with demand that we otherwise couldn't manage. Our range of categories is quite wide. Some of our smaller ones in fact, generate a large income for us; even the humble phone card generates around AED100,000 for us every day. We also sell AED70,000-AED80,000 worth of sunglasses every day. A category like confectionery, which was not traditionally a duty free airport item, accounts for around 6%-7% of our total business, which is perhaps worth AED300 million. In 2013, we expect our turnover to reach AED6.6 billion, which is about $1.8 billion. While our sales are undoubtedly impressive, our success is down to a number of important factors. First and foremost, we have had the support of the government of Dubai (Dubai Duty Free is now a part of ICD) from the beginning and I am particularly appreciative of my own boss, HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President of Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Chairman of Dubai Duty Free.</p><div class="quote">“We value our staff and ensure they are fully trained for the job."</div><h4>What impact has the opening of the new concourse had on Dubai Duty Free?</h4><p>Developments at the airport inevitably have a notable impact on our business. The airport and Dubai Duty Free have a common owner: the government. Any new concourse that is opened at the airport receives financial support from Dubai Duty Free. That is where our money goes. We naturally spend on developing our own facilities, but also help to finance the overall infrastructure of the airport. In 2012, we borrowed $1.75 billion via a syndicated loan from 26 banks, which is being used to finance the construction of the next concourse (Concourse D), currently under construction. The opening of Concourse A was significant for us, and we have 8,000 sqm of retail space in it. We specifically recruited 1,600 additional staff for the concourse, which brought our current staff level to 5,800 people. Clearly, we are part of the airport's story of growth and success. I think we have had an excellent impact on Concourse A, and we find that it is working very well for us. What's more, it has helped to ease the congestion previously experienced in Concourse B.</p><h4>How has your experience helped you drive the company's success in Dubai?</h4><p>When we launched Dubai Duty Free, we had 100 staff. We still have 44 of those original people working with us 30 years later, while 207 of our employees have been with for us for over 20 years. Within our company we have tried to build a family-oriented team. We value our staff and ensure they are fully trained for the job. Three decades ago, there were only three million passengers passing through the airport; in 2013 there will be 66 million. Many factors have contributed to this exponential growth; tourism has been promoted, Emirates Airline was born, the hotel sector has blossomed, and real estate began to develop in Dubai. Around 25 years ago foreigners could not buy property in Dubai. Today they can, and they have in fact become a key contributor to the economy. Tourism has grown; and, to accommodate this, so too has the airline business. You cannot find a better growth story than Emirates Airline in the airline industry anywhere else. We have tried to keep pace with that. Originally, we had just 100 staff located in an area of about 1,800 sqm. We now have 5,800 staff in a 26,000 sqm area. Sales in our first year amounted to AED70 million ($20 million), and by 2012 the figure had soared to AED5.9 billion ($1.6 billion).  We keep pace with infrastructural developments, and adjust our operations accordingly. Apart from the core duty free business line, we were one of the first companies in Dubai to promote Dubai abroad, mainly through events and sports sponsorship. We have, for 17 years, sponsored horse racing at Newbury in England. We are the main sponsor of the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby, and have been for many years. We have also sponsored tennis weeks during the men's and women's tennis tour, and are part of the highly successful Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. Building on this, we built our tennis stadium, our Irish village, and our hotel, the Jumeirah Creekside. The men's tennis players have voted our tennis tournament the best in the world for nine of the past 10 years. The sport of tennis is an expensive one to promote, and in 2012 Dubai Duty Free was selected as an exemplary company by the Emirates Competitiveness Council. An international symposium was held in Dubai, and a study was conducted to assess the nature and perception of our business. Two interesting points emerged from that study. The first was that over the past 29 years, traffic through Dubai Airport had increased by 1,700%. Dubai Duty Free too, had grown by 7,200%. The second thing we learned was the true value of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championship—in promotional terms for Dubai—while it was valued at $381 million for 2012, in 2013 the value of TV coverage of tennis has risen to $528 million.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Majid Al Futtaim contributed to the development and wealth of Dubai?<br></h4><p>Majid Al Futtaim was the first group to introduce the modern shopping mall experience to the UAE, starting with our first opening, Deira City Centre, in 1995. The company also introduced the first hypermarket in the Middle East. At that time, the predecessor of Carrefour was Continent. Carrefour is now present in 19 countries in Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. In addition to these, Majid Al Futtaim also opened the first modern cinema, leading the company to buy VOX Cinemas. Majid Al Futtaim brought in a number of brands for the first time to the UAE and also introduced the concept of leisure entertainment with Magic Planet, which was our gaming and leisure entertainment concept. Majid Al Futtaim made an even bigger impact with the Mall of the Emirates, which featured the region's first indoor ski slope. We have been developing this trend of bringing not only shopping, but also entertainment and food under one roof. We have continued to deliver the comprehensive offering envisioned by the company's founder, Majid Al Futtaim, for more than 20 years now. Indeed, our developments have been major contributors to Dubai's success as an international hub for business and tourism.</p><h4>Do you transfer your success from one mall to another?</h4><p>In each market, we must study both the specific need and market capacity. We do not replicate the same features in every mall. In Bahrain, for example, we have a waterpark on the roof of the mall, and in Mirdif City Centre we offer indoor soccer and skydiving with the iFLY concept. There are many new concepts at each of our malls, and we constantly work to bring in fresh ideas. A few years ago, casual dining was much less important. Today, it is an integral part of what shopping malls have to offer.</p><h4>How different is the management of each mall?</h4><p>We study the local demand and size of each market. What the mall offers depends on the needs of the catchment area. For example, our malls in Egypt tend to be more anchored around hypermarkets at the center and smaller shops surrounding that; however, Dubai draws shoppers from all over the world, and many have come to experience the sophisticated shopping experience the city offers. The Mall of the Emirates tends to draw tourists seeking high-end products, while Mirdif targets the local community more.</p><div class="quote">“We have been developing this trend of bringing not only shopping, but also entertainment and food under one roof."</div><h4>Majid Al Futtaim Holding acquired full ownership of the Carrefour Franchise in the region in May 2013. What is the significance of this move?</h4><p>Nothing will change from an operational point of view, although we have acquired the rights to financial control over the business as part of the agreement. Previously, Majid Al Futtaim had the rights to hypermarkets and supermarkets, but now it has gained the rights to alternative concepts, such as convenience stores and discount shops. The group has also acquired the rights to additional countries, which we can explore in the future—beyond the 19 countries we are already operating in.</p><h4>How important is the hospitality arm for Majid Al Futtaim Holding, and how do you foresee it developing within the group?</h4><p>The hospitality arm of the group is tied to the retail arm. We are primarily a retail group, so our business is very focused on that through different offerings. Again, we were one of the innovators by combining a shopping mall with a hotel. We started that with Deira City Centre and what was then the Sofitel. The driver of these malls was tourism, so the idea of being able to stay in the mall where you plan to do your shopping was unique and attractive. All of our hotels are either attached or across the street from our shopping malls. The high-end four- or five-star hotels tend to be attached to the mall, and some of the three- or four-star establishments, such as the Ibis, tend to be situated across the road. The dining experience was something relatively new for malls.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gold-standard]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the regulatory environment affect the companies installed here?<br></h4><p>The guidelines for trade are established and enforced by each Emirate and the federal government. Dubai Multi Commoditites Centre (DMCC) acts as a trade facilitator and supports the Government of Dubai through a variety of initiatives, regulations, and products that we introduced, principally within the gold and diamond sector. These have allowed the trade to excel over the last 10 years. Gold saw $70 billion worth of trade in 2012 compared with $56 billion in 2011. As far as regulatory initiatives are concerned, in 2005, we developed the Dubai Good Delivery (DGD) standard, which is an international benchmark for quality and technical specification for the production of gold and silver. The objectives of the standard are to increase confidence in the gold and silver industry, create more opportunities for trade finance activities, provide the technical robustness, and incorporate relevant globally accepted best practices. In addition, it provides a delivery standard for the Dubai Gold and Commodity Exchange (DGCX) for a 1 kilogram gold bar of 995.0 fineness and a standard large silver bar ranging from 900-110 ounces of a minimum of 999.0 fineness. In addition, in April 2012 we introduced the DMCC Practical Guidance—a five-step risk management framework reference manual that has been developed in consultation with the OECD and global market participants. It is based on the OECD's guidance for conducting due diligence for the responsible sourcing of gold to ensure conflict-free supply chains. As of June 2012, DMCC made it a mandatory requirement for all DGD member refineries to comply with, and implement all the provisions of the DMCC's Practical Guidance for Responsible Sourcing of precious metals. In regard to the trading of diamonds, we helped establish the first UAE Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) office in the Arab World, based in Almas Tower in 2003. The KPCS is a joint government, industry and civil society initiative that aims to stem the flow of conflict diamonds into the legitimate diamond trade. Set up to assure consumers that the diamonds they are purchasing are conflict free, the KPCS was implemented in the UAE in 2003 making the UAE the first Arab country to introduce this process, and DMCC the only entry and exit point for rough diamonds in the country.</p><h4>What measures is the DMCC taking to assist the sector?</h4><p>The DMCC Free Zone is not only the fastest growing free zone in the UAE, it is soon to be the largest as well. Our success is largely due to the fact that we continuously look at ways to enhance the business and residential environment for the 70,000 people currently working and living in Jumeirah Lakes Towers (JLT). In terms of our 7,000+ member companies, the DMCC Service Centre has also been significantly enhanced in 2013 allowing faster and more efficient registration, licensing, and service provisions to the growing number of new and existing members. The Service Centre includes a full suite of meeting rooms for registration and license processing, and direct access to all major government services, including visa renewal, utilities, and business support services. In early 2013, and in response to community requests, we announced the transformation of one of our lakes into a 55,000 sqm community park. Also in the pipeline is a state-of-the art business park in the DMCC Free Zone that will primarily cater to large multi national companies that require commercial space to buy or rent in Dubai. This addition to the DMCC infrastructure will also include the world's tallest commercial tower. We have already received interest from prospective clients looking to buy and lease space in the tower, which further demonstrates our appeal. There are currently 65 mixed-use commercial and residential towers and over 200 retail outlets in operation within JLT. We register approximately 200 companies every month of which over 95% are new to Dubai. We are well on the way to meeting the commitment we made in early 2011 to be home to over 7,200 companies by the end of 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can Cape Verde learn from Dubai as it develops into a regional hub?<br></h4><p>Dubai offers an extraordinary experience. Here, I believe Cape Verdeans have a lot to learn. In my opinion, Cape Verde, like Dubai, is in a strategic position to contribute to development in our region. It's necessary to see what one can do, and if it is even possible. The country is growing well, and it is in a good location. Therefore, the government makes steady profits off of its strategic position in this zone. My opinion is that, in the near future, Africa will be stronger. It is, therefore, crucial that the world sees Africa from another angle. The continent is in the process of leaving many difficulties behind. There has been much progress, and there are many possibilities. The continent holds great significance to the world. It is important to have a good perspective in the coming years. We, from the African countries, are embracing progress.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the search for new investors for Cape Verde's $300 million airport refurbishment?</h4><p>There are four airports in Cape Verde, two of which are for tourism. The question is how to better utilize one of our international airports to connect Africa, Europe, and the Americas. We're talking about the premier airport in the country, and the largest. We want to transform the airport into a large center of aviation, a hub. It's a project for which we are in the process of finding investors.</p><h4>Why is Cape Verde an attractive destination for tourists?</h4><p>At the moment, tourism is the principal economic activity of the country. First of all, the country is composed of islands located 500 kilometers from Senegal. We have beautiful beaches and an agreeable climate for tourists who visit year round. Therefore, it's the climate, the nature, the beaches, and the diversity of the islands that are very interesting for tourists. Secondly, we are a very secure country for investors. We have created guarantees for foreign investors and fostered a safe investment climate. Everything is guaranteed for investors who want to do business here. From a political point of view, we are stable and secure. Our country and climate are good for your health, and we offer a unique experience for our tourists. Cape Verde has been independent for 38 years. We also have a strong education system for students. We have acquired very important social developments and made advancements in education. Around 85%-100% of our children are enrolled in school. The level of our education, the investment guarantees, and the business climate, as well as the favorable ambiance for tourists, are all benefits that our country offers.</p><div class="quote">“Cape Verde, like Dubai, is in a strategic position to contribute to development in our region."</div><h4>How is Cape Verde different from other West African countries?</h4><p>We are a group of islands; we're an insulated territory, and we have a huge mix of cultures. People live in harmony and we are open to foreign visitors.</p><h4>How many tourists visit each year?</h4><p>Up to 500,000 people visit per year, but we will start within 10 to 15 years to progressively and slowly develop to a level that is sustainable. At the moment, there is huge interest in investing in the tourism industry.</p><h4>What there other economic sectors in Cape Verde that are interesting at the moment?</h4><p>The country is in the process of developing a number of plans to transform the port. The service sector is developing, as is the fishing industry. We also have a growing energy sector. The government is interested in developing renewable energy sources because the country has a lot of sun and wind. We have the conditions to develop new, green energy resources.</p><h4>When will work on the airport refurbishment begin?</h4><p>Investors are in the process of finding partners at the moment, then civil aviation and commercial activities will begin. Right now, we are presenting the project to investors and finding partners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-desirable-scenario]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Dubai in terms of Ecuador's foreign policy?<br></h4><p>The establishment of lasting links with the UAE responds to priority guidelines of Ecuadorean foreign policy. Dubai is an important player for Ecuador due to the investment and cooperation opportunities. There is huge potential between our petrochemicals industries, but especially in terms of clean energy, where Ecuador has a great interest and Dubai has shown significant global leadership. We also believe that other sectors of the Ecuadorean economy, such as tourism, floriculture, cocoa, and banana production have demonstrated great international solvency, and have marked potential in the entire Gulf region.</p><h4>How do you see the present and future of the relationship between Ecuador and Dubai?</h4><p>New partners like Dubai represent for Ecuador the opportunity to diversify cooperation, transfer technology and scientific sources, as well as share new export markets. For these reasons, over the past four years we have taken a new approach in regard to Middle Eastern countries, having promoted the development of diplomatic relations with the Arab nations, in which we have found coincidences and focal points in human rights issues, migration, and environment in the UN framework. Discussions have been held for the signing of trade agreements, and I trust that the prompt establishment of an economic trade committee for Ecuador and the UAE will definitely boost our trade levels. In addition, we will foster support for technological innovation in renewable energy issues, knowledge transfer, and the exchange of experts. Meanwhile, from Ecuador, we are studying the possibility of strengthening our diplomatic representation in the UAE. Recently, the Embassy of Ecuador in Qatar—also serving the UAE—was opened, but the growing relationship of Ecuador with the countries of the region leads us to consider strengthening Dubai's business office with its own embassy. Relations with Dubai in the future will continue advancing through cooperative agreements regarding environmental and energy issues. We also expect to complete the signing of an air services agreement, take measures to avoid double taxation between the two countries, and have the possibility of deepening the knowledge and technology transfer through the exchange and training of professionals in both countries.</p><h4>What actions is Ecuador taking to support relations with other regions and emerging markets?</h4><p>Ecuador, in adherence to its constitutional principles to promote the formation of a multipolar global order and the strengthening of horizontal relationships, not only aims to improve regional integration, but also focuses its efforts on deepening relationships with new strategic partners to alter traditional logic. In this regard, emerging economies are globally fundamental strategic poles for the country, both in the context of our policy of diversification of economic and political relations, and, in particular, regarding the implementation of the strategy of a productive matrix transformation. Although they are not the only emerging economies, the BRICS are essential for understanding our strategic relationship goals. The BRICS are among the main sources of FDI, which increased from $7 billion in 2000 to $126 billion in 2012, comprising 9% of the global total. The five BRICS countries make up 42% of the world's population, 21% of global GDP, and generate trade of around $282 billion. The opportunities presented by these countries are large, and can play an important role in Ecuador's objectives to become a socialist society of knowledge, where investment and technological cooperation are cornerstones. In line with the diversification of its partners, Ecuador has already taken particular steps to approach emerging economies, as in the case of Qatar and Malaysia, with which it has negotiated cooperation and understanding agreements in various fields.</p><div class="quote">“The BRICS are among the main sources of FDI, which increased from $7 billion in 2000 to $126 billion in 2012."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What evidence of stable growth have you witnessed over the past year?<br></h4><p>Dubai had experienced rapid economic growth prior to the onset of the international financial crisis in 2008. Thanks to this achievement, Dubai's economy has undergone a radical transformation, enabling the city to become an international reference in terms of trade, logistics, transportation, and tourism. These growth dynamics have also been based on increased diversification. The modern infrastructure put in place during that period required the mobilization of large resources in the construction sector, and the development of real estate added substantially to excessive reliance on construction and real estate as a source of growth and job creation. While pronounced speculative behavior was a major factor in the rapid growth and real estate bubble, the contagion effect resulting from the international financial crisis also played a no less important role, signaling that Dubai's growth couldn't continue as fast as in the previous decade. Notwithstanding the international crisis, the slowdown in growth was expected as Dubai completed the bulk of its planned infrastructure. Therefore, the “boom and bust cycle" label does not appropriately describe Dubai's growth patterns. The economy evolved at a high but steady pace between the years 2000 and 2008. It then slowed down in 2009-2010, and started recovering in 2011, which is much sooner than many expected given the hit that the construction sector took in 2009 and 2010. Then, 2012 came to confirm a strong recovery, led by tourism, trade, transportation, and logistics. According to preliminary estimates, GDP grew at over 4% in 2012, accelerating from about 3.4% in 2011. In line with all relevant indicators, tourism was a leading sector with value-added growing in real terms at more than 16% in 2012. Thus, while the pace and pattern of growth is clearly no longer the same as before 2009, it should be viewed in light of the previously mentioned background and the new international environment. Today, Dubai doesn't need to maximize growth, but rather, pursue healthy growth that is moderately high and sustainable. Given this important objective, we are expecting an annual average growth rate of around 4.6% each year until 2015.</p><h4>Why is Dubai the preferred hub for the region, and what is the role of the department behind this story of success?</h4><p>Dubai enjoys a strategic geographic location. It belongs to a region that is well-endowed in energy resources and large oil wealth. It is also centrally situated in a region that accounts for over 2.2 billion inhabitants, and has been the fastest growing in the world. These are very favorable external factors; however, they are not sufficient alone to make Dubai a preferred hub. A clear vision was required to exploit this potential. It is a vision based on the pursuit of economic progress, economic modernization, openness to trade, capital, labor flows, and international competitiveness. The Government of Dubai is led by this vision, and is focused on realizing all factors of success: building the required infrastructure, creating the right business environment, and enhancing the pro-friendliness of government regulations. Without this vision, and the fulfillment of the conditions to achieve it, the objectives, which seemed unrealistic 20 years ago, and which made Dubai the international hub that it is today, wouldn't have been achieved. The Department of Economic Development (DED) works within that vision, and in line with its mandate. It has consistently been in pursuit of business facilitation by streamlining business registration and renewal procedures, making them as business-friendly as possible. Business registration and licensing procedures in Dubai are among the speediest and the least cumbersome in the world, as recognized by international institutions such as the World Bank in its annual Doing Business report. Furthermore, specialized agencies within the DED are constantly exploring avenues and expanding activities to promote exports, enrich the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Dubai, and attract high value-added FDI to Dubai. The DED has contributed, along with other government departments, to the increasing attractiveness of Dubai for FDI, and for sourcing goods and services by other countries.</p><h4>How has the leadership's vision for a diversified and knowledge-based economy influenced the business landscape in Dubai?</h4><p>Being less endowed with natural resources, Dubai has pursued economic diversification. The oil sector accounts for less than 3% of GDP, while trade activities—wholesale and retail, domestic and foreign—accounted for more than 30% in 2011. Logistics, transportation; and communications contribute nearly 14%, about the same as manufacturing, while the financial sector's share in GDP is about 11%. This relatively high diversification has played a major role in the resilience of Dubai's economy to the construction and real estate shock of 2009. Despite the significant decline in the value-added of real estate activities in 2009-2010, the economy has indeed rebounded, with growth reaching over 3% in 2011. However, we recognize that we have yet to be established as a fully knowledge-based economy, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing, where we clearly need to develop high value-added activities further and attract knowledge-based FDI. This should be facilitated by creating synergies between key private sector players and academic institutions, and by helping potential FDI to secure the skills—local and foreign—required for knowledge-based international competitiveness. This requires a joint effort by government departments and other relevant entities.</p><h4>Which economic sectors are seeing the highest growth in the Emirate?</h4><p>For the period 2009-2012, tourism (hospitality and restaurants) has been the fastest growing sector, growing annually in real terms at an average rate of over 12%. Manufacturing real value-added has also grown by about 10%, transportation and logistics by 6%, and trade by over 5%. These sectors have thus grown faster than GDP, which increased on average by 3.5% annually over the period. As expected, overall GDP growth was held back by the slack performance of the construction and real estate sectors, which are now showing signs of a slow, yet steady, rebound. Dubai's efforts to evolve into a knowledge economy have accelerated growth and expansion in the Emirate's services sector. The Islamic economy is a particularly important sector, for which Dubai aims to be a major hub. Furthermore, Dubai has been a pioneer of sustainable economic development in the region, having unveiled the “Dubai Green Economy Partnership" initiative to promote the development and broader deployment of clean technologies. Dubai FDI is the liaison point in this initiative, and investors interested in providing green solutions have a valuable opportunity in the Emirate.</p><h4>What recent reforms has the government put in place to enhance business regarding these issues?</h4><p>The Business Registration &amp; Licensing (BRL), as well as Commercial Compliance &amp; Consumer Protection (CCCP) sectors are two essential and dynamic customer interfaces for the DED. These two sectors are also critical in demonstrating Dubai's competitiveness in terms of the ease and transparency of doing business. The BBRL sector has been contributing substantially to facilitating business, and meeting the demands of rising business confidence in Dubai with service upgrades. In 2012, the DED issued close to 17,000 business licenses, 16% more than were issued in 2011. Service efficiency has also improved considerably, with 95% of the BRL services now available online, in addition to over the counter at DED branches, partner outlets such as legal offices, and a growing network of customer service centers. The pro-business environment in Dubai contributed substantially to the UAE jumping seven spots up to 26th place in the World Bank's Doing Business report of 2012. The World Bank is also citing BRL procedures in Dubai in terms of best practice, and helping other countries in the region to adopt our model. Government delegations from other countries, such as Iraq and Lebanon, have already held discussions with the DED on how to build efficient BRL operations. Retail is a pillar of economic activity in Dubai, and a major attraction driving trade and tourism, and the Commercial CCCP ensures that sales and service outlets in Dubai uphold the best international standards, and grow sustainably, while respecting consumer rights. In 2012, CCCP started classifying businesses according to their consumer friendliness, and more and more business sectors are progressively brought under this program. The Consumer-Friendliness Index, which now serves as a benchmark for service excellence and consumer satisfaction, is a key measure in this classification. As part of enabling retailers to exchange knowledge on best practices and retain customer confidence, CCCP also organized the first-ever Dubai World Conference on Consumer Rights and Power Brands Dubai Exhibition in 2013. The three-day event brought together international experts and local, as well as regional, businesses in discussions on protecting consumer rights, intellectual property rights, and brand integrity.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What evidence of stable growth have you seen in 2013?<br></h4><p>There are a couple of matters to consider. One is the investor confidence index, and the other is the consumer confidence index. Consumer confidence is higher now, and at the same time so are our economic figures—GDP growth is doing very well. In 2012, we achieved 3.5% growth. We are pursuing steady growth, while investors are seeing what they like to see, and certain sectors that were heavily impacted, such as real estate, are returning slowly in a controlled way. At the same time, we are seeing indicators that new investors are coming to set up business in Dubai. Looking at the last survey that was conducted asking the Arab youth in which foreign place they would like to live if they got the chance, the UAE ranked first, and Dubai is the highlighted city; France and the US came second and third. These indicators are important to consider because stability comes not only from economic prosperity, but also lifestyle. It was the number one factor investors valued in our Why Dubai survey. People like to stay in a place to do business, but also one that fits around their lifestyle. People want luxury and safety, and you get both of those in Dubai. Security comes with having the clarity of where you are. The government has sought a continuous vision of where we are going, our targets, and the measures taken to get there. We are sending a message that within the larger region we are very clear about our goals and ambitions, and how we will reach them.</p><h4>Tourism is growing steadily, but which other sectors can you identify as having the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>FDI grew 26.5% in 2012 compared to 2011. It is very encouraging to look at what it could be in 2013. Tourism is one of the most important sectors, especially with His Highness Sheikh Mohammed's new tourism strategy for 2020, which is looking to double Dubai's current visitor numbers from 10 million to 20 million. That will open up more opportunities for more investors to develop their future plans. We see trade and logistics as the strongest contenders because Dubai is a trading city. Trade will continue to be a strong sector, while exports will continue to grow stronger. Logistics is the tool Dubai uses to be a world trade hub.</p><h4>In 2012, Dubai FDI attracted 119 companies to the Emirate. How would you evaluate the competitive nature within the GCC in attracting new FDI?</h4><p>We have excellent relations with GCC countries, and we all complement each other. Competition helps us, and we see it as very positive. We believe that challenges are the motivator for change and for better future development. From a regional perspective, if an international company wants to establish itself in the GCC, looking at it as one bloc, we see this as very positive. Then, it depends on the nature of the investment and the economies around us. We strongly emphasize our strengths in trade and services. This is the very unique proposition of Dubai globally. We can promote doing business in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain, and many other countries in the entire MENASA region through Dubai, and at the same time have businesses coming to us first. We have these discussions internally in the UAE, as this healthy competition between the cities has been a normal practice for many years, and has helped to ignite positive economic change. This engine was always one of the successes of the UAE—the combination of competition and collaboration. There are many complementary aspects we share as a country that made us able to provide a wide range of offerings to investors and attract a large number of them to start here. Whenever we can assist a neighbor, we do. We are not afraid of competition, because there is always a positive side, and we focus on the glass being half full.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the purpose of creating the Dubai Economic Council (DEC)?<br></h4><p>The DEC was established to act as an advisory entity for the government of Dubai in economic decision making. As a think tank, it is the first of its kind in the UAE to provide initiatives and policy recommendations to the government for the wellbeing of citizens.  We will cover many of the remarkable early days of Dubai and the UAE in our forthcoming book. It will trace Dubai's origins as a mercantile hub and its strength through a shared vision and leadership. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, is keen to increase consultations and activities that allow him to see the diverse views of the representatives of  the public and private sectors.</p><h4>How do you design your policies to adapt to the different demands of companies from various sectors?</h4><p>First of all, it might be pertinent to mention that the DEC is mandated to propose forward-looking initiatives and policies to the government of Dubai, and not to private companies. Nonetheless, everybody here, including the Secretariat General, is aware of local market needs. In short though, we deal with macro-level issues and are an important tool for decision-making circles in the country.</p><h4>You have initiated the Economic Policy and Research Center (EPRC) and the Legal Affairs Research Center (LARC). What do each of these add to the DEC?</h4><p>EPRC deals with macroeconomic, sectorial, and economic growth issues, while LARC deals with legal and other regulatory matters; both are essential when formulating policies. This ensures a strong regulatory framework that mitigates the continuous changes in the local and global business environment. Our published books include commentary on taxation in Dubai and the currency union. Recently, we published our quarterly review on Dubai.</p><h4>What are your priorities to promote sustainable growth in the context of the Vision 2020?</h4><p>The UAE is advancing toward a knowledge-based economy, and we recognize the pre-requisites for this strategy, namely: good education, innovation, and competitiveness. The DEC believes in sustainable development through its partnerships and has established a number of them with local and international organizations. For example, the partnership with the Commercial Law Development Program (US Department of Commerce) and the UAE Ministry of Justice saw the initiation of a training program for judges, which we hope to continue annually along with the recent Arab International Chambers of Commerce training program concluded in China. Such partnerships enable sustainable economic development, and DEC's network contributes toward Dubai's economic growth.</p><h4>How was the 2009 crunch taken as an opportunity to rethink the economic model here?</h4><p>This was not only the case in Dubai, but worldwide. Dubai was affected simply because of its dynamics. That is, we are a part of the global economy. Nevertheless, if we look at the real estate sector in the US and many other countries, people were being asked to leave their properties to settle debts with the banks. Dubai built excellent infrastructure, and since then those assets have appreciated, not depreciated. Real estate will have a crunch time, but will rise again. It is the same as London, Paris, Barcelona, or Istanbul. Cooperation is important, too, and we have reflected that in our policies. His Highness' directions clearly stated that the rights of everyone must be protected. A law was passed to universally guarantee all deposits within the UAE banking system. In sum, the DEC believes that despite the impact of the global financial crisis, it can provide significant lessons for all countries and companies: first, to advocate a visionary strategy toward the future, and, second, to formulate sound policies to achieve short- and medium-term objectives.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the rest of 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>Arguably, the first priority for the government now is macroeconomic stability in order to attract more FDI and grow the economy. Second, Emiratization of the UAE labor force is key to future sustainable growth. We lack natural resources, but we are rich in infrastructure. Dubai is also expected to grow at a rate of more than 4% in 2013, and the government has announced major projects, such as the Mohammed Bin Rashid  (MBR) City, which is set to redefine Dubai's regional and global profile. Meanwhile in tourism, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has announced a plan to attract 20 million visitors per annum by 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When we spoke to you in 2012, you mentioned that it is important for Dubai to abandon boom and bust cycles and aim for stability. What evidence of stable growth have you witnessed over the past year?<br></h4><p>Just to clarify, Dubai was impacted by the global financial crisis in 2009, but since then the economy has been on a stable growth path, free from boom and bust cycles. Upturns and slowdowns have not been ruled out as these are natural given our exposure to the world economy. Dubai saw stable growth of 4.4% in 2012, and growth in 2013 is expected to be around the 5%. Again, this reflects faith in our sound macroeconomic management and is a clear indication of stable, fundamental growth. In terms of the Dubai Chamber, our members' exports and re-exports increased 9% to AED268 billion in 2012, up from AED246 billion in 2011. This was on the back of 15% growth between 2011 and 2010 and 15% growth in 2010 compared to 2009. Again, in 2013 we are seeing steady and consistent growth, with our members' exports and re-exports rising 7% in the first half of the year to reach AED145.2 billion, up from AED136.2 billion for the same period in 2012. The number of certificates of origin we issued during the same period increased by 12.2% to a total of 418,000, compared to 372,000 in 1H2012. This puts us firmly on track to meet last year's targets. Meanwhile, along with trade, tourism continues to go from strength to strength. Strong numbers are being reported by the city's hotels and Dubai International Airport alike. While another indicator of Dubai's stable economic growth is the recent pick-up in real estate that we are currently witnessing. Rental yields have increased in most areas and across various housing stock, with more popular locations reporting double-digit growth. At the same time, new projects are coming on stream, yet this has done little to dampen prices, which indicates that demand is still strong.</p><h4>What does the announcement of Mohammed Bin Rashid (MBR) City indicate for Dubai?</h4><p>This new city within Dubai will set a new benchmark for urban development in the region. Comprised of four key components, the city will feature world-class leisure facilities and provide an integrated environment for the development of entrepreneurship and innovation that will benefit the private sector considerably. MBR City is aligned to Vision 2030 and will enable the UAE to enter a new era in which it becomes the capital of entrepreneurship, arts, culture, and family tourism for over 2 billion people. This is an ambitious project and one that shows Dubai is still growing and developing into one of the world's leading cities for business and leisure. For the private sector and the economy, this announcement is a major boost and will provide a new impetus for a revival of the construction sector. This is going to create more jobs and increase consumer confidence and spending and will help to boost economic output across the board.</p><h4>What kind of growth has the Chamber experienced over the past year? Which economic sectors comprise the largest portion of your membership base?</h4><p>In our core business we have seen increases across the board in certificates of origin, membership and our members' trade activities. In terms of their spread, a large portion of our members operate in the trade sector, followed by the construction and real estate sectors, respectively. Other activities, such as manufacturing, leisure, financial intermediation, and health and social work make up the remainder. As an organization, we have physically grown by reaching out into new markets around the world. We now have a presence in Baku, Azerbaijan and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We are in the final stages of opening another branch office in Erbil, Iraq, and are examining possibilities in another 17 different markets. Our target is to open 20 such offices in key markets around the world in order to help our members tap into the investment opportunities in these markets, while helping to attract FDI flows into Dubai. We are also seeing growth in our SMEs and are working on a number of projects to help support these businesses. This includes Tejar Dubai, which is an initiative to encourage and train the next generation of Emirati entrepreneurs. We launched this initiative recently and are in the process of recruiting our first round of candidates to start the bespoke training and mentoring program later in 2013.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai is a gateway to Africa as the Emirate's close proximity and business-friendly climate is an ideal hub for the continent."</div><h4>Can you comment on other significant growth areas for bilateral trade, such as Africa?</h4><p>Africa is home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies and offers the highest risk-adjusted returns on foreign direct investment among emerging economies. While mining and oil are big businesses, infrastructure investment and the consumer market are major growth areas. The continent has a growing middle class, which is driving significant consumer growth. At the same time, around 70% of its population is under 35, which is also helping to power further economic development. The IMF has predicted that no other continent will grow more strongly over the coming years. At the same time, governments across Africa are working to improve the business climate, which can only serve to strengthen its investment potential. Dubai is a gateway to Africa as the Emirate's close proximity and business-friendly climate is an ideal hub for the continent. Dubai offers international companies a safe haven to do business across the Middle East, African, and south Asian regions, and we will continue to facilitate and promote Dubai as an international business hub for decades to come. We envisage developing our existing trade relationship by encouraging more African companies to use Dubai as a base to trade with Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North America. To this end, we organized the Africa Global Business Forum 2013 in May, held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. The forum highlighted the growing ties between the UAE and the continent and the areas of business potential for both sides. Over the course of two days 4,500 attendees participated in the event, including 40 government ministers and business leaders and the clear message was the Africa is ready for investment and Dubai is an excellent gateway and business partner.</p><h4>Regionally, how have trade relations between Dubai and GCC countries grown over the past year?</h4><p>The popularity of GCC countries as export destinations has further accelerated in 2013, with our members' total exports to the region between January and June expanding by 19% to AED82.6 billion. Saudi Arabia is the biggest market in the GCC, with our members' exports reaching AED44.1 billion, or 30% of their total exports for the period. Qatar is second to Saudi Arabia as the largest export destination, with a 17% share and exports worth AED13.8 billion. However, during this period Qatar grew at a much faster pace, with exports rising by 33%. Kuwait then follows in terms of share with 12% of our members' exports to the GCC, then the UAE with 8%, Oman with 7%, and Bahrain with 3%.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>Looking ahead, initiatives like the Islamic Economy, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, earlier in 2013 will play a major part in driving new business growth. This initiative is to make Dubai the capital of the Islamic economy and it sends a clear message to all investors that Dubai is the most prominent destination for sharia-compliant finance and business in the region. As a major Arab business and leisure destination, Dubai is an ideal choice to become the hub for all Islamic economic related fields due to its existing strengths in this area. We see opportunities to enhance the halal food industry, develop trade policies and commercial laws, and for the development of the Islamic finance industry, through the provision of this initiative. For instance, the UAE is already one of the biggest markets in the region for Islamic banking, accounting for 27% of all Islamic banking assets in the GCC. Given Dubai's position as a key destination for many global banks and financial institutions, this initiative will serve to strengthen this thriving sector. The establishment of an Islamic economic capital will encourage competitiveness, of which Dubai has many advantages like multiple promising sectors, the unlimited support given by its leadership and help to open doors to new opportunities. To this end, Dubai Chamber is organizing the Global Islamic Economic Summit later in 2013 which will bring together experts, policy makers, and stakeholders from around the world to initiate a dialogue on the development of the Islamic Economy sectors, including sharia finance, halal manufacturing, and related lifestyle sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Dubai Holding supported Dubai's growth since its establishment in 2004?<br></h4><p>We are proud to be one of the engines driving the development of the non-oil sectors in Dubai. Through our different specialized business parks run by TECOM Investments, we continue to provide a platform for many companies from different sectors including media, technology, bio-technology, light industrial manufacturing, education, and design, to grow and expand their presence regionally from within Dubai. These business parks have played an instrumental role in establishing Dubai as a knowledge-based economy and a manufacturing hub. There are currently over 4,000 companies based out of these business parks, and they have attracted over 45,000 knowledge workers and students. Through Jumeirah, we have supported the growth of the hospitality sector, which in turn has supported tourism and Dubai's status as the destination of choice when it comes to family tourism and, increasingly, shopping and medical tourism. Currently, we operate eight luxury hotels, a water park, a serviced residence, and many restaurants in Dubai aimed at addressing the needs of tourists. Through Dubai Properties Group, we have created highly desirable communities for the residents of Dubai. We have delivered over 31,000 residential units to the market, offering a full range of products addressing each segment of the residential market. Lastly, Dubai Holding has also been instrumental in improving the level of telecommunications services in Dubai and the UAE. As you are aware, du was launched and spun out of Dubai Holding, and we are extremely proud of its success achieved within a very short period of time. Overall, through our diversified portfolio of businesses, Dubai Holding has contributed to cementing Dubai's position as a leading global business hub.</p><h4>How is the Holding positioned to help develop different sectors of the economy in the Emirate? What values are reflected in the company's philosophy?</h4><p>Dubai has established itself as the region's financial, business, and tourism hub, and Dubai Holding is definitely at the heart of that development. Through our different portfolio of companies, we cover all key growth sectors, namely hospitality, business parks, real estate, and telecommunications. Dubai, and the UAE in general, encourage innovation and recognize excellence, and these two values are at the core of our philosophy. At the same time, we are also measured in our approach and carefully study each opportunity before acting on it. For example, we are currently establishing Dubai Design District, which will develop the country's luxury, design, and fashion sectors. We have spent a lot of time studying this, and are confident that we will be able to deliver a truly unique project aimed at establishing Dubai as a hub for these sectors.</p><h4>In which sectors is Dubai Holding seeing the most growth?</h4><p>Positive indicators and trends in Dubai are illustrating the Emirate's resilience and, in turn, the outlook for Dubai Holding, the businesses of which show considerable promise. Over the past year, Dubai has witnessed growth in a number of sectors that are central to the Emirate's economy and development. These include real estate, hospitality, and telecommunications, all of which are sectors that we, Dubai Holding, are involved in. In addition, we are also seeing growth in the end-user markets for our business parks such as technology, media, and education, all of which have shown very steady growth over the past year. We are also registering very strong growth in the light industrial manufacturing sector through Dubai Industrial City. As you may be aware, this sector is now the second largest contributor to Dubai's GDP, having posted growth of 13% in 2012.</p><h4>How do you collaborate with government authorities to sustain growth within Dubai?</h4><p>We coordinate very closely with Dubai's government though various channels, for strategic directions, as well as in operational matters. For example, in June 2013 we signed an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the General Secretariat of the Executive Council of Dubai to create and develop Dubai Fashion 2020, which is a strategic plan that will support Dubai's and the wider region's design and fashion industry. Dubai Design District will be the cornerstone of this plan. We also work closely and regularly with other government authorities like RTA, DEWA, and Dubai Municipality to ensure the smooth delivery and management of our projects.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the Holding?</h4><p>Over the past few years, we have focused our strategy on driving revenue, improving operations, and boosting profitability across all of our businesses, as well as addressing our financial commitments. The results of this strategy are increasingly evident in our financial performance, and are testament to the group's overall recovery. We will continue supporting our business lines, all of which are progressing positively in the strengthening market environment. We are ardently looking forward to what lies ahead and have many exciting plans in the pipeline.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) provides a platform for commodities companies to set up their operations and access the markets of the region. What makes Dubai attractive as a destination for companies?<br></h4><p>As a Government of Dubai authority with world-class infrastructure and regulation, our members know they can trade here with confidence. Dubai is a global hub for the commodity trade that caters to local and international market demands. Businesses around the globe look for a place where they can expand, access new markets, and conduct their day-to-day operations in a secure, transparent, and modern environment. They look for the very best in logistical facilities, a stable political climate, and a favorable fiscal climate, as well as a high quality of life. Dubai is also located at the center of trade between producing countries in the East and consuming nations in the West. It has excellent air and sea links, which makes doing business here extremely convenient and efficient.</p><h4>Will its trade relationship with Africa allow Dubai to overtake Mumbai or Antwerp?</h4><p>It is important that we don't just look at this as a competition. At the same time, it is of course well documented that Dubai is perfectly positioned between producing and consuming countries. Yes, it is imperative to grow; that is essential, but it is also important to note that our trading partners are often complementary centers. India is a very large cutting and polishing center and a huge artisan trading center, similar to that of China. Looking at the diamond trade specifically, Dubai is the leading rough diamond trading center. Dubai serves as a central hub for goods as they are amalgamated, sorted, and sent on for cutting and polishing. We are seeing a number of polished goods coming back into Dubai, which is also growing as a polishing center, not just a jewelry center. Our mission is to establish Dubai as the global hub for the commodities trade, the overall growth of the global sector is therefore equally important to us. To give you an example of how we at DMCC cater to the Dubai trade, we focus on offering the infrastructure to increase the flow of trade through the Emirate, and as a result have seen the flow of diamonds coming through Dubai grow from $5 million a few years ago to over $39 billion today. The fact that Dubai and DMCC has facilitated this growth is testimony to that strategy. In fact, if you look at the rough trade, Dubai is the only diamond center in the world that has grown at this unrivalled pace.</p><h4>What were your experiences at the Dubai Diamond Conference in 2013?</h4><p>As you are aware, DMCC hosted the first ever Dubai Diamond Conference in the UAE in March 2013, which brought together delegates and keynote speakers from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, including several ministers of mines and mineral resources from leading African producing countries. Being the only diamond conference in the UAE, it also provided a great opportunity to build relationships between companies and governments in producing and consuming countries. There was naturally a strong focus on the role that the Middle East plays along the trade route for rough and polished diamonds—also known as the New Silk Route. The delegates' broad range of experience fuelled dynamic discussions with many different views from African, Middle Eastern, European, and Asian diamond industry participants. It was really insightful; imagine a room with over 500 delegates and keynotes such as Hon. Susan Shabangu, Minister of Mineral Resources of the Republic of South Africa; Hon. Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu, Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Republic of Zimbabwe; Hon. Kitso O. Mokaila, Minister of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources, Republic of Botswana; Hon. Prof. Dr. Francisco Queiroz, Minister of Geology, Mines and Industry, Republic of Angola; and Hon. Isak Katali, Minister of Mines and Energy of the Republic of Namibia in attendance. DMCC's ability to bring together such key players from across the globe demonstrates Dubai's strength and position as one of the world's leading international diamond centers comparable to Mumbai, Antwerp, and New York. A key outcome from the Dubai Diamond Conference was that almost everyone agreed that as the center of gravity for the international diamond trade continues to shift eastward to MENA, India, and China, DMCC and Dubai's significance in the international diamond trade will only grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of impact did the financial crisis have on internal auditing and risk management procedures?<br></h4><p>In terms of business challenges, the reforms to the legal framework improved corporate governance requirements for risk management and, hence, the development and resilience of the economy. They proved how important corporate governance is. For a global economic crisis, which it was, the need for stronger internal audit and risk management procedures are of utmost importance. Good corporate governance is a key factor in sustaining economic growth and development. As economic conditions change, so too do risk management priorities. That is also why auditors should consider first and foremost whether they are aligned with the strategy and direction of the company. By focusing on a company's long-term strategy and understanding the impact of short-term initiatives, they can align themselves accordingly, and the internal audit functions can be better positioned to monitor and address the risk management activities throughout. Internal auditing plays a very big role in corporate governance. We recommend having an audit committee. Large family businesses should have an audit committee, and the chairman should be an independent board member. From there, they can decide whether they should outsource, or else have an internal auditing department.</p><h4>What kind of impact has real estate legislation had on the market here?</h4><p>The Dubai Jointly Owned Property Law established a framework for development and subdivision in such unified compounds, which are then known as jointly owned properties. Each development in Dubai comprises not only a number of units, but also common parts designed for common use by unit owners and occupants. Regulations have been introduced to enforce the law and, among other things, they provide that the owners' association of all the unit owners is responsible for the management, operation, and maintenance of common areas. For each development, the developer must file a Jointly Owned Property Declaration (JOPD) with the Land Department. Under the strata law, they must appoint an auditor and at the first annual general meeting and at the end of the financial year they evaluate financial statements. We give guidance and provide a way forward to the board in the initial transition stage for it to ensure that the service charge is properly calculated, computed, and charged correctly to the owners. When there are multiple users, making sure the right amounts are charged is very important, especially where developers are still holding something they've not sold. It was quite a task in the initial years. The strata law accounts for this and provides owners' associations with the power to hold a loan on the property of those we have not paid. The legalities are there, and the lawyers are comfortable going to court to get a loan to recover service charges, which is the same as in other countries where we work, such as the UK.</p><h4>What about the need to improve insolvency laws?</h4><p>That, to me, is crucial in a developing nation. The reform of insolvency laws can improve economic deficiencies and strengthen the market in times of crisis. Reforming the insolvency laws to provide clarity and transparency will boost the national economy by reducing the cost of capital for companies in the medium to long term. There is a bankruptcy law, but it has not been tested by companies, which means that there is uncertainty in legal circles. Best practice corporate governance can play an important role in stimulating investments in the UAE, and enhancing confidence among investors.</p><h4>Why has the bankruptcy law taken so long? Is that prudent?</h4><p>Dubai is unique. It has grown very successfully in a very short period of time. There is superb infrastructure, but this requires time. It has to balance between the sharia and other legal systems. It is complicated. The lawyers and businesses have long been calling for changes to mitigate financial problems and attract foreign investments. The good thing is that a draft bankruptcy law designed to support companies is currently being reviewed, which is the final stage. There is new hope for an overhaul in how the law deals with businesses and individuals.</p><h4>Why do you see Dubai as such a vibrant center for global business?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the very few cities in the world that has undergone such a rapid transformation from humble beginnings to become one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Tourism, trade, and logistics have earned it the reputation of being the bridge between East and West. It is a new, dynamic place for the Arabian Gulf region, and home to maybe 200 nationalities. Dubai is safe, stable, centrally located, and boasts a good education system, healthcare, and infrastructure. Obviously, also, the tax legislation is very relaxed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Noor Islamic Bank began in 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis. How did the bank come about, and what is its importance for the Gulf region and Dubai?</h4><p>Noor Islamic Bank was created to bring a new face to Islamic banking in Dubai and the region. The financial crisis taught us to be resilient, and now we focus on liquidity and capital. That was the secret of our success, and we are in our second year of profitability. It started off tough, but we are now doing well.</p><h4>What is the potential for Islamic banking in Dubai, and how big is the market for sharia-compliant banking?</h4><p>The market remains large, and the potential throughout the region is huge. The GCC is the busiest and most developed region for Islamic finance in the world; however, there is still a lot to be achieved in terms of trade, cross-border trade, and long-term Islamic sukuks. I believe the market has yet to attain its full potential.</p><h4>You have stated your desire to be among the world's 100 most innovative banks by 2020. What measures are you taking to achieve those goals?</h4><p>Banks are conservative and traditional by nature, because of the element of risk that we have to manage. However, at Noor we are firmly focused on the future, and can see tomorrow's trends taking shape today among our customers. We see strong changes, particularly among our young customers in the way they approach and deal with banks. I don't see other banks adapting as well yet. They rarely change their ways unless it is to catch up with new trends that prove profitable, and are by nature cautious and conservative. I really believe we need to consider innovation seriously. Innovation doesn't just mean the technological dimension. It involves the way you see things, your perspectives, the way you deal with customers, your interaction, your whole business, and even your philosophical outlook. Social and digital media have opened up so many horizons that need to be explored, and that is how I see the next generation of customers. They don't come to the banks anymore, so what is the use of all your branches? You need to find customers online; that is where the future generation wants to interact.</p><div class="quote">“Our major activity is corporate, but we are looking to diversify our portfolio."</div><h4>Do you think a large portion of your customers still need to be educated in terms of online banking?</h4><p>I remember when ATMs initially appeared; it was difficult for people to get used to them at first—they thought it was a complicated machine. However, they all got used to them over time. It is the same with online banking, and banking done through smartphones. People will get used to these modes and realize they are the way to go. They are far more convenient than traditional banking methods.</p><h4>What is your customer profile?</h4><p>We have all sorts. Our major activity is corporate, but we are looking to diversify our portfolio. I am interested in moving into more specialized corporate niches.</p><p>Yes, HH Sheikh Mohammed's goals mean there will be more interest and opportunities for Islamic banking to develop and flourish. But, the key factor is not just finance, because that always comes after trade. I think HH Sheikh Mohammed wants to develop production and trade around the region and the world of Islamic halal products; be they food, cosmetics, or healthcare products. There is a huge market for these products, as long as you can bring investors in and open this market. The financial market, sukuks and so on, will follow on from this.How will Dubai as a world hub in the sukuk trading market benefit Noor Islamic Bank, and what are the challenges you face?</p><h4>Do you see local bonds, currently being issued in London, coming here to Dubai?</h4><p>I don't know why they are being issued in London, because to my thinking the natural place for them is here in this region. We have international markets that can be accessed from anywhere. The brand equity of the entities that issue sukuks is from this region. These are known in their region, and liked by investors here. If you take it to London from here, you are just trying to attract investors to that market.</p><h4>Corporate social responsibility is a major part of a bank's outlook in compliance with sharia principles. What sort of initiatives do you undertake in that regard?</h4><p>We recently announced the establishment of Noor Awqaf, an asset management company that is dedicated to charitable endowments (awqaf). It ensures that these endowments are managed efficiently and profitably in order to cater to people in need. Islamic endowment activities, one of which I chair, have suffered for years from a lack of efficient financial skills. These awqaf are run as an asset- and fund-management-type institution, or as a treasury. However, they have to be managed efficiently from a financial perspective. We launched Noor Awqaf as a joint venture between an awqaf and a financial institution, and it is the first ever example of this. I think this will bring efficiency and financial rewards into Islamic endowments, which will prove more beneficial in terms of addressing the actual requirements of those in need, those whom the awqaf is for.</p><h4>How is Noor Islamic Bank a positive influence in Dubai?</h4><p>We are trying to redefine Islamic banking by creating a more progressive, open, tolerant, and global model. We don't want to be pigeonholed into a limited audience, and want to become a global player. We aim to create an Islamic icon built on those principles.</p><h4>What are the company's targets in the UAE over the coming year?</h4><p>We will keep doing what we have been doing so far. We will consolidate our position in debt structure with sukuks. Moreover, we will continue to diversify our business, building stronger roots in our existing market. We will look for fresh opportunities and growth, and we'll try to tap into new areas in our market that have been underpenetrated.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, recently issued a decision commissioning Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum to oversee the development of the Islamic economy to become one of Dubai's basic tributaries. How do you see the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) supporting this initiative?<br></h4><p>If there is one area in which I expect innovation and development, it is Islamic finance. I expect Dubai and the UAE to become a major hub for Islamic finance, with more of the world's sharia-compliant products being launched or administered from here. The first half of 2013 was an exciting time for UAE sukuk issuers and saw a significant increase in the number of sukuk listings on the DFSA's Official List of Securities. As of the end of July 2013, there were 10 sukuks listed with an aggregate market capitalization of $7.15 billion, of which $3.5 billion was raised during the first half of 2013. They include the UAE's most prominent companies like the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), Emirates Airline, Dubai Islamic Bank, Sharjah Islamic Bank, and Majid Al Futtaim. Members of the DFSA staff are active in the Islamic Financial Standards Board, which is a leading standard setter, promoting consistency for Islamic finance. We have also designed our regulatory structure to be a “sharia systems regulator" allowing maximum flexibility for Islamic firms or those offering products through an Islamic window. Finally, we have invested much time into aligning our rules and processes with international best practices for offerings and listings. Thanks to these efforts and the excellent work done by NASDAQ Dubai, the DIFC is well established as one of the leading international centers for Islamic finance.</p><h4>The index compiler Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) recently promoted the UAE to emerging market status. Do you think that this move will further boost investor sentiment for the Gulf economies?</h4><p>As one of the largest index providers the recent upgrade is important, not least for future liquidity, but is not completely unexpected. UAE exchanges and capital market infrastructure have, in 12 years, reached a level of standards that other emerging markets have yet to reach. In fact, other index providers like the FTSE Group and Russell Investments had already upgraded the UAE to emerging market status in 2010 and 2011, respectively.</p><h4>In 2013, the DFSA signed its 60th Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the European Securities and Markets Authority. How have all your MoUs contributed to more efficient and effective regulatory cooperation and engagement?</h4><p>Cooperation and information sharing with fellow regulators remains critical in the current environment for the DIFC, and MoUs have proven to be the most effective tool for leveraging regulatory intelligence. The global standard setters, too, have come to appreciate the value of this mechanism, and the DFSA is a signatory to multilateral MoUs initiated by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), following a rigorous assessment process. Cooperation and interaction with the DFSA's federal counterparts and with regulators and supervisors in the region remain a top priority. We have a network of MoUs with the Central Bank of the UAE, the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority, and the Insurance Authority of the UAE and, as you would expect, we work closely with our colleagues in each of these, in addition to arrangements with our counterparts in Oman, Jordan, Qatar, and Egypt. A continuing increase in activity by authorized firms in the DIFC, and individuals and entities with links to the DIFC, has meant a corresponding increase in requests for assistance to and from fellow regulators. This assistance and these exchanges are made much more efficient and effective by the reliance on MoUs. A real benefit of our MoU network is the ability it gives to our regulated firms to have access to European markets, for example.</p><div class="quote">“The DFSA has a stated goal to develop, administer, and enforce world-class regulations, including playing a part in their formulation. "</div><h4>In which way has the work of the various standard setters impacted the policies of the DFSA?</h4><p>The international standard setters play a critical role in drafting and revising best practice, sometimes to avert, but sometimes in response to, crises. The DFSA has a stated goal to develop, administer, and enforce world-class regulations, including playing a part in their formulation. To that end, the DFSA is represented on, and participates in the work of, all three of the main standard-setters: the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) for banking regulation; IOSCO for securities and markets regulation; and the IAIS for insurance regulation. The DFSA is also committed to the development of standards for Islamic finance, and in 2012 we were admitted to the Technical Committee of the Islamic Financial Services Board. The policy positions and expectations that flow from the work of the standard setters then feed into the DFSA-administered Laws and Rulebook. For instance, over the past 18 months or so we have seen the Basel III framework and capital adequacy requirements reflected into our rules, and the enhanced corporate governance and remuneration standards of the Basel Committee, IAIS, and IOSCO reflected particularly in our GEN Rules. In addition, recent changes to the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations in relation to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) are reflected in a new AML Module of the Rulebook, and the new IOSCO Principles for Financial Markets Infrastructure are found in the DFSA's Authorized Market Institutions Regime. There are numerous other examples, and this is an ongoing process. It is important to be compliant with international standards and expectations, as this improves regulatory standards and adds to the credibility and reputation of the DIFC and the firms that choose to be regulated here. However, we are also very mindful to ensure that any change to our regime will be appropriate for the type of jurisdiction we are and our location, along with other considerations such as to ensure that the cost of regulation is in proportion to the benefit.</p><h4>How do you foresee the regulatory landscape to look like in the UAE in five years' time?</h4><p>The DIFC is the vision of its founding President, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. He saw the importance of financial services driving economic activity and growth in creating an effective regulator and strong judiciary as key foundations of an international financial center. His vision and strong support have provided both the blueprint for, and the foundation of, the DIFC's success today. This vision is endorsed by the Deputy Ruler of Dubai and the current President of the DIFC, His Highness Sheikh Maktoum Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Under his guidance and engaged leadership, the center has become a beacon in the world of financial services and continues to grow and develop; wherever I travel around the world, as I meet senior policy makers and regulators, they are impressed by what has been accomplished. I think we will see an even stronger level of cooperation among regulators in the coming years. The DFSA's relationships with the UAE federal regulators are excellent, strong, and effective. We all recognize that there are good public policy reasons to have an international financial center within the UAE that offers a distinct jurisdiction, while retaining the federal regulators' functions in the UAE.</p><p>The recently announced Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the financial free zone in the capital, will create a number of opportunities in the coming years. I expect that this center will be aligned with the DIFC regarding public policy and legislative ideals, and that consensus should strengthen our voices at the federal level and at the tables of the international standard setters. It remains to be seen what sectors the ADGM will seek to develop in the financial services industry, but I look forward to working with them for our mutual benefit. After several rocky years, I believe the world financial markets are settling into a period of greater stability. I do not expect so many of the dramatic regulatory changes that followed the 2008 crisis. Rather, I think this consolidating period will give the UAE's regulators an opportunity to bring their regimes into line with international best practice and standards in the most appropriate manner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-core-of-affairs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the potential market and prospects for the finance sector in the UAE?<br></h4><p>The location and strength of the market are probably the most attractive factors supporting the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) at the moment. Many of the companies that come to the DIFC are looking at not only doing business within the UAE, but also around the Gulf region as well as the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia (MENASA) region. Dubai is a gateway to those different countries. When we talk about the business prospects from the DIFC's perspective, we don't just talk about what is going on in the UAE or in the Gulf, but also in the region because that is where our clients are doing business. That is how I view the market as opposed to just being centered on Dubai or Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>Coming from NASDAQ Dubai previously, do you think the vision of positioning Dubai as a sukuk market and a leading Islamic finance center will benefit companies that want to trade here?</h4><p>London typically leads in the international figures, but for Dubai to be in second place is not a bad position to be in. Given the pipeline of sukuks that is expected over the next year, we could see it being number one in terms of value raised. Many jurisdictions are looking at the regulations and opportunities that Dubai provides. We foresee the sukuk market increasing in the future, and NASDAQ Dubai will be the beneficiary of that.</p><h4>How do you develop international relations with other leading world financial markets?</h4><p>You have to establish a position of credibility. It is one thing to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) and say, I am a financial center and I would like to work in your country, I would like to work with your financial center. The question is whether or not that MoU means anything. If the MoUs, treaties, or agreements you make with other countries are not respected after they have been signed, then they mean nothing. However, if they are respected then you have a true agreement and a true treaty. Look at what Dubai has done with the DIFC as well as with the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in terms of our regulations and our court system. The DIFC has 80 MoUs and the DFSA has 56. If a judgment is rendered by the DFSA, by the DIFC court via us, or the DIFC authority, it has to be demonstrated that it can be respected in other jurisdictions, and that it can also be challenged in such jurisdictions; that is the ultimate test. The other area where the DIFC has established credibility is in the treaties and agreements that have been made internationally. That gives the DIFC an incredible advantage over many regional financial centers, as international businesses come to the region because of its safety. The second reason they come is certainty of law, which is great if it works in the UAE—and even better if it works internationally.</p><h4>How do you manage to create the appropriate regulatory environment for the financial sector?</h4><p>When the G20 gets together, it discusses what regulations are needed and how they can be put into effect. They usually say, let's create a board with a representative from each member of the G20, the Financial Stability Board (FSB). That board creates individual committees that accredit each country. They put you through a whole series of tests, and if you want to be a regulator that is accredited under the FSB of the G20, then you have to adhere to these standards, pass these tests, and be willing to be audited. We adhere to those tests, we submit to those audits, and we complete all the necessary requisites to ensure that we meet all the standards of the G20 and the board. If you come to the DFSA or the DIFC, you are regulated at the highest global standards.</p><h4>Do you consider demographics to be an important factor in the MENA region?</h4><p>By itself, Dubai has a lot of growth. If you talk to anyone from around the world that is thinking about doing business in this region, they will come to Dubai. They will come to Dubai first because it is the easiest place to live in in this region. It has the most open culture and the most houses and apartments. We accept other cultures and we are very competitive, meaning that the banks and the different firms here are used to competing because we have an open trade culture. Dubai is going to continue growing and being the business destination of choice for the Middle East. Abu Dhabi will be very aggressive as well, and so the UAE itself will see decent growth going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the global financial crisis impact operations here, and how has it recovered since?<br></h4><p>Société Générale is based in the Middle East region since 1997, originally through a representative office based in Bank Street, and then with a Regional Head Office located since 2007 in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) (Société Générale Bank and Trust—Middle East). Nowadays, we have two business lines based in the GCC: Private Banking (PRIV) and Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB). Apart from our regional headquarters in Dubai (for both PRIV and CIB), we also have one representative office in Abu Dhabi and a subsidiary in Riyadh (CIB). Société Générale was created in 1864 and has successfully passed through several global financial crises. At the end of 2007 the financial crisis hit the markets, but it didn't hit Dubai until the end of 2009. So as a conclusion, I would say that this was not the first crisis for us and it will undoubtedly not be the last we will overcome. Crisis or not, we continue to advise our clients investments, as usual.</p><h4>Are there other ways in which banking in the Middle East is different than in Europe?</h4><p>Yes, the most important thing being that our clients based in the Middle East have a much more global exposure than those based in Europe. This definitely implies a lot of changes within the bank as we need to have the capability to follow our clients all around the world. That's why we need to be very well connected within the bank, which is one of the strengths of Société Générale. As an international group, Société Générale is considered as a universal bank. Our PRIV division is present all around the world, through 18 offices. As a matter of fact, if we have a client here in Dubai who wants to invest in one of those places, we can ensure that he will have the same level of understanding and expertise thanks to these local teams.</p><h4>Would you say the appetite for high-risk investments has returned to Dubai?</h4><p>Yes, we are definitely seeing an increase in the risk appetite of Dubai investors. First of all, Dubai real estate has performed very well recently, topping the world's property market. This excellent performance brings confidence to local investors and also helps them to redeploy their assets toward other asset classes. Secondly, our 2014 economic scenario of accelerating global growth translates into a bias toward risk assets, especially in the US. We have seen no new top-down fact that would change our risk position since early summer. Economic releases even tend to confirm that the recovery is gaining speed in developed countries. Our clients want to be able to benefit from this good environment for equities and many of them requested to invest in products linked to equity market performance. Thirdly, in relation with this new appetite for Western equities, we have seen clients reducing their exposure to fixed-rate bonds and asking for products with floating rates. Indeed, the long-awaited rise in US Treasuries has materialized from May, starting with better than expected US employment figures and increasing likelihood of Fed tapering from September. The 10-year has moved up more than 115 basis points in yield since then. At this current level, we believe that investment grade credit spreads are much too tight in the context of credit ratios stabilizing at best. Given the fact that default rates remain low for the foreseeable future, we believe the high-yield space is the place to be invested in. At the end of the day, it may seem paradoxical, but riskier investments, such as equities and high-yield bonds, seem safer than the sovereign bonds that have a too low yield to really protect investors. It is another legacy of the financial crisis.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you plan to do now that you have been elected Secretary-General to the new Islamic Economy Initiative Committee?<br></h4><p>It is one of Dubai's most promising initiatives, with enormous potential. The whole idea is that the market is there and growing. If you look at the GDP of Muslim countries, it is in excess of $8 trillion. Muslims account for one-quarter of the world's population—about 1.8 billion—and their numbers are growing twice as fast as the global population. That gives you an idea of the size and potential of this sector. Our work concentrates on three major areas. One is the regulatory framework, which includes the introduction of an authority entitled to review all of the existing regulations and standards to introduce the necessary amendments toward establishing a comprehensive set of laws, regulations, and standards governing the compliance of any product with the sharia. The second area that needs some attention is the vertical and horizontal enhancement of sharia-compliant activities in the financial sector. This includes financial transactions, Islamic banking, Islamic insurance (takaful), other financial institutions, and debt instruments (sukuk). The third area is the real economy, which is meeting the requirements and demands of consumers, such as food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, luxury goods, and other products. Yes, it is very wide, but it also needs to be verified and stamped as halal or sharia-compliant to meet consumer requirements in this regard.</p><h4>How will Dubai compete with countries like Saudi Arabia or Malaysia?</h4><p>Dubai is really well positioned in terms of its infrastructure, network, location, and connectivity between East and West, which places it in a good position to compete. The Islamic economy, especially in the financial sector, is not new to Dubai. We had the first Islamic bank in the world. The Dubai Financial Market (DFM) today is labeled as an Islamic stock exchange in the sense that we have a sharia board and are sharia-compliant. We do have some activities which are not, but that is really part of the listing. At one time, Dubai was the biggest listing venue in terms of sukuk. This is an evolving situation, and the potential is there again in the sense that we have a number of Islamic banks and financial institutions with their own sharia boards, and we are in a much better position in terms of being more central in the Islamic world. Malaysia, in terms of food production, is on top, but it is at the other end of the Islamic world. We are at the heart, and Dubai is very strong in logistics and exports.</p><h4>How do you ensure that your products are sharia compliant?</h4><p>Today, every bank or financial institution that provides sharia-compliant services such as direct financing, murabaha, or that is managing sukuk issues has its own sharia board that takes the responsibility to ensure that its products and services are in line with the sharia. The absence of a unified set of rules and standards for judging the sharia compliance of a service creates room for disagreement and differences between different institutions' practices in this regard. In Dubai, we feel it is very important at this stage to look at having one board that would standardize not only sukuk activity, but all other activities as well. We already have an equity standard, and will soon officially launch a sukuk standard. It is very important to have one regulatory body that will standardize not only sukuk, but all other Islamic products. That is the minimum requirement for the issuance of a sukuk. When you adopt an initiative and part of that initiative is to create this kind of regulatory infrastructure, it is important to do so.</p><div class="quote">“We feel it is very important at this stage to look at having one board that would standardize not only sukuk activity, but all other activities as well."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)?<br></h4><p>We are a development institution, similar to the World Bank, and cover many sectors. We finance projects in energy, transportation, agriculture, education, and much more. We started in 1976, and in 2013 we will celebrate our 37th anniversary. We work all over the world in developing countries from Honduras to Tajikistan. OFID covers more than 130 countries and realizes many capacity-building projects for young people. Over the last four years, energy has become one of our priorities here.</p><h4>How do you see sustainable energy moving forward?</h4><p>We keep hearing the motto “Finding Solutions," but when I spoke at a recent conference in Vienna, I wanted to change the motto from “Finding Solutions" to “Funding Solutions," because this is exactly what we are doing to innovate. We are currently running the Energy for the Poor program, which has reached three main milestones. The first was in November 2007, when our heads of state gathered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, hosted by King Abdullah, and called for the first time in our era for the eradication of energy poverty. This was not an original part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which is why our heads of state were keen to include it as the ninth goal. The second milestone came in 2008 when King Abdullah launched the Energy for the Poor scheme, and called on us to consider pledging. In June 2012, our ministerial council gathered in Austria and issued a declaration pledging a minimum of $1 billion, which is scalable, and can be increased if warranted by demand. At first, 20% of our commitment was to energy. Now we have increased this to 28% for the next two years. In 2012, we completed 25 projects, seven of which were renewable. Just because we are oil-exporting countries does not mean we are biased toward fossil fuels.</p><h4>Are there plans to increase the number of renewable energy projects at OFID?</h4><p>For OFID, the eradication of energy poverty is the first and overriding priority. With due respect, let's not mix priorities. Many people are concerned about renewables, and I respect that. But at OFID, our main goal is the elimination of energy poverty. When I travel to developing countries, the message I hear is always the same—“we need energy, and we need it now." People living in energy poverty are not interested in waiting until certain technologies become feasible. Their children need light to do homework by, families need fuel to cook, and preserve food and medicines. Meeting these most basic of needs is our chief concern. Honestly, the fuel mix doesn't enter into the equation. Our approach is always to find the best solution for a given situation. In terms of renewables, we have provided a cumulative $700 million in financing for such projects. Around $225 million of this has been delivered over the past five years alone, as we have ramped up efforts to address the urgency. We are currently working with a number of organizations that are implementing innovative solutions on the ground. Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda are three countries that spring to mind.</p><div class="quote">“In terms of renewables, we have provided a cumulative $700 million in financing for such projects."</div><h4>How does the GCC fit into developing green energy in underprivileged countries?</h4><p>We are doing everything we can. Of course, oil is the mainstay of the economy, but the region is also investing in renewables. It has established institutions for solar, nuclear, and wind energy, and is working to place the right people into jobs, including graduates from Harvard, MIT, and the like. We're on the right track. The issue is that this discussion is continuously misguided by commentators politicizing the energy mix and insinuating that oil is dirty. It depends on your perspective. At OFID, we look at the problem as experienced by people in poorer countries, where often the main source of energy comes from wood and animal waste. Burning these products is a serious health hazard and has many other disadvantages as well. So, for such communities, anything superior to these sources is preferable and would certainly be considered as “clean." After all, it's all relative. In fact, I would say that what we have in these cases goes far beyond social and economic considerations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy (DSCE)?<br></h4><p>The DSCE was formed under Law 19 of 2009, issued by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. The Dubai Supreme Council of Energy is chaired by His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, and HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer is Vice-Chairman. It was established as a governing body tasked with governance, policy development, and setting strategic direction for the energy sector to deliver several objectives, including the security of energy supply to sustain Dubai's growth, the diversification of fuel sources, the streamlining of functions in the energy sector in order to bolster efficiency and synergy, support for the green economy and sustainable development, and the development of a regulatory framework required to drive implementation and attract private investment in clean energy projects. We have developed a balanced approach to achieving these targets through the deployment of the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 to deliver specific initiatives and projects. A roadmap has been defined, reflecting the priorities of energy supply and demand abatement measures. Today, we feel that a robust platform championed by the DSCE  entities, including DEWA, DUBAL, ENOC, Dubai Petroleum Establishment, DUSUP, the Department of Petroleum Affairs, Dubai Municipality, and Dubai Nuclear Energy Committee, has been established to develop several strategic measures and projects in Dubai where energy efficiency, demand abatement, and sustainability are high on our agenda. These elements are vital to sustaining Dubai's competiveness and growth.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges?</h4><p>I am a strong believer in how challenges can generate opportunities if we tackle them rationally and analyze the influencing factors. This is particularly proven when we look back at Dubai's exceptional development over the past 10 years. Dubai has always set the bar high when it comes to creativity in new ventures and projects, and has managed to deliver on its dynamic planning and development. The fundamental elements are planning and deployment mechanisms, which we have defined well in our roadmap and, as a matter of fact, we have already seen a positive impact in the early phases.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for foreign companies to invest in this sector?</h4><p>One of the key strategic mechanisms defined in our strategy is the funding mechanism for the projects and measures planned for the period leading up to 2030. We have planned some of our new projects to be funded through public-private partnership (PPP) and have developed a regulatory framework to attract international investment to Dubai. For example, the next phase of the solar project will be based on the PPP model for financing additional solar capacity at Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Solar Park. We have seen great interest from the technology and financing firms to partner with us on the execution of the planned projects, and shall continue to facilitate this mode of engagement. The Dubai Global Energy Forum (DGEF) 2013, held last April, was well attended by investment and technology firms, and we promoted Dubai's position on partnership to create a hub here for clean energy technologies and services.</p><h4>How is the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 structured?</h4><p>The Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 is based around four strategic themes. There are objectives, which work like mechanisms on how to achieve each pillar. There is one of governance and policy in order to govern the energy sector in Dubai, which is the ultimate objective of the DSCE. We are also looking at energy efficiency and demand-side reduction, as well as energy security and the cost of that energy. Being a net importer is risky and may come at a very high cost, especially when you talk about gas accounting for 99% of power generation today in Dubai. The cost of energy is very important and so is bringing in the financial mechanism that will actually encourage investment from international companies and technology providers. At the same time, we are looking to build national capacity. Dubai can do this in a number of ways. Building capacity means that we want to develop the knowledge here in Dubai, with renewables being an area that is only recently penetrating the market. It is also about how we can pick the right technology that works in our climate and conditions. We want to become a free zone where companies can develop and manufacture so we can promote the economic advantages of solar and other technologies. It is ambitious, but we have the elements to achieve this mission.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENOC announced plans in 2012 to increase its capacity and, among other projects, construct a 60-kilometer fuel pipeline from the Jebel Ali Free Zone to Dubai International Airport. What are the drivers behind this growth?<br></h4><p>The aviation sector is one of the core growth drivers of the Dubai economy. Today, Dubai International Airport is the world's second busiest, while the aviation sector at large contributes to over 28% of the Emirate's GDP, in addition to supporting over 250,000 jobs. ENOC has been a leading provider of jet fuel oil to several leading airline companies. Today, with Dubai's strong reputation as a global hub in the aviation industry, and demand for jet fuel increasing to meet the vast network of carriers linking the city to several international destinations, it is imperative that we further support the sector through our investment in the new oil terminal at the Jebel Ali Free Zone. With a storage capacity of over 141,000 cubic meters, the terminal has a 60-kilometer jet fuel pipeline linked directly to Dubai International Airport. In addition to directly supporting the aviation sector, the new facility will also complement Dubai's strategic plan, which aims to welcome over 20 million visitors by 2020.</p><h4>The Supreme Council of Energy is focused on securing the future of Dubai's energy sector by adopting the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030. What recent reforms has the government put in place to promote sustainable growth?</h4><p>ENOC has been at the forefront in driving the sustainable development agenda of Dubai, in line with the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy, and the vision for a green economy of sustainable development announced by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. At ENOC, we are committed to supporting the strategy by focusing on the manufacturing and distribution of cleaner and greener fuels, which will not only reduce the dependence on traditional fuel resources, but also contribute to a healthy and sustainable environment.</p><h4>What new initiatives at ENOC are you most excited about?</h4><p>Personally, I am excited about all the strategic growth initiatives that are currently being rolled out by ENOC. I strongly believe that it is important to take a personal interest, and be passionate about the organization. In addition to ongoing work on the new terminals, I am also looking forward to the completion of the CNG project, which will further highlight our thought leadership in environmental sustainability. I am also focused on various human capital development initiatives that are being undertaken by ENOC, including the thrust toward Emiratization. Over the years, ENOC has consistently focused on creating new jobs for Emiratis, as well as building the talent of our young professionals through our comprehensive National Development Programme. ENOC's diversified businesses offer talented Emiratis a solid platform for personal and professional growth. Developing the skills of our nationals plays a key role in further supporting the UAE toward achieving its Vision 2021 goal of being among the best nations in the world.</p><h4>What opportunities could entering markets such as East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa bring to ENOC?</h4><p>The Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia have several fast-growing markets that serve as a perfect fit for ENOC's growth strategy. We see opportunities across all our business segments, from setting up terminals in countries such as Djibouti and Morocco, to trading in oil, and the marketing of products such as lubricants and jet fuel. We also see tremendous opportunities in expanding our marketing business and taking our highly successful ZOOM retail chain to such growing markets. In fact, we have already signed a joint venture agreement with Aldrees Petroleum &amp; Transport Services Company (Aldrees), one of Saudi Arabia's largest petroleum retailers and commodity hauling companies, to set up service stations in different locations across the Kingdom.</p><h4>How is the focus on sustainability set to boost the energy industry?</h4><p>There are two key aspects to promoting sustainability in the energy sector. One is that it encourages the industry to be more focused on strengthening operational efficiencies, thus conserving precious natural resources. Secondly, it encourages innovation and motivates the industry to consider alternative, renewable sources, thus bringing about a more diversified energy mix.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Describe the overall activities of the Crescent Group and its various subsidiaries?<br></h4><p>Crescent Group, established 42 years ago out of Sharjah, is one of the most progressive business groups in the region, operating through more than 25 companies and subsidiaries across the energy and non-energy sectors. To promote world-class corporate governance processes and to generate synergies between our companies, we have instituted two specific verticals: energy and non-energy. Within our non-energy portfolio, our holdings are all formally amalgamated under the Crescent Enterprises umbrella, which operates in eight diverse business sectors: ports and logistics, healthcare, aviation, power and engineering, private equity, technology, and media and entertainment. Crescent Enterprises looks to build profitable, sector-leading companies, which are also responsible citizens throughout the region and the wider world. Within the energy portfolio, our flagship entity is Crescent Petroleum, the region's first and largest independent, privately owned upstream oil and gas company. Other companies in the energy portfolio include our 20% shareholding in Dana Gas, 40% shareholding in Pearl Petroleum, which is a regional partnership with Dana Gas, OMV of Austria, and MOL of Hungary, which is used for gas resource and infrastructure development in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, and a 50% stake in Gas Cities, which is working on the creation of a gas-based industrial hub partnership with Saudi Arabian Construction Products Company International, a subsidiary of the BinLadin Group.</p><h4>What is the relationship between Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas, and will the sukuk restructuring at Dana Gas affect Crescent Petroleum?</h4><p>Crescent Petroleum was a key founder of Dana Gas in 2005 along with other core founders when it was launched as a new public company on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange. The company is independently run with a prominent board of directors and capable management. It is the only publicly listed private sector natural gas company in the Gulf region today, and it has active operating interests in the UAE, Egypt, and Iraq. Crescent holds approximately 20% of the shares of Dana Gas and is, therefore, its largest single shareholder. As with any significant shareholder in any company, we are well represented on the board of the company and always strive to maintain a very constructive relationship. It is important to emphasize, though, that we operate fully independently of one another. Of the many projects that Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas are pursuing, only two projects are being executed in partnership, and that is our large project in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and our downstream joint venture Gas Cities.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the UAE's oil and gas industry?</h4><p>The GCC states currently produce about 16.3 million barrels of oil per day, with the UAE accounting for about 2.7 million barrels per day alone, about 18% of global oil demand. These countries account for 30% of global proven oil reserves, the UAE on its own accounts for about 6%, so they have the potential to produce much more. However, with liquids production rising from nothing to around 2 million barrels per day in only a few years as a result of tight oil in North America, and with the potential for further output increases elsewhere in countries such as Brazil, the ability of the Gulf region to increase its output without putting downward pressure on prices is likely to be constrained for some time to come. As for gas production, it is a well-known fact that our region does not produce as much as it needs to ensure a fully efficient domestic energy economy, with gas production limits restricting power output or leading to the burning of oil to meet peak power demand. To put things into perspective, the region holds over 45% of the world's remaining gas reserves, but produces less than 14% of world production. Therefore, the region's gas resources, like its oil resources, are abundant with current proven gas reserves able to maintain current production levels for over 120 years. For the region to realize its full gas output potential, there needs to be a realignment of economic incentives to ensure that subsidies do not make it uneconomic to explore for and develop new gas resources.</p><div class="quote">“The GCC states currently produce about 16.3 million barrels of oil per day, with the UAE accounting for about 2.7 million barrels per day."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-return-of-risk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Barclays' growth prospects in MENA?<br></h4><p>I am cautiously optimistic, specifically about the investment banking sector in the Middle East region. We saw the trough in 2011, and the investment banking wallet in 2012 was definitely higher than it was in 2011. We experienced a good start to 2013, which makes me cautiously optimistic that we will extend our growth period following the 2011 low. I am slightly more bullish about the growth of profit pools for private banking in the region. There is new wealth being created at all levels of the population and the economy. In the Middle East, a large segment of the population qualifies for the affluent or private banking proposition, which translates into several market opportunities for our Wealth and Investment Management. Furthermore, I am more optimistic about our Corporate Banking business given the continuing trend of GCC governments investing within their own economies with the objective of diversifying into non-hydrocarbon related sectors.</p><h4>Do you think an appetite for high-risk investment has returned to Dubai?</h4><p>I would not say that a high-risk investment appetite has returned. Although this is a great commercial climate—the economy is growing, people are doing business, and investments are taking place—I would not characterize it as the same high-risk environment that we experienced prior to 2008, when people would throw all caution to the wind. I believe we are back in an environment where it is important to be invested. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, investors were very risk-averse, which led the majority of them to sit on the sidelines, mainly in cash. However, the risk appetite is gradually returning. This does not mean that investors are being more aggressive; it means that they are assessing their risk and return objectives and aligning them to their financial constraints, while taking into account their financial personality. As a result, we are witnessing a growing trend in balanced and healthy portfolios.</p><h4>Would you advise people to invest in MENA capital markets right now?</h4><p>The MENA region, particularly the GCC, still offers some attractive investment opportunities. As some large global institutions may be reluctant to invest in the region due to their perception toward equity market size and depth, as well high geo-political risk, the MENA region represents a good geographic diversification to global investments, complementing positions in emerging markets. The MENA region also has an active market for bonds issued by corporates, sovereigns, government-related enterprises, and banks, where there is decent value that provides institutions with the ability to take good positions while also benefiting from strong credit fundamentals.</p><h4>How important are emerging markets to Barclays?</h4><p>Emerging markets are very important to our clients globally; that means emerging markets are also important to us. Considering trade and investment flows today, we see large movements from the Arabian Peninsula northward through Turkey to the former Soviet Union, westward to North Africa, south into Africa, and east into the Indian Subcontinent and beyond. The Arabian Peninsula sits on the crossroads of five of the world's eight largest trade corridors and, hence, is at the center of a significant proportion of global trade and investment flows, especially those taking place among emerging markets. Furthermore, the world's major sovereign wealth funds are clustered in the Arabian Peninsula and Asia. This region is vital to multinational clients, especially to corporations in the US, which still has the world's largest investment banking wallet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TECOM's portfolio comprises 10 business parks under five industry clusters across the ICT, media, manufacturing, education, and sciences sectors. What kind of changes have they seen over the past several years?<br></h4><p>TECOM was founded in 2000. Initially, it was designed to attract foreign technology and media companies into the Emirate. Our role has ultimately been in helping Dubai to develop a more diversified, knowledge-based economy. TECOM's 10 business parks now play host to over 4,500 companies and 70,000 knowledge workers across the ICT, media, education, sciences, and manufacturing sectors. We play host to a wide variety of firms, from SMEs to Fortune 500 companies and multinationals. Industry giants such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Oracle, Thomson Reuters, and MBC are just a few examples of the global businesses choosing to base their regional operations in one of TECOM's business parks. According to a recent World Bank report on the knowledge economy, the UAE has the highest employment growth rate in the MENA region. We have seen employment reach 3.5 million in 2009 from 1.7 million in 2000—the year that TECOM's first free zone business park, Dubai Internet City, was established. This shows a significant rate of growth, and we work hard toward sustaining a comparable trajectory, market conditions allowing. Real, thriving, and substantial business is going on within TECOM's clusters, underpinning Dubai's drive to become a knowledge economy.</p><h4>Why is it important for Dubai to develop a diversified economy as per HH Sheikh Mohammed's Vision? How does TECOM fit into this vision?</h4><p>Dubai recognized early on that it had far less natural resources relative to those of its neighbors. We needed to forge another way forward. The free zones are the result of a determined effort to diversify and develop a leading knowledge-based economy underpinned by a larger private sector. This approach has been very successful, and now contributes approximately 30% to Dubai's GDP. TECOM Investments is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai Holding. Due to the nature of our ownership by Dubai Holding, we are acutely aware of the ambitions and future vision for Dubai. TECOM is keenly focused on its responsibility to help develop and diversify Dubai's economy, create jobs, and provide sustainable, realistic growth along the way.</p><h4>How will the leadership's vision to further develop the sector, in combination with the World Expo 2020 bid, impact Dubai's business environment and TECOM's future?</h4><p>Dubai's ongoing investment in infrastructure is certainly of benefit to TECOM. By locating within one of TECOM's business parks, companies do not just enjoy the benefits of being part of a dedicated and thriving industry cluster with all the infrastructure that goes with that, but they also have excellent connectivity to the rest of the world by both air and sea. Dubai International Airport is one of the world's great airports, and there is another under development; a leading global airline in Emirates Airline; and two deep-water seaports, Mina Rashid and Jebel Ali. Should Dubai be blessed with World Expo 2020, then we would see further investment in infrastructure, which in turn would boost commerce and tourism numbers, and underpin economic confidence. This will of course benefit TECOM Investments as well. As a Group, our vision is directly in line with Dubai Expo 2020's strategic theme; "Connecting Minds, Creating the Future." We strongly believe that connections between people, societies and ideas are crucial for invention. In a world of long-distance communication, Dubai Expo 2020 is the perfect forum for innovators across the world to come together and create.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of growth and major milestones were achieved in 2012?<br></h4><p>I believe that 2012 has been a year of consolidation for Ericsson, and that is valid for the Middle East as well. We have completed exactly what we set out to do, namely incremental improvements in all areas, be it net sales, margins, or orders booked. It was a year that saw the true convergence of telecommunications and media as new distribution models emerged. This was, at least in part, responsible for driving demand for Long-Term Evolution (LTE) contacts. We felt the effects of the political instability and the general volatility in the region, as did the rest of the region, but considering the countries I'm responsible for, we have managed to handle all adversity, and consolidated to see further growth in several areas in 2012.</p><h4>What does Ericsson's relationship with du mean for the company?</h4><p>du is one of our key customers, together with a number of other mobile operators and service providers in the UAE. We have a long-standing partnership with du, which allows us to supplement the company's aggressive growth strategy and its continuous focus on improving its capabilities in service delivery, and enhancing the customer experience. We do the billing with our business support system in addition to other projects, and we have interesting discussions with du on a handful of new areas.</p><h4>Does Ericsson maintain its aggressive plans to greatly boost sales in the Middle East by 2015?</h4><p>We do indeed have ambitions to maintain our strong position in the Middle East and continue our growth. I can say that the market is progressing very much in line with the trends seen globally and regionally. We observe a continued push for mobile data, and a focus on reducing operating costs, as well as improved performance and customer experience from many of our partners in the market.</p><h4>What makes the local market unique compared to other countries in the GCC?</h4><p>GCC countries have very high GDP growth and are some of the richest in the world. They also have fairly small populations, which means that international expansion is on the horizon. Considering the UAE, the authorities have been impressive and intelligent in terms of investing in infrastructure. This could mean roads, but also telecommunications, or the tallest buildings in the world. And as such, we observe the government investing in the country for the benefit of its residents and local people, which is not observable everywhere in the world.</p><h4>As the leading woman at a major multinational company, what have your experiences been?</h4><p>To generalize, I believe that I may have had a slight advantage as a woman, due to the visibility you get. I have had the fortunate experience of working with great line managers throughout my history with Ericsson. These people generally believed in finding the right person regardless of culture, gender, or race. To have at least one woman has also been a smart business move in many parts of the company, as diversity adds value to discussions and decisions. Despite the fact that I was often given the smallest, most insignificant role at each company, I have consistently performed above and beyond expectations, being promoted to the next level time after time.</p><h4>What are your company targets, and how would you like to achieve them in the future?</h4><p>Overall, the telecoms industry in the region has been moving at a rapid pace. Telecoms providers have been consistently providing new services and products, and increasingly becoming consumer-centric. In this rapidly changing industry, we believe that telecoms operators will continue to adopt new technologies and solutions as the demands and requirements of consumers also continue to rise. As a company, our ultimate vision is to create a networked society. Our goal has always been to leverage global presence and scale, as well as technology and services leadership, in order for Ericsson to remain the prime driver in the telecom industry. We are committed to ensuring that our customers' telecommunications technology and service needs are met, and that we are well equipped to face the industry's challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key points behind the operational philosophy of Dubai Customs?</h4><p>Dubai Customs is an important part of Dubai's economy. We don't act like a police body; we act as facilitators and provide services. The most important part of what we do is protection. We are the first protective barrier on entry to Dubai. We protect the people living here from drugs and dangerous weapons. We are also protecting trademark holders from counterfeit goods. Today, when counterfeit brands come into the country, the economy as a whole loses. These actions can imply a huge cost, meaning we are protecting traders. We are protecting the people from bad food or low-quality medicine entering the country. We at customs are not just collectors; we protect the people.</p><h4>To what extent does Dubai Customs benefit the economy?</h4><p>The money that we collect does not go into the government's pockets; it goes toward infrastructure, including buildings, bridges, schools, and hospitals.</p><h4>How has Dubai Customs developed over time?</h4><p>We are developing our systems and our work continuously. We are 100% online. Customers can finish all their documentation online before they come. Then, when they arrive, they can walk straight through. The government department is secure, private business is very quiet, the business environment can be seen, and people are not walking back and forth. It is a positive environment because everything is online and people can communicate effectively. We facilitate all the traders and make life easy for them to clear their goods, get their work done, and protect their business.</p><div class="quote">“We are the first protective barrier on entry to Dubai."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will Dubai SME help nationals increase their presence in Dubai's workforce?<br></h4><p>Dubai SME's primary role is to encourage and enable Emiratis to start a business and be owners of businesses as an alternative to seeking employment in the public sector. Over the last 10 years, we have seen more Emiratis setting up businesses that, in many instances, have thrived. In 2013, with the establishment of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Fund (MBRF) at Dubai SME, we will devise schemes to encourage more locals to start their businesses with financial support. As with our current funding approach, Dubai SME will continue to enhance ways to enable the Emirati entrepreneur to be effective and skillful in setting up a business. Other major initiatives to enhance the Emiratization of business will focus on capability development. Our entrepreneurship diploma is very popular with the Emiratis who are committed to attend and learn the fundamentals of setting up and running a business.</p><h4>How important are SMEs to the economy?</h4><p>The Dubai SME sector, like in most other economies, is extremely important. It contributes 40% of Dubai's annual GDP and accounts for 42% of the Emirate's workforce. Dubai's diversified economy is based largely on SMEs, which serve many parts of the industry value chain. Dubai's SMEs have also been the bedrock of stability in times of crisis, and are a source of entrepreneurship, innovation, and new business model creations. The real economy grows when the SME sector grows. In 2012, the Department of Economic Development in Dubai issued 16,688 business licenses, up 16% from the previous year, while license renewals increased 3% to reach 101,766. Given the business categorization in Dubai, the increase in license transactions clearly points to rising SME activity and the continued sustenance and stability of the local SME market.</p><h4>What new developments will be happening at Dubai SME in 2013?</h4><p>There are several big initiatives in the process of being launched in 2013, including breakthrough changes in some of our existing initiatives. First, we are about to launch our very own fund—the MBRF—to support more Emiratis to start and launch their businesses. It will cover three components, depending on the stage and need of the entrepreneur. For early stage ideation, we will provide seed grants to transform ideas into testable and executable businesses. The grants will cover such allowable costs as market feasibility studies, purchase of equipment, and engaging consultants for feasibility studies. Another component of the fund is the loan-guarantee scheme. A couple of partner banks will provide the credit due diligence based on our feasibility studies. The banks will also be incentivized to support local SMEs through a fund that will be leveraged by the bank to support more SMEs. A final component we are planning is equity, in which the MBRF takes a stake in selected start-ups and/or high-potential SMEs, founded on a development objective that is based on a fair return for a future sell-off to investors. Another major initiative is the second cycle of the SME100 ranking initiative. Our success in the first ranking and the post-ranking work has yielded very positive pay offs. To date, we have reached record levels of more than 3 million SMEs being nominated and more than 300 SMEs applying with full submission of three-year audited financials. The ranking will be announced in October or November 2013. We are delighted and honored that HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai's Executive Council, is the Patron of the Dubai SME100.</p><p>Thirdly, we are expanding the Young Entrepreneur Competition (YEC) competition, currently in its ninth year, to reach out and educate our next generation of entrepreneurs who are now in schools.</p>]]></richbody0content>

It was the largest exhibition for Gulf Food ever in Dubai. There were over 4,000 exhibitors, and between 35,000 and 40,000 business visitors attended. The entrance price was AED250, which was expensive, but there were still many people. It means there is a large demand for such exhibitions. The food sector itself is in our top 10 in terms of the target list for Dubai Export Development Corporation (DEDC), and it represents between 10% and 14% of all manufacturing in Dubai. The Emirate is becoming a worldwide hub for exporters of food, fruit, vegetables, and processed food, among others. We are increasing our production, and we are also becoming a trading hub between West and East.</p><h4>DEDC facilitated AED5 billion worth of trade in 2012 compared to AED3 billion in 2011. What were the drivers behind this huge growth?</h4><p>We believe that the support and assistance we provided to firms has made a substantial difference. We are one of the major factors in this increase. We believe our matchmaking, business-to-business meetings, exhibitions, and conferences helped with this increase. Prior to the establishment of DEDC, it was not organized as such. The figure in 2007 was AED27.7 billion in exports. In 2011, it reached AED98 billion, and we think it will be around AED128 billion in 2012. From AED27 billion to AED128 billion is phenomenal growth. The number one exporter or manufacturer in the world is the US. When it wanted to overcome the crisis, President Obama's first action was to double exports in five years. His target was to double exports in five years; however, we quintupled them in five.</p><h4>Why did DEDC push for enhanced exports and relations between the UAE and Southern Africa?</h4><p>We are an adaptive organization, and we have a flexible strategy. Every year we revise our action, business, and strategic plans. We change our strategy according to what is happening in the area and the world, and we try to utilize those targets. For example, since we started, we noticed that business and trade in Dubai is strong. It is not one of the strongest parts of our economy, but, in the last 60 years, Dubai has become a hub for trade in the area. It is mostly regional, meaning between India, the Middle East, North Africa, and the Arab countries, with a little bit into the EU, North and South America, and Asia. That is why our strategy in 2012 and 2013 was to open Africa, especially East Africa and Southern Africa. We visited Tanzania and its growth was around 5%-8%, which is very large for the whole country. We are also looking at trading over the entire continent, even Western Africa, because of the connectivity and the ports. We are managing a port in Senegal and Emirates Airline has flights to Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria. That helps the businesses to have more contact with other businesses. The second area we added was Central Asia, especially Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. We also visited Kazakhstan in 2012, and we are planning to expand our visit to other countries neighboring Kazakhstan in 2013.</p><div class="quote">“The food sector itself is in our top 10 in terms of the target list for Dubai Exports, and it represents between 10% and 14% of all manufacturing in Dubai."</div><h4>What does the UAE do to compete with countries like Turkey?</h4><p>The relationship with Turkey is very old and good; there is no competition there. We can provide things that Turkey can't, and vice versa. Besides products, we have the service sector. We have many projects in engineering, finance, IT, e-government, and especially in Islamic finance. For example, the first Islamic bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, was set up in the UAE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the most significant achievements led by the Department of Finance in support of the Dubai Strategic Plan 2015 and the UAE Vision 2021?<br></h4><p>The role of the Department of Finance is to work closely with all government departments, and to support their initiatives and strategic directions, which are all aligned with the Dubai Strategy. During the past four years, we have been able to support all government departments and have followed a fiscal expansionary policy—we did not try to stop any projects in pursuit of savings.  This is in line with the direction of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and the Ruler of Dubai, which is why most of the major projects that were underway were completed. Now, going forward, we are supporting the main infrastructure projects, which continue to expand.</p><h4>How has this lent credibility to Dubai as a global business hub?</h4><p>For 30 years, Dubai has been building itself up to be a regional hub by developing, on the one hand, the infrastructure of the city, but at the same time the soft infrastructure. This includes the city's regulations, which have made Dubai a point of interest in the region. The decision was taken by the government to finish ongoing projects, including the metro project and the port expansion. Today, we can see that with recovery in the region and the wider world, Dubai is benefiting from investments made during the financial crisis.</p><h4>One of the issues that rose out of the financial crisis was regulation of the private sector. What initiatives has the Department of Finance undertaken to help regulate the sector?</h4><p>We have tried to avoid interfering in the private sector, as this is a free economy. However, where there are regulations, either local or federal, they effectively ensure that processes are legalized and protection is in place for the stakeholders, investors, and contractors. For example, during the restructuring we had to set up a tribunal at the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) in order to protect all parties, while simplifying the process in accordance with international criteria. This avoided the need of going through the Dubai courts, as certain international investors prefer to deal with the DIFC. Providing them that option has really made a difference in the successful structuring of Dubai's legal system.</p><div class="quote">“The deficit has been declining over the past four or five years... we are hoping to issue the 2014 budget without a deficit."</div><h4>How is the government involved in encouraging Dubai to become a hub for Islamic banking?</h4><p>Dubai has been developing financial services by setting up the DIFC and has become a regional center for financial services. In addition, there are other non-financial services that are also turning Dubai into a hub. Developing Islamic financial services, or Islamic services in general, is a complement to what Dubai has already been doing. For example, if we look at Dubai's financial services, sukuks have become one of the main products, and the Dubai government has been issuing them for many years. Most of the listed sukuks on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) are from the Dubai government, and it is now a matter of leveraging this and building on existing knowledge by developing expertise for new services, such as in finance, insurance, or Islamic insurance, as well as in the certification of halal products. We feel that this initiative for Islamic services will complement what Dubai has been doing as a service-based economy.</p><h4>The DFM was recently listed as one of the world's strongest exchanges, with Abu Dhabi a close second. How have the capital markets in Dubai matured in recent years?</h4><p>Following a crisis, I think it is the natural tendency of investors to stay away from a market, perhaps for liquidity reasons. However, since the start of the economic recovery, investors have started to re-enter the market, and we have been seeing a brisk recovery since the beginning of 2013—trading has reached record numbers in terms of prices and volume.</p><h4>The Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange has been performing extremely well, too. What are the benefits of having two separate exchanges within the UAE?</h4><p>I don't see why we would not have two exchanges. Dubai itself, as a trade center, will perhaps serve a different population from among the UAE and overseas investors than Abu Dhabi. And it is not only countries that have different equity exchanges; many cities have more than one exchange and are successful. For example, New York and London also have commodity and other large exchanges; similarly, there is room enough for all of them to survive. In the end, if both of the exchanges are profitable, they are both commercially useful.</p><h4>The government will deliver a budget deficit in 2013. How important is a surplus to the economy of Dubai?</h4><p>The surplus will make a difference; it will enhance the economy and give the government the ability to meet its commitments, or reduce its debts, and this is what is in our plans. The deficit has been declining over the past four or five years. And while it is difficult to predict, we are hoping to issue the 2014 budget without a deficit.</p><h4>What do you think will contribute most to growth?</h4><p>The sectors in demand in the UAE are the aviation sector, which is doing very well, and the tourism sector. We have been seeing very good numbers in terms of tourist arrivals and hotel occupancy lately, and even the real estate sector is booming now. The events observed in the Arab Spring countries are driving people to Dubai because it is safer and more economically sound. We enjoy good growth in these areas.</p><h4>What has the Arab Spring done to highlight stability here further?</h4><p>The UAE has been a stable destination for the past 30 to 40 years, a period that has encompassed the Iranian revolution, the Iran-Iraq war, and the Iraq invasion, aside from the Arab Spring. Dubai's popularity is mainly to do with the regulations, the rigid infrastructure, and its security. Dubai has attracted many foreigners to stay, for whom it is their preferred place of work within the GCC.</p><h4>Do you think that in years to come people will look at it as the “Dubai model?"</h4><p>Yes, I think they are already looking at Dubai that way. Dubai's success in introducing a unique developmental model has gained remarkable international recognition. During crises, people turn their attention to those that have a successful track record. The 2009 crisis has brought Dubai's developmental model with all its successes into a tough test, and the recovery we have seen over the last two years shows the resilience of our growth model.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Emirates NBD was listed in October 2007 on the Dubai Financial Market as a result of a merger between Emirates Bank International and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD). What strengths did the bank achieve by combining the second and fourth largest banks in the UAE?<br></h4><p>Through the merger, we became the largest bank in the UAE and one of the leading banks in the Middle East. We have achieved a great synergy between the two banks and this has added to the economy of Dubai, and the UAE as a whole. The rationale behind the merger was to create a large and strong bank that is capable of expanding both regionally and internationally. One of the focal points that needed to be highlighted was that the NBD was the first bank in the UAE. It began its operations in 1963, prior to the creation of the UAE Union in 1971. The bank has a long heritage, deeply rooted in the culture of the UAE, and this has allowed it to play a vital role in shaping Dubai. There are several companies that have made a difference in the city, and the bank supported many of the start-up projects from 1963 to the 1980s.</p><p>The success of the bank is irrelevant compared to the success of the city. Without Dubai, the bank would not be as big as it is; therefore, we are linked. The success of Dubai, having the right business base and being a multinational economy, has supported the financial sector and guaranteed the success of the city's economy. Dubai's trade is international. A large majority of the imported goods to this country are coming in a transit capacity. Similarly, Dubai Airport is now the second biggest in the world, and has surpassed other prominent and leading airports around the globe. Dubai has created the right circumstances to become the international hub that it is, and this is reflected in the success of its financial institutions and our bank.</p><p>Dubai has a unique character and a different flavor to other GCC countries. It is a genuinely multicultural place, but the locals still manage to keep their own traditions. As a modern and established city, Dubai has an excellent and unsurpassable infrastructure, allowing families to live comfortably and to prosper. Dubai's welcoming environment invites talent and business from around the world as well as a large number of tourists who visit the UAE for leisure purposes. Ultimately, it is the result of the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, as his vision for the city is what has brought about this success. His Highness is the strong driving force that is leading Dubai in the right direction.</p><div class="quote">“Emirates NBD actively participates, supports, and in many cases leads these sukuk projects."</div><h4>Which products do customers demand the most from the bank?</h4><p>Any customer that needs financial services looks for a full range of banking services. All customer needs, starting from opening an account to obtaining finance for cars, mortgages, credit cards, and travel, among many others, must be fulfilled from our side. The services must be accessible too, and Emirates NBD has excelled in terms of technology and the offering of technology platforms to its customers. Today, Emirates NBD has a physical side as well as a virtual offering, and we have focused on user-friendly services by developing applications for all platforms, namely the iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android. For our consumers, Emirates NBD offers a host of products and services as well as banking packages and investment opportunities that provide exceptional privileges for our Priority Banking and Private Banking customers. At the same time, we are a very sophisticated bank in terms of our corporate services making Emirates NBD a major player in the corporate banking arena.</p><h4>You won the “eBanking 2013 Excellence Award" for best mobile banking application. What is the customer profile of Emirates NBD?</h4><p>We cater to a wide range of profiles, and from a broader perspective, we are catering to every person in this country. Today, we are looking at being a fully fledged bank, and we look to every customer and do our utmost to address their specific needs. If we categorize our customers into age brackets, education level, and through other demographic statistics, we have profiles for these customers. For example, for the eldest category, these customers would not typically use technology, so for those customers we have our branches and staff that help them with everything they need. When it comes to our younger customers, we provide them with mobile banking services through enhanced platforms that allow them to easily and safely access their accounts and carry out transactions even when they are on the go. On the corporate front, we have platforms for SMEs as well as large local and international corporations and financial institutions.</p><h4>You are present not only in the UAE and GCC region, but also in China, Singapore, the UK, and Egypt, amongst others. What opportunities does Emirates NBD foresee in these markets?</h4><p>The opportunities depend on the country. Take Saudi Arabia for example. There are many financial institutions there, and it is a very large market. We are one of the financial institutions proud to have a presence in the country. It is a GCC nation with a huge economic base, and as a bank we have developed an excellent reputation in the market there. Emirates NBD has been there since 2003, and the bank is doing a successful business. The Saudi market is very sophisticated, and in fact we are learning a lot from this market. We do not see Saudi Arabia as being a different country, but rather a natural extension of our own market and economy. When we set up abroad, we do so with the intent of supporting our customers' expansion plans in new markets. Dubai, and the UAE, is a regional hub, so many of our customers already have established businesses in their country of origin. Unfortunately, we are not always able to set up in another country as most of them have restrictions on financial institution licenses. This idea of growing with our customers is part of our broader attempt to offer a complete range of services.</p><h4>HH Sheikh Mohammed envisions Dubai as a global center for the sukuk market and Islamic finance. Do you see any opportunities within this sector for Emirates NBD?</h4><p>Emirates NBD actively participates, supports, and in many cases leads these sukuk projects. We are certainly supporting His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai's vision to establish Dubai as a center for Islamic banking. Emirates NBD provides its clients a variety of Islamic banking offerings through its subsidiary, Emirates Islamic Bank, which has almost 70 branches across the UAE. We also have an Islamic banking window within Emirates NBD called Al Watani Al Islami, which offers sharia-compliant banking.</p><h4>Which products and services do you find your customers demand the most from your bank?</h4><p>Emirates NBD is a bank that caters to a variety of customer segments. After the merger, Emirates NBD has been able to provide its customers with services ranging from retail to corporate to private to investment banking. If the question is whether we can cater to any customer, I can proudly say, “yes," regardless of whether it is Islamic or non-Islamic banking. The merger has created a banking group that caters for anyone. We are seeing more activity on the corporate side for advisory services and more movement on the real estate front. I think many areas have seen significant improvements and growth, for example with credit cards. This area has seen significant growth, and this is also the case with SMEs. We have the biggest SME portfolio in the country.</p><h4>What efforts do you make to attract and retain skilled staff?</h4><p>We are in the service industry, and the most important part of that is the human talent. Therefore, we have made a huge investment in terms of human capital, as this is the organization's most valued asset. Emirates NBD has more than 9,000 staff, representing more than 60 nationalities, and we can proudly say that they will always be the pillars of the Group's success. We always focus on ensuring that our staff are happy and that they are sufficiently trained to be among the best in the region, and we do this by hosting a number of programs that cater to employee development and career growth.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins of Emirates Islamic Bank (EIB) in Dubai?<br></h4><p>EIB was launched in 2004 as the wholly owned Islamic arm of the Emirates NBD Group. It was established to provide the highest standards of Islamic banking services in the UAE. Meeting the highest standards of sharia compliance, set by our Sharia Board, EIB offers a broad range of products and services designed for individuals and small businesses, as well as large corporations. This distinguishes it from conventional banks in the market. Utilizing Islamic financing methods like murabaha, ijarah, and salam, EIB focuses on avoiding uncertainty in its transactions. Customers are viewed as partners, and the bank works closely with them to ensure that the best results are delivered for the customer and for the bank. Following the impact of the financial crisis, and in accordance with the announcement from the Ruler's office in late 2011, the vast majority of the assets and liabilities of Dubai Bank were assigned to EIB. The associated integration of business and operations was completed over a period of just one year with no disruption of services or discomfort to clients. Currently, EIB offers a wide range of sharia-compliant financial services with a focus on retail banking including for the mass affluent, SME banking, and remittance services.</p><h4>How are sukuk market trends being perceived by EIB after the financial crisis?</h4><p>Sukuks have become more popular over the past few years, especially in the GCC markets and Malaysia. Our outlook for this important investment instrument is very positive. A recent study conducted by Kuwait Finance House indicated that total sukuk issuance grew by 54% in 2012 and by 22% in 1Q2013. We share the view that sukuk issuance will continue to see strong growth in the near future, especially with more market players viewing this type of investment as a safe haven in comparison to conventional bonds.</p><h4>The bank's mission is to keep working on a core retail banking platform and a strong commercial banking franchise. What are the challenges when approaching UAE customers and spreading through the territory?</h4><p>The UAE is a very competitive market, where banks have been increasingly active in launching new products, services, and promotions. Moreover, customers are no longer looking for one-size-fits-all products. At EIB, we focus on understanding customer needs across the different segments, and work toward enhancing the overall customer experience. Based on this, we then develop innovative, convenient, and cost-effective solutions that best serve our customers. We also provide sound financial advice and elementary financial guidance to our clients.</p><h4>What is the customer profile of EIB?</h4><p>EIB has a clear stated vision of becoming a leading regional Islamic financial services institution with a core platform in retail banking and a strong commercial banking franchise. The bank aims to focus on four key customer segments; personal banking, priority banking, including the high-net -worth segment, business banking focused on SMEs, and commercial banking.</p><h4>How is the bank trying to approach different customers and fulfill customer needs? How has the banking app been received?</h4><p>EIB is continually developing products and services that cater to the changing needs of its customers. Our focus is on the richness and variety of our products and services. In keeping with the principles of sharia, we are also focused on setting up musharaka (partnership) financing with clients, based on risk and profit sharing. We have also witnessed a growing trend among our customers of going mobile. We were the first Islamic bank to introduce mobile banking across all major platforms, which offers our customers the very best in flexibility, convenience, and useful on-the-go banking services. In this sense, our banking app is an essential addition to the bank's e-portfolio system. It enables our customers to manage all banking operations including accounts, transfers, and utility payments.</p><h4>What are you doing to expand your reach?</h4><p>At EIB, we believe that you cannot be strong internationally until you gain a firm position in the domestic market. I view a bank like Santander as a role model; it first focused on organic growth in the domestic market, and then expanded regionally and internationally through a policy of mergers and acquisitions. We are also closely aligning our goals to Dubai's Vision 2020, through focus on retail banking and wholesale banking growth. EIB offers customers a wide product and service base, combined with a larger network of branches and ATMs, rooted in a strong commitment to customer service and care.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about BNY Mellon's presence in the Middle East?<br></h4><p>We've been in the Middle East for 100 years, having started with the Ottoman Bank in Turkey. We have two major lines of business right now: asset management and asset service. On the asset management side, we manage close to $1.2 trillion in assets through 17 investment boutiques, each of which has adapted special investment guidelines that can differ completely from the others. Thus, we can accommodate all of our clients' needs through our diversified services. In terms of our asset service line of business, we are the world's largest global custodian, with $26 trillion in assets under custody. We do cash-and-trade with banks, we open accounts, and we provide trade finance in the region. We also have a trust business and are one of the largest trustees in the financial world. We conduct a deposit receipts business for capital markets, where we take several companies in the local stock exchange and help them get listed on a European stock exchange or the London Stock Exchange. Put simply, we manage or service one dollar in every five dollars in the finance space. So, considering our model, Dubai is really a fantastic location for us. We cover the whole region from Dubai, where our product specialists are located and we also have an office in Abu Dhabi. The regulatory environment here in the UAE is very healthy.</p><h4>When we look across the range of products and services, where do you see the most demand within the UAE itself?</h4><p>The service sector is really expanding. Local companies are making good ratios, and this will encourage the capital markets to grow and open for foreign investors. Dubai has come through the global crisis well, real estate is recovering, and the service sector is going very well. This will all have a good effect on the capital markets.</p><h4>Would you say Dubai has very flexible visa arrangements and very positive labor laws as well?</h4><p>Yes, that's a good point. There are also the regulatory and compliance standards that Dubai has implemented. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has a very strong regulatory body that monitors business, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). Supporting our institution to be based in and outside the DIFC was the Central Bank of the UAE. Regulation and compliance is very important for our business model.</p><div class="quote">“We manage close to $1.2 trillion in assets through 17 investment boutiques."</div><h4>Do you see a flow-in effect in when other global companies open an office here in Dubai?</h4><p>Not at the time we opened, but I have noticed that Dubai is increasingly taking advantage of the recent changes in neighboring countries. Dubai is positioning itself as a safe haven in terms of trade finance, project finance, and real estate for the region. There is business coming from Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon. Thanks to its position as a safe haven, its good business and regulatory environment, as well as its geographical location, Dubai is really emerging. Dubai is taking advantage of its importance and benefits for countries in transition around it.</p><h4>How have you seen local banks develop over the time you've been here?</h4><p>They have continued to improve a lot, and they have recovered, for the most part, from the 2008 crisis. I see healthy ratios on balance sheets. I see good solutions of non-performing loans, and I have seen good compliance departments built over the last few years. I see many of them taking compliance more seriously now.</p><h4>What is your outlook regarding BNY Mellon's operations in Dubai?</h4><p>We are waiting for market development here. We expect the next market development to be on the capital markets side, by opening them up to foreign investors through the offering of more Depositary Receipts programs. We are expecting the capital markets to be the star in 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The Supreme Council of Energy is focusing on securing the future in the energy sector for Dubai, adopting the 2030 Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy. What recent reforms has the government put in place to promote sustainable growth and increase industry competitiveness and how it has impacted on DEWA policies?<br></h4><p>The Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030, developed by the Supreme Council of Energy under the guidance of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, serves as a roadmap for the governmental reforms and the vision of promoting sustainable growth. It sets the strategic direction of Dubai toward securing a sustainable supply of energy and enhancing demand-efficiency for water, electricity, and fuel. The overall goal is to diversify the Emirate's energy mix to include alternative energy sources, with 71% from natural gas, 24% from both nuclear power and clean coal, and 5% from solar power to fulfill Dubai's electricity needs by 2030, while achieving an energy use reduction of 30%. The Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 complements the long-term national initiative to build a sustainable future, announced by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, under the theme, “Green Economy for Sustainable Development." Led by our vision to become a sustainable world-class utility and to effectively contribute to the social, economic, and environmental development in the Emirate by supplying stable electricity and water services to achieve the vision of Dubai, DEWA is fully committed to the visionary outlook of the Supreme Council and the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030. In fact, I serve as the Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Council, and I ensure that all the policies and initiatives of DEWA are aligned with the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy. We place the utmost emphasis on rationalizing the use of natural resources, and identifying and implementing renewable energy strategies.</p><h4>How do legislative regulatory environment changes affect the electricity and water business?</h4><p>As proven by Dubai's success in driving sustainable development, the legislative environment serves as a strong referral point for utility providers to encourage the rational use of water and electricity. What we see in Dubai today is a more participatory role of sustainable growth, where stakeholders from across the industry, as well as end-users, are increasingly aware of the need to conserve electricity, water, and fuel usage. They take up various initiatives that are aligned with the regulations outlined by the Council. I strongly believe that it is important to have such an approach, where the government leads the way, and the public and private sectors adopt these policies pro-actively, and work together to achieve the common goal of rationalizing the use of electricity and water.</p><h4>To what extent has the acceleration of Dubai's economy been beneficial to the industries that have a high demand for electricity and water?</h4><p>The Dubai economy is currently growing at over 4%, led by a focus on economic diversification. This means, strengthening the traditional growth sectors of tourism, retail, hospitality, and aviation, among others, as well as building the pillars of the knowledge economy through education and information technology. Dubai has also been placing considerable emphasis on promoting the industrial sector, with a special focus on SMEs. This all-round growth has benefited industries that heavily rely on electricity and water, but what is of critical importance to these electricity- and water-intensive industries is their focus of on sustainable growth through concerted initiatives, to rationalize the use of natural resources.</p><h4>Can you give us a preview of the new projects that will be coming to DEWA in 2013-2014? What new initiatives are you most excited about?</h4><p>We have already set several new milestones this year including the opening by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Minister of Finance, and President of DEWA, of DEWA's M Station for electricity generation and water desalination in Jebel Ali. M Station is the largest power production and water desalination plant in the UAE, and generates 2,060 MW of electricity and 140 million imperial gallons of desalinated water per day. Developed at a cost of AED10 billion, M Station facilitates our goal to achieve a total production of 9,646 MW of electricity, and 470 million imperial gallons of desalinated water per day, to meet the current and future needs of the Emirate of Dubai, including planned expansion to further drive the city's urban prosperity and economic advancement. We have also opened our new Sustainable Building in Al Quoz, the first sustainable building in the UAE, and the largest government building in the world with a Platinum rating for green buildings from Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the US Green Building Council institute, which has a set of rating criteria for the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings, homes, and neighborhoods in the world. The DEWA Sustainable Building achieved 98 out of 110 points. With an area of 340,000 square feet, the new building is part of our “Green Buildings" initiative to achieve the highest levels of efficiency in the consumption of electricity and water. The building has been completed as per DEWA's Green Building regulations, with recycled materials accounting for 36% of the total construction materials used. The new project will achieve an energy performance efficiency level of over 66% by providing additional insulation in its walls and roof. In addition, renewable energy is available through an on-site 660 kW solar power plant, thereby reducing the building's carbon footprint even further.</p><h4>DEWA's motto is “For Generations to Come." How does this focus on sustainability to boost Dubai?</h4><p>Our focus on sustainability conforms with the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030 goals to reduce energy use by 30% and promote renewable energy sources. The advantages of such an approach for Dubai will be felt not only in the short term, but will bring tangible results in the long term, significantly benefiting our future generations. The emphasis on sustainability will not only enable Dubai to conserve its precious natural resources, but also reduce its carbon footprint, thus preserving our environment. It underlines Dubai's thought leadership in sustainable development policy-making globally, further adding to the civic pride of the city. DEWA is already seen as a leader in the industry, globally, having achieved very competitive results surpassing the private sector, and even leading European and American companies in efficiency and reliability. This is demonstrated by our reduction of losses in our electrical grid to just 3.5%, compared to 6%-7% in Europe and the US. And our water losses have decreased to 10.8% compared to 15% in North America. DEWA has also accomplished major achievements in enhancing the efficiency of generating electricity and desalinating water, and minimizing greenhouse gases, carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen emissions by an average of 10%. This is equivalent to the beneficial effects of planting 82 million trees. DEWA reduced carbon emissions by 11 parts per million (ppm) compared to 87 ppm in Europe, 3.5 ppm of sulfur as against 13.4 ppm in Europe, and 72.4 ppm of nitrogen compared to 108 ppm in Europe. This sets another international benchmark, highlights our commitment to meet the growth in demand for water and electricity, protects the environment, and promotes sustainability.</p><h4>DEWA offers the electricity and water that lay behind Dubai's astonishing growth. What are the major opportunities that DEWA provides to Dubai?</h4><p>The seamless growth of any city depends on the timely provision of electricity and water that supports businesses as well as promotes the quality of life. The growing demand for power reflects the prosperity of economic and social development in Dubai. Led by our vision to become a sustainable world-class utility, DEWA effectively contributes to the social, economic, and environmental development in the Emirate by supplying stable electricity and water services to achieve the vision of Dubai. We are now able to achieve a total production of 9,646 MW of electricity, and 470 million gallons of desalinated water per day, to meet the current and future needs of the Emirate of Dubai, including planned expansion to further drive our urban prosperity and economic advancement.</p><h4>Since modernizing is a top priority for DEWA. What trends do you foresee in your analysis of the needs and expectations of citizens and businesses?</h4><p>We foresee an obvious shift toward encouraging the rational use of electricity and water by end-users as well as businesses. We undertake regular surveys and analysis of the market to understand demand patterns. In fact, according to our most recent evaluation, demand for energy has increased in Dubai by an average 7.1% during the first quarter of 2013, with need for power increasing from 2009 GW in January 2012 to 2,142 GW in January 2013, 1,919 GW in February 2012 to 2,002 GW in February 2013, and 2,247 GW in March 2012 to 2,471 GW in March 2013. These figures highlight the capacity and efficiency of DEWA's transmission networks to meet the growing demand of different segments of consumers, and our commitment to ensuring the provision of electricity for various industrial, economic, residential, and service sectors, complementing the Emirate's rapidly developing pace. We will continue to expand our transmission and distribution networks in line with the expansion of urban areas in the city.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) is tasked with ensuring the UAE becomes a regional ICT hub. How would you evaluate its performance so far?<br></h4><p>The TRA is building the core ICT regulatory framework for the UAE's burgeoning knowledge economy, and it regulates the UAE's telecommunications sector to ensure that competition provides affordable and reliable telecommunications services. The TRA licensed Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Corporation (du) as the UAE's second national operator in 2006. Since commencing service delivery in 2007, du has largely focused on the mobile communications market and, by the end of 2012, it had secured almost 50% of the mobile market in terms of subscriber numbers. The positive effects of competition in the UAE telecommunications sector are now being witnessed by customers, who enjoy some of the lowest mobile tariffs in the GCC. In terms of fixed-line telecommunications services, the UAE has some of the most advanced networks in the world with a very high penetration of fiber to home connections, over which the licensees deliver innovative triple-play (voice, internet, and TV) services to customers. The policies of the TRA and the advanced networks deployed in the UAE enable modern UAE society to function with a high level of connectivity and affordable and reliable telecommunications services. In short, I am proud of the TRA's performance so far.</p><h4>What role must the TRA and the telecommunications sector play in Abu Dhabi's strategy to become a diversified business center by 2030?</h4><p>The TRA must continue to support the development of the industry, while promoting the interests of end-users. Supporting the development of the sector will ensure that the licensees continue to invest in new technologies and innovative service offerings. This is vital to ensuring businesses in Abu Dhabi take advantage of high-quality ICT infrastructure that may, in turn, give them a competitive advantage in the markets they compete in. Furthermore, by promoting the interests of end-users, we can ensure that they receive good value for their ICT spending. Overall, it is important that the TRA continues to provide a balanced, impartial response to the needs of all stakeholders: the government, the licensees, and the consumers.</p><h4>Is there room for another mobile carrier?</h4><p>We should think of quality rather than quantity. So, instead of focusing on the number of licensees, we should focus on what is being delivered. The UAE has one of the highest degrees of mobile penetration in the world. We also have some of the lowest mobile tariffs. World-leading technology—4G (LTE)—is deployed on both networks, and is widely accessible in the UAE; and from the TRA's consumer surveys we know that users generally have a high degree of satisfaction with the services supplied to them. At this point in time, the TRA has no plans to issue further mobile licenses. The TRA is happy with the way that the mobile market has developed and notes that the sector displays highly competitive characteristics. Having said that, the regulatory framework is an evolving process and, as such, the TRA constantly reviews the effectiveness of competition to ensure that the structure of the market remains appropriate.</p><div class="quote">“The TRA supports the UAE's ICT sector by safeguarding competition to protect the interests of subscribers."</div><h4>Many internet users still connect by dial-up because of the prices attached to broadband plans. Is there an opportunity here for regulation to improve services and prices for consumers?</h4><p>The TRA supervises the development of the UAE's online infrastructure, and has enabled the UAE to become one of the world's most connected societies, with 72% of households having access to broadband internet. The TRA is working closely with the licensees to implement a form of network sharing known as bit stream access. This will increase competition in the fixed services market, and exert downward pressure on a range of fixed-line services, including broadband.</p><h4>Just recently companies have been sharing their dark fiber networks. How will this improve services for customers?</h4><p>Such arrangements are been carried out as a result of commercial negotiations between the parties involved. The TRA is not involved in these negotiations, and is unaware of such agreements. Nonetheless, the TRA considers that dark fiber sharing, as with other forms of infrastructure sharing, can reduce the costs of service provision, which has the potential to reduce prices. This is an outcome that the TRA is seeking to achieve through other regulatory measures, such as the introduction of the bit stream access service.</p><h4>The TRA has been running the “My Number, My Identity" program over the past few months. Could you tell us a little bit about the program, and why it is encouraged?</h4><p>This campaign runs in line with our continuous efforts to protect the interests and privacy of mobile users, and is based on studies and surveys that indicated an increase in civil and criminal cases. These are due to certain mobile subscribers giving away their SIM cards to other users who may misuse the number, resulting in serious legal or financial issues for the actual owners. The TRA took several steps to organize registration processes and requirements for mobile phone services provided by the two licensees. It launched the “My Number, My Identity" campaign in collaboration with the licensees, aiming to increase awareness of the new registration procedures. The campaign highlights the importance of the mobile subscribers' role in protecting their SIM cards. These should not be given out to other users in order to avoid any misuse that may occur, as the registered owner of the number will be legally and financially accountable.</p><h4>Over the coming months, Yahsat will start to enter the local market as a broadband provider. What is the role of the TRA in protecting this new company from being priced out by Etisalat and du?</h4><p>The TRA supports the UAE's ICT sector by safeguarding competition to protect the interests of subscribers, enhancing the readiness of e-services, and encouraging investment, innovation, and development. The TRA has a range of regulatory measures in place designed to protect competition and to prevent licensees from subjecting other licensees to anti-competitive conduct. For example, the TRA's Competition Safeguards Regulatory Policy, dated September 30, 2010, prohibits the misuse of market power including, among other things, predatory pricing, margin squeezing, and discrimination against competitors. The TRA also has a price approval policy, whereby licensees must submit any proposed prices to the TRA for advanced approval. This includes all price changes for existing services and prices for new services. The TRA reviews the proposed prices with a view to ensuring that, among other things, the prices implemented within the market are not anti-competitive and will not have a detrimental impact on competition. In addition, the TRA is currently working on a project to define a set of competition remedies for markets in which one or both of the operators have been identified as having market power.</p><h4>The TRA has encouraged telecoms providers to introduce mobile number portability (MNP). Why is this important?</h4><p>MNP will allow the customers to retain their mobile number when switching network operators, and this will give them the freedom to choose their preferred network operator without worrying about their number changing. At the same time, MNP will enhance competition among network operators, and hence it would enhance services. MNP will be to the benefit of the end customer in general.</p><h4>At a recent GCC meeting the TRA proposed the creation of the .arab domain name. What potential does this have?</h4><p>The internet today has labels representing countries. The League of Arab States and the TRA envision .arab serving the entire Arab region. It shall create new opportunities for businesses and individuals, unifying us on the internet. We are at the birth of a new beginning, and are going to fully support it. We believe that .arab has a very strong potential for success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In a departure from the trend seen in many other countries, the UAE places aviation at the center of its economy, and the results over the past 25 years have been phenomenal; Terminal 2, which has just been extended, Terminal 3, the cargo mega terminal, the Dubai Flower Centre, and the Dubai Metro system. More recently, we've seen the opening of Concourse A, the world's first purpose-built A380 concourse, while Al Maktoum International—part of the Dubai World Central aerotropolis in Jebel Ali—continues to unfold. This has all been made possible by the underlying vision of Dubai's rulers, creating an aviation-centric economy and a model that the country can be very proud of.</p><h4>What's next for the aviation industry in the UAE?</h4><p>The next important aviation milestone is the start of passenger flights at Al Maktoum International—Dubai World Central (DWC) from October 27, 2013. The launch carriers will be Saudi-based nasair and Naz Air of Hungry, which flies to Central and Eastern Europe. Many people may not realize that the airport has been open to cargo flights since 2010, and Emirates SkyCargo will be moving its operations to DWC in a phased process beginning later in 2013. The latest developments come at a time when Dubai's aviation sector continues to show impressive growth. Dubai International, the world's second busiest airport for international passengers, racked up another month of double-digit growth in May with an 18.9% increase in passenger numbers. Overall, passenger traffic was up 16.8% compared to the first five months of 2012. In May 2014, Dubai Airports will conduct an extensive runway enhancement project at Dubai International. To safeguard service levels over the 80 days during which the work is taking place, scheduled passenger flights will be reduced, and all freighter, charter and general aviation flights will be diverted to DWC.</p><h4>Emirates Airline keeps opening new routes that connect Dubai with the world. What is the airline's ongoing strategy for securing a strong global presence?</h4><p>From the beginning in 1985, the strategy of Emirates Airline has remained very focused—to grow organically, connect cities across the world via Dubai, offer unbeatable value for money, and provide an unmatched level of service. In 2012, Emirates  Airline launched a record 15 new destinations, and our fleet count has recently reached 200, including 35 A380s.</p><h4>Which regions provide the greatest opportunity for the company? What new routes do you have planned?</h4><p>Emirates Airline is a global organization, so we look at opportunities on a global basis, sensitive to economic trends and other emerging patterns that may impact our business. So far in 2013, we've launched the Algiers, Warsaw, and Tokyo-Haneda routes.  Stockholm, Clark International in the Philippines, and Conakry in Guinea will follow later in 2013. A significant plus for Emirates Airline is the size of our network, enabling us to activate business between all sorts of city pairs, exploiting east-west connectivity through our Dubai hub. The strength of our business model, and the healthy spread of risk has helped us through the more difficult times.</p><h4>What sets Emirates Airline apart from its competition?</h4><p>In short, an indomitable desire to lead the industry. Billions of dollars in investment spanning our fleet, aircraft interiors, lounges, products, and services ensure that we leave no stone unturned in providing the very best value for money, delivering an experience customers are eager to repeat and share. With the largest fleet of A380s and Boeing 777s in the world, our fleet is one of the youngest and most environmentally efficient in the industry.</p><h4>What is the significance of customer needs anticipation for Emirates Airline?</h4><p>I strongly believe that people are an organization's greatest asset, and I am pleased to say the staff I oversee are remarkable, going the extra mile for our customers every day. Anticipating what customers want is a vital part of what we do.</p><h4>Emirates Airline offers the largest fleet of A380 aircraft, and a multitude of added services to the traveller, including luxurious lounges, a chauffeur service, and extensive cabin features. What is your next contribution to the airline sector?</h4><p>Emirates Airline is a pioneer in so many ways. Just recently, it was awarded the highly coveted “World's Best Airline" award, presented by Skytrax at the 2013 World Airline Awards. It is well known that barely a day goes by at Emirates Airline without a major announcement—if it's not a route launch, it's a global sponsorship, or an aircraft order, or else an investment of some sort. So I would say, watch this space.</p><h4>How will the Dubai's vision to further develop the infrastructure, in combination with the World Expo 2020 bid, impact operations of Emirates?</h4><p>From the very start, Emirates Airline and Dubai have grown hand in hand. The ongoing infrastructure development and the World Expo 2020 follow that pattern. Emirates Airline would continue to play a significant role in Dubai's bid, and, if successful, the event itself. As a company, we exist on the basis of connectivity, and in the 2012 financial year, we carried nearly 40 million passengers around the world. We, of course, will be a major factor in bringing millions of visitors to Dubai should World Expo 2020 be held here. With modern aircraft and numerous pioneering initiatives, Emirates Airline is also a shining example of progress. With the completion of Concourse A as the new home of the A380, the aircraft is representative of the rapid economic and infrastructural journey Dubai has undertaken.</p><h4>What does 2014 hold for Emirates Airline?</h4><p>The new financial year, which began April  1, 2013, is again proving to be challenging. However, we will remain focused on growth, and exploit opportunities that work for the business. We are optimistic about the future, but, given the intensely competitive environment and the forces at play, we need to remain smart and ahead of the game. We will continue to see a shift of activity from west to east—and with Dubai's globally central position, Emirates Airline is well placed to capitalize on that trend, equipped with modern, fuel-efficient aircraft.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)?<br></h4><p>We are a development institution, similar to the World Bank, and cover many sectors. We finance projects in energy, transportation, agriculture, education, and much more. We started in 1976, and in 2013 we will celebrate our 37th anniversary. We work all over the world in developing countries from Honduras to Tajikistan. OFID covers more than 130 countries and realizes many capacity-building projects for young people. Over the last four years, energy has become one of our priorities here.</p><h4>How do you see sustainable energy moving forward?</h4><p>We keep hearing the motto “Finding Solutions," but when I spoke at a recent conference in Vienna, I wanted to change the motto from “Finding Solutions" to “Funding Solutions," because this is exactly what we are doing to innovate. We are currently running the Energy for the Poor program, which has reached three main milestones. The first was in November 2007, when our heads of state gathered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, hosted by King Abdullah, and called for the first time in our era for the eradication of energy poverty. This was not an original part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), which is why our heads of state were keen to include it as the ninth goal. The second milestone came in 2008 when King Abdullah launched the Energy for the Poor scheme, and called on us to consider pledging. In June 2012, our ministerial council gathered in Austria and issued a declaration pledging a minimum of $1 billion, which is scalable, and can be increased if warranted by demand. At first, 20% of our commitment was to energy. Now we have increased this to 28% for the next two years. In 2012, we completed 25 projects, seven of which were renewable. Just because we are oil-exporting countries does not mean we are biased toward fossil fuels.</p><h4>Are there plans to increase the number of renewable energy projects at OFID?</h4><p>For OFID, the eradication of energy poverty is the first and overriding priority. With due respect, let's not mix priorities. Many people are concerned about renewables, and I respect that. But at OFID, our main goal is the elimination of energy poverty. When I travel to developing countries, the message I hear is always the same—“we need energy, and we need it now." People living in energy poverty are not interested in waiting until certain technologies become feasible. Their children need light to do homework by, families need fuel to cook, and preserve food and medicines. Meeting these most basic of needs is our chief concern. Honestly, the fuel mix doesn't enter into the equation. Our approach is always to find the best solution for a given situation. In terms of renewables, we have provided a cumulative $700 million in financing for such projects. Around $225 million of this has been delivered over the past five years alone, as we have ramped up efforts to address the urgency. We are currently working with a number of organizations that are implementing innovative solutions on the ground. Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda are three countries that spring to mind.</p><div class="quote">“In terms of renewables, we have provided a cumulative $700 million in financing for such projects."</div><h4>How does the GCC fit into developing green energy in underprivileged countries?</h4><p>We are doing everything we can. Of course, oil is the mainstay of the economy, but the region is also investing in renewables. It has established institutions for solar, nuclear, and wind energy, and is working to place the right people into jobs, including graduates from Harvard, MIT, and the like. We're on the right track. The issue is that this discussion is continuously misguided by commentators politicizing the energy mix and insinuating that oil is dirty. It depends on your perspective. At OFID, we look at the problem as experienced by people in poorer countries, where often the main source of energy comes from wood and animal waste. Burning these products is a serious health hazard and has many other disadvantages as well. So, for such communities, anything superior to these sources is preferable and would certainly be considered as “clean." After all, it's all relative. In fact, I would say that what we have in these cases goes far beyond social and economic considerations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that the fast changing global political, economic, and cultural trends have a greater and deeper impact on the future of nations. Economic growth has become chiefly dependent on the extent of a nation's pursuit of those trends, the level of flexibility in handling their implications, and the necessary actions taken to cope with them.<br></p><p>Our country has shown utmost flexibility in coping with surrounding variables. Due to its precise goal-bound economic strategies and solid policies, the UAE has achieved outstanding progress on global economic indexes. Progress was obtained through strong emphasis on the human factor, which is the foundation of the development system that enables the UAE to achieve its goal of ranking number “One" on all global indexes—an unwavering strategic goal and rank that we are keen to accomplish.</p><p>Under the leadership and directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, our country recently ranked 19th overall on the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), which was a five-rank improvement compared to 2012—an achievement that we are proud of and that gives us an incentive to work harder to obtain further progress and top the world in this and other indexes.</p><div class="quote">“Our country has shown utmost flexibility in coping with surrounding variables."</div><p>Since the early stages of our developmental journey, we have been very keen to pursue the diversification of our national economy. The improvement of all economic sectors was emphasized, and global trends were closely monitored to identify opportunities that we could utilize toward achieving desired progress. Determined to create a healthy, inviting environment attractive to investment and supportive of the private sector, we embarked on setting a comprehensive and solid framework for our relations with the local and international business community based on the principle of partnership toward success.</p><p>Enjoying a distinguished geographical location at the center of the world, we have chosen to strategically invest in building sustainable infrastructure that would establish our country as the main gate for trade in the region and beyond. Today, we feel proud of our world class and highly ranked sea and air ports, which have strongly positioned the UAE as a main hub for trade and travel worldwide.</p><p>Since the UAE possesses the necessary constituents to attract tourism, we gave this vital sector significant attention; especially in the light of emerging global trends such as the growth of the middle class in the Far East region and the remarkable increase in its travel budgets. The emergence of China as one of the new tourism exporting countries will definitely have an impact on the global tourism industry. Scrupulously monitoring and measuring these fast-paced changes, we are prepared to handle their global implications. Our reliable and state-of-the-art infrastructure underlines our capability to meet the growing demand for our country as a preferred tourist destination in the Middle East. The UAE fulfilled all necessary requirements, especially those catering to family tourism, which we seek to lead globally.</p><p>As we look into the future, we do so with hope and faith. We have placed our trust in the capabilities of our citizens and their ability to achieve further success in various sectors, equipping them with all the necessary tools to sail into new horizons and build a better future for the coming generations. We shall continue to invest in developing our human resources, updating our legal and regulatory frameworks, upgrading and further strengthen our infrastructure, and pursuing new levels of development and seeking to further establish ourselves as key partners in forming the future of humanity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When you served as a diplomat in the Gulf during the 1980s, did you ever imagine that Dubai would transform so rapidly into such a globally significant center of trade?<br></h4><p>Dubai's development has been extraordinary. It has used ingenuity and creativity to turn the challenges it faces, as a non-oil producing part of an oil producing region, into huge advantage, as a business and trading center for the region and the world.</p><h4>The results of Dubai's World Expo 2020 bid should be known by the end of 2013. Do you believe this city deserves to host the event, and if so what are the advantages of having it here?</h4><p>Yes I do. Indeed, the UK was the first country to publicly support Dubai's bid. Dubai's experience is its major advantage—it already has an established reputation for high-quality event delivery and it is host to over 50 exhibitions a year.</p><h4>As both London and Dubai are major regional transport hubs, how do you see the number of air and sea connections, as well as the exchange of expertise, personnel and experience, increasing over the next five years?</h4><p>We are closely following the UAE's airport development plans. Dubai airport is due to take over from Heathrow as the number one passenger airport by 2014, and UK companies are already positioning themselves to take advantage of the opportunities generated by $80 billion of investment over the next 15 years.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai has a very strong vision and offers a safe and secure environment for investors."</div><h4>The British represent the largest expatriate population of EU citizens in the UAE and are concentrated for the most part in Dubai. Do you think this trend will change any time soon?</h4><p>The UK and the UAE (and specifically Dubai) have strong trade links. They rightly see Dubai as the hub within which to base their regional headquarters in order to cover both the GCC and the Asia-Pacific region. We have recently launched the British Business Centre in Dubai to provide incubator services to new-to-market SMEs, and this will undoubtedly increase the number of UK expatriates and will help us to exceed our £12 billion export target.</p><h4>As an international trade professional, what would you say are the main lessons that other economies, particularly those struggling to grow or attract investment, can learn from Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai has a very strong vision and offers a safe and secure environment for investors. It quickly realized that it needed to diversify its economy in order to succeed in a non-oil producing environment. There are two specific areas that have contributed most to this success—the Jebel Ali Port and the rapid expansion of Emirates Airline. Dubai's successes in attracting inward investment have also been part of a wider strategy that has seen 60% of Dubai's imports actually re-exported to the wider region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the culture and the evolution of the insurance sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>Usually, you evaluate the culture and evolution of a market by comparing it to your neighbors, in this case the Middle East at large. The Lebanese people were the very first in this part of the world to introduce the concept of insurance. Unfortunately today, there are many countries ahead of us. And while we still rank quite highly on a premium per capita basis, we lag behind the UAE, which is the number one in the Arab world. On that front, we also lag behind another neighbor, Israel, by 10% to 15%. Of course, all of this is still far behind the EU and the US. The problem with the sector and its evolution is that it is market-made and not shaped by regulation. Yes, the Ministry of Economy does oversee the sector; however, it is not doing enough to advance the sector, or its evolution mainly by reason of legislative and government paralysis. With the market often unable to reach a consensus, it has problems raising capital. Market forces, private companies, and competition make the Lebanese insurance sector what it is. One notes that the regulatory authority tends to protect existing insurance companies from potential new players entering the market. It can, for example, be quite difficult to register a new company due to certain restrictions in place. One reason for this is that there are already approximately 50 insurance companies operating in a country that should accommodate a maximum of 20, thereby making for a surplus of about 30 companies. Many of those would come back as brokers if they were to shut down their operations, because many are already brokers in reality, operating behind the façade of an insurance company. One suspects that some business people simply prefer to be acknowledged as the president of an insurance company, rather than of a small brokerage house. Sooner or later, these companies will have to face the fact that they are indeed brokerage houses, or else merge with other sector players.</p><h4>How do you assess competition in the sector, and what is the importance of mergers?</h4><p>Let's consider for a moment the case of France; when you work as a broker, you work on small margins. Yet, margins are fast-eroding, which is the price of competition. Expense margins made on every insurance policy account for 55% of the premium, which is a huge percentage. This scenario does not exist in the Arab world. Out of the 55%, what you end up doing is giving a discount to your client in order to face the competition, which is basically price driven. Service is important down the line; you never know the worth of the insurance company you are working for until you make a claim. When you work in insurance, you are in the business of paying claims, not collecting premiums. This is the service that we provide, and is at the very heart of our business. Mergers are very difficult to calibrate. You are either bought out completely, as in the case of LIA, or else there is an imbalance in terms of power. One company is always the stronger. Mergers are also difficult, culturally speaking, because Lebanese people have an inflated sense of pride and exhibit too much amour-propre to accept their realities. The problem is that smaller companies are hiring six or seven additional people in order to look bigger and call themselves an insurance company when in actual fact they are brokers. At that point, they are not thinking about maximizing profit, but about prestige. Large companies are looking to buy others out, or to be bought out. Then, there are the insurance companies owned by banks to contend with. Bank Audi just sold its own such division for solvency reasons at the bank level. Perhaps more companies will go this way down the line, because regulations on the banking sector are much more stringent than those of the insurance sector. These banks have, however, become serious players in the Lebanese insurance market.</p><div class="quote">“Market forces, private companies, and competition make the Lebanese insurance sector what it is."</div><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Oman's traditionally low insurance penetration?</h4><p>Currently, the Sultanate of Oman has very low insurance penetration as a percentage of GDP, as is the case in GCC. Presently, only third-party motor insurance is compulsory, whilst all others are optional. Unlike Western countries and many of its counterparts, people here think of insurance only as a last resort. However, the situation is slowly changing. A low volume of high-net-worth (HNW) individuals, both expatriates and Omanis, would purchase insurance. But, corporate companies are realizing the benefits of purchasing employee benefit insurance, medical insurance, workers' compensation, and group life cover for their employees, and as such these classes of insurance have shown a remarkable increase in the last few years. To take advantage of the situation, Falcon Insurance Company extends excellent life and medical and workers' compensation insurance coverage and has developed an extensive portfolio of corporate clients since its inception. Many of our clients are realizing the importance of insurance, and I am sure a few years down the line that retail insurance too will snowball into a bigger market.</p><h4>Is the insurance market evolving as people see the benefits of insurance?</h4><p>Yes, the market is evolving; however, in terms of buying insurance voluntarily, it is still a long way off. I personally am of the opinion that in the next five years, the Omani insurance market might witness a visible jump/enhancement in terms of insurance, especially in the personal lines segment. A decade ago, society operated in a different manner. In case of the unfortunate death of an earning member of a family, the relatives and friends would pool money and take care of the family of the deceased person. However, that is not the case now, and people are realizing the importance of saving and having a back-up plan in case of misfortune. The working population is growing, especially in the cities. We find that the percentage of couples working, both males and females, has increased over the last few years, thus directly increasing the potential for saving. Nuclear families have given them an opportunity to save more and invest wisely. They are indeed realizing the importance of the different types of insurance available in the market, and we find many people buying policies like those related to savings for marriage, retirement, and children's education, for example.</p><div class="quote">“The insurance market is evolving at a slow and steady pace, especially life insurance."</div><h4>What do you think will be the impact of takaful?</h4><p>Falcon Insurance Company is a conventional insurance firm, whereas takaful is an Islamic insurance concept, and as such it has a completely separate and different entity. The basic tenet of insurance is that the risk of one is shared by many. This concept does not change between a takaful insurance company and a conventional insurance company. Overall, the arrival of takaful companies will have an effect on our share of business in the market. In regard to the creation of new business by the availability of takaful products, we will have to wait and see.</p><h4>How do you see the insurance market evolving over the next five years?</h4><p>The insurance market is evolving at a slow and steady pace, especially life insurance. In terms of business, we haven't seen any major new projects coming up in the last two years, and hence our focus is on retaining our clientele listing and, of course, developing and increasing our reach wherever possible. In the last few years (2004 to 2011) the number of insurance companies has increased drastically. However, the size of the market together with premiums have not grown as much. Oman continues to be regarded by many reinsurers as the most under priced and over competitive in the GCC. I strongly believe that this scenario will have to change in the next few years. Moreover, the regulators are now working toward forcing insurance companies to have a minimum capital of OMR10 million. New licenses are issued only with this criterion. That leaves existing companies that have a capital less than OMR10 million to either request shareholders to inject more funds, find new stakeholders, or look at merger options with other insurance companies with similar issues.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the business environment for foreign investors in Ecuador?</h4><p>Among the 185 economies across the globe, Ecuador ranks 139th according to the World Bank Doing Business 2013 edition, which is an increase of nine positions on the previous year's edition. The rank reflects group topics regarding evaluation criteria to determine the ease of doing business, and its feasibility. To constitute an enterprise, 13 mandatory events are necessary to fulfil all the legal and tax requirements, a process that approximately requires 56 days. Other considerations that need be taken into account at the start of business in Ecuador are: construction permits require 16 procedures and take around 128 days; registering property comprises nine mutually dependent steps, which are indispensable; paying taxes involves 654 hours per year; and enforcing a contract on the judicial level requires 39 actions and instances to occur. This approximately takes 588 days, and on average the cost represents 27.2% of the claim. From a regional point of view, Ecuador has reached an average performance whereby the country has set a precedent of locating itself in a regular Doing Business position.</p><h4>What must Ecuador do to maximize its knowledge and human capital potential?</h4><p>Education plays a leading role in the maximization of knowledge, and should also be seen as a key factor in the attainment of corresponding human rights, as well as in  helping achieve the UN's millennium goal of universal primary education. To do this, Ecuador must constantly develop a sense of responsibility, cultivate an autonomous culture, increase students' range of possibilities, and exercise the ability to face and deal with challenging situations. Conversely, regardless of the implementation of a new legal framework for tertiary education, a more binding course of action to reach an optimal R&amp;D for universities and colleges, as well as assuring better academic or technical studies and publications must be addressed. In other words, we need to produce knowledge, instead of just learning it, in addition to making this new data accessible in different segments of society. Therefore, more accurate information will be used as input for decision-making processes. On these grounds, the Council of Evaluation, Accreditation and Quality Assurance of the Higher Education System in Ecuador (CEAACES) promotes the continuous assessment of existing universities and colleges in order to maintain and provide proper development and sustainability criteria for the attainment of a noticeably improved service.</p><div class="quote">“The most relevant industrial sectors to be consolidated due to transactions and mergers are health, finance, and education."</div><h4>What is your midterm outlook on the evolution of the non-oil trade balance?</h4><p>According to the Central Bank of Ecuador, the non-oil trade balance of January 2013 registered a rise in negative trade balances from $833.2 million to $863.5 million, which represented a larger non-oil commercial deficit of 3.6% than in the previous year.  Additionally, at the end of the same period, compared to the previous one, the non-oil trade balance grew 37.6%, from $627.6 million to $863.5 million. Furthermore, as an expected outcome of the four-year national budget program, the Ministry of Finance of Ecuador forecasts the non-oil trade balance improving. Based on data from the Ministry for the Coordination of Economic Policy the deficit, at $8.8 billion in 2012, is estimated to rise to $8.9 billion in 2013, but then decline to $8.2 billion and $7 billion in 2014 and 2015, respectively. To be able, in the short term, to mitigate the deficit of the Ecuadorean non-oil trade balance it is advisable to open up the Ecuadorean economy to markets where domestic products, such as flowers, coffee, and seafood, have an extensive quality advantage. It would also be beneficial to intensify business and commercial relations with countries whose trade balances are largely positive.</p><h4>What are the most important specifications of the Ecuadorean Commercial Code that foreign investors should be aware of?</h4><p>Effectively, the Ecuadorean Commercial Code is inadequately promoted; hence, investors are not able to fully understand the rights, obligations, and benefits enshrined in this law. Despite this, circumstance regarding the existing commercial code considers the following:</p><p>• Art. 2. - Those deemed to be merchants or traders</p><p>• Art. 3. - Trade actions (16 different types)</p><p>• Art. 7. - Who are forbidden to conduct trade actions</p><p>• Art. 26. - Period allowed to obtain business registration (15 days)</p><p>• Art. 140. - Business registration mandatory nature</p><p>• Art. 154. - Ecuador geographical jurisdictional hierarchy.</p><h4>Do you anticipate further changes to the legal framework for investment?</h4><p>Currently, the legislative environment of Ecuador may see the approval of approximately 63 bills or drafts laws impacting certain sectors of society. Among those connected to the legal framework for investment are: the law on the securities market, the currency regime and the state bank law amendment, as well as the financial system institutions law amendment, the law for the defence of labour rights (Procedure No. 108924), and the social security law amendment (Procedure No. 121679)</p><h4>Where do you foresee the main growth opportunities in the Ecuadorean economy?</h4><p>In 2012, according the four-year national budget programme (2012-2015 indicates a progressive decline of GDP, until a 3.3% level has been reached by 2015. As for the various sectors of the economy, there is a positive perspective regarding infrastructure and construction. This segment of the economy has seen the highest growth over the past two years on a 15.6% average, and signifying 10% of the GDP. Finally, there are more sectors promising growth in the upcoming years, such as aquaculture, fisheries, shrimp processing and preservation, and forestry, which will altogether reach an average growth of around 15%.</p><h4>What are your expectations for M&amp;A activity in Ecuador?</h4><p>The overall outlook seems promising based on the bills that have been passed into law. The most relevant industrial sectors to be consolidated due to transactions and mergers are health, finance, and education. PwC highlights the presence of regional players, for instance Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, primarily in the field of potential purchasers and acquirers in the floriculture and aquaculture, construction, retail, and tourism sectors.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When business people come to Abu Dhabi, what are the key points that they need to understand?</h4><p>Over the past decade, Abu Dhabi has become one of the world's fastest growing economies. As a result of its oil and gas resources, Abu Dhabi is a significant global exporter of goods and services, linked to the world's largest economies through trade. Abu Dhabi has shown remarkable growth and is highly instrumental with its progress. Presently, the Commercial Companies Laws do not specify any accounting standards framework for the preparation of the financial statements. The Central Bank of the UAE has made it mandatory for banks to prepare their accounts as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Listed companies also prepare their accounts as per IFRS. In the absence of any specific standards framework in UAE, most of the practicing firms apply IFRS in the preparation of audited financial statements, and apply International Standards of Auditing in the conduct of audit of financial statements.</p><h4>What are the major advantages of registering a company in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>According to major economic indicators, Abu Dhabi currently enjoys an enviable position; economic growth is accelerating, per capita income is one of the highest in the world, and Abu Dhabi's citizens are wealthier and healthier than ever before. If one has a viable business plan and wants to tap into of one of the safest, most affluent, and fastest growing markets in the world, Abu Dhabi is the right place to establish presence. Whether you are planning to set up a new business in the Emirate or open a branch of a company based outside the country, the procedures are transparent and flexible. In most cases, it takes only a few days to complete the procedures if you fulfill all the requirements of the relevant authorities. Abu Dhabi is the economic center of the UAE and it is the capital. It fully expects to become a world showcase for planned growth in the future. Abu Dhabi is the largest Emirate in terms of land and the second largest in terms of population. It is well known for its significant oil and gas reserves, and is a regional banking and investment center. The government provides a broad economic base to include a diverse range of industrial and commercial activities. It is beginning to encourage commercial activities and not solely rely on its oil and gas reserves. The rate of investment very much includes utilities and infrastructure, which need foreign investment in areas such as water, power, gas, satellite communications, and computer hardware and software. It is very much interested in banking and other subsidy sectors, also promoting tourism. Abu Dhabi has also established a customs- and tax-free zone, with particular emphasis on industrial free zones. The Emirate is also a popular choice for foreign investment and business, being at a crucial junction for gas and oil transit through the Gulf. Abu Dhabi has recently placed particular efforts into economic diversity, focusing on the financial and banking industry as well as increasing tourism. This, combined with its traditionally open attitude to Western cultures, makes Abu Dhabi a highly attractive location for a large number of cosmopolitan international visitors. A key factor to understand is that Abu Dhabi is successful at business strategies, and you have to understand the behavior to make Abu Dhabi a business center for you. It may take a bit of time to understand, but we have a prize in Abu Dhabi. We get our clients to come to Abu Dhabi, we talk to them, and now we have decided to open a branch office here. We have been looking after Abu Dhabi clients for local interest, overseas interest, and now we have a commissioned place.</p><div class="quote">“Over the past decade, Abu Dhabi has become one of the world's fastest growing economies."</div><h4>What draws international businesses to Abu Dhabi's free zones?</h4><p>With the intensified global trend toward trade liberalization, the Abu Dhabi government, which is keen to take the full advantage of various opportunities and challenges created by integration into the global economy, provides tremendous support for businesses established within the free zones. Abu Dhabi free zones attract international investors by providing a multitude of incentives, such as 100% foreign ownership of companies, eliminating the need for a local partner, a low-cost operational environment, full repatriation of capital and profits, and exemption from import, export, corporate, and personal taxes. One of the other major advantages that international businesses can benefit from is the utilities. Abu Dhabi has subsidized utilities—electricity costs as well as port facilities are subsidized. That is what makes Abu Dhabi an attractive place, especially when it comes to semi-skilled labor. The ability of Abu Dhabi to bring in skills from neighboring countries, and even attract the most skilled workers, is surpassed by none. This was made possible by changes in the labor laws.</p><h4>Can you talk about how the tax system affects expatriates?</h4><p>Most expatriates move here to work in Abu Dhabi. The tax benefits are well known and the standard of living—even with the heat—is very high, making it a great place to relocate to. Being an expatriate, no extra tax will be charged, which is what makes the Emirate so attractive. White-collar jobs make Abu Dhabi interesting for expatriates. Also, people generally pay taxes in the country they work in and there are treaties in this regard. If you are a resident, you would not be paying tax to your country when you are not domicile. However, in Abu Dhabi, if you are a resident here, you will not pay tax, which is a great advantage.</p><h4>The silver and gold trade is intensely popular here. What are some of the customs issues people face?</h4><p>Gold is popular in the UAE, being known as the Middle East region's gold hub and the world's largest re-exporter of gold. The gold souks here have a breathtaking choice of jewelry including silver, pearls, and diamonds. The gold is generally 18 carat and sometimes 22 or 24, while styles range from Indian to traditional Arab and modern Italian. The UAE, as a whole, is remarkably attractive in specific reference to the privileges it offers in free trade. There is a huge Indian market for gold, which is made into traditional ornaments. People from around the world especially travel here to buy gold ornaments to take back home. Abu Dhabi not only provides these facilities, but a variety of precious metals and stones. In Indian and Pakistani culture, they use these ornaments a lot, sometimes even for a dowry. The quality of gold is excellent here.</p><h4>Where do you see the bulk of demand for your services in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Merali's aims at being widely recognized as a premier and independent accounting firm that serves leading national and global organizations and for this we ensure our work is conducted with professional skepticism. We strive for excellence in whatever we do. Merali's has conducted several trainings for the UAE government and Abu Dhabi nationals in order to enhance their technical audit and accounting skills. Our firm specializes in service charge audits wherein community towers have been sold to a freehold, and the maintenance and communal part comes under review. The owners would like to feel comfortable with the idea that these expenses are accurate and correct. Therefore, it is good practice in Abu Dhabi that an independent company and not the auditors of the developer audit these expenses. We have been specializing in all the large developments, and audit all the service charges for the second-largest developer in Abu Dhabi. Having said that, we also looked after, historically, medium-sized and family businesses. We provide them with financial guidelines. We provide studies, corporate finance facilities, and insurance work. This is an area that, at the moment, is not well catered for when companies get into financial difficulties. We can help assist them to resolve their issues, debts, and insolvency issues, as well as look at their debts and help them figure out how they can clear them.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where did your story in the logistics market begin?</h4><p>I started as a delivery boy in one of Colombia's main packaging and forwarding companies. This experience gave me the opportunity to discover the multi- dimensional nature of this industry. Within three years, I had been appointed Department Manager. Then following further professional experiences, I decided to go solo with Pasar, a company that first started operating without industry licenses, working basically on commission for other freight-forwarding companies in the sector. In 1978, we officially began as a customs agency, and over the past 35 years we have grown tremendously. For example, when we learnt that FedEx wanted to enter the Colombian market in 1993, we applied for the representation rights, and won. As a result, we represented FedEx in Colombia and Ecuador for 18 years. Only after that period, did it decide to have its own official business activity. TNT, a leading company in the industry in Europe and in certain part of Asia, and with activities in over 200 countries, is another example of our growth story, since it came to us based on our reputation, offering us its representative duties in the country, thereby adding to our prestige. That was in 2011, and since then we have invested large amounts of money into ensuring that we grab a secure a significant piece of the market. At the moment, we hold a 4.5% market share and expect to reach a 9% share within the next seven years.</p><h4>What have been the company's landmark achievements over these 35 years?</h4><p>The main one has been to get to know, in detail, the Colombian market, as well as entering neighbouring markets such as Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. In this context, we have managed to consolidate our business activity and become a rather reputable international logistics and freight-forwarding company in Colombia. We have expanded the size of our operations to reach customs, storage facilities, fast packaging, and road transportation, and also within ports facilitating the transportation of goods to and from Bogotá, as well as express packaging, and air transport. Overall, I think we have become a provider of fully integrated logistics services domestically and in the region, with very good prospects for further growth on the international stage.</p><div class="quote">“We expect to reach over 5% of the market thanks to our hard-working sales force and by offering added value to our clients."</div><h4>Who are Pasar's main clients?</h4><p>We have a broad customer portfolio that includes corporate clients, manufacturers, industry-related companies, and clients from sectors including pharmaceuticals and commerce. We are also deeply involved in online commerce and the delivery of online purchased goods. This latter section enables us to better reach individual clients. According to the figures, in the corporate segment alone we have more than 4,000 clients, whereas in terms of individuals, this figure exceeds 10,000.</p><h4>What is the current size of your operations?</h4><p>If we assemble all of our operations—not only in Colombia, but other foreign markets—we are talking about business activity worth $16 million. Despite having an international presence in some markets, we also outsource activities in international packaging, as this provides us a wider geographical reach.</p><h4>What regional markets offer the potential for Pasar to expand its activity?</h4><p>Currently, we are holding talks with potential investors in Mexico, a country in which we are very interested to start operations. Our focus in Mexico, as well as in general terms, to expand our activity in the mailbox service and reach the entire Latin American region. Additionally, we want to further consolidate the other segments of our operations.</p><h4>What challenges must the Colombian logistics industry overcome for further growth?</h4><p>The main problem is related to infrastructure and infrastructure capacity at places like El Dorado airport, which make exports prohibitively expensive. For example, to transport a few containers from Bogotá to Cartagena is more expensive than taking them from Cartagena internationally.</p><h4>How would you characterize competition in the Colombian logistics industry?</h4><p>Competition is rather strong in our sector in Colombia. Despite the fact that we are not an active player in the domestic market, I can say that Servientrega is a leading actor. We compete in the international market from Colombia, and TNT has strong competition in that segment. Our strength is to be able to offer competitive advantages to our clients. For example, we have better transit times and more flexibility than many other players in the industry. We have the advantage of being an international company with domestic flexibility. However, we should keep in mind that we are a rather young player in the sector, having entered the market two years ago with TNT.</p><h4>What is the relevance of the Alpasar Free Trade Zone (FTZ)?</h4><p>Our storage and custom facilities are located at this FTZ in Bogotá. All the goods imported for our clients are stored there to undergo relevant checks before delivery.</p><h4>What are the company's main goals for 2014?</h4><p>We expect to reach over 5% of the market thanks to our hard-working sales force and by offering added value to our clients. We have vast experience in working under pressure and in line with international standards. Additionally, TNT is also undergoing an international campaign to further improve its services, and I believe we will manage to continue growing in this demanding sector. In this context, I believe we will create considerable positive synergy with TNT to the benefit of both parties. We have to keep in mind that TNT is a rather young company in Colombia and we are heavily investing in brand recognition in the local market to ensure that we compete against other companies based on services, rather than tariffs.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Currently, there are 18 mainstream banks, eight microfinance banks, and seven credit cooperatives in the market, but when Millennium bim started there were none. How has your approach changed since the market began to open up?</h4><p>We have always had the same approach to the market. Millennium bim was established in 1995 as a business model that was based on a differentiation strategy by focusing on the mass and corporate segments, coupled with the introduction of IT platforms, modern branch layout, as well as a new organizational structure that emulated the mother company's business model in Portugal. The formula proved to be successful as our competitors remained at a standstill at a time when the economy was going through a transformational phase from a planned to a market-based economy. In effect, the leading banks were being privatized with outmoded business models. Our motto from the beginning was “innovation and modernization." We have always kept the transformation of the market as a central part of our business strategy in Mozambique. As the economy changes, you can verify from the data and the numbers that we are at the forefront of the market. We are always leading the market among financial institutions because our strategy is to be in line with the state of the market, the needs of our clients, and with the future needs of the Mozambican economy.</p><h4>What is  Millennium bim doing to support the lower income and SME segments of the market?</h4><p>This economy, with the development that it has, needs greater financial inclusion. This financial inclusion requires that the bank creates innovative products that meet the needs of our clients in areas that have low penetration by the Mozambican financial system. This is our approach and we will keep on leading the bank in this way. There are many microfinance institutions in Mozambique, but we started the sector here. The International Bank of Mozambique got into contact with institutions that had experience in microfinance, and we created a microfinance bank called Novo Banco, in which we were one of the stakeholders. We are now opening new branches in different areas of the country where business is growing.</p><h4>What role do technology and e-banking play in your business?</h4><p>We recently launched an innovative product in the Mozambican market called Millennium IZI. Millennium bim was the first bank to give its clients the chance to access electronic banking channels. It was the first bank to have online and mobile banking—Millennium Izi is a new and user-friendly version of mobile banking that includes a customer support service line that is also a transactional line. This means that through the line a client can make transactions by using the appropriate codes. They have the internet, but they can access this secondary channel to make their transactions.</p><h4>How has the increased influx of international corporates changed Millennium bim's business?</h4><p>We approach both the mass market and the corporate segments differently. Obviously, the oil and gas and mineral resources projects are a major part of the Mozambican economy. This will bring in major investments from multinationals, and a lot of them import their own financial packages already completely designed abroad. Our home institution Millennium BCP in Portugal has a developed investment banking model, and considerable professional experience. We previously had an investment banking practice in Mozambique, which we are now rebuilding in collaboration with Millennium BCP so that we are not left out of infrastructure finance opportunities in Mozambique. Crucially, we need to be prepared to respond to the appeals for financial resources from SME companies in every domain, whether they be in the electricity, tourism, agriculture, food, or transport sectors.</p><div class="quote">“The expansion of the oil and gas sector will precipitate major investments from abroad."</div><h4>Why should international investors work with Millennium bim in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have 18 banks, but three of these represent over half of the market. However, we are the bank with the highest number of awards, and are recognized nationally and known abroad. Millennium bim is the only Mozambican bank to be included in the ranking of the 100 largest African financial institutions.</p><h4>What forthcoming trends do you see in Mozambique's banking sector?</h4><p>The expansion of the oil and gas sector will precipitate major investments from abroad. These investments will be too big for the banking sector's capabilities, and the big-ticket transactions will be funded by global banks. Such banks are seeking to have a permanent footing in Mozambique, whilst others use regional offices located in Johannesburg or other neighboring countries. The development of huge investment projects requires a concomitant development of clusters of local SMEs to cater to the different services and goods that multinational companies (MNCs) require along their value chain to accomplish their production plans. This is where local content comes in, regardless of whether it is imposed by legislation or not. The underlying business model for SMEs involves a stable stream of revenues that translate into contractual arrangements pertaining to the supply of goods and services. This is where we can come on board and support companies to enhance their capabilities. The situation is so critical that Millennium bim has rolled out specific products for the linkage-related SMEs, as is the case of the discount of invoices aimed at smoothing the cash-flow cycle, forex transactions, and wage payments. In addition, by its nature as a retail bank, the mass market is encompassed by providing household loans that are pay-related.</p><h4>What are your plans and goals for 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>In the forthcoming years, and as part of our ongoing commitment to the social and economic development of Mozambique, Millennium bim plans to continue to fund both individual and SME/corporate loans and advances, while also maintaining its leadership in customer deposits. Once more, the bank's approach to innovation in new products, services, and functionalities will be a key driver for our business, aiming for the further penetration of services and customer enrolment to different banking business lines. Furthermore, Millennium bim will remain focused on its branch expansion efforts, including in rural areas, therefore contributing to a greater and better accessibility of financial services in Mozambique, as a way to promote the financial inclusion of the population, as we have done, historically, since the bank's inception.</p><h4>Where do you see the greatest opportunities for foreign investors in Mozambique in 2014?</h4><p>Massive investments in infrastructure are required in regions that are extremely underdeveloped and where skilled manpower is scarce. Developed countries' resources and experience can be replicated in Mozambique through adequate adaptation to local conditions. Opportunities abound in logistics, such as ports, railways, roads, warehouses, and transportation. Accommodation is non-existent in regions like Palma, or is faced with huge supply constraints in some cities, like Tete. State-sponsored training centers for specialized skills have lagged behind, and increasing urbanization calls for real estate development in the main cities. It is like the country is starting anew, with all the other components that are enablers for an environment conducive to investment.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy over 2014?</h4><p>Investments in gas, mineral and infrastructures should tilt growth to the upside to post a growth rate of 8.0% in 2014 after a moderate deceleration in 2013 (7.0%) due to the impact of floods that caused damage to infrastructure and disrupted agricultural production in early 2013. The country's growth follows a typical path experienced by countries with resource booms entailing huge imports of equipment and a concomitant current account deficit. The current account deficit was 36% of GDP in 2012 and could hike to 40% in 2014. Nevertheless, it is necessary to underscore that the deficit is funded by FDI flows that are based on the economy's fundamentals with a long-term perspective, unlike the short-term carry-trade based flows in search of high-yield currency profits, which could pose a risk of reversal. On the fiscal front, government revenues have been on the rise, at the same time that developments in infrastructure could put more pressure on government expenditures, raising the need for more non-concessional debt (the current cap of $1.5 billion by the IMF may have to be raised, as massive investments are in the pipeline). In a nutshell, and apart from some political noise, I see the country continuing with a steady growth path at an average of 8% over the 2014-2016 period, with an inflation rate tamed to below double digits, a fiscal deficit below 7.0% of GDP, a steady FDI flow to finance the current account deficit, increasing urbanization, the surge of a new middle-class, and the subsequent diversification of the economic base.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nasser Bin Khaled (NBK) Holding has been one of Qatar's most accomplished and entrepreneurial companies over the past 60 years. What strategies and vision have contributed to this success?</h4><p>From the very outset, NBK Holding has been as much about supporting Qatari society as it has been about business and entrepreneurship. I believe that this, more than anything else, has been responsible for our long-term success. We have capitalized efficiently on our business advantages, too. We had the first-mover advantage in many of the industries we entered because NBK's corporate leadership has made it a priority to spot opportunities early and foray into new markets. Then there's the fact that the NBK brand has always been recognized for outstanding customer service across all subsidiaries. Even today, we understand that our future successes will only be possible with the support of the people and the loyalty of our Qatari and expatriate clientele. That's why we continue to make it a corporate priority to support the people, in particular the youth of the nation.</p><h4>The GCC's automobile sector is seeing double-digit growth and Qatar is no exception. How will you meet this heavy demand going forward?</h4><p>Our projections do indeed show strong growth in the automobile sector in the years to come. We have constantly been working to ramp up our operations on the automotive front, with a planned multi-phase program already underway to stay ahead of demand. One of the crucial areas for us is after-sales service, because it is a key driver of customer satisfaction. When customers purchase a Mercedes-Benz, a Mitsubishi, or one of our more specialized offerings, they expect and deserve the efficient and hassle-free aftersales experience that they have come to expect from NBK brands. So, on the one hand we are actively increasing capacity, while on the other planning new and bigger aftersales centers to serve the market adequately and keep our customers satisfied.</p><div class="quote">“We are very happy to be leading the charge toward a diversified, knowledge-based Qatari economy."</div><h4>How will your construction, real estate, and tourism businesses take advantage of the opportunities offered by the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is a huge triumph for Qatar on the world stage, and I believe it to be an equally big opportunity for Qatari businesses. I see it as the collective responsibility of the business community to represent Qatar well when the world's eyes are on us. It is self-evident that as we approach the date there will be a sharp increase in demand for a wide range of real estate and tourism services, and NBK is poised to take advantage. We are already working on strategic long-term initiatives to prepare NBK Contracting Companies, NBK Real Estate, and NBK Travel &amp; Tourism for the inevitable spike in demand in the years to come. From my perspective however, the opportunity goes far beyond 2022. The advances and improvements that we make with the World Cup in mind will serve as an excellent launch pad for growth in future years as Qatar continues to become a global force to be reckoned with.</p><h4>Together, NBK's lines of business cover many sectors of the economy. Where do you expect to see the strongest growth over the coming years?</h4><p>With Qatar's economy showing excellent growth year after year, I'm happy to say that we expect all areas of our business to post strong numbers in the foreseeable future. With planned increases in the population of the skilled expatriate workforce, I see plenty of business opportunities all around. That being said, I am confident that our core automotive businesses will continue to show robust growth. Real estate and construction are expected to be equally strong performers, thanks to the many building and infrastructure projects in the pipeline. And with Qatar Tourism Authority taking steps to enhance Brand Qatar on the world stage, I believe many new opportunities will open up in the travel and tourism sector very soon.</p><h4>NBK has been a well-diversified holding company since early in its history. How do its ambitions contribute to the diversification of Qatar's economy?</h4><p>NBK is a proud Qatari company and our long-term plans have always been aligned with the vision of the nation's leadership for a strong, sustainable economy. Increasingly, the focus of the government has been shifting toward developing the non-hydrocarbon sector, which has set up a happy cyclical synergy for NBK Holding. On the one hand, our extensive non-hydrocarbon businesses have benefited from conducive government policies; and on the other, our diversified business portfolio is representative of exactly what the government has been trying to achieve. Going into the future, NBK's ambitions remain firmly rooted in the non-oil and gas sectors. We are very happy to be leading the charge toward a diversified, knowledge-based Qatari economy that our leaders have envisioned.</p><h4>Going forward toward 2030, how will NBK grow with Qatar towards the National Vision?</h4><p>Under the wise leadership of HH the Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar has been set upon a course of growth and progress. Qatar National Vision 2030 unites us all with a common purpose and hope for the future of our nation. At NBK, every important decision we take for the future is held up to the National Vision 2030 before being implemented. By the very act of enterprise we contribute to the economic pillar of the vision. Having always been a people and society centric organization, our philosophy is naturally aligned with the social and human development pillars. Last but not least, NBK has always been very conscientious about leaving a happy, healthy planet for future generations, which is also the environmental development pillar of QNV 2030. The values of NBK Holding have always been deeply rooted in Qatari society and culture. Even as we continue to expand our operations and grow as an organization toward 2030 and beyond, this key facet of our identity will always remain true.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the creation of Corporación Maresa in Ecuador, and how has the group evolved since?</h4><p>The Maresa Group started its operations with Maresa, an assembling company, over 35 years ago. We started assembling Mack trucks, and over the years incorporated other clients and products, such as Fiat and its vehicles and trucks, as well as Mitsubishi, Mazda, Toyota, and Ford, some of which we no longer work with. However, the success story behind our group shows that, thanks to our evolution, we established other business divisions like leasing for Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and the automotive division, in which we have constantly grown our clients' portfolio. Our main objective has been to widen our business activity in order to cover all the market's needs and demand, both product- and service-wise. Today, we are the official distributor for Fiat, Chrysler, and Mazda nationwide, and for Ford on the coast and in eastern Ecuador. For the other brands we work with, we mostly perform specific distribution or commercialization activities. In terms of percentages, we distribute 35% of Mazda vehicles and 100% of Fiat and Chrysler vehicles.</p><h4>What specific role does each of these brands play in your global activity?</h4><p>Currently, Mazda plays the most important role in our group's activities, as we have long managed its operations in Ecuador. For example, Chrysler and Fiat have been with us since 2012, and, therefore, their weight in our overall activities is rather low, especially because they are subject to import quotas established by the government. However, our main goal for the near future is to consolidate their activities and brands in the market, while we expect the authorities to lift the import quota.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategy in the distribution segment is to become as multi-brand as possible."</div><h4>What is the company's growth strategy?</h4><p>Our strategy in the distribution segment is to become as multi-brand as possible, in order to cater to the market with different products. Regarding the assembling business line, we aim to operate at full capacity in the near future. With Mazda, for example, we assemble vehicles that are locally sold, and also export to Venezuela; however, we do not operate at 100% capacity. In this context, we want to close a partnership deal with another automotive brand to start assembling its vehicles at our plant and then try to operate at full capacity. Among our top priorities is the consolidation of our companies' mission to meet consumer needs. For that reason, we need to further strengthen our post-sales services. Maresa Group was established with that purpose; to serve the needs and demands of consumers while bringing together the wide portfolio of brands we represent. We also expect to close partnership agreements with other related companies in the industry, such as insurance companies or banks, which would enable us to offer a comprehensive package of services to our clients. Such a step would enable us to generate further value-added for our services, and the brand in general, in the consumer's eye. We would also like to increase the segments in which we operate in Ecuador, such as low-price cars.</p><h4>What role do exports play in your distribution activity?</h4><p>Last year, we assembled 12,000 vehicles, 5,000 of which were exported to Venezuela. In this regard, we are open to looking at export activities to neighboring countries; with Mazda, the activity is solely focused on Venezuela. Maresa also operates in Colombia and Peru, though this activity is purely focused on the leasing division of our business. Currently, our leasing division represents 10% of our overall activity, whereas the automotive assembly and distribution division represents 90%.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Maresa Group as compared to its main competitors?</h4><p>We are the only company offering the multi-brand business concept to its clients under the Maresa Group umbrella. We complement this with our capacity, training, and post-sales services.</p><h4>What is the company's expected turnover for 2013?</h4><p>We aim at closing the year with a $350 million Group turnover. If we break down the figure into national and international operations, I could tell you that, nationally, we will close the year with similar figures to 2012, as we must keep in mind the so-called import quotas, which pose a barrier to our growth in the domestic market. For that reason, exports and rental activities are driving the Group's growth today. In this context, the size of the Ecuadorean automotive market stands at around 145,000 units per year, and, right now, supply in the automotive industry cannot meet demand, especially because of the quotas.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for Agility Lebanon over the past two years?</h4><p>In terms of development, the recent economic situation that the country and the region have experienced, as well as the war in Syria, has significantly affected us. The company and the logistics sector as a whole are involved in various industries as clients. They range from food and machinery to heavy industry and pharmaceutical companies; we have highly diversified our logistical operations. Aside from warehousing, we also offer ocean freight, airfreight, and overland transportation services. Land freight has definitely been negatively impacted by the events in Syria over the past two years. And while we have clearance at all borders, ports, and airports, as well as having warehousing and local distribution networks, all of these were affected to some extent. Some transportation modes, such as ocean freight, increased dramatically due to the difficulties experienced with land freight. On the warehousing side, at the beginning of 2013, business volume was somewhat lower than usual, although demand has subsequently increased in 2Q2013. At the beginning of 2013, we signed a 17-year lease contract for a large state-of-the-art warehouse, in a deal valued over $25 million. This was one of our major developments and investments. The space we are talking about has a capacity of around 45,000 cubic meters. Even though our current occupancy rate is 110% of our present capacity, we are the biggest in Lebanon in terms of warehousing and we have increased our capacity by 35%, which is high for a country such as Lebanon. We perceive this as a prudent move given how we perceive our partners and clients in the market. We view our clients as partners.</p><h4>How would you classify your fleet?</h4><p>It is a mix. We have frozen, chilled, and dry vehicles that cover more than 6,000 points of sale in Lebanon. There is basically no area we don't go to, regardless of the client size. We deliver to small market shops as well as to hypermarkets and five-stars hotels.</p><div class="quote">“There is basically no area we don't go to, regardless of the client size."</div><h4>What sectors represent the greatest growth potential for Agility Lebanon?</h4><p>There is definitely always potential in food, which is continuously growing. In contrast, we haven't seen much growth in electronics over the past two years, and we assume more of the same for the near future. This is the feedback that we are receiving both from our clients and the market.</p><h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of Lebanon's logistics sector?</h4><p>A major weakness is the lack of proper infrastructure. We also suffer from endemic irregularity. The latter, however, is also the case throughout the region and elsewhere in the world. If the rate is at 5%, it is manageable, but if it is a 105%, it is not acceptable and, unfortunately, this is precisely the case here. Every country has some degree of corruption, but in Lebanon unfortunately you cannot move unless you know somebody, who knows somebody else. We suffer because, as a global company, we have to comply with and cater to all these means, while following the letter of the law ourselves. This means that it sometimes takes us a little longer to deliver than others.</p><h4>What can be done to improve the logistics sector?</h4><p>It must be privatized. Our expectation of what the government can do to help, or support us, is very low. This preference not to count on any government help underpins our success. And while we do meet with the administration, it is merely a political formality, and obligation. Whenever we talk about infrastructure, we look ahead to a more advanced country and compare ourselves to it. We could achieve this, but any progress is indexed to the ministries, government, and corruption levels. Unless someone invests billions of their own money, we cannot get any contracts.</p><h4>What are your most frequent inbound routes?</h4><p>We are largely an import country. For every 100 shipments, we export about five or 10. There is a small percentage of imports that is then re-exported. There is definitely a part of the wine and the food sectors that we export to, as well as small industries. We have many import routes mainly from Italy in this regard. In the EU, the top three countries are Germany, Italy, and France. In Asia, it is China. This is where our focus is: Europe, Asia, and then the US. The rest of the world does feature, but the numbers are smaller.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Stay on Target]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[stay-on-target]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your personal background and how did the company come to Oman?</h4><p>We started Takamul as an initiative within Oman Oil Company (OOC) in 2006, and shortly afterward we began mapping out our business plan and targets, examining the raw materials available, exploring the market for downstream opportunities, and assessing the technology. We started our work with four people, and now we have close to 50. Takamul Investment Company was first incorporated in July 2008 with OMR10 million of paid out capital, and the figure has reached OMR100 million despite the financial crisis. We are a good example of the economic stability in Oman. We are entirely invested in the market—profitable and doing well. The company is competing, creating opportunities and new employment, and attracting investment and loans from local banks.</p><h4>How has your focus evolved?</h4><p>We began by seizing opportunities downstream from the aluminum mill and Oman Polypropylene, which is now part of ORPIC. Then, we considered opportunities at the refineries in Sohar and Muscat. We identified a number of projects that could be potential investments for us; our criteria were that they should be feasible, sustainable, and job creating. We want this activity to be integrated within the existing industries in an economically, financially, and environmentally sustainable way. We are working to create employment and a synergy with SMEs. Our focus was on raw material availability and we created industries for export. We then started targeting the local market for import replacement, and, thus, entered the service industry. Until then, many services were imported from outside, and knowledge and know-how were not retained in Oman. One industry that is commissioned regionally is the manufacture of galvanized steel wire. That is one project where the raw material is not available today, but the market is. We feel that 60% of that project could be supplied locally or regionally by Oman, the UAE, and Qatar.</p><div class="quote">“Oman does not require much advertisement when it comes to potential investment opportunities."</div><h4>How important has Duqm been for your development?</h4><p>Considering how Sohar has developed to the point of saturation, we need to begin thinking about another area. Beyond Sohar, we are exploring new areas for future growth. There is huge potential for growth in Sohar, but on the long-term horizon, we need to establish a new area for growth and Duqm is the right place to do it. Taking into consideration our interest to leverage further on the strategic location of Oman on the open sea, we feel Duqm could also provide a more competitive advantage for large industries to allow for better-positioned import and export activities. Being a greenfield area, Duqm will allow us to expand much further away from existing residential zones.</p><h4>What characterizes the sea intake system you are constructing in Duqm?</h4><p>Our experience in Sohar guided us to take control of the sea intake system from an early stage, where initially the government had taken responsibility for the development of the project. We are in discussions with the refinery, the government, and the authority to plan better for the seawater intake. Originally, we lacked a central focal point in Sohar for the provision of utilities—we scrambled to find investors arriving in Sohar who could offer telecoms, electricity, and water. There was no one-stop shop for utilities. In Duqm, we are working to plan and develop the corridors and the utilities in order to attract industrial companies and make life simpler. Specifically, we have targeted the steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, and refining clusters. The fisheries segment is another sector that has yet to be developed, so there are six clusters planned in Duqm. We would like to lead the discussion on the development of utilities for these industrial sectors. The provision of utilities is a long-term plan that requires large, advanced capital investment.</p><h4>What time frame do you have in mind for investment?</h4><p>When Takamul was initially created, we were not aiming to compete with local industries or investors. We were created to leverage and add value to the sector. We try to utilize the maximum amount of Omani workforce resources for operating and managing our plants. In the final stage of our investment, we divest part or all of our interest directly or indirectly to all of these industries. In collaboration with our shareholders, we are implementing a number of projects that have passed the development and construction phases and are entering the operational phase. The company is seeking to work with financial advisers to start divesting. That would most likely be carried out through private placement (pension funds) or an IPO. These will be part of the studies we are completing in the near future.</p><h4>How do you attract investment to Oman?</h4><p>To be honest, Oman does not require much advertisement when it comes to potential investment opportunities. Many people come and talk to us directly, and we partner with them on projects in Oman. We have received a huge amount of feedback for opportunities through local banks and government and consulting agencies, whether the work is financial or legal. These opportunities are usually created by international investors who have a business plan to invest in the region and are aiming to find the best place and partner. Another way we participate is by creating an idea and the investment opportunity. We identify an opportunity, develop it, then target the players in that industry globally. We focus mostly on technology or know-how, not specific countries. We are looking to attract long-term investments that are technically and economically feasible.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the downstream industry in Oman and its role in developing the economy?</h4><p>I see the government as a whole putting more effort into supporting the downstream segment. Downstream is more focused on SMEs, and the government is putting huge effort into developing these areas. The challenges we are facing will hopefully be resolved. The competitive advantage is that we are more technology-oriented, closer to customers, and more labor-intensive. Somehow, we need to come up with a structure to ensure that whatever SMEs and downstream industries we create here, we can combine them competitively in Oman.</p><h4>What is your vision for the next five years?</h4><p>Over the next five years, we will continue adjusting our targets. We base our strategy and vision on the past, and that means that we sometimes make mistakes. I know we are going to develop a number of projects in Duqm, but some of the projects we have carried out in the past six years were not even on our road map. As a target, I'd like the company to be twice as large as it is today in five years. If we were able to grow our capital by OMR100 million in five years during the economic crisis, our rate of progress should be easily tripled during the current economic boom.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the DCAA within the economy of Dubai, and the tourism and transport sectors?</h4><p>The DCAA is mandated by Law No 22/2007, as amended by Law No. 19 of 2010, to define the general policy of civil aviation in the Emirate of Dubai, manage civil aviation operations to secure aero-political rights for the designated airlines in the Emirate, and their implementation. Through the above functions and powers, the DCAA works toward achieving a safe and efficient air transport framework within Dubai, connecting it to the global network and facilitating and sustaining the growth of the local economy. The success of Dubai's aviation industry has a direct impact on the Emirate. It contributes around 28% of its GDP. The DCAA also coordinates with the other transport sectors and the tourism industry. The tourism industry goes hand-in-hand with air transport. While not directly visible as such, there is an indirect contribution of our role in the tourism sector. Multi-mode transportation in the cargo industry is prominent. However, compared to the growth of passenger air transport, there does not seem to be an equally great demand for multi-modal passenger transportation. The DCAA provides leadership in monitoring the implementation of the Dubai Aviation Sector Strategy to ensure that Dubai becomes the aviation capital of the world.</p><h4>How will the Dubai's vision to further develop the infrastructure, in combination with the World Expo 2020 bid, impact Dubai's aviation industry?</h4><p>Upgrades to Terminal 3 and the development of Al Maktoum International Airport (AMIA) are being carried out pursuant to the Master Plan 2020, which is designed to meet a projected demand of 115 million passengers and 570,000 aircraft movements per annum. The success of Dubai 'sairlines in providing global connectivity, and the demand to be created by World Expo 2020, have prompted the authorities to revise the strategic plans extending to 2045, and further develop infrastructure to facilitate growth. Through this process, we also contribute to the development of the aviation infrastructure for the benefit of the global aviation industry and the traveling public.</p><div class="quote">“The exponential growth of passenger numbers, coupled with air traffic movements, pose a serious challenge to the aviation industry."</div><h4>How do the main airlines operating from Dubai cooperate to improve in terms of efficiency and the sustainability of the sector?</h4><p>Airlines as stakeholders will have their individual needs and concerns. The main airlines that operate out of Dubai are those designated by the Emirate to conduct international air transport. Their needs and concerns require projection in a strategic plan. Indeed, output would be meaningless without their participation. We have developed a shared understanding to formulate our policies in order to achieve the best results. Although our role differs from those operating out of Dubai and coming into it, we are committed to equally facilitating the airlines that are operating into Dubai.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges Dubai's aviation industry faces?</h4><p>The exponential growth of passenger numbers, coupled with air traffic movements, pose a serious challenge to the aviation industry in terms of capacity on the ground and in the air. They are adequately addressed separately by infrastructure development bodies and through the negotiation of airspace structure enhancement.</p><h4>What needs to be built in order to facilitate development and maintain the open skies policy?</h4><p>The Strategic Plan 2020 is designed to support the expansion of Dubai International so as to meet envisaged demand growth. Approximately $8 billion in investment has been made to continue infrastructure development, which will respond to the 10-year traffic forecast. The development plan includes the expansion of Terminal 2. The construction of Concourse 3 has already concluded and it is in operation. The construction of Concourse D, which will be connected to Terminal 1, is also in progress. Furthermore, an additional 30,000 sqm of cargo space will be built. Upon the completion of the ongoing projects, Dubai International will have the capacity to handle 90 million passengers. Eventually, AMIA will be developed as a second hub to accommodate 160 million extra passengers.</p><h4>What are the major achievements that DCAA has reached in regulating civil aviation and providing an adequate regulatory framework?</h4><p>Dubai does not believe in an over-regulated industry. We adhere to the international standards and recommended practices of the ICAO, the aviation law, and the regulations of the federal government. We implement these, and also ensure stakeholder compliance. The framework established for a safe and secure air transport industry, compared to the number and volume of the movements of aircraft, passengers, and cargo within the Emirate itself is a major achievement. We also ensure that the industry functions with due regard to the environment.</p><h4>How do you orchestrate your policies in response to diverse requests for landing and operations in Dubai?</h4><p>Our policy includes the provision of excellent services to our customers. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, recently announced an innovative concept of “m-government" (mobile government), which transforms the e-government process to mobile. HH Sheikh Mohammed also directed federal and local government entities to implement the concept within a period of two years with a view to providing an efficient and excellent service to customers. Currently, we handle scheduled and ad—hoc operations through a 24/7 service and several other approval processes using the e-government system. We will be transforming the current processes to the m-government environment in the near future, keeping in line with the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed, and to enhance our customer-friendly service further.</p><h4>What relationship do you maintain with other local aviation authorities and government entities?</h4><p>We have an excellent relationship with the other emirates and the federal authorities. DCAA and the Dubai Travel and Tour Agents Group (DTTAG) recently signed an MoU to cooperate with travel business activities within Dubai.</p><h4>What common actions do you aim to take to facilitate the development of the tourism industry?</h4><p>We place importance on education and the development of leadership skills for the local community. This will ensure a productive, well-educated workforce in the tourism industry capable of contributing to the growth of the aviation industry in Dubai, and also have a significant impact on potential students, families, schools, and the broader community.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>New extraction technologies have flushed regional markets with natural gas. What is RasGas' strategy for dealing with this reality?</h4><p>RasGas' long-term strategic vision, since its inception in 1993, has enabled it to become a major LNG supplier to the world. Over the past 20 years, we have demonstrated that reliability, deliverability, and flexibility are our key strengths that have set us apart. We have invested, through our major shareholders, Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corporation, in the full LNG value chain ranging from some of the world's largest LNG production trains to managing 27 efficient LNG vessels and constructing world-class terminals around the world. This allows us to reliably and efficiently transport and deliver clean energy to the world. Since our first delivery to South Korea in 1999, RasGas has come to produce and sell nearly half of Qatar's total LNG production to markets all across the globe, whilst also producing significant amounts of pipeline gas and associated products. RasGas also remains focused on expanding its wider business portfolio through the production of petrochemical liquid feedstock, helium, and pipeline sales gas for national and regional use. The construction of the $10.3 billion Barzan Gas Project will help to support Qatar's growing energy requirement and provide an incremental 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of dry gas, as well as associated products starting in 2014. Once the two trains come online, RasGas will be producing around 11 billion standard cubic feet (bscf) per day, making us one of the largest gas producers in the world.</p><h4>How does RasGas address sustainability concerns, and how do your sustainability reports help the company achieve its goals?</h4><p>At RasGas, we believe that sustainable practices and business success are inseparable. In 2009, RasGas became the first energy company in Qatar to voluntarily report on its sustainability performance relating to business, environmental and social issues, which is aligned with the four pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV 20130). Our annual sustainability reports demonstrate our commitment to accountability and transparency in our business practices, as well as keeping us focused on excellence in safety, production, and in making a valuable contribution to the community. It provides us an opportunity to review our business and operations, and remain accountable for our resources. In 2013, we issued our fourth sustainability report and the company received the top accolade for large-scale organisation for its 2012 Sustainability Report at the Excellence in Sustainability Reporting Awards ceremony held by QP. The RasGas Sustainability Report for 2012 has improved on previous reports both in content and presentation by expanding its coverage and being available online in both English and Arabic to reach a wider audience. It takes account of sustainability reporting guidance specific to the oil and gas industry prepared by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The report benchmarks us with our international competitors and demonstrates that we are world-market leaders in sustainability. In 2012, RasGas launched its second five-year flare minimization program, which is set to continue the trend of downward CO2 emissions, ultimately targeting a 90% reduction from the flaring levels of 2005. RasGas also continues to maintain a safe working environment for its employees and contractors. As of December 2013, the company's venture group had completed a record 100 million man-hours without Lost Time Incident (LTI). RasGas is consistently ranked among the best performers when compared with 20 of the largest companies in the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers' (OGP) safety performance benchmarking report. In 2012, RasGas was the safest company in the upstream industry.</p><div class="quote">“RasGas' long-term strategic vision, since its inception in 1993, has enabled it to become a major LNG supplier to the world."</div><h4>RasGas is responsible for 25% of the world's Helium production, a gas whose inertness, low density, and solubility make it useful across many sectors. How is RasGas preparing for what will likely be increased helium prices and potentially a large drop in supply?</h4><p>RasGas does not speculate on price increases, as there are many factors involved in the global pricing market. Our second helium plant, Helium 2, started production in June 2013. Together with Helium 1, built in 2005, RasGas has a combined annual production of approximately 2 bscf per day and will meet around 25% of current total liquid helium global demand. This also makes Qatar the world's largest helium refining facility and the largest exporter and second largest producer of helium in the world. RasGas has off-take agreements with Air Liquide, Iwatani Corporation, and Linde Gases, a Linde Group division. Air Liquide will receive 50%, Linde Gases 30%, and the Iwatani Corporation 20% of our annual liquid helium production up until 2032.</p><h4>In early 2013, Carnegie Mellon Qatar and RasGas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that paved the way for mutually beneficial initiatives and projects that include providing resources and training for students at Carnegie Mellon. What else is RasGas doing to invest in education?</h4><p>Education is the key to sustainability and RasGas' liaison with the education sector is pivotal to ensuring the long-term viability of our Qatarization strategy. As such, we have built numerous long-standing relationships with many educational establishments, such as Qatar University, Texas, A&amp;M University-Qatar, Virginia Commonwealth University-Qatar, and most recently CMU-Q. RasGas provides financial and technical support to a number of university programs that seek to encourage young people to pursue technical or science-based careers. These include support or the Life is Engineering program in collaboration with the Faculty of Engineering at Qatar University, supported by RasGas volunteers. Additionally, we have signed a platinum sponsorship agreement worth $350,000 with Qatar University in support of the Al-Bairaq program, which is designed to generate interest in scientific, experimental, and research skills among high school students in Qatar. We also work directly with high schools; for example, RasGas' Safety Ambassadors program stimulates interest in occupational health and safety as a career for young students in Qatar. This program not only nurtures and develops safety and health awareness as a necessary life skill, but it also builds a foundation for creating a reservoir of talent for the future oil and gas sector. Additionally, RasGas awards scholarships to high school and university students to continue their education locally or internationally for qualifications ranging from diploma programs to Bachelor and Master's degrees. In the summer months, we have a robust internship program that offers students an early introduction to the work environment where they are assigned RasGas mentors. It allows us to participate in the process of training students while they are still at university. This in turn supports our recruitment drive. In 2012, RasGas was awarded the Qatarization Crystal Award in recognition of its support and active education initiatives as part of its Qatarization strategy.</p><h4>How do RasGas' long-term goals align with Qatar's 2030 Vision?</h4><p>As a good corporate citizen and respectful member of the Qatari community, RasGas' 5 year strategic plan, goals and objectives are established in alignment with Qatar's National Vision (QNV) 2030. The strategic choices, which serve as the core of our strategy, revolve around the four pillars of QNV 2030 (Safety, Health and Environment, People, Reliability and Deliverability). To promote sustainable prosperity, we consistently enhance our reliability and deliverability of gas from reservoir to delivery point. For the human development pillar, we are committed to developing Qatari nationals into employees to strengthen the national workforce and optimize the skill mix. To contribute to an integrated approach to sound social development, RasGas implements several effective Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives within the community. To ensure environmental sustainability for future generations, RasGas strictly obeys the regulations enforced by Ministry of Environment and pursues strict initiatives to use energy and national resources efficiently and reduce waste and emissions.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the Colombian economy?</h4><p>Currently, our main economic partners, namely the US and Europe, are growing very slowly. In addition, with regard to commodities, we observe that China, despite impressive growth in recent years, has seen its economy grow at lower rates than before. However, we should highlight that one of the commodity prices that has remained pretty stable is that of oil, which is one of the most important ones for our economy. This global economic context has had a negative impact on our economy; nevertheless, it has been expanding at a moderate pace of 3.5%-4%. We are optimistic that positive economic prospects for 2014 at an international level will give us a further boost, as rising demand in markets such as the US and Europe will allow us to take advantage of recently signed free trade agreements (FTAs).</p><h4>What role does FNG play in generating further economic activity among SMEs in Colombia?</h4><p>We have been a key economic agent for SMEs in Colombia for the past 10 to 12 years, providing financing tools to such companies. We have to keep in mind that a decade ago, credit lines for SMEs in our country were rather restricted, and we have worked with financial institutions in order to open new financing possibilities for these companies. In general terms, I can say that micro and small companies in the country are the main users of our guarantees, given that medium-sized companies tend to have easier access to credit from financial institutions. For example, in 2012 we issued guarantees for over 500,000 credits that amounted to around $4.5 billion. New technologies play a major role in our activities, as we have a rather small workforce of 109 people who manage a large volume of operations. This is only made possible by technology.</p><div class="quote">“We have been a key economic agent for SMEs in Colombia for the past 10 to 12 years."</div><h4>In which sectors are your clients most active?</h4><p>They basically come from all the economic sectors, with the exception of agriculture, a sector that has its own institution for the same purposes, the Agricultural Guarantee Fund (FAG). Our clients come from sectors such as commerce, services, industry, tourism, construction, small-scale mining, transport, and some agribusiness, a sector that already implies some industrial engagement.</p><h4>Which trends do you see in the development of the national economy?</h4><p>From our own statistics, it is difficult to guess, since we serve a segment the output of which is mostly focused either on generating sufficient economic income to make a living or on generating profits in traditional activities (rather low on technology or innovation). For this reason, we do not identify special trends in the segments in which we work; however, from a broader perspective, we believe that the most interesting growth is taking place in the sectors that are being promoted under the Programa de Transformación Productiva, which has been developed by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism.</p><h4>What's the impact and significance of your Colombia Exporta program?</h4><p>We believe it has been a very useful program for companies, allocating guarantees worth approximately $50 million. These guarantees are only for loans aimed at improving companies' productivity, such as the purchase of fixed assets. I only wish we had additional funding resources in order to extend the program's duration, as this has proved to be a very successful tool for the modernization of Colombian SMEs, as well as their competitiveness.</p><h4>What is your take on the housing market?</h4><p>Our institution was established in 1982 to support small enterprises in Colombia. In around 2003, the government decided to boost the expansion of social housing, and we were directed to step into that particular segment by providing guarantees to people who wanted to purchase these housing units. Ever since then we have focused on the lower end of the market and the Vivienda de Interes Prioritario program. Nevertheless, our participation in this segment is rather limited: it only represents 3% of our overall activity, whereas the remaining 97% is business activity. From 2014, we will also most likely have subsidies available through a special program in cooperation with the Ministry of Housing called “86,000 housing units," so that the cost of our guarantees will be covered by the government, rather than being paid for by the borrower. Also, this program has other types of subsidies and economic support for people making use of it. For example, it provides economic support to cover the down payment, and the interest rate on the loan will be below market levels.</p><h4>What are the general requirements when applying for guarantees from FNG?</h4><p>It is very easy, actually. If you are an SME that would be entitled to obtain a bank loan, you simply have to comply with the bank's requirements. In fact, banks have the last word on whether to grant guarantees within a maximum amount assigned by FNG to each institution. The whole process is done over the internet between the bank and FNG and the SME does not have to do any paperwork.</p><h4>Which groups are you targeting specifically?</h4><p>We mainly target banks, because we believe that by doing so we can facilitate access to credit for many people. Basically, we meet with bank branch directors to talk them into granting loans to SMEs with FNG guarantees. We know that they have the last word, and we want to influence them positively since each of them has a potential multiplier effect in granting access to credit for many SMEs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>In 2013 we are going to guarantee loans in excess of $5 billion. In terms of future prospects, FNG has been growing along with SMEs in Colombia and the dynamic is working well. In this context, we believe the future is brighter, because these types of enterprises are set to play an even bigger role in the national economy.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the Colombian economy in the coming years?</h4><p>I would say that we will close 2013 on around 4% growth, but that this figure should improve in 2014. In the longer term, I foresee a sustained growth scenario for the national economy. In order to meet our real potential, I think we must keep investing in infrastructure and also invest more in innovation, as I consider these two of our weakest points today. We have made significant progress over the past few years regarding the business environment, but more must be done.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the basis of your success as a company?</h4><p>The most important component underpinning Estafeta's success is innovation and the search for new offerings to bring to our customers. Some time ago, we were the first company to use tracing and tracking in Mexico. We were the first to offer an overnight service in Mexico via air and also, during the economic crisis, we started to provide freight tracking services with the quality of a courier company. This ensured definitive delivery times, as well as tracing and tracking that other companies could not match. Lately, we have begun to offer a mobile platform for the iPhone and BlackBerry. There are similar services in other countries, but we operate the best one in Mexico, allowing our clients to track and trace their parcels and contact the call center directly to make a claim in the event of a problem. In 2013, we launched a platform for e-commerce, which provides a store for our clients to sell their products online. We realized that many of our clients wanted to sell online, but didn't know how to do so. They would set up a webpage, but lack the appropriate payment facilities, which actually can be complicated for small companies. This platform was designed precisely for such small organizations to enable online sales nationwide. The second step is to widen our service to the US. Surprisingly, large companies are contacting us for this service, too.</p><h4>What challenges exist to expanding e-commerce?</h4><p>E-commerce is quite young in Mexico, and is growing slowly. One reason for this is the culture; you have to learn to use e-commerce. For example, people do not want to leave their credit card data online out of concerns about fraud. There are many other considerations in e-commerce; collecting at the consignee's door is very complicated because the driver has to carry change, for example. It's very important to offer a range of payment options, but we do offer a lot of options, including at convenience stores. The customer makes a purchase online, receives a barcode, and takes that to a shop to make the payment, at which point the parcel is sent. This is a working solution for Mexico that no one else has. One aspect of e-commerce in Mexico is the payment and culture of credit cards; the other is the limited volume of credit cards. Brazil has five times more credit cards in circulation. In Mexico, there is a per capita rate of 0.2, while in Brazil it is one and in the US it is three or more. We observe that among those using the internet, about 50% say they don't buy online because of the lack of a credit card.</p><div class="quote">“I don't think Mexico has yet understood the potential that its location offers. "</div><h4>How does your 24-hour delivery service to the US and Canada work?</h4><p>For us, it was more a case of playing catch up with our competition. UPS and Fedex are very strong in this area, so we simply had to offer this service. I think we now offer a very similar quality service. You have to think about who your target customers are. Estafeta is a very effective company for domestic distribution if you work within Mexico. For lots of foreign companies we manage literally everything from sales to imports, warehousing, and distribution. Sales can be done over the internet, so foreign companies do not need extensive infrastructure to sell in Mexico.</p><h4>What is the main focus of your investment?</h4><p>The biggest investment has been in the distribution fleet, with a strong investment also made in technology. For Estafeta, it is very important to distribute with its own equipment. That gives us the security of delivering a high-quality service and sustain a respectable corporate image, as represented by our drivers in our uniform, trained by us. Our competition outsources many of their services to third-party transportation companies. Our quality control is thus an advantage that we deliver. In regard to technology, Estafeta offers a quick and easy integration of information. We deliver packages of data on the client's shipments, which the client can use on his or her applications. Estafeta's IT systems perform these integrations faster than our competitors. Other useful data includes pricing, postal codes, and shipping guarantees. Moreover, the client need not see the Estafeta logo because their customers do not have to switch pages any more to track their packages.</p><h4>Where are the forthcoming opportunities for Estafeta?</h4><p>In logistics, our warehousing side will grow 30% over 2013. It is very important to offer an integrated solution; a one-stop-shop for our clients so that they can have all their logistics needs met by us. The idea is to offer a complete package, and is why we added this business to our product portfolio. Nowadays, we see a huge opportunity that is outgrowing both the economy and Estafeta itself. Our competitors are transnational entities and offer these services, but they cannot offer parcel distribution in Mexico.</p><h4>How can Mexico take advantage of its logistics potential?</h4><p>I don't think Mexico has yet understood the potential that its location offers. Mexico, being a neighbor of the biggest market in the world, should use this opportunity much more. Transportation is key. The main hub for distribution if you look at airfreight, nowadays, is Miami for the Americas. I believe that Mexico should play a much more important role in that. This really requires a governmental initiative. Other Central American countries, like Panama, already do this. Of course that country boasts the Panama Canal, but the government has also invested in modern airports. Mexico needs to move forward in this respect.</p><h4>What impact has airfreight growth on your operations?</h4><p>What we would like to see is an expansion of airport infrastructure. Larger aircraft should be coming to Mexico, but are going to the US instead. You have a situation of freight going down by truck, while Laredo airport in the US moves more airfreight than Mexico City. All freight going there or to El Paso is destined for Mexico, but is currently trucked down. The growth of airfreight today without infrastructure is very limited. For the airlines over 2013, growth has been at 4%-5%, but it is much more about how you manage prices; it is not a question of capacity. At the moment, we are not acquiring many aircraft, for example. It is not about more airports; what Mexico needs is more infrastructure and larger aircraft and airports designed for airfreight, not just passengers.</p><h4>What is your forecast for 2013 and 2014?</h4><p>Overall, 2013 was much more difficult due to slower-than-expected economic growth. GDP growth was projected at 3.8%; however, currently it is below 2%. Estafeta, in 2013, anticipates growth of around 6%, but in 2014 I want to see a 10% print.</p><h4>As a leading company, how do you perceive the challenges faced by the sector?</h4><p>I am very positive. The opportunity for transport in Mexico is generally very good; it is a country undergoing development. As people's wealth increases, they consume more, which in turn fuels the entire transport sector. The biggest opportunity, of course, is e-commerce, the growth rate of which in Mexico is over 35% compared to Europe, where it is about 10%. This will help considerably in developing the entire transport sector, but will take perhaps four to five years to be felt.</p><h4>How do you secure the system when you shipping to remote areas?</h4><p>Security remains an issue in Mexico, although we have suffered no significant incidents of theft because we have implemented protocols should the undesirable occur; for example, using GPS technology to locate a missing truck.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The National Hydrocarbons Company (ENH) currently acts as a partner rather than an operator in Mozambican oil and gas concessions. How do you see this changing in the future?</h4><p>The goal of ENH is to become an operator in Mozambique's oil and gas business within 20 to 40 years. Over the course of that period, Mozambique will gain the technology and human resources necessary to take over field operations. Another area of interest is marketing, and we plan to champion the Mozambican marketing of gas.</p><h4>What is ENH doing to facilitate that knowledge transfer?</h4><p>We have 11 concessions in Mozambique, and ENH has shared in each along with international companies. In these joint ventures, there are technical committees that complete the technical review of information. We also have operating committee meetings, which is where all the decisions are made. Looking at the way we are structured, in one concession we have more than one partner—up to three or four. With this amount of interaction we can really learn a lot. In the case of Rovuma, where ENI is the operator, one of the international partners is Kogas, which has extensive experience in LNG as a seller in addition to its shipping business. Its knowledge is being transferred to some entities internally. People from ENI come here and go through the process, and we send people to ENI's technical academy. They get trained there for a year or two and return. With Anadarko, staff get trained in Houston. We have people in Portugal, too, at Galp Energia Academy, which has been heavily involved in Brazil and Angola. We are also looking for experience from all over the world. We ask ourselves: How did Petrobras grow? How did Sonagas get to the level that it is at now? We are learning from those models and are pleased with the progress we are making.</p><h4>How would you compare the way that Mozambique is developing its hydrocarbon reserves to the way it has been done in other countries?</h4><p>We came in early, starting production 10 years ago with just one small field. Today, we have more than 100 tcf of natural gas, which means that we have enough natural resources for four to five generations. This is in contrast to Angola, where Sonagas was given the blocks when 40-year concessions for international companies expired. It started at the end, and had 30 years of production and experience. So the question now is: how do you strategically position yourself to have relevance? The relevance does not come from the resource sitting in the ground, it comes from how it is used. Mozambique is a long, thin country with 2,500 kilometers of coastline. If you build east-west infrastructure, it is easy to connect to the markets of the interior: Malawi, Zambia, and South Africa. These markets will either need energy from Mozambique, or will need natural gas to build their own small industries. Then there is talk of having four LNG trains, which could produce up to 20 million tons a year for international export. For example, Qatar now produces around 47 million tons. We could produce almost 50% of what Qatar is currently managing. A country can become globally and regionally relevant with its resources, and, consequently, access to finance for the country will be better. Agriculture, which is the main driving force of the country's economy, will receive a boost. When you have all these projects, you have people coming in, you have internal needs, and you improve the production of your crops. The sustainable management of resources leads to the economic development of the country.</p><div class="quote">“The goal of ENH is to become an operator in Mozambique's oil and gas business within 20 to 40 years."</div><h4>How do you confront infrastructural challenges in Mozambique?</h4><p>These “challenges" are opportunities for investment and growth. Imagine if Mozambique was well developed; how could you build an east-west pipeline? If you have a market and the necessary resources, the infrastructure will come because it is feasible. We are talking about billions of dollars being invested just to get into the market. All this investment in infrastructure is because you need to get the product to the market; to get the east-west pipeline or the containers to transport is a modest investment. It is not difficult; it is different. If one takes a look at other projects, you can see that someone has already solved the problem. You just need to adapt.</p><h4>What is the current status of the negotiations over the LNG plant?</h4><p>The current status is that the government and the concessionaires are discussing how the project will be implemented. All the technical aspects are being considered between the two parties. An official public announcement will be made, and plans will come after the final investment decision, which we think will happen some time at the end of 2013.</p><h4>How does ENH's involvement ensure that Mozambique is receiving the maximum amount of benefit from the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Firstly, we have to make sure that they do not damage the reservoir so we can extract as much as possible from it. From a management perspective, we have the joint operating committee, and all the rules on how the project has to be run are based on that. We have to approve the investments and all technical aspects of the project, not only in exploration, but also in production. Everything has to be properly financed and we have to check whether the cost of capital is high or low. If it is high, we recommend they look for a new source, for example. We participate in the decision-making process from beginning to end. We also monitor the performance of the companies. Today, we have 11 concessions, and five or six years ago we had only one five or six. We monitor each dollar that the company invests as each one will reflect on our revenues. It is the same with our resources; we monitor the amount of gas we are exploiting. For the international companies it does not probably matter. They recover the investment and that is fine, but we are here and have been for more than one generation, so we have to make sure that we extract the maximum in the optimal way.</p><h4>You are currently working on a project to pipe natural gas to households in Maputo. Do you see downstream playing a bigger role in your portfolio in the future?</h4><p>That will be part of our portfolio, because for natural gas you need the infrastructure. To build the infrastructure we need for this, we use part of the profit we make upstream, as part of our corporate social responsibility, as it is very expensive to invest in this sort of infrastructure. We want to see the natural gas consumed in Mozambique, and to do that we need to invest in infrastructure. We will need part of our upstream revenue to do that. We have an exit strategy for five or 10 years down the line when we will go through the stock exchange and float most of the shares so that some private investors will become involved through the PPP law.</p><h4>What oil company do you want ENH to emulate in the future?</h4><p>It will be the next ENH. In the future, others will look to ENH as a reference. As I mentioned before: either you start at the beginning or you start at the end. Our birth is unique and different from other companies, so others will have to look to ENH as a reference. Then someone will copy the model we have developed. The systems, operations, and management of the company could be comparable with those companies because we have to benchmark those companies if we want to be part of the game; but as a model, ours will be unique.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors lend credibility to Abu Dhabi as an international business hub and destination?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi moved up 134 places in the ICCA ranking in 2013 compared to 2012, placing it among the top-100 busiest global meeting destinations for the first time in its history. That by itself is testament to the potential Abu Dhabi has to offer. We are one of only two cities in the Arabian Gulf to have made it that far. Between us and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Cultural Authority (TCA), we are projecting annual growth of 7% in tourism revenues to $5.1 billion by 2020. This is also an indication of the potential that Abu Dhabi has to offer in terms of business tourism. For example, between 2011 and 2013, the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC) grew it exhibitions business significantly, from eight to 22 exhibitions per year. In 2012, we hosted 360 events compared to 223 previously. In 2012, the ophthalmology conference provided further evidence of Abu Dhabi's status as a destination for business tourism. Around 12,000 practitioners hosted their annual conference here, which was the biggest ever in the Emirate, marking a further great success. We have splendid infrastructure facilities, and pride ourselves on being the best venue in the region in terms of growth potential. All of these factors position Abu Dhabi as a solid destination for business tourism.</p><h4>What are the challenges of catering to MICE tourism?</h4><p>We are no different from any other destination. We understand the mechanics of business tourism and have clearly articulated our strategy to respond to its needs. The business visitor requires high-quality facilities, reflecting the latest technological advances in communications. Furthermore, people themselves are very important; the higher the caliber of person in your organization, the better it can become. Abu Dhabi caters to the highest caliber executives from around the world by creating the right environment for them to do business in, responsively and effectively. State support for the ongoing developments in Abu Dhabi is encouraging, as observed in the well-connected airline and tourism portfolio being developed. By focusing on the above factors Abu Dhabi is able to support all sectors, but specifically, business tourism.</p><h4>How competitive is this market for MICE tourism compared to Qatar and Oman?</h4><p>It is highly competitive. We are dealing with a market where the readiness of the Emirate to play the host is the key to winning. Commercial visitors are highly intellectual and professional individuals who need to be convinced that what you are offering will meet their exacting requirements.</p><div class="quote">“We measure ourselves in terms of our economic contribution to Abu Dhabi as a city, and also to the UAE in general."</div><h4>How have visitor numbers risen over past years, and what do you expect in the future?</h4><p>Visitor numbers have been increasing since 2012. At that time, we had around 1 million visitors, but for 2013 we have a target of 1.4 million. We measure ourselves in terms of our economic contribution to Abu Dhabi as a city, and also to the UAE in general. One of the key economic contributors is the number of visitors we host. If you imagine an increase from 1 million to 1.4 million visitors in one year, you begin to picture the magnitude we are talking about in terms of support for this industry and its wider economic impact.</p><h4>How important is ADNEC in building the profile of the exhibition center?</h4><p>We host a number of major events in Abu Dhabi, including the International Defence Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) and the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC). There are two ways to look at these. One is to consider the ability of Abu Dhabi to host, attract, nurture, and grow such events. If you take the example of IDEX or ADIPEC, these are homegrown events. We now look at those events as the two flagship events of the city that occupy the entire venue. Herein lies the vision that Abu Dhabi has in growing, nurturing, and providing the environment and support what such events require. Many other events, with the support of both ADNEC and Abu Dhabi, can also blossom. We observe many events developing within a short period of time that come to rival the scale of their major predecessors. Relatively speaking, such events have been staged in Abu Dhabi for the past five or six years. Both Abu Dhabi and ADNEC are highly supportive of them, and appreciate the value participating businesses bring to the Emirate. Our work now is to provide the best environment for such events. Importantly, we see many new organizers launching shows in Abu Dhabi for the first time. Moreover, in 2013, ADIPEC is set to be annualized for the first time, which will contribute notably to the economy; there are many factors at play here. We set out by solely hosting IDEX, but have now come to host a number of different shows and organizers.</p><h4>Considering that the US and European markets have decelerated, how is ADNEC looking to draw visitors from the region, Indian subcontinent, and the Far East?</h4><p>Any country should always play on its strengths. The UAE and Abu Dhabi specifically, are perfectly located midway between East and West. The environment that we provide here in the UAE and Abu Dhabi, in terms of political and logistical stability, as well as business support, make it a great location to do business. The UAE has been ranked among the best 25 brands worldwide, at number 23 to be exact. Yet, over the coming 15 years, the country is expected to move up to number one. That is exactly the positioning that the UAE is focusing on, due to its superb environment, infrastructure, support, connectivity, airline connection, hotels, and exhibitions, as well as purpose-built, world-class conference centers. This is what we focus in light of the competition, and to attract business to this part of the world, thereby also improving the economic prospects of business around the region and locally. The growth that this country is witnessing is encouraging, and proof that this is the place to be.</p><h4>Where does ADNEC fit in to Vision 2030?</h4><p>Where do we position ourselves, on the economic or tourism front? My answer is both. We are contributing to the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 as a vehicle and driver of economic growth. Business tourism is key and we are working hand-in-hand with TCA to develop and support this sector. Moreover, ADNEC is contributing in different ways to employment creation in Abu Dhabi. We perceive nationalization as a key strategic factor for the city. We not only recruit talent, but also nurture it, providing experience and training development programs through our own exhibitions in London. We are creating an environment in which the talents of UAE nationals can be developed. We are also contributing to the initiatives and efforts of Abu Dhabi in terms of renewable energy by reducing waste by 15% in 2012. Our efforts are wholly in line with the government's Vision 2030 and are complementary to it.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the core market factors that lead to the establishment of Servientrega in Ecuador?</h4><p>In the mid-1990s, Ecuador was enjoying an economic boom. Since Servientraga is from neighboring Colombia, we thought it was the right moment to take the company abroad. Colombia and Ecuador are two very similar countries and we also had future regional plans in mind, this being the first step. Additionally, the market research we conducted showed that companies operating in the logistics sector in Ecuador at that time did not properly meet the needs of the market. There were two key points in the industry—high-quality services and technology—that the Ecuadorean market lacked. Our slogan today is “Servientrega: Solutions Center: A Center For Solutions," since we provide our customers with integrated solutions to make their activity more efficient and qualitative. Servientrega is a logistics company that over the years has achieved great levels of success in Ecuador. Today, we are part of many different industries and processes; we work backstage in election processes, and we provide essential services for the key social and daily economic processes of Ecuador's life. This is Servientrega today, and despite the fact that our brand does not always show off, we are always present and ready to help out people and companies.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Servientrega?</h4><p>We always work to a five-year business plan, and at the beginning of each year we develop the main strategy to implement. Thanks to our activity, experience, and expertise in Colombia, we have always been able to import know-how into Ecuador. At the same time, our business model is based on the standardization of the brand and has always been an innovative one. Also, we have developed and implemented our own information system, which has a clear focus on Latin culture. I would like to stress that one of our main assets and competitive advantages is our human capital, which thanks to their qualities and our extensive branch network puts us in a better position than our competitors.</p><div class="quote">“In terms of volume of operations and turnover, Ecuador is the second most important country for Servientrega after Colombia."</div><h4>How was 2012 for the company?</h4><p>Despite the slight economic deceleration, we managed to achieve positive results, consolidating our brand in the market. Trust is a key word in our industry, and only through trust in a brand can one grow their business activity. Servientrega has achieved more in this area as the years go by. A good example of this is the size of our operations in the country; we directly employ 1,243 people and approximately 2,500 indirectly.</p><h4>What role does Ecuador play in Servientrega's global operations?</h4><p>In terms of volume of operations and turnover, Ecuador is the second most important country for Servientrega after Colombia, a country that is twice the size of Ecuador. For example, we expect $30 million in turnover for 2013.</p><h4>How has your product and service portfolio evolved over the years?</h4><p>There are two segments where our company has gained a very consolidated position: corporate mailing and packaging (including all types of administrative and logistics services), and premium cargo (medium cargo transport delivered across the country rather than to one single point). We also have mass delivery, where we can include items such as newspapers and other publications, and we have a significant market share in this segment. Apart from that, we have home-to-home packaging delivery, online order delivery, and regional and international delivery, a segment in which we have a competitive advantage due to our presence in several regional countries and the wide range of agreements with our international counterparts. For example, we manage import and export transportation, with Miami being one of our main markets. One of our main products is transportation of goods to and from Miami. Within these segments, we have many different products linked to time and countries of delivery. Our large branch network enables us to reach a wider range of people and niche markets than our competitors.</p><h4>What are the company's expansions plans at the local and regional level?</h4><p>Servientrega operates in Colombia, Ecuador, and six more countries. Currently, the company does not have plans to enter new markets. Our priority is to further consolidate the brand in these countries and create more efficient synergies between these countries. Also, starting from 2013, the company is implementing a new five-year strategic plan, in which sustainability is the key element. Regarding the local market, we are entering a new business segment: goods storage. Until 2012, we basically focused on transportation and delivery; however, starting from 2013, we decided to explore this segment, linked mainly to clients that also need transportation and goods and packages distribution. In this regard, we have already signed a contract with a Chinese company operating in Ecuador, and we hope this to be the first step of a very successful venture. Additionally, we also have plans to enter the hazardous materials transportation segment, a small market in Ecuador, in which there is not much competition. I think we could enter this sector by 2014, especially on the main national route from Guayaquil to Quito and vice versa. Finally, we need to continue strengthening our marketing channels and make sure our clients are 100% satisfied with our brand and services, which would help us to reach new clients. For example, our information system enables us to keep a constant eye on the inventories in our offices and those of our clients. We know of the importance for our clients to have their inventories updated with the required products, which underpins the satisfaction of their own clients. Nestlé, Colgate, Unilever, and Cerveceria Nacional, among others, are clients that use our services.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>For a huge global company like Allianz, what is the importance of the Turkish market, and what are your expectations?</h4><p>In today's globalized business environment, companies should have a strong presence in emerging markets in order to maintain sustainable growth. Since Turkey is one of the so-called MIST countries, its relevance is clear to us. The Turkish economy is showing the most dynamic growth in Europe and it is one of the continent's largest economies with a fairly young population of 75 million people. The opportunities in the Turkish insurance sector are shaped by the dynamics of a growing middle class, favorable demographics, and low penetration rates. We see rapid progress in Turkey along with an attractive economic landscape and stability in the physical, regulatory, and economic infrastructure. The acquisition of Yapı Kredi Sigorta by Allianz is the biggest investment made in the Turkish insurance sector, and it definitely underlines Turkey's position as one of the key markets. This is how we see Turkey in a nutshell and why we are investing in this country. Turkey is clearly one of the key markets where growth potential is seen, and where we see also that growth can be captured without losing focus on profitability. We are subscribing to double-digit growth over the next year, and we also plan to have double-digit growth in profitability over the coming years.</p><h4>How do you expect the merger with Yapı Kredi to change your role in the market?</h4><p>We are becoming the market leader in Turkey in non-life, life, and pensions. We have a combined market share of 15.6% in non-life and 20.4% in pensions. In terms of life protection, we rank third following some company mergers. Furthermore, we have taken the lead in the health branch with a market share of 33%, which is around 19 percentage points ahead of second place. Our plan is of course to maintain our market position, but we will never do so for the sake of market share only. We are always focused on sustainability, which means that if we cannot maintain our market share with a return on our risk capital, we will forego market share. The sustainability of growth and profitability is always our top priority. Our mission is to serve the Turkish population because, as a market leader, what you feel most is a responsibility to society. Turkey is growing, emerging, and transforming into a developed economy, but as of yet the assets of Turkish wealth on a global scale are rather low and they need to be protected from any downturn. As Allianz, we are aware of the emerging needs of the market, where we brought our global expertise. On the one hand, we are utilizing our global knowledge and expertise in Turkey, but on the other hand we are also benefiting from our local experiences.</p><div class="quote">“We are utilizing our global knowledge and expertise in Turkey... also benefiting from our local experiences."</div><h4>How does the new private pensions law change your outlook on the growth potential of private pensions in Turkey?</h4><p>Pension savings have been supported with state contributions, which is a major milestone in the development of savings in Turkey in general. Again, looking at it from a macro perspective, it was an extremely smart move from the government. When we consider the level of the current account deficit, increasing the local domestic savings quota is crucial. As of October, the contribution of the state to the pension funds was around TL700 million. We are talking now about a sector worth TL24.2 billion as of October in total pensions volume, of which TL700 million comes from the state. This was a major milestone in the development of Turkey as an economy, and for us as an insurance player. It was very important because we are now in a position to gain scale. Pensions profitability margins are quite low, for both the insurance and the asset management companies in Turkey. To have an asset management culture, to grow funds, and to intensify savings in order to establish a professional sector is the only sustainable plan, and with the current margins this is going to be difficult.</p><h4>As awareness and participation in the insurance and private pensions system grows, what effects will we see on a macro level in Turkey's economy overall?</h4><p>It is important to increase the savings quota in Turkey. Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan's latest announcements mark a rise in savings in 2013, and I believe that pensions do play a role in this. In Turkey, we have a problem of high and growing private debt, and this will become a problem in due course. I would even go so far as to say that we might already have an asset bubble. As insurance players in Turkey, we need to do a better job of communicating and convincing all related stakeholders, i.e. customers, the government, regulators, peers, and also connected sectors like banking, into making a story of it. Insurance is a very basic need for societal development, and we have to leave the foundations in the hands of those who are in a position to manage them. The government, regulators, peers, and banks have to communicate this together to our customers. It will be a great development for Turkish society and the country's long-term growth because we will be more tolerant to external shocks, and one strong way to buffer a downturn is insurance. That is something we need to communicate better, and here again Allianz, as the market leader, will play an important role.</p><h4>You mention a lot of opportunities and risks in the sector. How would you assess the level of foreign interest from investors and companies thinking about entering Turkey's pension and insurance sector?</h4><p>Foreign investor interest in the Turkish insurance market is very high, which is reflected in the capital ownership of the market—70% of paid-up capital belongs to foreign players. There is still potential for more, and I think it is also good for Turkey's development because a local player in the long term will find it hard to persist in an environment that involves larger investments. Digital technology developments, particularly in big data and other niche areas, play an increasingly important role in our interconnected world. Our purchase of Yapı Kredi Sigorta is the start of a broader consolidation that will occur over the coming five years. It can be foreseen that there will be more opportunities to enter the market. I think there is still the opportunity to enter with a brand new establishment, rather than through M&amp;A activity.</p><h4>You have outlined what needs to be done by players in this sector to grow and help the Turkish economy. Are you optimistic about these issues?</h4><p>We enjoy fruitful discussions with the regulator and the government. For example, the government understands the relevance of insurance, and this will further improve over time. We will do our best to support the government and the regulator. We will always bring the global know-how of Allianz into those discussions. We have a good track record so far, the growth rates are good, and profitability will increase.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess demand for gas in the UAE and how does your company contribute to its supply?</h4><p>There is demand on a large scale for gas in the UAE and the demand-supply gap is growing. Currently, Abu Dhabi is importing about 2 billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas, which comes from the Dolphin Project in Qatar. However, even this is insufficient to meet the growing need for gas in commercial, industrial, and residential applications. Our company, Al Hosn Gas, will be producing 0.5 billion standard cubic feet per day in an effort to reduce the shortfall in gas supplies.</p><h4>What is the scale of the Shah gas project?</h4><p>The Shah gas development is a greenfield project located about 250 kilometers from Abu Dhabi City, in a remote area with no pre-existing access roads, water, electricity, or communications network. Our goal is to process 1 billion standard cubic feet of raw gas per day. The development plan primarily consists of drilling some of the most technically challenging wells, connecting the wells to a gas plant via a gas gathering network, processing the gas and associated liquids at the gas plant, and delivering end products via pipelines to the country's hydrocarbon network. In addition, we will be producing substantial volumes of sulfur as a by-product, which will be transported 256 kilometers via rail to the port of Ruwais. The scale of the project is huge and the size of the facilities makes them some of the largest of their kind in the world, primarily because of the sour nature of the gas, with an average 23% toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and 10% carbon dioxide (CO2).</p><div class="quote">“The Shah gas project will become an industry benchmark and its success is likely to spur even more sour gas projects."</div><h4>How does the high sulfur content of the gas affect the upstream and downstream process?</h4><p>The Shah gas field was first discovered in the 1960s, and for close to 50 years was not considered technically feasible to develop due to its high sulfur content. It is tough enough to drill for sour gas in a difficult reservoir formation, and tougher still to build facilities on harsh terrain to gather and process huge volumes of rich sour gas, then separate them into condensates, natural gas liquids, ethane, and sulfur. It requires robust health, safety, and environmental management systems, state-of-the art drilling technology, and stringent manufacturing design and workmanship to effectively construct the facilities that could deliver sustainable production over several decades. As a consequence of the high sulfur content, the gas plant layout is wide and covers an area of six kilometers long and three kilometers wide. A substantial part of a gas plant is its “red zone," where no personnel are allowed under normal operating conditions. The four sulfur recovery units in the plant are about four to five times the size of a conventional sulfur recovery unit, with each unit processing about 2,500 tons of sulfur per day.</p><h4>When will the plant be fully completed?</h4><p>The plant will be completed on schedule and become operational by late 2014. During this summer, we had a multinational peak workforce of 40,000 from several contractors and subcontractors working on the project.</p><h4>What have been the major challenges so far and how are you looking to boost Emiratization?</h4><p>One of our primary objectives is to meet certain Emiratization goals. We aim for 75% of the workforce to be UAE nationals by 2017. We are in a good position to meet this target; today, the figure is approximately 40%. The technical experience, skills, and knowledge that our UAE employees need to work in a challenging operating environment such as the Shah gas field will be hard to master, not just in the region, but even globally. Regarding the challenges to date, we have overcome many of them. One such challenge was locating the plant in an area that had no infrastructure. Everything had to be built from scratch, from access roads to electrical power, water supply, and a communications setup. Providing quality services with a pleasant work environment to our site-based employees such as accommodation and social and healthcare amenities was challenging but accomplished effectively and successfully.</p><h4>The breakdown of production is interesting. Can you provide more detail?</h4><p>The daily production will be approximately 500 million cubic feet of sweet gas, 33,000 barrels of condensates, 4,400 tons of natural gas liquids, and 9,000 tons of sulfur. All of the gas production will be for domestic consumption. The natural gas liquids (NGLs) will be taken all the way from the Shah area to Ruwais for fractionation into ethane, propane, butane, and pentane production. The condensate will go to the Ruwais Refinery for processing and the elemental sulfur will be transported by rail to Ruwais for export.</p><h4>What does this project say about Abu Dhabi's ambitions?</h4><p>The Shah gas project is undertaken by Al Hosn Gas in pursuit of Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030. This project confirms that the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is keen to develop and utilize its sour gas resources by developing the technology and committing the required investment. The entire industry is watching our progress with interest. The Shah gas project will become an industry benchmark and its success is likely to spur even more sour gas projects. In addition, our high level of Emiratization, and the resultant knowledge and skills development that it creates, will ensure that our employees are well equipped to tackle the challenges of the future, a key objective of Abu Dhabi's Vision 2030. We are aware that the success of this project will create a huge responsibility for Al Hosn Gas. We are confident of living up to this responsibility by delivering a growth model that is sustainable, inclusive, and balanced, and takes into consideration the environmental factors, human development, community and social responsibility, as well as business aspects.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have Demco Steel Industries' milestones been over the past year?</h4><p>We have shifted our interest from the steel industry to various other sectors over the past few years. Real estate in Lebanon has become one of our main businesses. We have also expanded our shipping business overseas. And while we have maintained our position as market leader in the Lebanese steel market, we do believe that diversification is the key to growth today.</p><h4>What type of real estate developments are you involved in?</h4><p>We have several projects that mainly consist of small-scale housing in very interesting residential buildings, including some products unique to the country. In our latest launch with RedRock Village &amp; Spa project, we are creating an entire village in the Faqra mountains with a spa, a farm, solar panels, and bio waste facilities. There is huge interest from the Lebanese people in this kind of development, and so we're starting to develop in this area and have done very well. We sold more than half the project in three days, and it is a very large one. We are beginning work to lay down the necessary infrastructure as we speak, and are set to start the construction of the project in April 2014.</p><div class="quote">“We have shifted our interest from the steel industry to various other sectors over the past few years."</div><h4>What makes the RedRock Village &amp; Spa project different?</h4><p>The initial RedRock master plan was designed by Foster &amp; Partners in London, one of the best architectural firms in the world. The total area of the project is 500,000 sqm, of which 250,000 sqm will be dedicated to public gardens and roads. We are ready to lose more than 50% of the potential exploitation to make sure we keep a maximum amount of green areas and a beautiful landscape for RedRock residents. This non-commercial approach, which is something we are very proud of, will definitely be a first in Lebanon. We are building exclusive high-end chalets, where families will live in apartments ranging from 50 sqm to 130 sqm in size. There will also be gardens and individual swimming pools. The farm is key to the project as it will provide a place for families to experience a healthy lifestyle with daily products such as eggs, dairy products, and fresh organic vegetables. Furthermore, we will have facilities to provide numerous sports activities within the sports club in the spa or natural jogging track/hiking trail in the forest. Despite the current instability we are faced with, this is yet another example that specially tailored projects will sell out irrespective of political stability. An “outside the box" approach combined with our unique products are the main reasons why we sold more than 1,000 apartments/offices in various projects, enabling Demco Real Estate in partnership with Sayfco's excellent marketing team to become market leaders within a very short time.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the demand for apartments?</h4><p>In Europe 50 years ago, many people were accustomed to live in apartments of 200 sqm-300 sqm. Today, people live on average in 70 sqm residences because prices are much higher. People want smaller places in good locations and with excellent facilities, but they cannot afford large apartments. Five years ago, I started a small apartment project in the Metn area of Beirut, with units of 122 sqm. It was a huge success. At that time, we were the first to develop 100-sqm apartments. In fact, we sold all of the 122-sqm units in record time, with the 166-sqm units selling out immediately after. People want to be very close to Beirut, but cannot afford to be in the heart of the city because it is too expensive.</p><h4>What other projects are you working on?</h4><p>We are working on three towers on the coastal highway, including 30- to 45-story buildings. That was also different in the sense that the highest building on the highway is currently seven or eight stories high. People never liked to live high up, but due to today's demographics there is an increasing demand for this kind of housing unit. With land being so expensive the only thing you can do is to erect higher buildings. These apartments have magnificent 360° views of Beirut city and the Mediterranean Sea. None of the available projects have these facilities and views at these price levels. There is a market for the right product, and there is adequate liquidity in the country. The banks in Lebanon are fully liquid and need to lend to their customers who are looking for the right products.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the shipping business?</h4><p>Today, shipping has changed. First of all, the last two or three years have been extremely difficult for the shipping business because of the global recession. I believe that the US and Europe are beginning to emerge. Although there are still many issues to overcome, I am convinced that one year from now things will start kicking in again. We have ordered a few large ships. These are ships that save around 30% of fuel over the previous models, and that have a capacity to move 30% more goods. Their new design enables them to go faster than previous models. They can trade anywhere in the world, which is another way of diversifying our assets. The main play was based on the reality that the market today is very bad, with very low ship prices, though with new technology for better ships emerging. When you save 30% on fuel, you are basically saving about $1 million per ship per year on energy costs alone. We are selling off the old assets and replacing them with new ones. The new ship designs will eventually be so much more competitive that they will make the rest of the world's fleet obsolete. This new approach should result in a significant increase for our shipping business.</p><h4>How is the steel market performing in Lebanon?</h4><p>To this date, the quantities of steel that are being demanded in the country are the same in 2013 as they were in 2012. That was a surprise; we had expected demand to drop due to a slowdown in the economy. I don't expect the 2nd Quarter of 2014 to be the same, and am anticipating a slowdown over the coming months. The price of steel is set by the international market, and not the Lebanese market. Therefore, what happens in the construction sector in Lebanon affects the demand for steel; however, it doesn't affect the price. The main problem that we are having today is that there is a lot of competition between players in the steel business. The margins are very slim and interest in growing a business with such margins and very little added value is falling. Hence, this is the reason why we are focusing most of our energy on other sectors.</p><h4>What is your vision for Demco Steel Industries?</h4><p>The biggest obstacle in proper forecasting is the political situation in Lebanon today. Visibility in this country varies very quickly. It is very difficult to be able to tell you where I see Demco in the near future because most of our activities are within Lebanon itself. I believe that turmoil in the region will not last as long as people think; in the modern world everything evolves quickly.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[here-for-the-fashion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fashion Trading Company (Hugo Boss) is present in 12 countries. What does Lebanon mean for the company?</h4><p>FTC is a family-owned business. We are the agent of Hugo Boss for the entire Middle East, so we carry out operations for the brand across 12 countries. We have franchise stores in 10 countries and the rest are multi-brand channels. Lebanon represents almost 10% of the entire Middle East market when it comes to the fashion industry. Nevertheless, Lebanon means a lot to FTC since the company was born in Beirut and currently is still based here.</p><h4>How has the fashion industry in Lebanon developed over the years, and how is it perceived externally?</h4><p>Lebanon has always been the most advanced country in terms of fashion. The fashion industry has developed quite a lot over past years. More and more brands from all categories have opened in Lebanon. Luxury brands have expanded in downtown Beirut, whereas the other segments have in malls or highstreet destinations like Hamra and Kaslik. Externally, Lebanon is perceived as a niche market. Lebanon doesn't have the biggest windows, but definitely it has a niche one since the offer is much smaller. Saying that, they concentrate on niche products to seduce clientéle. It is more homogenous and they have to make sure to choose a nice collection since they don't just sell to expatriates or tourists, but mostly to local people. Lebanon is considered the window of the Middle East because of its large diaspora, which gives it an edge in fashion. If you attend an event or walk around during the day, you will find people dressed up fashionably; and this for me is a true indicator of the country's fashion culture. Lebanese women are trendsetters. Other GCC countries may have the stores, but the locals haven't embraced it. Dubai, however, is a larger market and leads the industry.</p><div class="quote">“Downtown Beirut is currently the best destination for luxury, and that is where all the premium brands are."</div><h4>What trends can you identify in consumer habits?</h4><p>The trend is changing in Lebanon. Shopping used to be only about high street destinations, like Hamra, Verdun, Kaslik, and other high-end streets in the downtown area. However, in the past five years, we have seen more and more malls opening up, and so the industry is shifting from a street destination to a mall one. Malls offer convenience—everything is under one roof. Hugo Boss, however, is a street destination brand. I do not like the shift into malls in Lebanon. We can have commercial stores in malls, but Downtown Beirut is currently the best destination for luxury, and that is where all the premium brands are.</p><h4>How are the premium brands performing in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are doing well. In 2012, we maintained the same numbers as in 2011, which is good because many others suffered. For 2013, we are expecting to sustain the 2012 figures. I am not expecting any growth. Unfortunately, we have not grown for a couple of years due to the poor political situation. Lebanon was much healthier in 2009 and 2010. The premium brands could perform much better if the situation calmed down. They should do much better since the stores are not big enough. If you compare the stores in Lebanon to the ones in the GCC, they are much smaller—and that is an indication in itself.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of local brands versus international ones?</h4><p>Local brands are very poor for men and brilliant for women. However, there are many upcoming stars for the future. We are extremely famous in haute couture, and its importance is really big compared to the international names. Brands like Elie Saab, Rabih Keyrouz, Mahfouz, and Hobeika are competing fiercely with international brands, such as Vera Wang. We have some other good emerging designers too, for example Sandra Mansour and Rani Zkhem. There are many smaller brands too that sell accessories in the mid- to high-price range. Lebanese designers are very talented with regard to women's haute couture and accessories, but not so talented when it comes to men's fashion. I would like to see more local brands in that segment as well as in the women's príªt-á-porter.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the authority with regard to creating an investment environment for the maritime and logistics industry?</h4><p>The Dubai Maritime City Authority (DMCA) is a tribute to the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. The creation of this authority represents the pioneering spirit of the city itself, as it provides world-class infrastructure complemented by seamless and progressive policies that will allow businesses in the maritime industry to meet their commercial objectives. The DMCA authority provides a platform for excellence and quality, as it nurtures the ambitions of Dubai to build on its leadership position within the region as the ideal business hub for the maritime industry. DMCA's aim is to connect all aspects of the maritime industry by providing rules and regulations that build on best practices in a consistent and responsible manner. The authority aims to play an important role in promoting the maritime industry to both government and non-government bodies, and is positioned to be the catalyst of growth for the maritime sector. DMCA's posture of cooperation and dialogue allows companies and individuals to navigate through operational complexities, while focusing on their strategic goals within this dynamic sector. DMCA is the gateway to Dubai's maritime sector. In line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, DMCA has a mandate to create and provide efficient processes and protocols that will allow companies to interact and operate effectively within the sector. The authority takes responsibility for establishing rules and regulations, as well as providing administrative infrastructure allowing businesses to operate efficiently. Our core strategic objectives are aligned to add value to all stakeholders by collaborating and nurturing partnerships among government entities, private companies, and NGOs.</p><h4>How will the vision to further develop this sector in combination with the World Expo 2020 bid impact Dubai's maritime industry?</h4><p>In Dubai, we have successfully developed what I can safely say is the first of its kind; a 360-degree approach to developing the maritime cluster in the Emirate of Dubai. There are many hidden treasures that we are trying to cultivate and bring together to create the world's leading maritime center here. Dubai has a very rich maritime heritage, and the city is aware of the fact that the maritime products that it offers now need to continuously expand. The Emirate has to be constantly renovated and always focused on bringing new products for it to succeed globally and sustainably. This is exactly what we are doing with the maritime sector strategy in line with the World Expo 2020 bid. In Dubai, there is a vision of excellence that we take from His Highness, who pushes us daily to be innovative and creative in developing regulations that help businesses thrive and make their lives easier, and thus they become more interested in investing in Dubai.</p><div class="quote">“The maritime authority is working closely with all of the different actors, and this way of working is an achievement in itself."</div><h4>Considering the fact that maritime traffic in Dubai is expected to increase exponentially until 2020 and beyond, what needs to be built to facilitate this development?</h4><p>If you look at the waterfront and coastal areas of Dubai, it is extremely busy relative to our size. There are many larger ships as well as individual yachts and traffic around Dubai Creek, and there are also traditional dhows that come and go every day. It is clear that things will continue to expand. We realize that there is huge growth coming our way and that there will be more traffic. According to the marine map that we have developed, we have four main achievements that will make this increase in traffic run smoothly. Firstly, we regulated maritime operations. All maritime specialists know that larger ships, when they come to certain ports or cities, need to perform certain activities, such as bunkering or ship-to-ship transfers. We have dedicated specific zones for these operations. The larger ship traffic will therefore never interfere with passenger traffic, for which we have also designated particular areas. Individuals with jet skis or yachts also have dedicated sailing areas. Finally, we have clearly marked all of the passenger and work areas with hundreds of buoys and floating navigational devices, creating a 300-meter buffer zone from the beach for individual sailors and pleasure sailing. Our main product offering is maritime regulation, and we work with the best of global and regional consultants to develop it in such a way that we do not enforce, but “engage" industry leaders in a negotiated regulatory process to develop forward-thinking maritime relations.</p><h4>How do you distribute the new regulations to the people they affect?</h4><p>We have a multi-fold strategy of communication. For example, implementing regulations for Law No. 11 of 2010 for licensing and registering marine craft in Dubai were issued in May 2013. The moment such by-laws were implemented we started with a multi-layered strategy. We approach private sector companies operating in the maritime sector, retail maritime companies, and governmental bodies that will be affected, and conduct one-on-one meetings with all of them. We also carry out mass media communication, advertisements, and sponsorships—all kinds of marketing activities—to try to get the message out. We also work with the Dubai marine police and our friends in the coast guard to make them aware of what needs to be done.</p><h4>How does the maritime sector benefit from the significance of Dubai as an international maritime hub?</h4><p>On the one hand, the Dubai equity of excellence is strong. Dubai has succeeded in establishing itself globally as a paradigm of success and a beacon of achievement in business, tourism, and commerce. We have developed dynamic, forward-thinking, and business-friendly maritime regulations that maximize business oportunities, and make it very easy for maritime investors to do their work in Dubai. This is what Dubai is all about; enabling people to make the most of their business.</p><h4>What are the major achievements of the authority in regulating the maritime sector and providing people with a regulatory framework?</h4><p>The maritime authority is working closely with all of the different actors, and this way of working is an achievement in itself. We do not live and work alone—everything we do affects other organizations. For this reason, a close working relationship is important. We think in a young, progressive, forward-thinking way, which is focused on maximizing success for commercial enterprises. Our vision is to create a safe and vibrant maritime environment. One of our achievements in safety has been establishing that life jackets at sea are as important as seatbelts in a car. We educate the public on a regular basis with simple, straightforward messages that will save lives. We go to schools and give lectures, we develop and publish boating best-practice documents that we make available, and we work to improve awareness of safety at sea. On the corporate side, we develop regulations that would never hurt businesses.</p><h4>What kind of relationships do you have with other maritime authorities in the region and the UAE?</h4><p>Our philosophy is to address the needs of the maritime industry with all parties concerned. The UAE is blessed with a very stable political system, and we enjoy that. Each Emirate has its own priorities when it comes to maritime strategies, but all share an important vision, which is to develop a unique and pioneering maritime center in the UAE. A recent example was a meeting with the Abu Dhabi Department of Transport, at which we shared our best practices when it comes to registering marine craft, and its officials shared with us how they are approaching the same topic.</p><h4>What is your future outlook for DMCA?</h4><p>The future is clear as it is mentioned in our vision statement. We aim to create a safe and vibrant maritime environment. We are creating a maritime context that is competitive, successful, and sustainable. It is competitive in that it will continue to be a first choice for investors in terms of maritime investment, successful in that it brings valuable contributions to the GDP of the Emirate, and also sustainable in that we are not working only to make Dubai's maritime sector competitive now, but to be successful for the next 50 to 100 years. We want to bring a lot of Emiratis into this sector, and share our excitement about its future.</p><p>© The Business Year - December 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

Ever objective, Expreso is known for its well-researched editorials and coverage of the major stories in domestic and global politics and economy. We aspire to maintain our strict standards of journalistic integrity, and continue to deliver quality news content to the Ecuadorean public.</p><h4>What prompted Expreso's shift from a focus on Guayaquil to a wider national coverage?</h4><p>Expreso is basically a Guayaquil newspaper. And while it does address national and global issues, it's focus remains on Guayaquil, which is Ecuador's main port and economic capital. Naturally though, we cannot be estranged from the wider issues of our country, and so we cover news from other regions to keep our readers informed.</p><div class="quote">“Expreso has always been closely associated with technological advances."</div><h4>How would you characterize the changing nature of demand for information in the local market?</h4><p>Readers increasingly want more concrete information that is personalized to their interests and needs. They also want immediate access, which explains the huge popularity of social networks. Of course, these networks lack the high quality research capability of a newspaper, which is what makes us indispensible for our readers. As a newspaper, we have to reinvent every day and create the best product so that our readers feel the need to buy a copy every day, confident of finding well-written and accurate stories.</p><h4>Has Expreso sought to increase its international presence?</h4><p>It's a complicated business for a newspaper to have a high international presence, although we provide the many Ecuadoreans living abroad news coverage via our e-paper, website, and on tablets. By these means, they feel connected both to their country and to the paper.</p><h4>How would you describe the newspaper's readership base and how many people subscribe to it?</h4><p>We have an important subscription base that guarantees our readership, mainly from Guayaquil and nearby cities. Subscriptions go beyond being a mere payment system, as they allow is to become familiar with the reader, and more informed in terms of what kind of service they want from us. This is important when it comes to developing new products and content.</p><h4>How has Expreso adapted to technology in terms of marketing and newsgathering?</h4><p>Expreso has always been closely associated with technological advances, be it for printing, distribution, merchandising, or other forms of marketing. Today, when considering the news business, digital technology immediately springs to mind, but let's not forget that behind the technology is a team of professionals that has led the company to its achievements. And concerning the content itself, having access to imagery and agency texts, and being associated with newspapers such as Le Monde, El Paí­s, and El Mundo, among others, guarantees that we produce the best possible coverage of international affairs.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the climate for international investors in the media sector?</h4><p>Currently we see some difficulties regarding the entry of new players and investors to the mass media sector, since the new communication law prohibits media players from participation in other business segments.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bandwidth-half-full]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Pesco Telecom evolved since it first entered the Lebanese market?</h4><p>Pesco Telecom was established in 1992 and started as a contractor for large telecoms projects, including satellite earth stations for international communications. In 1997, we moved on to become operators. In the same year, we were granted a license from the government to build and operate a nationwide wireless data network, and this is how we started. With time, we expanded the network and started servicing larger corporate customers that required wide area network (WAN) services. Over the past few decades, in line with growing demand for the internet, we expanded our network to deliver services to ISPs that did not have the license to build their own. Today, we have a customer portfolio that includes corporate customers, who we service directly, as well as all the other ISPs that happen to use our network to deliver internet bandwidth to their customers. We pioneered the first wireless mobile residential network in Lebanon in 2005, known as WISE. By doing so, we moved into the ISP business and finally DSL in 2007. An ISP leases internet deals in terms of buying and selling access and acting as a bridge between the government and the private user. ISP companies in Lebanon are not allowed to build their own infrastructure, and hence must rely on the infrastructure of data service providers.</p><h4>What investment plans do you have for 2014?</h4><p>The lack of a clear regulatory environment makes it impossible for us to plan major investments in the near future. Nevertheless, we will definitely be investing in growing our existing networks.</p><div class="quote">“We are experiencing organic growth and the constant and continuous needs of people for more bandwidth."</div><h4>How do you assess the regulatory environment for the ICT sector in the country?</h4><p>It is tough. We are caught in limbo between the full deregulation of the telecoms market and the government monopoly, and the politicization of the sector makes things harder still for us. Despite the fact that a law was approved almost 10 years ago that aimed to privatize and deregulate the sector, it was never fully enacted nor implemented. This state of limbo has a very negative impact on business because long-term visibility of 10-15 years is essential to be able to invest in the telecoms sector, due to the high capital expenditures involved. We are in an unfriendly environment where the de facto licensing regime is not in our favor and the regulatory environment is far from clear. We lobby as hard as possible, but most of the time we are caught in the crossfire. Because of the high politicization of the business, if one party expresses an opinion, the opposition makes a stand and the situation becomes deadlocked. It is nonsense to hold the entire nation hostage to political bickering. A free-from-politics telecoms sector would be beneficial to all parties and to the nation. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) tries to do what it can in good faith, but the agency has practically zero enforcement capabilities. It cannot issue rules, much less enforce them.</p><h4>How can Lebanon sustain innovation in such a monopolistic environment?</h4><p>There is no doubt in my mind that this is slowing down the whole innovation process and the creation of new business enterprises. The situation is slowing down the economy at a time when growth is most needed in order to make up for the lack of stability, which exacerbates political volatility. The formula for the enhancement of telecoms and internet communications leading to higher GPD growth is obvious. It is pity that we have only registered limited improvement—we could have done much better, but this is typical of Lebanon, a country that has missed so many opportunities.</p><h4>What were Pesco Telecom's results in 2012? What are you expecting for 2013?</h4><p>We are well established in the market, and are managing to post a decent bottom line, but growth is a problem. The whole economy is shrinking and I long for the kind of growth we witnessed a few years ago, when the government was fully committed to the full deregulation of the market.</p><h4>In terms of the drivers of growth, which areas have greater potential?</h4><p>We are experiencing organic growth and the constant and continuous needs of people for more bandwidth. Bandwidth is something that will always be crucial in the sector, and demand can only increase in the future. I have never heard of anyone whose need for bandwidth is decreasing. Regardless of what industry you are in, your need for communications will always rise.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the ICT sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>I am positive because we are going through a rough patch now, but eventually things will settle down and the politicians will ultimately agree on some type of deregulation. Meanwhile, we will continue developing new products and infrastructure despite prevailing constraints, no matter what they are. Lebanon is a very resilient country and its people are very brave. From an economic perspective, business goes on no matter what, and this applies also to the telecoms sector. It is a challenging and dynamic industry where things always change, and where every year introduces new products.</p><h4>What new products have you introduced in 2013?</h4><p>In the last few years, we have introduced a few key services, the biggest one being 3G. The impact could have been better had we been allowed to market it more aggressively, but we are bound by constraints set by the Ministry. We have also introduced many hardware products to the market, such as miniature Wi-Fi routers for 3G dongles and tablet PCs.</p><h4>What would you say are Pesco Telecom's competitive advantages?</h4><p>Our competitive advantage is our excellent team. I am very proud to say that we have one of the best teams in the country; our people are highly skilled engineers who are fully dedicated. Because of our status as a service company, our people are our core assets. We pride ourselves on being a fully transparent company with a high standard of corporate social responsibility, and we try to communicate this to all levels of the hierarchy.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Pesco Telecom?</h4><p>Growth and innovation are the key words. We plan to innovate no matter what the constraints are. We live in a country where it is hard to predict what will happen in the future, but no matter what the givens are, we will work with that status quo and strive to remain the best and the most innovative company. The trick is to adapt to the times that we are going through. Flexibility is crucial in this case. In the private sector, we are probably number two when it comes to size. And as far as reputation and quality of work are concerned, we rank among the best.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Madina Logistics developed and evolved over the past six years?</h4><p>The company is considered young compared to well-established logistics companies, but we have a very clear aim to be among the top leaders of third-party logistics provision. We have studied all the best practices around the world that provide the best logistics services in terms of performance, facilities, and equipment. We reviewed the same with our consulting engineers to design and build one of the best world-class distribution facilities in Oman. As a third-party logistics company, we provide full supply chain services that include freight services, transportation, warehousing, a container yard, and much more. Our shipping and freight-forwarding department has extensive local coverage and a global network with leading shipping and freight-forwarding companies. The transport department has a complete fleet of trucks that can handle and transport any kind of goods. One of the main features is a trailer that has an in-built crane to load and unload containers by itself. We also have special trailers that extend up to 21 meters in length. Furthermore, we have a connection with international heavy-lift firms that have capabilities to transport 5,000 tons of equipment. All of our trucks are equipped with GPS and IVMS systems to track all movement and monitor truck performance. The warehouses are operated with world-class inventory management systems that manage each client's products. It has full capabilities to manage various product types such as food, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and more.</p><h4>Have you seen demand rise in recent years?</h4><p>Oman enjoys continuous growth in all business sectors. This has supported the rise in the demand for other services such as logistics. Despite the financial crisis around the world, GCC countries were able to sustain growth trends, especially Oman. The government has increased the budgets of new infrastructure projects, and all these need logistics support. We try to provide quality and unique services that guarantee high standards, especially for food products, as we sustain high-quality temperature control up to -25° Celsius. All of our trucks are equipped with temperature-control chips to monitor the supply chain and maintain the correct rate.</p><div class="quote">“To provide the best supply chain solutions, we have to have an excellent international network."</div><h4>With regards to ports, is sea-to-air-to-road logistics a big opportunity for you?</h4><p>Yes. With Oman having a very strategic location, the opportunities are great. Salalah Port is already receiving direct calls from the main shipping lines, and Sohar Port has also started to get direct calls. Port Sultan Qaboos is still getting feeder ships that are coming from UAE ports and others. With six new airports, especially the ones in Muscat, Salalah, and Sohar, as well as the new expressways and future railway project, the Sultanate has great outlook for connectivity in a more economical way.</p><h4>Efficiency is very important for ports. How does Al Madina Logistic Services Company help in this regard?</h4><p>All Omani ports have excellent infrastructure and equipment. Efficiency is a very important part of the success of these ports. What is lacking is the efficient management and smooth operational system. Along with high fees being charged by the ports, unfortunately we see more and more shipping lines using neighboring ports.</p><h4>How important is your international network?</h4><p>To provide the best supply chain solutions, we have to have an excellent international network. With such connections, we can provide the best logistics solution to our clients in terms of quality of service, the timeline for deliveries, and dependability at the best competitive prices. Hence, the network connections are very critical for a business such as ours. We also act the same way for our international partners as we facilitate their needs in the local market.</p><h4>How do you rate the regulatory environment in Oman?</h4><p>The regulatory system is improving and currently the government issues special licenses for customs clearing staff. Most of the customs clearing operations are very simple and clear, which saves a lot of time in the process of clearing goods. The Supreme Council for Planning is developing master plans for various logistics hubs in Oman, and one that is being currently studied is the South Batinah Logistics Hub, which would boost logistics operations in Oman.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-result-of-commitment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the highlight achievements of ARS Palic in the Dominican insurance industry?</h4><p>Ours is a company that stands out for its vast experience in the sector and its strong economic and financial backup—we are the partner-company of Grupo Financiero BHD and Grupo Sura. These are two business groups highly recognized in their respective countries, which decided to enter the Dominican market during a period of reform in the health insurance sector, as they foresaw many business opportunities. This is the oldest company in the insurance sector in the Dominican Republic; however, the company underwent a rebranding process in the early 2000s, from which ARS Palic was born in 2003. The firm was established as a result of the groups' social commitment to this country. In this context, we have been the fastest growing company in the market over the past five years, which has made ARS Palic the leading institution in many segments of the insurance sector, having enabled us to gain trust and a strong reputation throughout society.</p><h4>What are the main benefits of being part of as strong a business group as Grupo Financiero BHD?</h4><p>Being part of such a strong financial group has given us a boost in terms of reputation and recognition among many individuals and companies from day one, as well as market positioning. Also, being a partner of Grupo Sura—a key player in the development of the health sector in Colombia—has given us other competitive advantages, such as know-how.</p><div class="quote">“The insurance market in the Dominican Republic offers much future growth potential."</div><h4>How does ARS Palic work toward educating the population on insurance products and services?</h4><p>The current GDP share of the insurance industry is around 1.3%, which is smaller than our regional neighbors. For that reason, the insurance market in the Dominican Republic offers much future growth potential. That 1.3% in our country could easily be doubled. In fact, I would add that the health insurance segment is one of the fastest growing and offers the greatest potential; 10 years ago, health insurance represented just a small segment of large insurance companies, whereas today it is larger than the general insurance segment, which is why there are companies solely dedicated to this particular line. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when talking about the health insurance segment; 65% to 70% of the income of companies similar to ARS Palic comes from social insurance. For that reason, we must work on educating people about insurance, and our development is tightly linked to the expansion of the labor market in the country. Therefore, as levels of informality in the economy decrease, the sector will grow. In this context, we are working toward that goal with the authorities and various other institutions. However, that is a common goal at the national level, because the informal economy still represents 55% of the overall economy. Additionally, as per capita expenditure grows, so will the sector.</p><h4>What are the products with which ARS Palic is experiencing the fastest growth?</h4><p>The current balance of our income is 65% from social insurance and 35% from private plans. However, high levels of inflation are impacting our products and those of the entire health insurance sector.</p><h4>What measures does ARS Palic implement regarding quality control at its providers?</h4><p>Currently, we have over 5,000 service providers, though the standardization of their processes is rather complex. However, we hold daily meetings with both service providers and clients in pursuit of excellence, one of our key goals as a company. Additionally, we continuously apply international protocols to improve the quality of our services and products, and we carry out internal controls to the highest quality levels. We train our employees in this field to strongly develop those processes in-house. I think this is another of our competitive advantages nowadays.</p><h4>How is ARS Palic building bridges between the company and its clients?</h4><p>The relationship between ARS Palic and its clients is built through several other agents. However, we have positively worked to become closer to clients, while respecting the work of our agents. In this context, we carry out hundreds of activities every year at the premises of those companies to build such bridges. Additionally, we have subscribed the company to many social events and activities in the social sphere related to the prevention of health hazards and diseases. For example, we became involved in activities and health campaigns that concern the whole world, such as breast cancer prevention. ARS Palic is very concerned about this disease, and we decided not to charge any co-payments to patients undergoing a mammography. Finally, I would like to highlight our large investment in PR and marketing to get closer to our clients. Also, we have deployed mobile units for people to better learn how to conduct self-controls to prevent breast cancer with highly qualified doctors who dispense advice. This is just one example of the kind of activities we carry out to make ARS Palic well known and stand out in such a competitive industry. Since 2009, we have also been official patrons of Operation Smile, an international foundation that aims to reintegrate into society disadvantaged children suffering from cleft palate or lip problems, through free reconstructive surgery. With this project, we have given smiles to more than 400 children.</p><h4>What are the company's expectations for 2014?</h4><p>Our future plans include providing continuity to the organic growth process we started some years ago, maintaining our leadership position in the industry, and increasing our market share—we currently have a 21% market share in the private sector. Also, we will continue updating our services and products to meet the demands and needs of the market, all while continuing to invest in technology across all of our processes. In fact, I would like to highlight the fact that we are the only ARS in the country offering its own interactive mobile app to our customers. Finally, we will also expand our national branch network to better cover the geography of the Dominican Republic, and our clients.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How far has Halyk Bank progressed toward being Kazakhstan's number one bank?</h4><p>If we talk about the period since 2011, then we can see that Halyk is continuing to grow as a bank and business. We have, on average, around 5%-9% annual growth in total assets. Net profit is increasing at an even higher rate and, overall, our loan portfolio is increasing at an average of around 10%. In 2012, the major milestone was that we approved a new strategy for the next three years. We are on target to become the number one bank in Kazakhstan. We are number one in most market segments, including net income, retail deposits, and total deposits, though we are not number one in terms of total assets. This is the main target for us. We also will continue to grow and develop in the other markets in which we're present, namely Russia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. Halyk Bank is diversified with regard to its products and clients. In 2012, we approved and looked at a new strategy on dividend payments, where we said that Halyk Bank will pay dividends on common shares each year amounting to 15%-50% of consolidated net profit. In 2013, we already paid dividends on common shares within the framework of a new dividend strategy. Also in 2012, we established a new company, a subsidiary of Halyk Bank, which is to deal with the management of distressed assets. This was allowed under new regulations to oversee the cleaning up of bank balance sheets.</p><h4>It is expected that the merging of Kazakhstan's pension funds will be completed by the end of 2013. What impact will this have on Halyk Bank?</h4><p>The pension reform was announced in January 2013, and has been an ongoing concern for us. Halyk Bank was offered BTA Bank shares in exchange for our pension funds. With more than 33% out of overall pension assets under management in the pension system, we have the biggest pension fund in the country—even larger than the state pension fund. It is the best pension fund in the country in terms of quality of assets, branch network, and presence around the country. For us, it is bad news that we are losing part of our commission business, which was profitable for us. We were earning fee and commission income of $100 million per annum on average from the management and administration of pension assets. At the same time, if you look at the total income of the group, the income derived from the pension fund was around 10%, so it is not extremely significant, but in terms of commissions it was quite significant. Despite this, we've been growing in accordance with our targets in the retail business, more than 20%, while corporate banking is growing around 10%, SMEs are growing around 15% for medium companies, but in small companies there is no growth. We finalized the due diligence of BTA and provided our indicative and non-binding terms regarding the potential acquisition to JSC Samruk-Kazyna, which were not accepted. Therefore, our negotiations over the potential acquisition of BTA have been discontinued and we are no longer considering this transaction. We opened two new branches in Georgia, and we continue to look to the Russian market as a strategic target. Kyrgyzstan is growing organically and we are looking at the competition that is growing in the local market there.</p><div class="quote">“We are outperforming our budget, improving net interest income, and generating new commission business."</div><h4>What were the main drivers for such growth?</h4><p>We are outperforming our budget, improving net interest income, and generating new commission business. These are the major drivers, and it is because portfolio growth is better than we expected. The rates were conservative, but we achieved a better result in our portfolio in the commission business despite the negative news about our pension funds. They are not performing on the budgeted numbers because pension assets today are not invested properly. The National Bank, in January 2013, implemented an embargo that does not allow the investment of pension assets in corporate securities. Over the year, pension assets were only invested into government securities or deposits, which were mostly current accounts because there was no long-term strategy for the pension funds. Overall, the returns on pension assets on the country this year are far lower than usual. That is why the income from the pension funds is lower than we budgeted. Our net income will be around KZT74 billion.</p><h4>What is the distribution of your portfolio?</h4><p>Around 58% of the balance sheet of the bank is represented by the net loan portfolio, out of which about 20% is retail, more than 10% is SMEs, and about 70% is corporate.</p><h4>Halyk Bank has regional operations in Russia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan. How do these markets compare to that in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Of course, all three markets are quite disparate and we see different challenges. There are different regulations, competition, and it is a dissimilar market as a whole. For example, in Kyrgyzstan, we were making a profit and being quite successful even during the financial crisis and the war there. People were still repaying their loans, which was really surprising. The performance of the Kyrgyz bank is really good and it is growing organically. We are number five or six in the market. In Russia, of course, we are a relatively marginal player, as there are around 2,000 banks, which contrasts with Kyrgyzstan's 15. The client base is also different. In Russia we target clients who already have business links to Kazakhstan under the new Customs Union. We seek out Russian companies that have business in Kazakhstan and Kazakhstani businesses in Russia. In addition, we focus on SMEs there because of the limited exposure. Competition is tough because our rates are higher, so we have to compete differently, also looking more at retail in the coming years. In Georgia we also feel quite good because we entered the market after the crisis. The bank was created in 2008, and we started working with clients in 2009.</p><h4>Non-performing loans (NPLs) are still an ongoing issue for Kazakhstan's financial system. What needs to be done to address the problem?</h4><p>Many new instruments have been created, including the distressed assets fund under the umbrella of the National Bank and also new legislation on taxation, allowing banks a two-year grace period if they write off the loan from the balance sheet, or create a company for the distressed assets. However, the procedures are so cumbersome and difficult that they take several years for completion, which means you cannot use any of the instruments. For example, the write off of the bad loans for the tax exemption has meant that it has been two years and no banks have managed to clean up their balance sheets because you almost have to go bankrupt. You have to go to all the regions of Kazakhstan and must go through all the assets and guarantees to sell everything to figure out what the defaulted borrower has in or outside the country. Only then can you go for the write off. It is the same situation with the state's distressed assets funds.</p><h4>What is Halyk Bank's strategy for growth and development locally and regionally?</h4><p>We are targeting a minimum of 10% growth. We will continue to grow in each segment in Kazakhstan, and will put more effort and investment into developing our IT and human resources. IT, online services, mobile banking, and an expanded ATM network all form part of our strategy to reduce costs, as building new branches is expensive. Some bubbles are going to be created in this sector, as can be seen in Russia, so we intend to remain conservative, especially in our consumer lending practices. In Kazakhstan, where consumer lending is growing more than 20% and some banks are growing at 70%, I do not foresee a healthy development of the sector. Halyk Bank is the only bank to provide loans backed by the salaries of employees of companies that have projects with the bank, either through overdrafts or by automatically deducting the amount due from their salaries. In contrast, other banks just issue loans at shops or online without proper analysis. It is a lot of work to maintain the high quality of the loan portfolio. In 2013, we repaid two outstanding Eurobonds, one with original placement of $300 million in May 2013 and the other with original placement of $500 million in October, 2013 out of our own funds utilizing existing liquidity. In 2014, we may look into returning to the capital markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Telecomunicaçíµes de Moçambique (TDM) contributed to the economic development of Mozambique?</h4><p>TDM is 90% state-owned, with the remaining 10% owned by its employees. We compete with other market players on an equal basis. We also aim to provide quality solutions to telecommunications operators, organizations, and people contributing to the growth and development of the country.</p><h4>How would you characterize the ability of Mozambique's telecommunications infrastructure to meet the needs of rapid economic growth?</h4><p>We have modern and robust telecommunications infrastructure, but for the level of development at certain poles, it remains insufficient. There are challenges ahead, namely regarding investment in new infrastructure and in strengthening existing services.</p><h4>What role does TDM play in the development of infrastructure?</h4><p>TDM is the main provider of telecommunications infrastructure in Mozambique for landlines, backhaul for mobile telephone services, broadband services, and the internet. As such, TDM is a major player in the economic development of the country. It is the only player in fixed-line telecommunications services, which, as you know, are in decline. Up to 2010, our network was the only one linking all the provincial capitals through a national broadband transmission network using 10,000 kilometers of fiber-optic cables. This infrastructure has allowed TDM to satisfy demand. TDM also provides ADSL connections and a CDMA network that covers all provincial capitals and major cities. We have been providing CDMA services for voice calls and the internet to reach areas inaccessible through normal cable and fiber optics. We recently upgraded the CDMA network to 800 MHz. Recently, we also launched a more comprehensive service in an effort to cover more customers and more people. We have also extended this to all products due to the increase in mobile phone usage, but we also aim to introduce new services like SMS and email, and possibly media in the future.</p><div class="quote">“Due to the resurgence of coal and gas, growth in certain provinces has been substantial."</div><h4>What is the main challenge to ensuring that Mozambique's telecommunications infrastructure reaches the entire population?</h4><p>Infrastructure is very expensive to put in place, and we have to go deep in order to reach everyone. We need to address universal access, which means that we need to reach some areas that are not commercially viable, but rather of social or nationally strategic consideration. If people interact and communicate, they will be able to participate in the development of the country. We have moved from being a public to a private company, but our core mission has remained to provide infrastructure to everyone while simultaneously dealing with issues related to the introduction of an open market.</p><h4>How do you balance TDM's social and commercial goals?</h4><p>This is a difficult balance to maintain, but throughout 2011 and 2012 we achieved a positive balance sheet. We are working hard to provide infrastructure to everyone as soon as possible, especially at hospitals and other public facilities. This, along with the connectivity of schools, is something that we would really like to realize. It is only a matter of time, but the small projects are often the most difficult.</p><h4>What is your expansion plan for the network backbone ?</h4><p>We now have two cables, one offshore and one that runs onshore along the coast. The problem with submarine fiber-optic cables is that they are very expensive to repair. It costs a minimum of $500,000 every time you have to repair the cable. We are now trying to lay a new cable through the interior of the country in order to cover the regions that are currently neglected. We are also introducing a Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) program, which will provide fiber-optic connections for homes and businesses. This will initially be available in 12 cities, but will certainly expand to others. We have invested heavily in regional networks and these are being used by all of the current telecommunications operators. We now have to work to provide access to customers. This is one of the biggest—in terms of the size and level of investment—and most ambitious projects that we have on the table.</p><h4>How has growth in the coal and gas industry affected the needs of telecommunications infrastructure in Mozambique?</h4><p>Due to the resurgence of coal and gas, growth in certain provinces has been substantial. Investment has led to economic growth and increases in demand for telecommunications services, particularly data. To respond to this demand, TDM has put in place upgrades and increased backbone transmission capacity. The network extension has been implemented in some district centers in Cabo Delgado, and it is a part of the project used to link Mozambique to Tanzania. Design and procurement is our response to the demand of the gas and coal sectors.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>We are working on a fresh strategic plan to meet the needs of the new market. We aim to implement a structural program in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the business and to better adapt. We would like to improve the sales of major products and services and to continue addressing the tariff issue. We aim to improve services and debt collection and implement certain regulations. We also want to improve links to the network backbone, connecting the remaining neighboring countries; a further 2,300 kilometers brings us closer to the 10,000-kilometer mark. We also plan to work on the fiber-optic networks of major cities, raising their length to 1,106 kilometers, which will bring eventually us to the 12,000-kilometer level. Ultimately, we need to provide the necessary infrastructure for universal communications, covering every province deep into the country, and we will have to ensure the maintenance and high performance of this network. We aim to improve the quality of the services provided and continue to ensure a return on fixed assets in the company by actively ensuring synergies between the companies within the group. We are 74% shareholders in mCel, 50% in TVCABO, 50% in the Telephone Directory (Yellow Pages), and 100% in Teledata. We are certain that some of the operators will apply for the fixed service, where we enjoy a distinct advantage, but in order to remain competitive we must combine both fixed and mobile services, the latter falling under the remit of mCel. Optimizing human resource capital by reorganizing the resources of the company is also a priority, and requires the consolidation of training programs. We also have a restructuring program yet to be fully implemented; we have about 1,469 employees, which is excessive for a high-tech company like TDM. This is an issue, as, on average, every employee in Mozambique may support up to five others financially. If we let 100 people go, we could be creating difficulties for 500 people. Naturally, this is one of the most challenging issues we will be facing in 2014.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investment opportunities does the opening of Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) present for companies operating in the GCC?</h4><p>Kizad is part of an initiative to promote industrial development and diversify GDP contributions. It acts as an enabler that allows companies investing in different clusters within Kizad to add tremendous business value through innovation and economies of proximity. Aluminum is one of the key clusters available today at Kizad and opens up a number of potentials on the downstream side. In terms of clusters we have the aluminum, steel, and engineered metal clusters, with logistics, food, and mixed-use clusters also available to investors, providing a variety of industrial activity. There are three key advantages that Kizad provides to companies that have a market within the GCC and are looking to expand, or companies that are interested in the Middle East as a new market. The first is excellent access to global markets. Secondly, we insist on operating a low-cost environment, and lastly we make it easy for investors to do business with us. The minute that you are set up in Kizad as an industrial project, you are able to benefit from cost advantages in three areas. The first is that firms are exempt from all customs duties on their capital equipment. During operations, we also exempt companies from customs on the importation of raw materials that come through Khalifa Port. The most significant exemption, though, is finished products. Here, the cost of selling a product includes capital costs, raw materials, operating costs, overheads, and profits, as well as financing costs. If you are within Kizad, we are able to issue a company a certificate that exempts it from GCC market taxes as well as the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA), where companies do not pay any customs duties to do business. That is really a key advantage. The other is that, obviously, there are no taxes on companies or on personal income, either.</p><h4>What is your current progress on Stage One, and when will Stage Two begin?</h4><p>The Stage One and Stage Two idea is a highly fluid one. Stage One involves 55% of the area, or 51 square kilometers. We have completed the infrastructure, including at the adjacent Khalifa Port, which is the first and only semi-automated port in the region and now completely integrated with Kizad. In just one year, Khalifa Port went from a pristine stretch of reclaimed land to a busy hub, serving 17 shipping lines, offering 18 direct services, and connecting more than 40 ports directly. As of October 2013, the container terminal at Khalifa Port handled a record breaking 100,081 TEUs. This is the highest number of containers ever handled in one month at Khalifa Port and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. In a year-on-year comparison to date, Khalifa Port's container terminal operations are more than 12% higher than in the same period of 2012, with a total throughput of 712,342 TEUs between January and October 2013. Growth hit 27% in October 2013 compared to October 2012. This is a part of our business plan and growth strategy. It also helps with our investors' distribution costs and gives them the connectivity they require. Now, in terms of industrial zones, all of Area A, including the highways, storm water, potable water, combined waste water, seawater cooling, process water, gas networks, and electrical distribution networks—high, medium, and low voltage—are already in place and operational. The idea is that we are able to offer quality infrastructure and transportation, and offer a framework that allows investors to “plug in and play." In terms of backers already establishing facilities at Kizad, we have over 40 investors busy building and preparing their operations for launch in 2014. These include TALEX, Brasil Foods, KSB, and Polysis, to name a few.</p><div class="quote">“Kizad is part of an initiative to promote industrial development and diversify GDP contributions."</div><h4>Kizad is primarily here to serve Abu Dhabi, which is only 40 kilometers away. Additionally, how can the industrial zone contribute to the Dubai and Al Ain economies?</h4><p>Obviously, industrial projects do have a coverage area. The minute that you bring a factory in, you find people working from all over the UAE, so in terms of staffing the benefits are for all the Emirates. In terms of the actual industries producing out of Kizad, I am confident that the output, be it automotive alloys from TALEX or spare parts for pumps from KSB, will affect all markets positively, not only in the UAE but the whole GCC and greater Middle East region as well.</p><h4>How will Kizad complement nearby free zones in Jebel Ali and Abu Dhabi Industrial City (ICAD)?</h4><p>Jebel Ali is much more focused on logistics. It is all about repackaging and redistributing. Its industrial footprint over the last 10 years has been very minimal. Our zone is an industrial zone. By sheer mass, 90% of the net leasable land is for industry—heavy, medium, and light industry. That is where we complement each other. Having a logistics zone next door allows you to have all the large shipping lines calling at that port, which makes it much easier for industries to benefit from low operating costs in terms of shipping. There are key advantages in having an industrial zone right next to a logistics zone. Firms such as Emirates Aluminium (EMAL), Borouge, Emirates Steel, and all of the other major producers, are becoming very attractive to shipping lines because they are much more competitive. They can drop their price on the way in because they have revenue coming back.</p><h4>How will vertical clustering in the park benefit primary industries?</h4><p>Aluminum is usually made in pot lines, where it becomes liquid at 750-800 °C. After that, it goes to the cast houses, where it is made into bars or ingots. That is necessary because the client is probably not close by. The producers cannot ship it in liquid form because it cannot be kept at high temperatures. However, if you are next door, then material can be transported directly. Special crews leave EMAL, for example, using an innovative route that we call the hot material road. The types of vehicles that are able to transport aluminum in hot molten form use this road to deliver directly to the manufacturing site. Now, for example, TALEX uses the aluminum at 450 °C. It comes at 750 °C, therefore leaving 300 °C of energy that it can use. So, rather than 40% of its cost going into re-melting the aluminum and then another 10%-15% to generating heat in order to be able to produce steam and other utilities, it is saving 40% and generating other utilities to cool it. This is a major advantage.</p><h4>How will the Etihad Rail network support companies operating in Kizad?</h4><p>Kizad is benefiting from the first rail infrastructure in the UAE through the Etihad Rail network. From the outset our master plan has indicated rail access to a number of plots. We worked with Etihad Rail at the planning stages, and in advance of the launch of the network, Kizad built in the entire culvert infrastructure, which will eventually allow the trains to pass right through the industrial zone.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the business network in Santo Domingo compare with the other economic areas of the Dominican Republic, and what are its strengths?</h4><p>The business network in Santo Domingo is organized, representative, and coordinated. Numerous business associations that operate throughout Greater Santo Domingo organize it, and it is representative in the sense that it covers a wide range of sectors of the national economy. Umbrella organizations, such as the National Council of Private Enterprise (CONEP), the Industry Association of the Dominican Republic (AIRD), the National Organization of Commercial Companies (ONEC), or our own Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production focus on particular issues in coordinating the various companies.</p><h4>Who are the principal economic players in the Dominican market?</h4><p>I cannot say that there are a few players that monopolize the economic activity of the country. In this country, we are approaching a genuinely democratic business environment, wherein each sector and each participant has a valid point of view and where no one is sidelined. The process of harmonizing these diverse representative organizations is enriching the business sector.</p><div class="quote">“The business network in Santo Domingo is organized, representative, and coordinated."</div><h4>Why is the development of a diversified economy important for the Dominican Republic, and how does the work of the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production fit into this objective?</h4><p>A diversified economy ensures, as the old saying goes, that we don't put all our eggs in one basket. By doing this, we can counteract the fluctuations of commercial and industrial activity. The role of the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production, and that of all the regional chambers that nationally comprise the Fedocámaras, or federation of chambers, is to have an even and balanced point of agreement for all members. These members come from every corner of the country and have businesses or companies of varying sizes from the full range of economic sectors. As such, the chambers of commerce and production, like that of Santo Domingo, become the ideal space to discuss and make proposals for public policy geared toward the sustainable development of national economic activity. Every day, we assume such responsibility either independently or by joining forces with the rest of the business sector in Santo Domingo and the country at large.</p><h4>How can you encourage the private sector to contribute to economic development in Santo Domingo by participating in discussions on policy and economic strategy?</h4><p>As everyone in the country recognizes, this collaboration is indispensable, without which we would become divided and end up in an endless struggle between the two sectors. Indeed, through the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production, we provide critical support and collaborate efficiently with every public sector initiative, starting, for example, with the Company Register and the SMEs program, which has recently been favored by the national authorities. Another example of this public-private collaboration is the setting up of the Single Window, through which we will reduce costs and facilitate the establishment of new companies.</p><h4>What are the main business opportunities that Santo Domingo is providing to companies toward making it a hub for the Caribbean region?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is situated in a privileged and strategic geographic position in terms of the Caribbean and Central America. However, we must recognize that we haven't made the most of our potential in this sense, perhaps because we haven't been capable of overcoming an island mentality. However, we seem more aware of these advantages and this is evident in the major investments that have converted our ports into regional hubs. We also have examples of industries that have successfully penetrated international markets. However, our potential is much greater, and in this sense it is necessary for the public and private sectors to unite in designing and implementing a strategy that allows us to take advantage of our location.</p><h4>How does the Chamber make policies that promote the diverse demands and necessities of its members?</h4><p>Fundamentally, we are organized according to our respective services: the Company Register and the Single Window program, international business opportunities and related negotiations, SME services, and ensuring of the institutional sustainability of SMEs beyond simply getting set up. The latter is done by promoting the development of innovative options and opportunities in trade via technology and through administration that guarantees the efficiency and transparency of our services.</p><h4>How does the Chamber help local companies to augment their market share?</h4><p>There is a wide range of methods. If I were to focus on just one, I would choose creating links with external or internal companies in a way that can complement their services, requirements, and help them find clients.</p><h4>What are your priorities for sustainable growth?</h4><p>The current priority, in addition to the efficient management of the Single Window and the Company Register, is the development of new e-commerce projects. We are concentrating on this without neglecting the positioning of the country in international markets through negotiations and commercial agreements.</p><h4>What is the outlook for 2014?</h4><p>The outlook and hope for 2014 is that the Dominican economy improves for the wellbeing of the population at large and the consolidation of internal democracy.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent is access to financing a major constraint on development in Mozambique?</h4><p>Unfortunately, the access to credit, especially for national entrepreneurs to fund their participation in megaprojects at different stages (upstream, medium stream, and downstream), is still difficult and the new discoveries of natural resources pose even more challenges to national credit institutions taking into account their inadequate funding structure, being specialized in short-term lending operations. To mitigate this situation the government decided to establish Banco Nacional de Investimento (BNI), a national investment and development institution. In this capacity, BNI provides financial advisory services and finance infrastructure to all sectors of the economy as well as their respective value chain using its balance sheet funds or through a co-financing approach. As of December 2012, BNI is 100% owned by the Mozambican government. The main objective is to bridge the government's development lines of credit to the private and public sectors.</p><h4>How are you working with SMEs to assist with access to financing?</h4><p>We prepare them to be listed on the stock exchange. In Mozambique, the main source of funding SMEs comes through commercial banks, not recommendable for seed capital. Therefore, our role is to offer an alternative approach by helping them in IPO operations and taking a minority stake with exiting clauses. This financial arrangement improves SME risk profiles and makes them eligible to be listed in the second stock exchange window and bankable for commercial banks and other financial providers.</p><div class="quote">“The country has grown by around 7% annually for the past decade, and I think this process will continue."</div><h4>What services and expertise can BNI provide for international investors coming into Mozambique?</h4><p>For those investors without an office representative, BNI is ready to serve as their Project Management Officer (PMO) and facilitate money transfers using our world chain of correspondent banks, as well as provide a variety of corporate advisory services. Our knowledge of the market is extensive, enabling us to advise and provide reliable information.</p><h4>How can the government oversee the development of natural resources so as to ensure sustainable long-term economic development for Mozambique?</h4><p>It can accomplish that by making sure all stakeholders are involved in every project, especially non-renewable resource projects, and this can be done by setting up friendly legislation and streamlining procedures for starting up and doing business. I am talking about improving the business environment, even considering the huge effort already made by the government in this respect, as investors can now register an SME in a single day.</p><h4>What balance should be struck between physical infrastructure and the regulatory framework?</h4><p>I think both are very significant. The regulatory framework doesn't cost anything, so it should be prioritized. For physical infrastructure, it is possible, along with a good regulatory framework, to finance projects using the public-private partnership (PPP) method. With the private sector involved, it is possible to improve infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications, which are vital to boosting the competiveness of the Mozambican economy.</p><h4>What does Mozambique's recent foreign currency credit rating upgrade by Fitch signal about the economy?</h4><p>It means that investors' money in Mozambique is safe and borrowers can raise external funding and get a lower spread. In this sense, it was a positive move to facilitate development and deepen the capital and foreign currency markets. It also sends a signal that the country's macroeconomic management is holding, solidifying the country's risk profile.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy in 2014?</h4><p>The country has grown by around 7% annually for the past decade, and I think this process will continue. Within five years I expect that GDP will have grown from $12 billion to about $30 billion and four times by 2030, taking into account the output of the current investment in mineral resources. This increase in the country's GDP will consequently increase GDP per capita.</p><h4>As we are in an investment phase, is it possible that we will see 8% GDP growth in the coming years?</h4><p>During an investment period, investors, inevitably, import more. After that period is done, in around 2018, those projects will start generating output. Afterwards, we can expect to see our GDP growing on that magnitude and improving our current transaction account.</p><h4>Why Mozambique?</h4><p>A potential investor in Portugal once raised the same question: give one reason why I should invest in Mozambique. I told him that there were too many reasons. For one, it is over 500 years since Vasco de Gama came to Mozambique and named it terra de boa gente, which means land of good people. If that was Vasco da Gama's perception at that time it is clear that the environment has improved substantially since then, and this is why we see many investors are coming and investing in Mozambique. The investment climate is solid and the people are waiting with open arms.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Times of Oman, the Sultanate's original English-language daily, developed?</h4><p>In 1974, an English newspaper was perhaps just a dream for the people of Oman. The Times of Oman would not have come into being if a telex from Singapore had not reached the late founder, Essa bin Mohammed Al Zadjali's desk, while he was serving as Director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The much-talked-about telex came from a company called Flying Tiger Corporation based in Los Angeles, US, asking for over-flight permission and, as the director of the department, it was Essa Al Zadjali's duty to give permission to commercial, military, and individual flights flying over Oman. The telex sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was addressed; “Muscat, Oman, Saudi Arabia." Infuriated by the way the telex was addressed, Essa Al Zadjali had three days of soul-searching without taking any action on the request made in the letter. Soon, he convinced himself that it was not the mistake of the sender, but that something ought to be done to make the country known to the outside world. Of course, in the 1970s there were neither any radio nor TV stations. Essa felt that it was the absence of an English newspaper that kept Oman in obscurity. The idea of the Times of Oman germinated from this incident. Essa Al Zadjali contacted the concerned authorities and in 10 months' time, the paper was out on the stands. Oman witnessed the birth of the Times of Oman, the country's first English-language newspaper, in an exciting tabloid format on February 23, 1975. Having started off as a weekly, it grew to become a daily.</p><h4>How would you assess the Times of Oman's current market position and characterize its editorial exposition?</h4><p>The print media is in disarray across the world. But that is not the case in Oman, at least. It is true that the readership of the printed version of newspapers has been declining over the past several years. Yet, the Times of Oman, the most endearing newspaper in the Sultanate for decades, has been ruling the media scene. The newspaper, to say it with utmost humility, has defined news, set benchmarks, and reset the norms of journalism in Oman. The Times of Oman leads the market and its leading position has not changed since the day it was launched nearly 40 years ago. We, at the Times of Oman, enjoy the largest share of advertising revenue in this country. In the coming years, we aim to grow far ahead of the market. We would like to have much higher ratings with our readers.</p><div class="quote">“We are keen on providing a platform for aspiring journalists to start their journey in the field of journalism."</div><h4>What is Times of Oman's readership profile and how is it evolving?</h4><p>Our newspaper continues to attract mostly expatriates, for obvious reasons. For most of them, the Times of Oman is a source of local information, announcements, and a way of connecting with this country. This factor has remained unchanged for years. But now, what is heartening is that we have more young readers and a lot of new generation Omani readers. We are moving well and are perfectly poised to reposition ourselves as demands change. We now consciously put out news that is of interest to local readers, too. We are focused on being reader-centric and building lasting partnerships with them, and continue to be the most preferred source of information. In more ways than one, the Times of Oman was, is, and will remain the official chronicler of the Sultanate.</p><h4>How would you rate the availability of quality journalists in Oman, and what opportunities exist for the media to provide employment to young Omanis?</h4><p>We have experienced journalists from across the world working with us. Until now, English journalism in Oman has been dominated by expatriates. This is slowly changing. With many of the local universities and colleges offering graduate and post-graduate courses in journalism and media studies, many young Omanis are showing keen interest in working in this sector. Plenty of opportunities are there for young Omanis aspiring to work in this industry. We are keen on providing a platform for aspiring journalists to start their journey in the field of journalism.</p><h4>What are the significant trends affecting newspapers in Oman?</h4><p>Like in other parts of the world, the coming of the internet that has affected the newspaper. People have more ways of accessing and disseminating information now than at any time in history. The boom in internet usage has given people the ability to focus on specific topics of interest and avoid spending time sifting through more generalized news presentations, thus fragmenting the audience. But in Oman, as of now, people still depend on newspapers for local news and announcements.</p><h4>What is the impact of the rise in internet usage and how has this affected readership, advertising revenues, and the Times of Oman's overall strategy?</h4><p>Online and digital news usage continues to increase, with many more people opting for news on their phones, tablets, or other mobile platforms. The most spectacular change in the news environment has been the rise of social networking sites. To combat this, we have increased our presence on these platforms. But we must say that it has not affected our advertising revenues, because the Omani market has yet to begin using the internet platform for advertising. But then, if people do start advertising there in the coming years, we are ready, since we have a solid presence in the web world.</p><h4>How important has the success of the Times of Oman's own e-newspaper, timesofoman.com, been?</h4><p>timesofoman.com has hard news as its core offering and interactivity as its key component. Along with it offering a plethora of mobile- and multimedia-enabled content, timesofoman.com is a true multi-platform offering that provides viewers/users an opportunity to contribute to the news process and interact with it. The website is supported by a team of professionals and experienced newspersons. The Times of Oman is the only newspaper in the Sultanate to have an online e-paper, timesofoman.com, which has a huge readership. Both the e-newspaper and timesofoman.com are hugely popular, especially among Omanis living outside the Sultanate.</p><h4>What is your vision and growth strategy for the Times of Oman in the medium term?</h4><p>We can proudly state that we have always had a clear growth strategy and a strong execution infrastructure. The fact that we went in for an international look for the paper in 2010 proved exactly that. In a fast-changing world where developments occur rapidly, making every new technology obsolete within days, change is unavoidable and rudimentary, especially in print media. That is why the Times of Oman decided to go in for a redesign. The change that we wrought was comprehensive, as a group of internationally acclaimed designers made the switchover happen seamlessly. The Times of Oman, in its new shape and dimension, has become perceptibly sleeker and smarter. It was devised not only to grant the newspaper a distinct look and individuality, but also to keep in mind the readers' point of view, as well. It is now much easier to hold, read, and turn pages when the readers are in crowded or narrow places. The change has been widely endorsed by all our patrons, friends, and advertisers and, most importantly, our readers, whom we consider our partners, more than receivers. The daily, in its new avatar, offers far better readability, both in terms of its look as well as content. Today, we are living in an age of internet and satellite televisions, where people get news and information much faster and significantly earlier. The Times of Oman, instead of catering only to news and information, now aims to offer in-depth analysis of the news and comments to expand our readers' perspectives. We are proud that we were able to rise to the occasion, successfully meet the challenges of time, and adapt to changing dynamics. We shall leave no stone unturned to keep pace with change and evolve in tandem with the times to keep up our relevance for years on end as we move into the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What financial policies have made Tanzania's rapid growth possible and, going forward, how do you manage the risks of a fast-growing economy without jeopardizing its health?</h4><p>Tanzania is one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. We experienced very high average growth of 6.9% to 7% between 2000 and 2012. However, this has not served adequately in terms of reducing poverty. During the same period, poverty has declined at a rate of 2% to 3%. We have discovered that the fastest growing sectors like construction, transportation, and finance will not employ as many people as agriculture, which has been growing at an average of 4.3% for the past decade. The second issue to consider is political tranquility. Tanzania enjoys a climate of political stability, which has made it possible to plan our programs and implement them without interruption. Also, our economic program has been reinforced by strong monetary and fiscal policies. A third element is sound financial management, which we have also improved, and which has led to a concomitant improvement in the financial sector's performance. Studies have shown that where there is an improvement in the financial sector—there is a positive correlation with economic performance. We have experienced a rise in both the number of commercial and community banks, along with new financial institutions, such as the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB). We are also in the process of opening the Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB). These are forecast to give the economy an opportunity to guide investment. Meanwhile, we have enjoyed a relatively positive performance in terms of social security funds, which have really contributed to the financing of other sectors, particularly on the investment side. All of these have contributed to the wellbeing of society. The final factor that has contributed to our success is our focus on investment; we have been doing our best to invest in strategic areas. Our task is to identify strategic projects that will support the development of other economic sectors. We emphasize energy generation and infrastructure, which involves seaports, airports, roads, and rail, including the modernization of all of these modes of transport. By focusing on these three factors, we can drive the economy forward. We have also invested a great deal in the provision of social services, particularly in water and road infrastructure, both of which add economic value through the integration of rural and urban communities. This has allowed us to drive the economy forward at a reasonable pace.</p><h4>As Tanzania is now one of the top three destinations in East Africa for foreign investment, will capital controls be reviewed?</h4><p>The future of investment in Tanzania is positive because of our clear investment policy. We are also looking at how to liberalize our capital account. We are still considering certain parameters, as we are not completely liberalized. In particular, we are looking at an optimal position that will enable us to attract more investment by redesigning policies geared toward improving the economy.</p><div class="quote">“We are looking to the recovery of gas reserves as one of the main drivers of the economy."</div><h4>Which of your policies could incentivize investment in Tanzania?</h4><p>We are looking to the recovery of gas reserves as one of the main drivers of the economy. Currently, we are spending almost $0.44 to generate 1 kWh of electricity. However, once we have the ability and the infrastructure required to deliver our gas reserves to users, we will be able to generate electricity at between $0.04 and $0.06 per kWh. This will enable us to reduce the costs of doing business in Tanzania, and is therefore a key consideration. The second factor is that by reducing utility costs incurred by industry employment can grow, thereby creating wealth for a broader swathe of the population. Therefore, these instruments will assist us in managing the economy properly by reducing the cost of doing business.</p><h4>Affordable credit is a major issue in Tanzania. How are you addressing the inability of most individuals and SMEs to obtain financing?</h4><p>The widening of the financial base can only take place if we first introduce a regulatory authority to safeguard service providers for the benefit of all parties. The second consideration is the setting aside of a sufficient budget to ensure that the nationwide personal identification scheme is completed no later than 2015, which we have done. This will provide an interface for the link between service providers and their beneficiaries, whereby a single identification list will be available to facilitate all processes in the country, including banking. In fact, the national identification system and the widening of the financial base go hand in hand. Licensing financial institutions can be quick, easy, and affordable, which means that the expansion of financial services takes place quickly in centers of high population.</p><h4>Where does international aid fit in with the new dynamic of rapid economic growth generating wealth in the country?</h4><p>We are making efforts to reduce our dependency on foreign aid, currently at a rate of 5.5% of GDP, to 5% for 2014. This will be a serious step toward improving and relying on our own resources. We will maintain a mixture of FDI or grants where we cannot manage alone. Yet both sources must be targeted at investment in economically crucial areas that offer greater opportunities for growth.</p><h4>Vision 2025 declares Tanzania's ambition of becoming a middle-income country. How do you plan to facilitate this?</h4><p>Firstly, the goals of Vision 2025 cannot be met without a realignment of the capacities of certain key sectors. The goal of the financial sector in a developed economy is to facilitate the funding of robust human capital and requisite technology through investment. By improving the role of the private sector and banking system, as well enhancing the public sector, public management, and accountability, we can build the instruments to create rapid economic growth and achieve the goals of 2025. Our manifesto and five-year development plan must reflect the spirit embodied by Vision 2025. In this manner we can realize all of the objectives that will transform Tanzania into a middle-income country.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the World Bank's most successful programs in Turkey in recent years?</h4><p>Our partnership with Turkey goes back many years; the first loan was extended in 1950, and since then we've been involved in a lot of different things. If you're looking at things that stand out as successes, we've had a quite good run in the energy sector, including working with the regulator and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. We have supported the renewables sector and energy efficiency among industrial companies and SMEs with credit lines, and have worked with transmission company TEİAÅž to upgrade the backbone of the transmission system. Now we're working on a smart grid project with TEİAÅž and our colleagues from IFC are doing their own part by supporting private power sector investments. If you put all of that together, you get an idea of how the Turkish energy market has developed over the years, and we've been there every step of the way. We also worked with Turkey on its health reforms, which were so successful in ensuring universal access to healthcare that we are now using the Turkish case as a model for other countries to learn from. We also supported Turkey more than a decade ago in its very successful banking reform and stabilization program and have assisted the development of the sector ever since through the provision of long-term financing. Of course, we don't only do financing; we do a lot of analytical work and, perhaps, one of our most interesting and exciting projects in recent times has involved working together with the newly established Ministry of Family and Social Policies to get more women to work. This is a clear business matter. You could argue that Turkey is only flying with one and a half wings as only 30% of women participate in the labor force. This is against the average 53.02% in the OECD. Our estimates suggest that if you close the gap between male and female labor force participation, which countries like Sweden have done very successfully, then Turkey's GDP alone, as a result of that measure, could increase by 30%. This is significant.</p><h4>There has been significant growth in the Turkish economy over the last 10 years, but what are some of the key challenges that you see facing the Turkish economy in the short and medium term?</h4><p>In the short term, emerging markets are facing the normalization of global monetary conditions. This isn't happening at maybe quite the pace people thought in May 2013, but interest rates will certainly go up at some point in the US and quite possibly in the eurozone, too. And, for a country like Turkey, which is so reliant on external financing, high interest rates are likely to dampen growth prospects. In the short term, there is not much room for macroeconomic policy to support growth. Policy makers have to be a little careful about pressures on the exchange rate and on inflation and probably need to accept lower growth. But if Turkey uses this as an opportunity to tackle the underlying structural reasons as to why it is so reliant on international finance, it may actually be a good thing. The structural issues around the current account deficit are relatively independent of global economic conditions. Turkey doesn't save enough; it needs to boost its competitiveness and attract more long-term financing, particularly FDI. Why does Turkey not save enough? There are a number of reasons for that and the government is dealing with some of them, particularly on the consumer side. But, on the corporate side, some Turkish companies, particularly SMEs, are not profitable enough to save. And that's related to them being not that competitive. If you want to be more competitive, you need to upgrade technology, and for that you need to invest more, and for that you need to have access to long-term financing.</p><div class="quote">“In the short term, emerging markets are facing the normalization of global monetary conditions."</div><h4>How can Turkey attract more FDI?</h4><p>On the FDI side, Turkey is now ranked 69th in the World Bank's Doing Business 2014 report. Most of the high-income countries in the world, and several of Turkey's high-middle-income competitors such as Malaysia, Mexico, and some of the countries in Eastern Europe, have done very well and rank much better than Turkey. Now, that is just one summary indicator, but it does suggest that Turkey has work to do to improve regulations and reduce bureaucracy; including making the courts work more efficiently so that more foreign investment comes in. If you want to upgrade technologically, you need people that have the skills to deal with modern technology. And there, Turkey has a huge catch up game to play by expanding the time people spend in education.</p><h4>What sectors have potential for more growth?</h4><p>I think Turkey has done well in medium-tech sectors like automobiles, machinery, and, to some extent, metals over the last 10 years, having increased the quality of these products and, as a result, increased its global market share considerably. What Turkey hasn't been very successful at yet is leapfrogging from the current technological mix to a high-technology mix. If Turkey is going to realize the ambitions of the government's Vision 2023 strategy, this is absolutely essential. The government has some incentive schemes that may be attractive, although we have yet to see how much strategic investment they will bring in. The government has also boosted its own R&amp;D spending, and opportunities will arise from that, too. Given high food prices globally, there could also be a lot of opportunities in agriculture and agribusiness, especially in relation to improving yields, upgrading water usage efficiency, and improving domestic food processing to meet international standards, particularly in meat and dairy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for growth?</h4><p>Turkey is on the verge of moving into high-income status. Very few countries have actually have done this. Since the 1960s, only about two-dozen economies have managed it. One half of them are in Europe, and they benefited from what we call the European Convergence Machine. Turkey, in that sense, is part of Europe. In the short term, Turkey needs to moderate its growth ambitions simply because the international environment will force it to. However, if you take a five-year perspective or even beyond, I can possibly see Turkey growing at a rate of 5% a year if reforms are enacted now to strengthen its competitiveness. Indeed, Turkey has a few assets that are very much in its favor. First, it's a very young country and it will still have a growing labor force until about 2040. In that regard, it still has quite a few demographic dividend years ahead. Turkey is also very well located. Here, you're close to the largest integrated market; the EU. You're also close to potentially very dynamic developments in the Middle East and Eurasia.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of the trust sector in Colombia?</h4><p>Until 1990, trust schemes were products offered by banks; in 1991, trust companies were created as separate legal entities, independent from the banks. To date, there are 27 trust companies in Colombia—four public and 23 privately owned. There are 16 with a bank as the major shareholder. Trust companies in Colombia, unlike other countries, handle two major lines of business: investment trusts, with products such as mutual funds, individual investment portfolios, and voluntary pension funds; and trust administration, with a variety of products such as payment sources, warranties, administration and payments, and real estate trusts, among others. As of July 2013, the total assets managed by trust companies in all lines of business amounted to approximately $134.5 billion, a figure close to 28% of the total assets of the financial system, and investment portfolios handled by trust companies and their businesses equaled approximately $78.5 billion, representing 36% of the total Colombian financial system investment portfolio.</p><h4>What have been the company's landmark achievements over the past few years?</h4><p>Fiduciaria Davivienda is a financial services company legally established in 1992 with the mission to expand and diversify the portfolio services of Bolí­var Business Group. In 1999, we complemented the investment products offering by acquiring the Dafutoro Voluntary Pension Fund from Davivir PFA. In 2006, we acquired Fiduciaria Superior, including its Superior Investment Fund and real estate ventures. In 2012, we merged with Fiduciaria Cafetera, which allowed us to enter the public trust area and become one of the leading companies in the trust sector in Colombia, offering a comprehensive product portfolio to the private and public sectors. Today, we are among the top five companies in the market; we have the largest voluntary pension fund, and manage approximately $8 billion in trust assets—6% of the sector total. We differentiate ourselves from our major competitors in that we work in synergy with the Bolí­var Group of companies, such as Banco Davivienda, Leasing Bolí­var, Seguros Bolí­var, and Constructora Bolí­var, affording us great commercial strength to sell and market our products. We rely on the office network of Banco Davivienda for products requiring collections, payments, or other operations at the national and international level, and work a joint strategy with clients so the Group can offer comprehensive products for every need.</p><div class="quote">“The private sector views us as the best alternative to develop its projects with transparency and effectiveness."</div><h4>How can trust companies contribute to further attracting foreign investment to Colombia?</h4><p>Fiducia means trust. Trust schemes provide foreign investors confidence, security, and transparency, whether individually or through consortia or temporary alliances with national investors, they bring in their capital to participate in infrastructure or real estate projects. These projects require a trustee to manage the different resources allocated for payments required by the project and, once completed, distribute the earnings to participants. As the trust sector also provides collective investment funds and private equity funds diversified by a strong combination of assets and risk, we will have a greater influx of foreign investors in Colombia. Trade agreements are another excellent opportunity to attract new investors to the country and take trust business lines to other countries. Our group recently acquired the HSBC business in Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica, and we also have a presence in Panama and Miami, which, no doubt, will allow us to attract more foreign investment to Colombia.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the challenges facing the sector in the near future?</h4><p>Challenges facing the sector include: improving risk management practices; improving the management of business accounting practices by implementing IFRS so the trust business reflects all the economic facts affecting it; separating investment and administration business lines so each can be profitable and generate sufficient income over costs—in some businesses, the only income generated is through the investment of funds received, and no fees are charged for the other activities and responsibilities assumed by the trust company; promoting the financial education of non-institutional investors; creating innovative products attractive to international and national markets; ensuring efficient and effective procedures, lessening the operational load produced by the diversity of business and low standardization; and achieving greater market penetration to ensure the trust scheme is appreciated for its benefits.</p><h4>Who are the company's main clients?</h4><p>Our main clients are natural persons such as investors in investment funds and the Dafutoro Voluntary Pension Fund. Another important group is public entities, who have entrusted us with the management of their pension portfolios, in which we manage large amounts of resources. Construction companies are another important group of our real estate trust administration. Corporate customers and SMEs represent an important segment as users of assurance schemes, sources of payment, administration, and expenditures.</p><h4>In your opinion, what is the perception of the trust industry in Colombian society?</h4><p>We are a well-known industry in the Colombian financial sector for the volume of assets we handle as well as the amount of resources we manage in investment portfolios. The public sector has found a complement in trust schemes, so public institutional resources are used for stipulated purposes and, therefore, support the implementation of business in accordance to laws, decrees, and presidential directives. The private sector views us as the best alternative to develop its projects with transparency and effectiveness, especially when it requires funding and the involvement of various investors.</p><h4>What is your expected financial performance for 2013 and 2014?</h4><p>For 2013, we projected significant growth in investment funds and the Dafutoro Voluntary Pension Fund, while in the other business lines we hope to maintain participation with moderate increases. We are ending the year within budget projections. For 2014, we expect to participate in trust schemes required by large infrastructure projects and public-private partnerships (PPPs.) As for real estate, our goal is to reach a greater number of building professionals with state-of-the-art technology. We will maintain our synergy with the Group for the implementation of trust schemes that support our joint commercial strategy. For investment funds and the Dafutoro Voluntary Pension Fund, we expect greater growth—they will become our main products for the future.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in five years time?</h4><p>I foresee very interesting opportunities in the coming years. The sector is growing, and the Group has bought businesses in Central America, where the trust sector has not been formally established. We are one of the most important organizations in channeling investments between countries. The current situation in South America and the rapid development of many of its countries offer a variety of opportunities.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you expect the widening of the Panama Canal and expansion of Puerto Caucedo will impact the Dominican logistics industry?</h4><p>The impact will be that those large, post-Panamex ships will only stop at the major ports, and smaller ports like Caucedo, Freeport and Cartagena will be used as transshipment hubs to carry that cargo with feeder services to other destinations within the area.</p><h4>How would you assess the Dominican Republic's potential as a hub in the Caribbean, and how do your operations affect the region at large?</h4><p>We are developing a logistics free zone in Puerto Caucedo to work toward that very purpose. I am very positive about the country's potential in this field. The Dominican Republic has the important ingredient of local cargo, which you need to include to be profitable. We can also provide services for transshipment cargo to other destinations, since the Dominican Republic is the largest market for local cargo within the Caribbean. We are also a strong hub for transshipments to smaller countries and ports within the area.</p><div class="quote">“In the shipping industry, we have departments that do container repair and maintenance in all ports of the Dominican Republic."</div><h4>What is your vision for the development strategy of Maritima Dominicana?</h4><p>Our goal is to become a service provider for what we call “supply chain management;" in other words, we want global companies to use the Dominican Republic as an inventory hub for spare parts and products that can eventually be delivered to local customers or to clients within the region. The services that we provide involve the management of materials and spare parts inventories that can later on be distributed either locally or abroad.</p><h4>How do you adapt to the different needs of your various clients?</h4><p>Each has to manage their own inventory and manage the supply to customers via an in-house system. We then become part of that system as we offer a tailor-made provision of services to our clients. We need knowledgeable personnel to manage our IT systems in accordance with our principles. Over the past five or six years we have employed and educated a lot of people who are now capable of doing this, and can successfully integrate them into the companies we work for. We have sent employees on training courses in Panama, the US, and even Europe over the last few years precisely to be able to adapt our firm to the requirements of our clients.</p><h4>What kind of infrastructure is needed to provide the various services you offer?</h4><p>In the shipping industry, we have departments that do container repair and maintenance in all ports of the Dominican Republic. We are also a service provider of spare parts for companies such as Thermo King and Carrier, which are the major suppliers of refrigeration systems for most of the world's reefer containers. All global steam ship carriers have reefer containers, but it is impossible to know when they will require repairs to their equipment. Therefore, if we have a local hub here for these spare parts and have the ability to provide that service very quickly, that is an important element of the services that we provide.</p><h4>Do you typically focus on a special sector or client?</h4><p>We do not focus on a specific sector, as the services we provide are generic in a sense; they are not dependent on the companies that require these services because containers and reefers are the same, more or less, for all shipping lines. For example, for companies importing or exporting fresh fruits and vegetables, we can store these products in our warehouses and then, according to their requirements, we can deliver them to their local customers or to the shipping lines for export. It is a generic service, more or less.</p><h4>How do your services differ in the various ports of the country?</h4><p>Each port has a specialized service for different cargos. For example, the main container ports are Caucedo and Haina, but some containers are being handled in Puerto Plata. Haina is focused on bulk cargo, like grain, coal, or fertilizers, and general cargo like steel and lumber, while San Pedro is involved in the export of cement and the import of fertilizers. We are the agents for vessels that deliver or load different cargos depending on the location.</p><h4>How does customs clearance work and how does it benefit the client?</h4><p>It is much easier to handle the transfer of cargo from the port to the customer at the end when all the services can be combined, including the handling of the cargo in the port, customs clearance, local transportation, the management of inventory if necessary, and then final delivery. Therefore, it is a chain of services that can all be integrated to provide the delivery of that cargo to the customer at the end.</p><h4>How do you provide services for steamships?</h4><p>To be a port agent for steamship companies is again what we call a generic service; we handle the port agency of the vessel, crew changes, the supply of spare parts or provisions, and supply drinking water or fuel oil. Those are generic services that have really nothing to do with the customer services that the steamship lines provide to their customers. This is why most steamship lines today have their own offices to be in contact with the customer. In the end, generic services can be provided to any principal, even if they compete with each other on a normal basis.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2014?</h4><p>We feel that 2014 will be a relatively stable year, but in 2015 we believe we will have additional opportunities precisely because the distribution free zone will be already operating in Puerto Caucedo, which will allow for the expansion of supply chain management solutions.</p><h4>What is the significance of the new distribution free zone?</h4><p>It is important for the Dominican local shipping sector and the port. All steamship agents and freight forwarders can take advantage of those services. They will be initiated in 2014 and will then grow over the years so we can attract more and more principals to use Puerto Caucedo. It will generate more international exposure, for sure.</p><h4>How does the regulatory environment affect the industry?</h4><p>The legal structure that has to do with customs and the local authorities have to make this distribution system more efficient. If you want to develop a new market of global commerce, you also have to adapt the local legal structure to make it efficient. That does not mean we will violate any government requirements, but the systems have to be modernized, and this is an issue we are discussing with the local authorities right now. A new customs law is currently under discussion in Congress in order to make those services more efficient.</p><h4>Have single window principles been applied here yet?</h4><p>The idea is there, but it has not been applied yet. Companies have an excellent opportunity to use the Dominican Republic as a hub, but you have to be able to bring in these spare parts without having to declare them in the local market. They should rest in a free zone and then, when they are needed in the local market, they can be declared, but when you want to send them to Barbados for example, you shouldn't have to pay import taxes on cargo if you are shipping it there. This is one of the issues that the new customs law needs to cover. The same is for the export of agricultural products; it has to be coordinated effectively so that when you deliver a shipment to the airport, it cannot sit there waiting for the agriculture department to inspect it for hours. If you miss the connection and need to wait until the next day to ship it, the quality of that product will suffer. This is a problem that the local authorities have to understand and help us so that this service can be improved.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Sertecpet's operations evolved in Ecuador since it was established in the early 1990s?</h4><p>During the 1990s Ecuador lacked a clear industrial policy associated with appropriate stimuli, generating a dependent economy centered mainly on the import of goods and services both for consumption as well as for industrial inputs within the oil sector. Additionally, relations between the public and private sector were extremely weak, and the lack of public-private cooperation gave way to an economy that favored commercial over industrial initiatives granting greater benefits to activities devoted to the import of goods and services, rather than to the development of the local industrial base. Taking into account such economic and social contexts, Sertecpet was born as a positive response to the lack of national incentives. Our goal was to address the situation by developing a national industry fueled by the contribution of local skilled professionals in the oil and energy industry. We are a family-run business that has undergone some transformations during the first 10 years, transformations that have included changes to our corporate scope, vision, mission and brand positioning, as well as to the instauration of innovative processes and technologic improvements. The end result of this evolution is today's Sertecpet, a company at the forefront of innovation and the industrial process in Ecuador whose vision is to excel in the provision of integrated energy solutions. We have earned our leadership through the development of world-class products with great added value and the highest international quality and safety levels. Today, we provide services with our products and technologies under a very recognized and reputable brand; we have our own patents and we are a unique company worldwide.</p><h4>What role does technology and innovation play in your overall activities?</h4><p>During our first years of activity, the latest technology to produce our products was wholly imported from the US, Canada, Spain, Japan, and Germany. Over the years, we have been able to develop our own, patented technology and get our systems internationally certified. We operate like any other multinational company that produces technology and systems for the international market. Additionally, we have also developed unique regional projects in the field of basic, conceptual, and detailed engineering for onshore and offshore, and bottom hole tool assembly that are installed in large fields at a regional level. We firmly believe that our know-how and technology allow us to become a strategic partner of the operators.</p><div class="quote">“Hydroelectric activities are the most relevant section of the industry for us."</div><h4>What are the services you have specialized in during the last few years?</h4><p>Because of our expertise and know-how, our technology and products are excellent for operating mature oil fields. These fields are low in production and, therefore, are less profitable and require high levels of technology. Sertecpet, thanks to its integrated solutions, makes these fields more profitable, generating positive contributions for the economies in which we operate. We are usually able to increase production levels by considerable amounts, generating the corresponding impacts in revenue growth and profitability. Currently, we employ over 1,200 engineers. Our qualified staff and the software systems we have developed can carry out detailed reports and studies prior to starting operations. Our clients are provided with a range of alternatives and solutions adapted to their needs, based on increasing production and reducing costs.</p><h4>What is the future growth strategy of the company?</h4><p>Hydroelectric activities are the most relevant section of the industry for us, and in Ecuador they represent the main activities we develop. However, as part of our growth strategy, we will soon enter the renewable energies sector, targeting our participation in solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy projects. We also consider that the geothermal segment has great potential. Such growth will enable us to further consolidate our company as a provider of integrated solutions for the entire energy industry. The further expansion of the company will be based on continuing the provision of engineering and production services with the latest technology and our own developed systems and products with a worldwide projection.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Net Holding evolved since it was established?</h4><p>We started off in 1994 with SkyNet, an international express company employing three people. Starting small, we initially grew through more of a personal pursuit than rationalized decisions to build a business providing much needed service in a post-war Lebanon; it was a period of heavy rebuilding and prosperity. I think it was something I was wired for in terms of my desire to build a new business model for freight and express services in Lebanon and the region. We grew organically and started thinking more strategically. In 1998, we expanded our line of services to include freight forwarding. As the freight forwarding side of the business developed, we felt the need to separate the two lines and in 2002 we created Net Logistics, a specialized freight forwarding entity handling air, land, sea freight, warehousing, and logistics. With the two lines of business in place, we set out to widen our reach opening up operations into Syria and developing our Syria-Lebanon business. Meanwhile, we worked on developing our brand regionally. As a young company, you are the product of your environment and you should choose that environment very carefully. We wanted to have scale in the areas we chose and Dubai was a very important growth engine for us. We opened our first sales office there in 2007. By 2011 we were implementing a growth strategy, opening in Jordan, another key market of ours. The Iraqi market soon followed suit in that same year where we established operations in Erbil, Basra, and Bagdad. As Net Logistics solidified its Levant base, we started looking at tie ups to ramp up our front end delivery. In 2008, Net Holding signed on for TNT Express representation in Lebanon, a move that propelled Net Holding to be a major express and logistics player in the region. Today, we number more than 175 employees and our company has been growing steadily at an average rate of 40% per year based on a strategic mix of organic and inorganic growth and a carefully thought out market penetration plan. On the local scene, 2007 represented an opportunity for us to be part of the Beirut Port Free Trade, and we opened up our 4,000-sqm warehouse within the zone that same year. It is a project we believe in, despite several setbacks, mainly due to the volatility of our region.</p><h4>What are the advantages of the free zone at the Port of Beirut?</h4><p>Being a Levant-based company, we were keen on seeing the Beirut Sea Port become a gateway to the region; you could say we are foreseeing a mini Jebel Ali Free Zone for Lebanon. With giants like Maersk and CMA bringing large short-transit vessels into Lebanon, we strongly believe in the need for a free zone Levant hub serving Syria, Jordan, and Iraq (Iraq being the biggest market). It is a market that could potentially include more than 50 million people, strengthen economic ties, and facilitate the exchange of goods, capital, and information. We remain very committed to this project despite regional instability, and we are optimistic that things will definitely change given greater stability.</p><div class="quote">“Being a Levant-based company, we were keen on seeing the Beirut Sea Port become a gateway to the region."</div><h4>What sectors of the economy represent the bulk of your clients?</h4><p>We cater to a wide range of sectors and companies from large multinationals in the oil and gas sectors to specialized tech and telecom firms, right down to retail and individual consumers. In terms of geographic spread, I think of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan as a single market. While freight movement in Syria at this time is almost at a standstill, we are servicing a large Jordan-based Iraqi community that found itself relocating to Jordan due to the drawn out in-fighting in Iraq. We also service a large client base of Lebanese companies operating out of Jordan and Iraq.</p><h4>Why would Lebanon be a good a hub?</h4><p>One factor of course is Lebanon's geographic location. Sea freight coming from Europe to Iraq can go through the Suez Canal and around the Arabian Peninsula, or from the Turkish Port of Mersin into northern Iraq. Beirut, however, offers a much shorter transit line. Lebanon also boasts a high performing and educated workforce of professionals and skilled workers. And, with its strong foothold in finance and insurance services, it is a highly desirable location for regional businesses and multi-nationals.</p><h4>You offer a wide range of services. Which of these are most significant for your overall operations?</h4><p>Net Holding provides express services through TNT Express and SkyNet Worldwide Express, and as Net Logistics we provide air, sea, land freight, warehousing, and logistics services. Our services are equally important to us because our individual and business clients need any or a combination of two or more of our services, but the greater part of our business remains in sea and land freight. Our goal is to offer our clients a complete range of cargo and express transport solutions with timely and cost-effective delivery. We have also focused on developing our multi-modal freight forwarding services, benefiting mostly our SME clients as it offers a mix between low-cost shipping and fast, but much more expensive, air transport.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand into other areas?</h4><p>Our default position is to look for opportunities of growth in fast growing markets where we can bring in added value. We have been focusing on expanding our Iraq operation. With its huge oil and gas sector, it constitutes a large part of our business.</p><h4>Why do you lease your fleet?</h4><p>In order to lower our operational and maintenance costs, we believe that leasing aligns with our strategy of always operating a more current fleet responsive to the changing needs of the market.</p><h4>What are the challenges faced by the Lebanese logistics sector?</h4><p>The local Lebanese market will certainly benefit from decentralization. Beirut is still the only major viable business hub in the country, which is jacking up real estate costs in the city, which then translates into higher costs for freight transport, logistics, and warehousing. People aren't used to outsourcing their warehousing, stock management, and distribution and handing it over to a third party and this, we find, is an unexpected advantage. This lack of consumer maturity in terms of logistics and warehousing options is being faced with a pressing need for businesses to cut costs, and the local market is fast realizing the advantages of third party outsourcing. Another, more serious challenge that has surfaced in the last two years is the situation in Syria. Despite the inherent dangers that being there entails, we are still providing our services within Syrian territory and while we have considerably scaled back our operations, we still maintain our office in Damascus.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the logistics sector in Lebanon in the near future?</h4><p>Stability is the be all and end all for our region. We can't talk about economic prosperity without a more stable Middle East. If we are to dream of claiming, or reclaiming, the title of distribution or gateway role for our freight transport sector, things have to calm down in our region. Borders have to open up and confidence in a long-term, stable political and socio-economic context must be re-established.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Khalifa Port signify for Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi's Zayed Port has served the city for the last 40 years, but in 2011 it reached 767,000 TEUs, above its intended capacity of 750,000 TEUs. Now at handling capacity, a new, modern port with room to grow was needed. The answer was the new flagship, state-of-the-art Khalifa Port. Located at Taweelah, Khalifa Port is the new gateway to Abu Dhabi. It has an initial capacity of 2.5 million TEUs, with space to expand according to demand. Today, it handles all of the container traffic for the Emirate, supporting its long-term vision of strong, sustainable economic prosperity. Abu Dhabi Ports Company (ADPC) was formed in 2006 from the restructuring of the Abu Dhabi Seaports Authority, and is the master developer of ports and industrial zones in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Our ports, which include Khalifa Port, Zayed Port, and Musaffah Port, as well as the Western Region ports, such as Delma Port, Sir Bani Yas, and Al Sila, all provide vital infrastructure for the maritime industry, promoting the flow of imports and exports while supporting local communities, sustainable businesses, and the wider economy.</p><h4>How will Khalifa Port and Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad) complement the other two zones already present?</h4><p>Khalifa Port and Kizad are two valuable new additions to Abu Dhabi's commercial maritime infrastructure; they are new elements that complement the existing ports and facilities in the region. While Khalifa Port is the main hub port, all ADPC ports and facilities will work together to support the Emirate's growing maritime trade and develop its status as a global trading hub. The megaproject that is Khalifa Port and Kizad has been deliberately designed to be an industrial-focused zone, rather than just a free zone. While we have allowed for and do provide a free zone at Kizad to cater for a variety of investor interests, our main focus is attracting industry-related investors to Kizad's vertically integrated clusters, where raw materials will be used by midstream producers and downstream manufacturers and then exported via the excellent transport links, which include, road, air, rail, and, of course, sea. ADPC is bringing a new proposition to the table with Kizad's dedicated industrial production, logistics, and distribution zone, which supports both Abu Dhabi's 2030 Economic Vision and its future international ambitions. But, ADPC is investing in and developing all of the Emirate's non-oil ports. For example, we have invested in a new 53-kilometer-long channel to serve our port in Mussafah, which is a thriving industrial area on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi city. The new channel is the second largest in the region after the Suez Canal and is capable of handling far larger ships, which will help support industrial and business growth in this important area. Of course, Khalifa Port will claim a lot of the plaudits as ADPC's flagship facility. With Khalifa Port, we can now offer shipping lines the region's only deep-draft, semi-automated container terminal and integrated port. In addition, we can also confirm that it will be the very first port in the UAE to be integrated with the new intra-Gulf countries rail network, which is currently being developed by Etihad Rail.</p><div class="quote">“Khalifa Port and Kizad are two valuable new additions to Abu Dhabi's commercial maritime infrastructure."</div><h4>What trends have you noticed in incoming vessels?</h4><p>Vessel movements into Abu Dhabi increased in 2012, and our most recent results for Q32013 indicate that there have been just over 9,000 vessel movements this year. It should be clear that while Khalifa Port will become the hub port, Zayed Port, which has served Abu Dhabi for the last 40 years, will continue to serve the UAE's capital in most areas, aside from container shipments. Because of its size and draft, Zayed Port was never a hub port; it was always a feeder port. That is why the size of the vessels and the profile of the vessels we are now seeing are different from the ones of previous years. The first vessel that entered into Khalifa Port carried around 12,000 TEUs. This would never have been possible at Zayed Port. In addition, there were only three main ports that were served directly from Zayed Port and about 70%—80% of the maritime volume handled was feeder traffic coming from Jebel Ali. Today, just one year on from the launch of commercial operations, Khalifa Port serves 17 shipping lines, offers 18 direct destinations with direct links to more than 40 international destinations, and offers customers a global reach through direct links to the word's hub ports. This increased connectivity is valuable to our customers and is, as a result, changing the dynamic of what cargo is handled, as well as the volume of vessel movements coming into the newly operational port.</p><h4>How important is the trade increase between Africa and the GCC for ports in the UAE?</h4><p>People are talking about shifts of trade from West to East, but I think it is clear that there are a number of trading shifts taking place globally, and I think it has happened faster than anybody anticipated because of the financial crisis. The shifts are happening from the North to the South and from the West to the East. There is more trade between Africa and Asia and the inter-Asian markets and, as this is happening, I think Abu Dhabi, and the region in general, is in the right place to cater for such a change. Of course, it requires the right infrastructure to support and guide such shifts to your ports. Abu Dhabi has long been serving the trade between Europe and Asia, as well as servicing trade between Africa and Asia, but, with the new infrastructure in place, this can now take on a more global dimension going forward.</p><h4>How would you compare Khalifa Port to Asian ports such as Singapore?</h4><p>I think we are moving in the right direction. ADPC, the government, and other governmental institutions are all determined and focused on being recognized as world-class entities. We are all working together closely to achieve this. ADPC is also working closely with Singapore and Hong Kong and other ports in Asia to identify best practices and operational management excellence. For our part, we see ourselves as being in the same category in that we can offer world-class facilities; however, we have only just started. In terms of Khalifa Port, we cannot compare ourselves in terms of volumes to the first or second busiest port worldwide—not yet anyway. One of the best benchmarks to assess Khalifa Port's operational efficiency is to compare ourselves in terms of how many containers we move hourly. If you look at some of the ports in the region, you will see that they are trading between a maximum of 24 and 26 container movements per hour. However, in July 2013, our concession operator, Abu Dhabi Terminals, achieved its highest crane production rate with 43.3 moves per hour. The port also handled 81,000 TEUs in July, the most ever handled in one month in the Emirate, and in August the terminal achieved a work production rate of 142.4 moves per hour, placing it in the global top 10 for productivity. These figures are important; they make the port an attractive proposition for shipping lines, which are heavily focused on fast and efficient turnaround times in port. As a result, ADPC sees this as a key selling point for winning more business in the future.</p><h4>How do you plan to sustain these high targets while competing in a market that is dependent on the global economy?</h4><p>In terms of growth, we don't just have Khalifa Port; there is also the projected growth of the Kizad industrial zone. With the first-phase infrastructure in place, and many international investors already committed to long-term leases of up to 50 years, Kizad will certainly be a key driver of economic progress for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and will help the government achieve the targets set out in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. Of course, ports all depend on, and are subject to, shifts and changes in international trade, and we must stay vigilant knowing that our success in attracting new business cannot be allowed to become a matter for complacency. However, ADPC has the right facilities, excellent infrastructure, and cutting-edge technology as well as highly efficient procedures in place, and so all of the key ingredients to be a significant maritime hub are there.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Novartis integrate research into its business model?</h4><p>Novartis is the number two company in R&amp;D spending in the world. We invest 21% of our pharmaceutical net revenue back into research. We believe that there are still unmet patient needs and things that we can do to make their lives better. That's our contribution to society and that is what we look for in the future.</p><h4>Do you carry out your R&amp;D in the country?</h4><p>We conduct clinical research around the world, and we currently have research running here in the Dominican Republic. We have around three clinical development projects going on right now. The reason for that is because you need to power the studies with a certain number of patients in order for the product to show effectiveness. Novartis needed to open up research bases, not only in Europe and the US, but elsewhere. We do research in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia because it is important for us to continuously evaluate our treatments to ensure efficacy and safety in different types of races, genders, and age groups and ensure we are offering the right treatment to the right patient. At Novartis, we are looking for unmet needs in different areas, but we definitely believe that there is a need for more targeted treatments, so we are increasing our investments in specialty care while maintaining our interest in primary care. We continue researching in the cardiovascular arena, but we're also focusing on harder-to-treat diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and other, less common diseases. There is an unmet need, and these patients suffer, so our mission is to find a treatment. We try to understand the biology of a disease and, once we understand what happens at that level, then we find the solution around a mechanism. We are trying to understand the root causes of diseases, so we can attack them. We conduct research in a different way, and that takes allows us to be a little narrower in focus.</p><div class="quote">“We promote our pharmaceuticals products through our sales representatives to physicians."</div><h4>The Caribbean region is increasing in health facilities and demographics. How does this affect your sales?</h4><p>I think one of the most important things about the Dominican Republic is that there are about 10 million people here. As the economy progresses, people have more access to information, and as a result diagnostic standards improve, and the market expands. Our responsibility lies in terms of walking with that development. We work globally in different countries with different realities, and there are markets that advance faster than others. We use our experiences from these markets to help those that are less advanced. If we can contribute in terms of expanding people's access to medicine, it can really make a difference. That involves continuous medical education because new therapeutic areas are being discovered, and we want to share our findings with physicians. We also believe it is important to collaborate with the Ministry of Health on health economics data as we believe that healthcare spending is an investment, not just a cost, and that health research offers a means to identify and demonstrate value. Medicine can prevent re-hospitalization, reduce the length of stay in hospitals, reduce additional care required by patients, or contribute to returning patients back to the workforce. For example, instead of providing a patient with life-long dialysis, the government should facilitate a transplant so the patient can come back to society with a better quality of life and begin to contribute again.</p><h4>How do you educate public and private clinics directly?</h4><p>We promote our pharmaceuticals products through our sales representatives to physicians. Our marketing promotion and sales activities are in compliance with high ethical standards to ensure the effective and appropriate use of our products and services by patients and healthcare professions. We also have a medical department that contributes with scientific knowledge through different activities such as congresses, forums, and clinical experiences.</p><h4>How different is the Dominican Republic compared to other markets in which you've operated?</h4><p>I have been on an international track for 17 years now. And, living in different cultures such as the US, Switzerland, Russia, Chile, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic has widened my horizons. By understanding and absorbing each individual culture, it has allowed me to get a local buy-in and build rapport. This enables the company to win hearts, laying out a course of action and building excitement around it. Also, we have to realize that we are not all unique. The similarity involved in the challenges a medical sales representative faces in Moscow and in Santo Domingo is striking. People from the US and Central America can also be motivated in the same way.</p><h4>Which line of products is growing the most in this market?</h4><p>Our pharmaceutical division is our fastest growing as we are bringing in new products to the market. General medicine and oncology are our fastest-growing divisions, as opposed to over-the-counter, generics, or eye-care products. We will have completed 16 worldwide launches in the next three years in different disease areas, providing breakthrough medicine to a yet unsatisfied market in oncology, cardiology, respiratory, rheumatology, and dermatology.</p><h4>Do you interact with insurance companies?</h4><p>In terms of insurance companies in the Dominican Republic, the list of basic medicines has not been reviewed since 2006, so it's quite outdated. If there is not a constant review, patients will not benefit from new and advanced therapies because they will not be covered. For example, from 2006 until today, Novartis has launched a number of products that are not covered.</p><h4>What is your outlook for this market in the coming years?</h4><p>I think we're going through a transformation in this market and, as we develop as a country, the population should seek to satisfy the next level of their needs. The first priority is to expand access to quality products. It's not just a matter of giving people a copy of the original because it's cheaper; I think we need to give the right medicine to the right patient, ensuring efficacy, quality, and safety. Novartis is committed to R&amp;D in treatments for patients with unmet medical needs. Sustainable access to medicine requires sufficient healthcare infrastructure, distribution, and financing. Governments play a principal role in addressing these problems. I believe the Dominican Republic has growth opportunities as it develops and modernizes its infrastructure and healthcare provision. For example, the government is doing a very good job to ensure the population has access to medicines through the Protegido Program, designed to help needy patients with high-cost treatment programs, including for transplants, renal insufficiency, hepatitis B and C, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, hormone therapy, and multiple sclerosis. This is a program that covers the diagnosis and treatment for patients and, depending on your socio-economic status, you can gain full coverage or partial coverage for your medicine. This country is blessed to have such a comprehensive program that helps the needy. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are essential because we all contribute to benefit patients. For example, INDEN is an institution dedicated to treat diabetes as a whole, as it affects many organs in the long run. Its role is not just to cover interventions and treatments, but also to educate, prevent, and ensure long-term care for a successful outcome. This is where we become partners of value, because we offer education hand-in-hand with innovative medicines. It is also our interest to collaborate with the local health authorities to protect patients by establishing quality standards for the registration and approval of medications while maintaining good manufacturing and distribution practices.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

What are your strategies to achieve this?</h4><p>Our strategy is one for the long term; we don't develop strategies on an annual basis. We have a clear idea of where we want to be in five to 10 years, and are working our way toward that. Of course, we will adjust mid course as circumstances dictate, but our vision remains the same. We intend to continue strengthening our presence in the region in various sectors, while targeting an increased presence in others on the global stage. Ultimately, shareholder value creation and alignment with the Qatar National Vision 2030 is our guiding principle. More specifically, Milaha is looking to grow organically in areas where we already have a significant presence and strong foundation. We will seek to acquire in order to add a larger footprint beyond our current markets or expand our service offering. We are actively seeking to partner with other established companies that can bring complementary capabilities or innovative business models that allow us to compete more effectively and sustainably. Internally, as part of our transformation efforts, we have, and will continue to significantly invest in our people, processes, systems, and capabilities, which will lay the foundation that takes us to the next level as a group.</p><h4>Milaha reported a 30% jump in net profit to QAR574 million in the first half of 2013. What do you attribute this success to?</h4><p>Milaha's ongoing internal transformation initiatives, along with improved market conditions, drove strong performance. Externally, volume growth, combined with increased efficiencies, resulted in a continued upward trend for Milaha's port services unit. Container shipping and logistics results also improved significantly over 1H2012. Deployment of two new vessels, combined with significantly higher utilization of the offshore fleet, led to robust improvement in Halul Offshore's results relative to 1H2012. Milaha's investment portfolio posted strong results, mainly driven by dividend growth, revaluations, and market trading activities. Our internal efforts over the past couple of years to restructure our organization, capabilities, and processes have also played a role in the improved results.</p><div class="quote">“Milaha plays a critical role, both directly and indirectly, in Qatar's LNG sector."</div><h4>How does Milaha cement Qatar's role as the largest LNG exporter in the world?</h4><p>Milaha plays a critical role, both directly and indirectly, in Qatar's LNG sector. The group has a 30% stake in Qatar Gas Transport Company (QGTC), which is the state LNG transportation company. Milaha also has varying ownership stakes in nine LNG vessels, which are under long-term charters to Qatari gas producers and exporters. In 2012, Milaha increased its ownership in two of the joint-owned LNG vessels, and also began to operate these vessels commercially. These vessels were renamed Milaha Ras Laffan and Milaha Qatar. Gulf LPG, a 50-50 joint venture between Milaha and Qatar Gas Transport Company (QGTC), was formed in 2008 to own four Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGCs). The vessels are engaged in the transportation of LPG cargoes worldwide, and these include loading LPG cargoes from Qatar. Our offshore subsidiary, Halul Offshore, is the single largest provider of offshore supply service vessels to Qatar's oil and gas industry, while also holding the largest diving services contract anywhere in the world. So you can see this is a critical sector for us and we are continuously looking for ways to enhance our capabilities to play a larger role across the supply chain in this sector.</p><h4>Qatar is aiming to position itself as a leading exporter of petrochemicals. To what extent is Milaha involved in the shipment of these products?</h4><p>At this time, Milaha is a key transporter for petrochemicals exports from Qatar. We are involved in the transport of ammonia using our gas carriers, which are time-chartered to Muntajat, the newly formed petrochemicals marketing company of Qatar. In addition, Milaha is feedering, on an exclusive basis, Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) from QAPCO, Q-Chem, and Qatofin, from Mesaieed to hub ports in the Gulf. We are currently positioning ourselves to expand our offering in this critical downstream segment. Given the anticipated growth in exports from Qatar over the coming years, we are evaluating ways to build a long-term relationship with Muntajat, and bring new tonnage to this sector.</p><h4>In 2011, Milaha took over operations and management duties at Doha Port. What were the strategic decisions behind this, and how has it increased the efficiency of port operations?</h4><p>Milaha has been a provider of stevedoring services at Doha Port since the late 1950s. As part of our strategic direction setting in 2010, and in alignment with Qatar's National Vision 2030, Milaha renewed its focus on supply chain-related businesses, and was awarded the contract to fully manage Doha Port in 2012. Since then, the port services unit has embarked on a comprehensive operational excellence program, which targeted, but was not limited to, health and safety, training, operations, management, and administration. We are undertaking a process of continuous improvement to achieve internationally recognized operating standards. Milaha is currently executing a ten-point plan in Doha Port to increase throughput capacity to a minimum of 750,000 TEUs, which will be completed on schedule during 2013. Through process improvement and better utilization of equipment, Milaha has increased net vessel productivity from 10 to 15 moves per hour. Restructuring of yard and operational process has reduced truck turnaround time from 16 hours to three hours, inclusive of customs inspection procedures. Milaha has also installed the Jade Mastercare Terminal Operating System (TOS), which benefits Doha Port and the entire port community.</p><h4>Who are Milaha's main customers in Qatar, and how do you intend on expanding your customer base?</h4><p>The group is focused on providing solutions and filling critical gaps in the supply chain for three core customer segments, including the oil, gas, and petrochemical sectors; non-energy customers; and shipowners and operators. Milaha is playing a key role in the offshore oil and gas industry value chain, from supporting early stage exploration and production activities to transporting end products globally. Milaha also provides integrated freight and logistics solutions for Qatar-based customers. Our 3PL services include freight forwarding, warehousing, and land transport, complemented by ocean transport services. Milaha additionally operates a shipping agency, representing 50 different ship owners, which have regular services operating to Qatari ports. The company's port management unit manages Doha Port, the main commercial port in Qatar, as well as a dedicated container terminal at Mesaieed Port, the base for the downstream industries sector in Qatar. Our long-term strategic plan is built around expanding our capabilities and services in each of these segments to become a partner, collaborator, and solutions provider of choice to our customers.</p><h4>As Milaha is one of the leading companies in its field, do you intend to expand operations regionally or internationally?</h4><p>Looking to the future, we believe that Milaha will be able to leverage its reputation, capabilities, and strong financial base to grow its footprint in Qatar, the region, and beyond. Our aim is to expand our participation in the supply chain in Qatar through careful development of capabilities and assets, and thereby continue to play an important role in Qatar's expansion over the coming years. In the medium term, we hope to expand Milaha's global presence. We want to leverage our capabilities to build a greater presence in ocean transport, particularly in gas and clean petroleum products. We are also actively expanding our strong offshore support capabilities into neighboring markets, and exploring opportunities beyond the region. This is a time of enormous change and opportunity. We have a new vision and a fresh focus to capitalize on the benefits of having a much larger and financially strong company. There is no time like the present to leverage our strong foundation to take the company to the next level.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The political and economic problems in the region have hindered economic activity in Lebanon and reflected negatively on the profitability of most sectors. How did the Lebanese banks manage to contain these negative indicators, and were they compelled to increase provisions on non-performing loans (NPLs)?</h4><p>The deterioration of political and security conditions in Lebanon and in the region over the last two years has had a negative impact on economic activity, as well as the profitability of many sectors. Real GDP grew by an annual average of 8.3% between 2007 and 2010 and retreated to an estimated average of 1.5% a year in 2011 and 2012. This weak economic growth is attributed to a declining level of consumer confidence and investor sentiment, as well as to lower GCC demand for our goods and services, while Lebanon's tourism, migrant transfers, FDI, and non-resident capital inflows are generated mostly from GCC countries. Still, the growth of the past two years was mainly supported by domestic bank credit to the private and public sectors, as credit grew by an average of 7.8% per year, with bank credit to the private sector expanding at a much higher rate. However, the deceleration in economic activity is projected to continue throughout 2013. Lebanese banks managed to contain the deceleration in economic activity, as they are well equipped and experienced in rapidly adapting to changes in business cycles. Further, the Lebanese banking sector has shown over many decades its ability to adjust successfully and to withstand domestic or external financial and economic shocks, in addition to an increased capacity to face and overcome challenges and uncertainties. Specifically, Lebanese banks managed to absorb the economic slowdown in foreign markets, as they are operating in many regional countries such as Iraq, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, and Algeria, as well as in international markets such as France, Switzerland, Belgium, and the UK. In 2012, the quality of banks' loans in some Arab countries, especially in Syria, was adversely affected by developments in these economies. However, the credit risks for Lebanon remained to a large extent under control despite the deceleration in economic growth. Also, banks are continuously trying to improve the quality of their loan portfolio and to take provisions, as the ratio of doubtful loans-to-net total loans dropped to 3.5% at the end of 2012 and the provisions on doubtful debt stood at 75%.</p><h4>What actions have banks recently taken to tighten banking supervision, and do you believe that the Lebanese-Canadian Bank experience will not be repeated again?</h4><p>The Lebanese banking system has made great strides toward strengthening its compliance with international anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. The sector is driven by the desire to maintain its credibility in the international community, in particular with its correspondent banks; as well as to reassure its depositors, largely Lebanese citizens in the country and from the Diaspora, that their funds will not be jeopardized by inadequate monitoring or compliance practices. In fact, the banks are the custodians of depositors' funds and fully realize that safeguarding these deposits is an utmost priority. Over the last decade, the Lebanese Parliament ratified a number of laws related to AML/CFT. As the legislative process tends to advance slowly, the Banque du Liban (BDL), the central bank, took the initiative by issuing circulars and regulations to address urgent issues, as guidance from the BDL is often issued before the laws themselves are enacted. Some of the important circulars include, for example, Basic Circular No. 126, issued on April 5, 2012, which requires Lebanese banks to implement strict, risk-based know-your-customer (KYC) methodologies for vetting customers' identities, particularly regarding cross-border transactions. It also requires banks to be fully informed about the laws and regulations that govern correspondent banks abroad and to transact business in accordance with such laws, regulations, and procedures adopted by international legal organizations or by the sovereign authorities in the correspondents' home countries. Also, the Lebanese government approved in mid-March 2012 three important related laws. The first includes an amendment to the law on fighting money laundering. The government expanded the scope of Law 318 to include most financial crimes, the protection of intellectual property, the obligation of AML reporting to new categories and sectors (property developers, lawyers, and others), and modified procedures to improve the efficiency of the Special Investigation Commission. The second law deals with the declaration of cross-border money transfers, while the third law addresses exchanging tax information. The draft law on cross-border money transfers included a definition of money that covers, in addition to cash, other means of transactional payment such as commercial debentures and financial papers. According to the parliamentary committee debating this law, persons carrying cash in excess of $20,000 have to declare these funds to Lebanese customs. The third law concerns the exchange of information related to tax evasion and fraud, and gives Lebanon the legal basis to abide by OECD norms adopted by the G20 countries. In addition, Lebanese authorities are developing additional draft laws as necessary in order to eliminate any remaining legal shortcomings.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanese banks managed to contain the deceleration in economic activity, as they are well equipped and experienced."</div><h4>What does it mean for the Lebanese to be ahead of countries in the region for Basel III?</h4><p>Banks in Lebanon are currently implementing the Basel II Capital Adequacy Framework and are required to implement Basel III by the end of 2015. In comparison, the international deadline for the implementation of Basel III is 2019. The BDL issued Intermediary Circular No. 282 requesting banks to reach a ratio of 12% of total core capital-to-total risk weighted assets by the end of 2015, compared to the Basel III-mandated ratio of 10.5% by 2019. To be ahead of countries in the region, and even internationally, means that the Lebanese banking sector is solvent and liquid and is ready to rapidly implement the new capital regulations. The sector will be sending a signal to the international community about its swift adherence to international banking rules and regulations as well as to best industry practices. According to the latest available statistics, the solvency ratio of the Lebanese banking sector exceeded 12% at the end of 2012 (calculated in line with Basel II Accord), which is well above the level of 8% required by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. However, large banks in the country have much higher ratios.</p><h4>The central bank is lending to private banks at 1% interest to stimulate loan growth. What segments of the population will see this money?</h4><p>In early 2013, the BDL launched an incentive program for loans that covered most of the economic sectors, but particularly the housing sector, in an attempt to support economic growth through banking loans denominated in Lebanese pounds at favorable interest rates. As such, the BDL placed $1.4 billion at the disposal of banks at an interest rate of 1%, which means that banks can extend loans to institutions and households at reduced interest rates through this new mechanism, after the amount of a previous mechanism was fully utilized. The banks and the market responded positively to the program to the extent that the amounts allocated for new projects and a large portion of the amounts allocated for housing loans were rapidly utilized.</p><h4>At Byblos Bank, how has your product portfolio evolved over the past five years, and what has been the main focus of your growth strategy?</h4><p>Byblos Bank's strategy has always been focused on growing its portfolio in a balanced and healthy manner. Our retail portfolio recorded significant growth during the last five years and jumped from $620 million as of December 2008 to reach $1.5 billion as of June 2013, representing a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.7%. This increase is the result of both our efforts to cater to an ever-growing clientele with innovative products and services, as well as to the rise in market demand. For example, the increase in the demand for residential apartments in recent years has contributed to the expansion of our housing loan portfolio, which currently amounts to almost 44% of our overall retail portfolio. In parallel, Byblos Bank's efforts to promote subsidized loans for the productive and innovative sectors reflect the Bank's determination to support SMEs to overcome the challenges of accessing credit and to grow adequately, most importantly in rural Lebanon. In fact, Byblos Bank tops the list of Lebanese banks in offering loans that are subsidized by the Kafalat Corporation, with a market share exceeding 22%. The plan is to continue this growth trend and to attract customers seeking loans for start-up businesses in ICT. In addition to loans, Byblos Bank offers an array of credit, debit, and charge cards tailored to the needs of its clients. In 2011, we launched the first E-Branch in Lebanon and we are now implementing other innovative banking technologies aimed at transforming our branches into advice and consultancy centers to better engage with our customers and provide them other personalized services. Besides consumer banking, Byblos Bank is also one of the key players in commercial banking, as it continues to maintain a dominant position in the Lebanese market. Our figures clearly show that corporate lending has been steadily increasing, reflecting in large part rising local demand and our determination to meet this demand with expert advice and tailored financing facilities to corporate clientele. On the international level, Byblos Bank continues to expand through its subsidiaries, yet adapting to regional developments and mitigating risks through diversification and continuous financial scrutiny. As the recent turmoil has heavily weighted on the economies of countries such as Syria, Byblos Bank has readjusted its strategy and is targeting instead countries that enjoy relative stability.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government has initiated plans to renew tourism promotion efforts in Mexico. What will be the initial strategy in order to support this?</h4><p>The main objective of this administration is to make Mexico the leading country in tourism through the recognition that tourism is the lever and key factor in the economic development of the country. We will do this by diversifying our tourism products with the end target of developing new markets. We will pick up the momentum in those areas, take advantage of touristic resources, and offer our support to those that are more competitive at the national and international levels. In Mexico, it should be noted that tourism is respected. By preserving our natural, cultural, and social environment, we are making attempts to avoid the negative impacts tourism can cause.</p><h4>Tourism represents about 13% of the country's GDP. What are the important points of Mexico as a center of regional tourism?</h4><p>Tourism in Mexico is one of the most powerful engines of development. We have a great variety of attractions such as beaches, colonial cities, natural scenery, cultural diversity, and ancient history that make Mexico unique. We also have high-quality infrastructure and touristic services, and, above all else, our extraordinarily warm human resources. Travelers will see Mexico as a warm country that always receives tourists with open arms. It is a place that, thanks to its diversity, variety, and offerings, satisfies the demands and necessities of its visitors with high-quality touristic products.</p><div class="quote">“One of the principal challenges is changing the image of Mexico in the eyes of the world."</div><h4>Would you say that there is still an existing misconception about the security situation in Mexico?</h4><p>As part of the competitive agenda, we know that public security is an essential component for tourism to flourish. President Peña Nieto has instructed us to present an integrated security program for tourists. We are working with the Secretariat of the Interior (SEGOB) to generate schemes for public security in touristic destinations, which have their own dynamics, because there is a constant flow of people that some spaces cannot necessarily accommodate. Thus, we need to devise specific and preventive strategies. We are working closely with the Sub-Secretary of Prevention at SEGOB so that the Program of National Social Prevention of Violence and Delinquency aligns with the development and incorporation of our strategies once implemented in tourism places. Ideally, we want to achieve preventative schemes that will work in touristic destinations so that we will not have security problems. One example is the campaign that we conducted alongside several agencies during the Easter break in 2013, which produced magnificent results. We are also generating security protocols for specific touristic destinations and working closely with the states and municipalities to collaborate on specific protocols that respond to public safety issues. Through this teamwork, we are working to ensure that all tourist destinations have similar protocols of action and that the police are working together to enforce our decisions. Furthermore, we are seeking ways to implement a better public information scheme that is also appropriate for tourists, in addition to public security. We have to establish public traffic rules in all of Mexico's most popular destinations, and ensure that our public servants can speak the languages of the tourists. We are also working with emergency responders on how to pay specific attention to tourists and ensuring the proximity of police, hospitals, and any other services that tourists might need. This component of security is integral to what we are developing in the Secretariat with the help of states and municipalities, but also with international specialists and the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which is working extensively with the integrated security concept. Security perceptions differ among tourists at different destinations, and we tailor our programs according to the feedback we receive in various locations rather than the general security concerns in Mexico. As a country, we are seeking to communicate and be perceived as an effective responder when there are incidents, thereby approaching international standards.</p><h4>In what ways would you like to see the tourism offering become more diversified in Mexico?</h4><p>The diversification of our offering is an opportunity that Mexico has to attract market niches that have not yet been seen in our country. It is about going beyond the specialization of some touristic destinations and creating synergies among the distinct sectors. In this way, we can meet expectations and supply the demands of distinct segments of “sun and beach" tourists. However, in the last couple of years, there has been a new wave of new activities in the areas of cultural tourism, MICE, eco-tourism, and adventure tourism, to name a few. As we continue to finalize our diversification of tourism offerings, we are bringing variety and attracting visitors from emerging markets such as South America, Europe, and Asia, which represent great potential for Mexico, without neglecting the fixed markets of Canada and the US.</p><h4>What are the principal challenges that need to be addressed so that Mexico can optimize its potential as a tourism center?</h4><p>One of the principal challenges is changing the image of Mexico in the eyes of the world. We need to create a more positive image. Another challenge for the current administration is the innovation and diversification of tourism products in order to compete internationally. We need to provide more tools, carry out more programs and policies, and support organizations and companies as they become more competitive. We are also aiming to boost new tourist destinations without neglecting the already-consolidated ones, amplify what they offer, and increase the country's infrastructure in order to convert it into a world-class destination. In addition, we are working to design tourism offerings that are adequate for our visitors through strategic planning combined with public and private management. To attract investments into the sector, we are creating confidence among companies and making tourism a source of welfare for the community.</p><h4>What is your prediction for 2013?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the principal engines of economic, regional, communal, and national development. It is a sector that represents opportunities for the Mexican youth and women and represents prosperity for the country. The sector can also function as a powerful instrument that generates opportunities and fights poverty, which is something the current administration is working on intensely. We seek to make our destinations more competitive and transform our offering to meet the parameters of sustainability and high quality. This will be our new objective in 2013. We will also work on a crosscutting agenda in the government, aiming to build the conditions for competitiveness and serve as facilitators for the private sector. It is necessary to modernize and move the tourism industry toward breaking inertia. With that, we will succeed in making our tourism industry the most competitive in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

What role can Scotland play as a partner in helping Mozambique to develop its emerging offshore gas industry?</h4><p>Scotland has an incredible wealth of energy resources from a range of technologies, which could help Mozambique fully capitalize on its oil and gas industry. Oil and gas is the largest industry in Scotland, and over the past four decades oil and gas production in the North Sea has created a strong supply chain, a skilled workforce, a renowned academic sector, and well-developed energy infrastructure. We have developed specific strengths in several key areas, which have helped to transform developments globally as well as at home. Scottish industry has taken drilling and well technology to new levels, while the subsea-engineering technology now deployed around the world was borne out of necessity in North Sea waters. Much of the global subsea activity is now developed, designed, and delivered in Scotland. The subsea market is predicted to double over the next five years, and with the UK accounting for one-third of the current market, we will have a significant role to play in this growth. We've also developed world-class expertise in many other areas including production and process management, asset integrity, downhole technology, and project management</p><h4>How can Mozambican companies benefit from Scotland's experience and expertise in the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Scottish companies have a significant amount of expertise, built up over the past 40 years, which could benefit Mozambican companies. For example, according to Ernst &amp; Young's review of the UK oil field services industry in 2012, the supply chain across the UK has achieved revenues of over $39 billion a year. In Scotland alone, there are 2,000 companies operating in the supply chain, and although there is a concentration around Aberdeen, many of these are in different locations across Scotland. These span the entire oil and gas upstream lifecycle, through exploration, development, production, and decommissioning.</p><div class="quote">“Scottish companies have a significant amount of expertise, built up over the past 40 years, which could benefit Mozambique."</div><h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive destination for Scottish investment?</h4><p>The Africa region continues to act as one of the primary drivers of the deepwater industry alongside the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. Indeed, current exploration and production drilling activities in the Gulf of Guinea and offshore Mozambique and Tanzania have increased global demand for deepwater drilling assets. Successes in these markets are adding additional fields to the region's development backlog and further establishing Africa as a hub of deepwater activity. In particular, new exploration, such as the offshore Rovuma basin in Mozambique and Tanzania, has the potential to boost regional production and exports substantially. Scotland's significant offshore experience, built up over 40 years of harsh conditions in the North Sea, means our companies are ideally placed to support Mozambique as it realizes its potential in this area.</p><h4>How would an independent Scotland leverage its expertise in the oil and gas sector to build diplomatic relationships internationally?</h4><p>An independent Scotland will continue to develop relationships internationally to promote its expertise within the oil and gas industry worldwide. We will use Scotland's place in the world and our approach to global affairs to develop Scotland's economy, which will be key to ensuring the continued and increased prosperity of the nation.</p><h4>What role are Scottish investors playing in the Mozambican economy?</h4><p>Sustainable Energy Scotland and Scottish Development International assist companies to internationalize, with a number of companies evaluating locations for future expansion. Africa is a key market for us and information continues to be gathered to inform companies of the opportunities.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of economic relations between Scotland and Mozambique?</h4><p>Scotland is keen to strengthen economic relations between our country and Mozambique. Developing close links with our research and academic institutions, as well as our oil and gas businesses, will be beneficial for both parties.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When we spoke to you in 2012, you mentioned that it is important for Dubai to abandon boom and bust cycles and aim for stability. What evidence of stable growth have you witnessed over the past year?</h4><p>Just to clarify, Dubai was impacted by the global financial crisis in 2009, but since then the economy has been on a stable growth path, free from boom and bust cycles. Upturns and slowdowns have not been ruled out as these are natural given our exposure to the world economy. Dubai saw stable growth of 4.4% in 2012, and growth in 2013 is expected to be around the 5%. Again, this reflects faith in our sound macroeconomic management and is a clear indication of stable, fundamental growth. In terms of the Dubai Chamber, our members' exports and re-exports increased 9% to AED268 billion in 2012, up from AED246 billion in 2011. This was on the back of 15% growth between 2011 and 2010 and 15% growth in 2010 compared to 2009. Again, in 2013 we are seeing steady and consistent growth, with our members' exports and re-exports rising 7% in the first half of the year to reach AED145.2 billion, up from AED136.2 billion for the same period in 2012. The number of certificates of origin we issued during the same period increased by 12.2% to a total of 418,000, compared to 372,000 in 1H2012. This puts us firmly on track to meet last year's targets. Meanwhile, along with trade, tourism continues to go from strength to strength. Strong numbers are being reported by the city's hotels and Dubai International Airport alike. While another indicator of Dubai's stable economic growth is the recent pick-up in real estate that we are currently witnessing. Rental yields have increased in most areas and across various housing stock, with more popular locations reporting double-digit growth. At the same time, new projects are coming on stream, yet this has done little to dampen prices, which indicates that demand is still strong.</p><h4>What does the announcement of Mohammed Bin Rashid (MBR) City indicate for Dubai?</h4><p>This new city within Dubai will set a new benchmark for urban development in the region. Comprised of four key components, the city will feature world-class leisure facilities and provide an integrated environment for the development of entrepreneurship and innovation that will benefit the private sector considerably. MBR City is aligned to Vision 2030 and will enable the UAE to enter a new era in which it becomes the capital of entrepreneurship, arts, culture, and family tourism for over 2 billion people. This is an ambitious project and one that shows Dubai is still growing and developing into one of the world's leading cities for business and leisure. For the private sector and the economy, this announcement is a major boost and will provide a new impetus for a revival of the construction sector. This is going to create more jobs and increase consumer confidence and spending and will help to boost economic output across the board.</p><div class="quote">“The popularity of GCC countries as export destinations has further accelerated in 2013."</div><h4>What kind of growth has the Chamber experienced over the past year? Which economic sectors comprise the largest portion of your membership base?</h4><p>In our core business we have seen increases across the board in certificates of origin, membership and our members' trade activities. In terms of their spread, a large portion of our members operate in the trade sector, followed by the construction and real estate sectors, respectively. Other activities, such as manufacturing, leisure, financial intermediation, and health and social work make up the remainder. As an organization, we have physically grown by reaching out into new markets around the world. We now have a presence in Baku, Azerbaijan and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We are in the final stages of opening another branch office in Erbil, Iraq, and are examining possibilities in another 17 different markets. Our target is to open 20 such offices in key markets around the world in order to help our members tap into the investment opportunities in these markets, while helping to attract FDI flows into Dubai. We are also seeing growth in our SMEs and are working on a number of projects to help support these businesses. This includes Tejar Dubai, which is an initiative to encourage and train the next generation of Emirati entrepreneurs. We launched this initiative recently and are in the process of recruiting our first round of candidates to start the bespoke training and mentoring program later in 2013.</p><h4>Can you comment on other significant growth areas for bilateral trade, such as Africa?</h4><p>Africa is home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies and offers the highest risk-adjusted returns on foreign direct investment among emerging economies. While mining and oil are big businesses, infrastructure investment and the consumer market are major growth areas. The continent has a growing middle class, which is driving significant consumer growth. At the same time, around 70% of its population is under 35, which is also helping to power further economic development. The IMF has predicted that no other continent will grow more strongly over the coming years. At the same time, governments across Africa are working to improve the business climate, which can only serve to strengthen its investment potential. Dubai is a gateway to Africa as the Emirate's close proximity and business-friendly climate is an ideal hub for the continent. Dubai offers international companies a safe haven to do business across the Middle East, African, and south Asian regions, and we will continue to facilitate and promote Dubai as an international business hub for decades to come. We envisage developing our existing trade relationship by encouraging more African companies to use Dubai as a base to trade with Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North America. To this end, we organized the Africa Global Business Forum 2013 in May, held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. The forum highlighted the growing ties between the UAE and the continent and the areas of business potential for both sides. Over the course of two days 4,500 attendees participated in the event, including 40 government ministers and business leaders and the clear message was the Africa is ready for investment and Dubai is an excellent gateway and business partner.</p><h4>Regionally, how have trade relations between Dubai and GCC countries grown over the past year?</h4><p>The popularity of GCC countries as export destinations has further accelerated in 2013, with our members' total exports to the region between January and June expanding by 19% to AED82.6 billion. Saudi Arabia is the biggest market in the GCC, with our members' exports reaching AED44.1 billion, or 30% of their total exports for the period. Qatar is second to Saudi Arabia as the largest export destination, with a 17% share and exports worth AED13.8 billion. However, during this period Qatar grew at a much faster pace, with exports rising by 33%. Kuwait then follows in terms of share with 12% of our members' exports to the GCC, then the UAE with 8%, Oman with 7%, and Bahrain with 3%.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>Looking ahead, initiatives like the Islamic Economy, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, earlier in 2013 will play a major part in driving new business growth. This initiative is to make Dubai the capital of the Islamic economy and it sends a clear message to all investors that Dubai is the most prominent destination for sharia-compliant finance and business in the region. As a major Arab business and leisure destination, Dubai is an ideal choice to become the hub for all Islamic economic related fields due to its existing strengths in this area. We see opportunities to enhance the halal food industry, develop trade policies and commercial laws, and for the development of the Islamic finance industry, through the provision of this initiative. For instance, the UAE is already one of the biggest markets in the region for Islamic banking, accounting for 27% of all Islamic banking assets in the GCC. Given Dubai's position as a key destination for many global banks and financial institutions, this initiative will serve to strengthen this thriving sector. The establishment of an Islamic economic capital will encourage competitiveness, of which Dubai has many advantages like multiple promising sectors, the unlimited support given by its leadership and help to open doors to new opportunities. To this end, Dubai Chamber is organizing the Global Islamic Economic Summit later in 2013 which will bring together experts, policy makers, and stakeholders from around the world to initiate a dialogue on the development of the Islamic Economy sectors, including sharia finance, halal manufacturing, and related lifestyle sectors.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your personal view of Ecuador's current economic situation?</h4><p>Ecuador has gone through several years of favorable economic performance and there are interesting opportunities to capitalize on in the future. It is noticeable that the government has made significant investments and advancements in roads, public health, and education, as well as in public security, adding value to the principles of El Buen Vivir, endorsed by President Correa. Likewise, the private sector has recently experienced some prosperous years for business; however, to continue contributing to economic and social development at an adequate pace, it needs assurance that a stable and healthy business environment will be promoted in the country. A strong and competitive private sector is one of the best instruments a government has to stimulate economic expansion and job creation.</p><h4>What are your near-term economic expectations?</h4><p>It is essential that the government and the private sector continue working together and strengthening constructive relationships to generate growth opportunities that improve the living conditions of Ecuadoreans. We believe that 2013 will be similar to 2012 in terms of business performance. However, we cannot ignore the implications of the European crisis and the slowdown of certain important Asian economies, which could impact growth in our region. Similarly, the recent visit of President Correa to Germany raised expectations regarding the possibilities of creating commercial agreements with the EU. The strategic decision to change Ecuador's productive matrix may also bring investment opportunities that could stimulate sustainable economic development.</p><div class="quote">“It is essential that the government and the private sector continue working together."</div><h4>What do you foresee for the health sector in the years ahead?</h4><p>Our business is related to healthcare and wellbeing in the pharmaceutical and convenience retail sectors. Our two main retail brands are Fybeca and SanaSana; both are emblematic and recognized in Ecuador as the service and trustworthiness leaders of the industry. Pharmaceutical retail is very important for society as it contributes to public health, thereby improving living standards. Currently, this sector is quite competitive in Ecuador, with thousands of retail businesses of different sizes participating in the market. Available data estimates over 6,400 points of sale nationwide. Therefore, it becomes crucial to have updated regulations that account for the consumer's growing needs in a fair and ethical competitive environment that promotes fair prices, product availability, and quality of medicines and health products. Corporación GPF exclusively participates in the retail business, making medicines and healthcare products available to consumers nationwide, with the highest levels of quality, service, and value.</p><h4>What reforms are needed in your sector?</h4><p>In Ecuador, most medicine prices in the pharmaceutical retail sector are regulated and one of the industry's main challenges is to remain competitive and profitable. We consider that an essential reform for our sector is improvement in the efficiency and timeliness of health permits granted by state authorities for medicines, non-medicine supplements, and food products. This process has historically been overly bureaucratic and time consuming, obstructing the offering of the latest and most innovative products to the market. We are aware that the government is carrying out several important reforms to address this situation, and we look forward to adding value during the socialization of those projects.</p><h4>How did your company grow and what are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>Corporación GPF has been a pioneer in the pharmaceutical retail sector serving the community medicines and complementary products for over 83 years, making us the most experienced company in Ecuador in this field. Our retail business started back in 1930 with a small drugstore located in the historic center of Quito, and thanks to ethical and devoted hard work, it grew to become the leading brand in the Ecuadorean pharmaceutical retail sector. Ever since, we have honored our founder's business philosophy: “Integrity fosters trust." Our business strategies are focused on providing solutions to our clients and not just products. In addition to pharmaceutical and health goods, we deliver value-added convenience with the guarantee of quality at the right price. Furthermore, Corporación GPF employs over 5,000 people, making us one of the largest employers in Ecuador. We apply consistent corporate responsibility standards contributing not only to our client's health, but also improving the living conditions of the communities we serve. The latter is reflected in our Sustainability Report, “Memoria Corporativa 1930-2011", granted A+ by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).</p><h4>What are the main goals and objectives for the coming years?</h4><p>Corporación GPF will continue implementing its philosophy of bringing pharmaceutical and health solutions with value, accessibility, and social responsibility as widely as possible throughout Ecuador. We are present in every province of Ecuador, including the Galápagos Islands. We are an efficient convenience retail group that goes beyond medicine supply with several other complementary health and convenience retail products that provide high-value solutions to our clients. Currently, our expansion strategy is concentrated in Ecuador and we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering top-quality service, innovation, and high value in everything we undertake.</p><h4>Who are your suppliers?</h4><p>Our suppliers are leading local and international pharmaceutical laboratories and distributors. Our goal is to offer the broadest possible product availability with competitive prices and quality assurance.  We highly value our suppliers and aim to establish long-term relationships. We are always looking for ways to improve cooperation with them to offer innovative and better-value products and services to our clients.</p><h4>Do you consider the entry of new distributors and retailers to be possible?</h4><p>This market has many competitors at the retail level. New companies are coming in all the time and there are also several pharmaceutical distributors that have relatively recently entered into the retail business. Competition is good for everybody, as long as it is exercised on an ethical and level playing field. We have been doing business for over 83 years, exceeding our clients' and market expectations. We have also been acting as an ethical and responsible partner with our employees, customers, allies, and the communities we serve. These attributes of Corporación GPF are widely recognized and respected in Ecuador and constitute our most valuable asset.</p><h4>What types of medicine are the most popular?</h4><p>The most demanded medicines in Ecuador are those used to treat respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, and locomotive apparatus conditions. Baby milk formulas are also highly demanded. We always strive to offer our clients a one-stop-shop for all their prescription requirements. Customers are not only looking for a prescription, but for good service, convenience, trustworthiness, and value.</p><h4>What trends do you see in your clients?</h4><p>Ecuadorean consumers are following the trend of the retail business in other countries. They are not just looking for products; they are looking for solutions. They do not just want a client-to-supplier relationship; they want to establish an emotional connection with the companies they are buying from, particularly in purchases as important as medicine and health products. They want excellent service, convenience, and good value. Assortment is an important aspect and clients expect more solutions at a single location. We are working toward meeting these trends and exceeding our customers' expectations.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell me about the growth and development of DHL in Oman?</h4><p>Oman is an interesting market. We are very close to Dubai, which presents both benefits and drawbacks. One negative aspect is that the retail sector and a number of other sectors in Oman cannot grow as quickly as they can in Dubai. Everyone is buying products from the UAE, and it is not difficult to go and come back. Two people could easily establish a trucking company and do business between Dubai and Oman. Competition against this traditional model in the local market is very difficult. However, 60% of the country's export income comes from oil and gas, and that is why energy is an indicator for the economy. The UAE, the US, Europe, China, and India are large trading hubs for DHL Express. The oil and gas industry's deadline is always yesterday, which fits well with the speed of our company. DHL Express is fast as we have our own aircraft and transportation system, solutions in Bahrain and Dubai, and state-of-the-art transportation and models. Our unmatched level of quality is what sets us apart in the market.</p><h4>What other industries do you serve?</h4><p>Automotive spare parts companies, construction-related companies, and the government are our largest customers. We are involved in a number of huge road, bridge, port, and infrastructure projects. However, about 65%-70% of our customer portfolio is related to oil and gas. What is also important for us is the new airport, because it will serve the country in a very positive way. Oman has a fantastic chance to open a commercial border with Saudi Arabia and, thus, grab business from the UAE. Currently, we see the transit business passing through Africa and the Middle East. After this new infrastructure is established, Oman will have the opportunity to take advantage of the new airport. The export-import business is an excellent way to attract huge shipments from the Far East and other countries that can then be passed on to Saudi Arabia. DHL believes in this new possibility, and we are aiming for developments that are in line with this projection. Muscat Airport could play a very interesting role in terms of East African countries and trade, and Oman has strong historical ties in the region. DHL is looking to expand upon these. In March 2013, we brought the first DHL aircraft to Oman. This is a historical time for the country because our competitors are still using 1970s-model trucks, and we brought a brand-new aircraft to Oman. This is testament to the fact that we are very much in line with Oman's up-and-coming logistics requirements.</p><div class="quote">“In 2013, we received the CEO of DHL, which sent the clear message that DHL wants to invest more in Oman."</div><h4>Do you see Duqm as an area for expansion?</h4><p>Duqm is very important for us. It may not be today, or even in 2015, but someday Duqm will play a very important role in Oman. Our sister company, DHL Supply Chain, has already started investing and very soon DHL Express will be opening its offices. Currently, the market is not for the retail segment, more for shipyards and other technical industries. However, the commitment level will be there.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the logistics industry in Oman?</h4><p>Logistics in Oman is a huge opportunity. It is a large country bordering Saudi Arabia, with access from Duqm Port, Sohar Port, and Salalah Port, and the soon-to-be built industrial city in Barka. However, we do have a weakness in terms of logistics-educated staff. For that, we are introducing graduates from universities unrelated to logistics areas and teaching, educating, and monitoring their progress. Oman is a safe, stable, and politically peaceful country—it is not dangerous here.</p><h4>What is your strategy for the growth of DHL in Oman?</h4><p>In 2013, we received the CEO of DHL, which sent the clear message that DHL wants to invest more in Oman. We are following the airport project closely and working together with its cargo facilities. This rapid growth is something that people won't necessarily see. If all parties are able to manage it properly, the airport could become a huge money machine and promote a good image for Oman. Now, we are seeing a green light in Oman, especially in terms of investment and logistics. DHL is going to continue investing because trade is always changing.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henrí­quez Ureña (UNPHU)?</h4><p>We were the first private university in Santo Domingo, as well as one of the oldest universities in the city. UNPHU was established in 1966 after breaking away from the State University during a time when there was a lack of higher education options, especially those without political or religious links. Today, we are run as a non-profit organization with strong support from a group of businessmen. We can proudly say that currently there are more than 30,000 graduates of UNPHU, and our strongest departments are medicine, veterinary science, dentistry, engineering, agronomy, and architecture (the first in the Dominican Republic), among others. In fact, our graduate architects have considerably contributed to transforming the urban landscape of the country. Thanks to established international agreements, our medicine, veterinary, and dentistry students take their exams in the US, which enables them to work professionally both there and in Puerto Rico. In this context, I would say that one of our strongest competitive advantages as a higher education institution is the array of international agreements we have with other universities. We have a strong focus on the US, but also in Mexico and Europe; for example, in Spain, we have agreements with the medicine faculty of the University of Seville and the architecture department of the University of Barcelona, among many others. As part of this internationalization process, we also have to comply with high standards, and many agencies and universities we have partnerships with come to visit our premises to ensure that we meet the required educational standards. We currently have seven faculties (architecture, health sciences, education, science and technology, social sciences, law, and economics), with around 450 professors and 7,140 students.</p><h4>What are the core values and missions of the university?</h4><p>At UNPHU we train students to become capable of becoming agents of change in the country. Our high academic standards and the recognition of our graduates demonstrate our strong commitment to society. Our mission is to contribute to the sustainable development and improvement of society through the education we provide to graduate students who are competitive in their fields and committed to innovation. Our values include academic excellence, responsibility, integrity, ethics, equality, social and environmental commitment, and diversity.</p><div class="quote">“Our graduates are the best PR agents the university and the country could ask for in the international arena."</div><h4>How does UNPHU contribute to strengthening the country's image abroad?</h4><p>Our graduates are the best PR agents the university and the country could ask for in the international arena. Also, through our partnerships with international universities and the varied academic research we carry out, especially in the medical field, we are making important contributions to foreigners' understanding of the nation. The country and its tertiary education sector are currently undergoing a process of opening up to the world, so it is a heady time to be involved.</p><h4>What role does research and innovation play in the development of your institution?</h4><p>It is a key element in our development; the main pillars of our growth and expansion at the moment are internationalization, innovation, and research. We prioritize strengthening our research focus, as we understand how vital it is for universities to expand their profiles and reputation. For example, we have an estate outside Santo Domingo with a small farm and investigation units, which is where many of our students carry out field research.</p><h4>Where does the university find the necessary funding for that development?</h4><p>Crucially, we receive private donations from businessmen. In addition, we also apply for state grants dedicated to research after the government created a grant scheme for universities to strengthen their research departments. Fortunately, the government is aware of the need to boost research and it increases the budget every year. At the moment, we have six ongoing research projects run with state funds. At the same time, we have a foundation that sponsors the university and is very active in searching for potential investors.</p><h4>What is the average profile of your students?</h4><p>Of our 7,100 students, around 30% of them enjoy scholarships due to the lack of sufficient funds to access higher education and their strong academic qualifications. Also, we have middle to upper class students in our university, providing a perfect mix of students in an academic environment. There are over 70 foreign students at UNPHU right now, mainly from the US and Spain, and we expect to increase such figures in the years to come.</p><h4>What are the main plans for the near future?</h4><p>We have many plans, as the university is a very active and dynamic social agent. I believe one of the biggest challenges ahead of us is to make sure professors have a better understanding of the academic power of new technologies. We must also continue providing high educational standards so we can make sure our graduates are ready to take on the world. We know of their importance in the continued development of the university, and we always try to keep close links with them once they graduate, especially in terms of becoming potential professors and lecturers. Finally, we also have some plans to expand our student body to approximately 8,000, as well as extend our campus.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of the Dominican higher education sector in the coming years?</h4><p>I think that both government and society have come to understand that the engine that will power their development is education. Today, the authorities, the private sector, and the universities are facing the same situation. I can feel for the first time ever a common feeling between all social agents to push education to the forefront of our development and prioritize education over other sectors. For example, the sector's budget today represents 4% of the country's GDP, but a couple of years ago it represented only 2%. In this context, there are already talks with a view to adopting a national plan on education, and the government allocates more funds every year to provide scholarships both in the country and abroad, and to encourage universities to expand their course portfolio and train future teachers and professors. However, we must keep one thing in mind: we won't see the results of such efforts in the short term.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ready-to-roll-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Information Technology Group (ITG) is part of a highly diversified group with operations all around the Middle East. What are your main drivers?</h4><p>Let me give you a brief history of our group first, which will give you a better idea of where we come from and where we are heading. The group was established back in 1967 here in Beirut. We started off at that time selling office equipment, such as Olivetti typewriters and telex machines. In the mid-1970s, during the era of mini-computers, we decided it was time to address the opportunities represented by the growing IT industry. When the Lebanese civil war started, in parallel with sustaining and developing our local business despite the difficulties at that time, some group executives moved to countries in the Gulf region to develop our operations there. It's all about people. Our human assets are the main driver of our business. This is why, as opposed to most other companies in our region, our group has not been built as a “family business," and that's part of our DNA. Since the start, the founders made sure to retain the management team as well as key people through a structured shareholding system (similar in some ways to stock options in the US, but more adapted to the reality of our regional market). As an example, our mother group (the HOLCOM group) currently employs roughly 3,500 people, which include around 150 shareholders, who are normally the managers and the senior members of its various operations. I personally manage ITG, which is affiliated to HOLCOM, and employs 550 people in Lebanon including 35 shareholders. We fully focus on ICT, selling a comprehensive range of hardware and software products along with related systems integration and support services. Depending on the various markets we operate in, we have different go-to-market schemes, ranging from selling to corporate accounts (such as banks, telecom companies, and major accounts) to distributing products through networks of resellers. Our group is also involved in IT retail, through the establishment and operation of its own stores in certain territories. When it comes to ITG, our largest customer segment is definitely banking, which is historically Lebanon's most vibrant sector. We have been actively promoting IT solutions to banks and financial institutions since the 1970s. Over the years, we have developed a deep expertise in the provision of banking solutions. It is also worth noting that we don't just cover Lebanon, but also serve banks in the entire region including the Levant, Egypt, the Gulf region, and elsewhere. Concerning our group operations in Lebanon, and besides ITG, there are more than 500 people working in sister companies, including the Globalcom group (focusing on telecom and internet), which comprises IDM, the largest ISP in Lebanon, as well as GDS, which operates a data network covering the whole territory of Lebanon. The rest of the group, known as MiDiS, is present in virtually every country in the Middle East and has also expanded its operations to Eastern Europe and Africa.</p><h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the IT sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>Despite the difficulties that our country has passed through, IT has always been an active sector in Lebanon. Moreover, local IT companies have always considered that the rest of the region was their natural market too and have expanded accordingly. The strength of Lebanon's IT sector has a lot to do with the availability of very good universities here. We are able to attract freshly graduated talent, train them in our projects in Lebanon, and involve them in projects across the region. Some prefer to travel and work abroad, some prefer to be based locally. The IT sector in Lebanon by itself isn't very large, estimated at about $500 million, which is similar to the IT volume of a single large European city. However, we have always looked at the whole Middle East region and are not just concentrated on Lebanon.</p><div class="quote">“I would like to see ITG as a pool of qualified IT people based in Lebanon and serving the whole region."</div><h4>What is your outlook on innovation in Lebanon?</h4><p>Institutions such as Kafalat have been doing a good job in providing loans to small companies, which has encouraged innovation. Recently, the Lebanese central bank started a great initiative by providing guarantees to Lebanese banks so that they can provide loans at greatly reduced rates—even at 0% interest rates—to IT start-ups. There are many good, talented people with great ideas in Lebanon, but without the money, the management expertise and the proper marketing and sales reach, their ideas won't go anywhere. This is especially true in the IT business, where innovation is essential and where technologies change at a fast pace. Lebanon's challenge isn't just financing companies to develop ideas and products; we also have to put a framework together to help those companies gain access to international markets—that is in my opinion the biggest challenge Lebanese businesses face. As a group, we grow organically through recruiting talent/expertise and incubating companies. In this context, we have established earlier in 2013 a new company called SysPro, specialized in energy efficiency and smart building solutions. But we also grow by acquisition. We have lately acquired many companies that we've successfully integrated within the group, the last of which was Fadel Systems (renamed PrimeWare after our acquisition), which specializes in the provision of Oracle-based solutions.</p><h4>What are your expectations for SysPro?</h4><p>Buildings are becoming more and more intelligent. We sell a lot of related products, electrical equipment, cables, power protection equipment, networking equipment, computers, telephones, and the like. These are being sold to both offices and residential buildings. We found that most of our clients wanted a single source for all of that, a single responsible entity that would deliver a turn-key solution and successfully integrate such systems; this is SysPro's mission. Around one year ago, we identified the need to have a company that could interface between the various contractors, architects, and building owners, giving them a one-stop-shop for integrating technology into buildings. We had to find the right people with the right experience, and we did just that in SysPro.</p><h4>How much investment potential is there in the ICT sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>The potential is huge. Many companies have a lot of good people, with great software and intellectual property, but they lack sales reach in the market to sell their products across the region. That is something we can provide. ITG, as a holding company, firstly provides financial support to our affiliated companies. We can act as a bank for our affiliates. More importantly, we provide synergy between our affiliated companies. Our established companies have been in the business for years, with deep-rooted relationships with their customers. When we have a new company, we can give that company access to this valuable client base, which would otherwise take years to develop. ITG is keen to invest in areas that make sense for us and give our clients added value. There are currently 23 companies affiliated to ITG.</p><h4>Where do you envision ITG in the near future?</h4><p>I would like to see ITG as a pool of qualified IT people based in Lebanon and serving the whole region. I envision a team of professionals providing services to specific industries such as banking and finance, telecoms, higher education, hospitality, healthcare, and others. We are investing a lot in that direction and we believe that we have a unique position there to succeed throughout the Middle East. I don't know of any local or regional group that has our reach or our level of expertise in banking and financial software. Of course, I don't want to limit ourselves to banking or to any other vertical sector for that matter. Our group also comprises substantial “horizontal" expertise in Oracle and Microsoft technologies. We will nurture those kinds of value-added businesses and promote them across the region. We will develop ourselves organically and also acquire companies that will enable us to grow in sync with the dynamism of the ICT industry. That will help us take ITG to the next level.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the attraction of the Dominican Republic as a foreign investment destination?</h4><p>The strong macroeconomic performance of the Dominican Republic over the past eight years, as well as the country's political stability, legal security, and social peace, have been the main incentives attracting new businesses and investors. Since 2005, the Dominican Republic has posted average annual growth of 6.7%, above the Latin American average of 4.3% for the period. In addition, we controlled inflation at an average of 6.2% during this period and enjoyed relative exchange rate stability, with an average depreciation of 3.2%. These favorable results were achieved thanks to structural reforms in the financial system and the use of more open trade policies and strategies.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the financial policies adopted by the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD)?</h4><p>We are convinced that key to achieving sustainable economic growth is sustained price stability, as well as ensuring the proper functioning of the financial and payment systems in our country. Only then can business and people schedule their consumption plans, savings, and investments with relative certainty, creating the necessary conditions for long-term growth.</p><div class="quote">“We are convinced that key to achieving sustainable economic growth is sustained price stability."</div><h4>What economic sectors hold the highest growth potential?</h4><p>Our economy has, in recent years, received the highest ever levels of foreign investment in various economic sectors such as mining, trade, industry, tourism, and real estate. Without a doubt, the mining sector will have a greater dynamism in the coming years, especially thanks to Barrick Gold's mining operations; we also have bright prospects for tourism, free trade zones (FTZs), and agribusiness. Additionally, we expect the financial sector to maintain the solid performance it has shown in recent years.</p><h4>In your opinion, how can investment and the industrial sector evolve over the next few years?</h4><p>In May, the BCRD implemented a series of expansionary measures in order to stimulate private sector credit and domestic demand; we released approximately DOP20 billion of resources from legal reserves (equivalent to more than 3%) to be channeled into the productive sectors to finance projects at historically low interest rates for a fixed term of six years. Specifically, these resources targeted manufacturing, agriculture, and the purchase of housing units, as well as trade, SMEs, and consumers. These monetary measures have resulted in a more dynamic credit climate in the private sector, growing at an annual rate of around 15%, which, along, with increased public investment in recent months, has contributed to the revival of economic activity. We expect our economy to grow by approximately 3% in 2013, rising to 4% or 5% in 2014.</p><h4>What strategies is the BCRD implementing to encourage further specialization of the national economy?</h4><p>We are aware that timely and adequate funding is a prerequisite for the growth of all economic sectors. Accordingly, we encourage greater access to credit for economic agents, reducing the costs of financial intermediation and promoting a more efficient allocation of financial resources. In particular, we have taken steps to ease the credit approval criteria for small debtors and reduce legal reserve requirements for commercial banks from 20% to 12.3%. Furthermore, we have supported the development of the mortgage and trust markets, as well as the creation of sub-banking agent services. The BCRD has also contributed to the development of the stock market, both by supporting actions taken by the Securities Superintendency (SIV) and by deepening the internal stock market through the issuance of securities in accordance with international standards. In fact, we are the largest issuers of securities in the country.</p><h4>How is the institution promoting further financial transparency in the national economy?</h4><p>Transparency is the bedrock of economic agents' expectations and accountability. We have strengthened our communications policy and the dissemination of information, particularly concerning the decision-making process. For example, we publish monthly statements after each monetary policy meeting, as well as biannual economic projections, and we also hold regular press conferences to report on economic performance. Additionally, the BCRD publishes quarterly economic reports, the result of all monetary transactions, and guidelines for the implementation of monetary policy through the monetary program.</p><h4>What actions has the BCRD implemented to promote further modernization of the financial sector?</h4><p>On the one hand, we have regulated a more competitive and transparent banking sector with a varied range of well-regulated products such as development of the mortgage and trust markets, the creation of sub-banking agent services, and the regulation of credit cards. Other initiatives aim at strengthening the banking and financial culture of economic agents; we created the Central Classroom (Aula Central) project, and the Diploma on Economic Journalism, as well staging communication seminars on economics. We also plan to implement a National Financial Literacy Survey, which will help to develop a national strategy in this context. On the other hand, we have made significant progress in open market operations with, for example, the dematerialization of securities issued by the BCRD, which contributed to deepening the secondary stock market in the country.</p><h4>What steps is the BCRD taking to promote macroeconomic growth for 2013 and beyond?</h4><p>In early 2013, our economy was affected by a combination of a moderation in global economic growth and a decline in domestic demand, due to the impact of a new tax reform. These factors led to growth of 0.3% during the January-March period of 2013. Faced with this reality and in an environment of low inflationary pressures, we decided to cut, by 75 basis points, the monetary policy rate, while releasing around DOP20 billion from legal reserve resources. We also eased credit conditions for small debtors, facilitating the recovery of private loans. As a result of these measures, as well as increased capital spending in the public sector, the economy recovered to grow 5.5% in 3Q2013. We expect this to continue, bringing growth at the end of the year to our projected 3%.</p><h4>The implementation of laws and regulations in line with Basel principles has ensured the banking sector's high levels of solvency, capitalization, and profitability. What challenges does the economy face in sustaining its pace in light of peso-dollar volatility?</h4><p>In our objective of maintaining price stability, we would adopt necessary measures to prevent high exchange rate volatility from jeopardizing our inflation target. The banking sector maintains high levels of solvency, capitalization, and profitability, as well as a long position in foreign currencies, which are factors reducing that vulnerability. Additionally, current regulation sets a limit on the channeling of loans to sectors that do not generate foreign exchange currency, mitigating credit exchange risks. The banking sector as a whole is funded locally in pesos and does not offer a wide variety of instruments as in developed markets.</p><h4>How would you assess ties with the IMF?</h4><p>Relations with the IMF are excellent. Recently, we received welcome feedback regarding the evaluation of the IMF on Post-Program Monitoring (PPM) for the country. In the monetary context, as mentioned, we decided to increase the BCRD's benchmark interest rate by 200 basis points due to strong pressure in the exchange market that would have endangered our inflation target. On the fiscal side, the government has implemented a successful reform that will reduce the deficit by about 4% of GDP. I should stress that, over the past eight years, the Dominican Republic has signed two stand-by agreements with the IMF, both very positive for the country; the BCRD fully complied with all the goals set, which allowed us to strengthen our reserves, to meet inflation targets, and contribute to maintaining macroeconomic stability. We have also passed new laws to strengthen public sector institutions, eliminated several subsidies, and pursued more efficient tax administration. Overall, the financial sector has become healthier to the point that today it maintains performance indicators well above international standards. We understand that we must focus on completing the PPM agreement, which is scheduled for 2014. Depending on local conditions and the international economic climate, the government could evaluate the possibility, in the future, of engaging in a new agreement with the IMF beneficial to the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>General Motors Ómnibus BB Del Ecuador has been in Ecuador for almost 40 years. How has the company evolved during this period?</h4><p>Around 37 years ago, a Hungarian entrepreneur set up OBB's first plant in Ecuador to assemble buses. His vision and leadership drove the company's first years, and in 1981 General Motors Corporation became a shareholder. This strengthened both companies in the Ecuadorean market, giving the brand a wider and more attractive portfolio of products, and developing the automotive industry in Ecuador. Ever since then, we have been constantly innovating and remaining at the forefront of the industry, which has brought about a preference for our products among Ecuadorean consumers. We are the leading company in terms of variety of products; currently we have around 50 models available on the market, ranging from small vehicles to trucks. Our assembled products are highly recognized in Ecuador for their quality. Some 80% of what we sell is assembled at our plant. In terms of distribution and after-sales services, we are the brand with the highest penetration in the entire country. We have wide coverage in points of sale and service, being present in most of Ecuador's provinces, and at the same time we continue to expand our network of after-sales service points. We believe that a company with such a long tradition as General Motors must look after its clients, and we do so by combining high-quality products with an extensive distribution and after-sales network. GM OBB enjoys well-deserved prestige in Ecuador. It is also a major employer, with 1,500 people employed directly by the company and approximately 9,500 workers in the automotive industry supported indirectly.</p><h4>How large is your distribution and after-sales service network?</h4><p>We are constantly expanding this network by signing new partnerships, or building new dealerships. We currently have 14 franchises, composed of 17 dealerships, as well as 70 points of sale, and 80 after-sales service points.</p><div class="quote">“Exports continue to play a very important role in our business."</div><h4>What are some of the most popular models in your portfolio?</h4><p>The Chevrolet Sail model, launched over a year ago, is the most successful model in our portfolio. We have sold over 1,000 vehicles of this model every month since its launch. With our large product portfolio, we have been able to reach all segments of society in all regions of Ecuador, paying special attention to the five cities with most market penetration: Quito, Guayaquil, Ambato, Ibarra, and Manta.</p><h4>Is the company planning to launch any new models in the near future?</h4><p>In 1H2013, we launched the 4x4 Trailblazer and the Chevrolet Tracker, and we will soon surprise the Ecuadorean market with another new model. Innovation is our motto, and we have no doubt that this coming model will be highly successful.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the automotive industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>The industry has clearly benefited from the growth of Ecuador's middle class, and experienced very significant and sustainable growth from 2009 to 2011. However, in 2012 the government introduced new legislation seeking to redress the balance of trade, bringing in quotas and new duties on assembly vehicles, which has regulated the market.</p><h4>How have sales figures evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>Sales in the industry were high in 2011 and 2012 (with 136,000 and 122,000 units sold, respectively). However, as mentioned above, the quotas and new taxes introduced by the government have had an effect on growth. We estimate sales of roughly 105,000 to 110,000 units throughout the automotive industry in 2013.</p><h4>How will the assembling industry in Ecuador evolve over the next few years?</h4><p>The raw materials that we use for vehicle assembly are imported CKDs and local parts. The government has recently promoted local manufacturing to supply assembly plants in Ecuador. We support this strategy, and are speeding up the inclusion of more locally manufactured parts in our assembly lines. In line with the government's policy of developing a more competitive industrial sector in Ecuador, we have invested a total of $71 million in new products, facilities, and cutting-edge technology over the past two years. A total of $31 million of this was invested in the third phase of a painting plant, focusing on modernization and automation. At the same time, last year we invested $9 million of our own resources in third parties, whose business is directly related to our assembly work. Last but not least, I would like to mention quality levels at our company. In 2012, we were the first CKD plant in the world to reach Level III, the highest quality level in GM. Furthermore, we have very high levels of compliance with the global manufacturing system. For these reasons, we are currently ranked among the top-three vehicle manufacturers in Latin America.</p><h4>What role do exports play in your overall business activity?</h4><p>Exports continue to play a very important role in our business. We export mainly to Colombia and, traditionally, we have also exported to Venezuela. In 2011, we exported products worth over $200 million, but in 2012 this figure fell to $140 million, due to restrictions in the Venezuelan market.</p><h4>How important is human capital in the sector?</h4><p>We have always believed that one of the keys to success is the happiness of our employees, and we constantly implement programs for the welfare of our staff and their families. At the same time, we provide ongoing training opportunities. Human capital is very important in our industry, not only as an internal policy, but also regarding our stakeholders. We paid special attention to our sales, and especially after-sales segments, due to their proximity to the customer. We know that good service makes a difference. Finally, we should mention General Motors Ómnibus BB Del Ecuador's corporate social responsibility policy. We have four pillars guiding our projects: internal social responsibility, relations with stakeholders, protection of the environment, and community relations. Some of our main projects are: Safe Driving Practices, volunteer programs focusing on education and the environment, and “Chevrolet Siempre Conmigo," a program for our employees and their families to enhance their sense of belonging.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[scaling-up-lng]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ExxonMobil has a long history in Qatar and enjoys an important relationship with the government. How does this history help it stay competitive?</h4><p>Relationships are extremely important, especially in Qatar, and to that end we are fortunate to have developed a strong foundation with the State of Qatar and Qatar Petroleum (QP) over the past 20 years. The beginning of the partnership we know today dates back to the early 1990s when we were asked to participate in the first Qatargas venture, which marked the country's first LNG undertaking. Following our initial venture, the government of Qatar and QP were interested in forming a second venture with ExxonMobil, which became RasGas. From there we began to build these businesses to what we have today. We spent the beginning of this partnership getting to know each other and understanding the strengths each of us brought to the table. From this understanding we were able to work toward delivering on the vision of His Highness the Father Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and the goals that he set out for the industry. That relationship has since progressed and grown stronger, and it is my belief that we were able to expand our projects because we had taken the time to build the relationship from the ground up. Since that time we have been fortunate to participate in 12 of the 14 LNG trains in the country. In terms of our relative strengths, the government established a business climate of transparency and stability that allows companies like ours to thrive. Additionally, QP brought operating strengths that really complemented our own, which is why our relationship has been able to expand as it has, especially over the past decade. The partnership between QP and ExxonMobil also brought technology and scale to the country, which necessitated an increased train size. This also enabled us to drive down the costs of the business and the scale created a reach that is allowing us to export to 20 different countries this year from Qatar alone. It has been a remarkable journey, wherein we have been able to take a business that was mostly point-to-point LNG with only a few buyers in Asia and then globalize this trend. Today, you cannot help but hear about an LNG-related development somewhere in the world. Qatar is essentially responsible for globalizing the LNG business, and the QP-ExxonMobil partnership was a conduit for this.</p><h4>How does Qatar factor into ExxonMobil's global strategies?</h4><p>Qatar's LNG business has helped globalize the industry. This is in part due to our ability to scale-up the LNG trains, but also is a result of revolutions in the LNG shipping business. Our LNG trains in Qatar have tripled in size since the initial days, and the amount of gas that we can ship has also increased substantially with the introduction of the Q-Flex and Q-Max carriers. The Q-Max, for example, is approximately 80% larger than the conventional LNG ships of the past. These advancements, pioneered as part of Qatar's LNG business, impact the industry as a whole with the introduction of additional LNG consumers into the market that were previously difficult to reach. These new customers add another layer to our global business, as ExxonMobil has operations—and hence solid relationships—across the global energy sector in many of the countries that now receive gas from Qatar. It goes without saying that our asset base in this country is very important to us, as are the relationships that come with it.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar's LNG business has helped globalize the industry."</div><h4>ExxonMobil is partnering with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) to build an LNG export facility at Sabine Pass in Texas. How does shale gas change your strategy in Qatar?</h4><p>The challenge society faces in the coming years is extremely complex when you consider the global population growing to 9 billion people over the next 30 years, a concurrent 35% growth in energy demand, and the need to manage risks associated with climate change. When you consider economic prosperity and poverty alleviation, it is ultimately dependent on economic growth, which, in turn, is dependent on energy consumption. This is an enormous challenge and a huge responsibility for our industry. The growth of shale gas offers an opportunity to help address this challenge. By 2040, we see natural gas going from the third most demanded energy resource to the second, displacing coal. Natural gas, whether produced from conventional reservoirs or shale deposits, can play an important role in helping address the energy challenge. As a reliable, abundant, and cleaner burning source of energy, natural gas can help support a growing population and increased standards of living while reducing the environmental impacts of energy use. Also in support of a growing demand for natural gas, we have signed an agreement with QPI to investigate upstream opportunities in North America, and we are looking at an expansion at the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas that would allow us to capitalize on the growing supply of gas in the US. With regard to Golden Pass, we have applied for and received a free trade agreement (FTA) export license, and are currently waiting on the non-free trade agreement (NFTA) export license, which we hope to achieve shortly. It is exciting for us to look at taking a business we know well, with partners we trust, and expanding it elsewhere.</p><h4>You speak of LNG in particular and natural gas in general as a kind of future fuel for a growing world. How does technology factor into that process on a global scale, and how does ExxonMobil bring technology to Qatar's economy?</h4><p>Our story in Qatar is grounded in technology. At one time, the North Field was viewed as a stranded asset, meaning it was too far away and too difficult to produce in an economically viable manner. Many people considered this challenge but couldn't find a solution. When ExxonMobil and QP came together, we considered the factors that drive costs, and how unique technologies could address these factors. The scaling up of the trains that we accomplished sounds easy in theory, but from an engineering perspective it represented a complex challenge. Almost all the technologies the joint ventures have implemented at Ras Laffan Industrial City are unique. At ExxonMobil, we consider ourselves to be first and foremost a technology-based company; one that employs 18,000 engineers and scientists and spends close to a billion dollars each year on research. We constantly consider how to overcome challenges, and just as in the case of the North Field, we take on these challenges with some of the best and brightest in the industry.</p><h4>Could you tell us about the Barzan project you are working on?</h4><p>The Barzan gas project is a great example of the strength of our partnership with QP as the only international company active in Qatar's domestic gas business. We have a strong foundation with our involvement in the Al-Khaleej Gas project, and Barzan is the next input into the domestic gas business. The project is being run exceptionally well by RasGas on behalf of the shareholders, QP, and ExxonMobil. It is a particularly complex project that involves developing natural gas reserves of greater impurity content. Working together, we have addressed these complexities and are progressing toward the first train start up in 2014 and a subsequent train in 2015. This marks a great step in our relationship with the State of Qatar. The project is especially significant as Qatar's economic and population growth will put increasing demands on electricity and energy to fuel its rapid development. Developments in infrastructure, public service, and transportation projects, like Sidra hospital, the metro systems, and World Cup stadiums, all depend on energy, and we are pleased to be a part of that.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This has been a very active and successful year for Borsa Istanbul, with the capital markets law being implemented and progress on a partnership with NASDAQ OMX. What else do you hope to achieve by the end of the year?</h4><p>Of course, the strategic partnership with NASDAQ remains at the MoU stage. We need to conclude the negotiations and resolve all the technical details, while, at the same time, both parties require Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approval, or, in our case, that of the Capital Markets Board (CMB). At the same time, we need to reach an agreement with NASDAQ OMX on certain details of the content, as to whether it will include an equity partnership, the scale, and so forth. And, of course, this partnership does not only consist of a transfer of technology and an equity partnership, as we also plan on taking full advantage of such a strong strategic partner. We are also now revising the entire business model of the capital markets, including collateral management, risk management, and the process right from ordering to post-trade transactions. We will develop a truly state-of-the-art business model, which will enable us to slash all unnecessary intermediary costs and create a market-friendly environment, especially for institutional investors. This is our most important aim for 2013, although, at the same time, there are also several issues related to the merger of three large institutions, namely TURKDEX, the gold exchange, which includes precious metals and gem stones, and, of course, at the core, Borsa Istanbul. This combination should lead us to peak efficiency, enabling full synergies between the three entities. I should also add that we are trying to become the eligible partner of the Electricity Exchange in Turkey. This exchange will start with electricity, but very soon will also include natural gas and then, perhaps, coal, oil, carbon dioxide, and so forth, thereby encompassing the entire energy market. Borsa Istanbul will be the main shareholder of the Electricity Exchange, and the institution itself will be the major shareholder at the same time. Meanwhile, for energy derivatives, Borsa Istanbul will be the market operator, which is another agenda item for the remainder of this year. And last but not least, we are now working on a new project to create a market for commodities. Most probably, it will start out with non-precious metals, for example iron and steel, and then perhaps include copper as well, to be followed by agricultural commodities; we have already started the preliminary drafting of the project. These are the four main issues on my agenda for the rest of the year.</p><h4>Istanbul also has very ambitious plans to become a regional or even a global financial hub. How would the partnership with NASDAQ help you achieve this?</h4><p>First of all, it would provide us with the most critical element of the exchange, which is infrastructure. When we incorporate the NASDAQ brand into our logo, it will inspire greater confidence among other parties. And, thanks to the latest technology, and in addition to the know-how and creation of a market-friendly environment, the already-high liquidity of the Turkish market will increase further. We will include institutional investors and expand our institutional investor base. And, as a result, Borsa Istanbul will be more financially integrated with the global financial network. Also, for exchanges in the region, the location, hosting, and data center services will be more attractively offered up by Borsa Istanbul.</p><h4>This year, despite many impressive gains, there is still some way to go to reach your stated goal of an 80% market cap to GDP ratio. What is your strategy for reaching this target?</h4><p>The second half of 2013 in particular was a difficult period from many perspectives. It was difficult for developed economies and emerging markets alike, although I think that we have now reached a more satisfactory position when considering the surrounding environment. I am still confident that our ambitious target is achievable because, when I look at what is taking place in banking on a global scale in terms of the regulatory framework, and especially in light of the US Fed tapering decision, financing organizations through banking will no longer be as easy as it once was. This was especially true during the 2008-2013 period. Credit will become more expensive, especially given the capital liquidity provisions of the regulatory framework. It will become even tougher to borrow and those corporations that need to expand their operational base or increase their market share will become more competitive. This is exactly the current situation of Turkish corporations, which will need to rely more on the capital markets, a trend that has already begun. While corporates are not currently large players in the liquidity market, we are observing more of them utilizing the corporate bond markets, or even the sukuk market. This is the partnership that we plan to sign with the World Bank regarding the opening of the first ever center for Islamic finance in Istanbul, of which Borsa Istanbul will be the host institution. This will contribute significantly to the development of this segment of the capital markets. I am also sure that after a certain threshold of awareness, the opportunities presented by the capital markets on the issuer-side, including interest from the company side, will increase further. This will bring them to the liquidity market as well, whereby we will achieve our target of 80% of GDP within a period of five years.</p><div class="quote">“Within five years, Borsa Istanbul will definitely be the center of this region."</div><h4>How would you assess investor confidence in Istanbul today?</h4><p>Certain elements merit closer analysis, such as the leverage ratio, both for the public sector and the private sector. When I look at the fiscal outlook for the Turkish economy, I am amazed. I would like to point out that Turkey has the strongest fiscal outlook among the non-commodity exporters of the emerging markets; we are the first by far. The budget deficit is less than 2% of GDP, and the country is running a primary surplus, thanks to which the debt-to-GDP ratio is declining continually. For 2013, we expect it to be below 35%, rendering it a key element of the evaluation. In the private sector, the household sector is not leveraged at all, compared to any international measures. The leverage of Turkish households remains very low, which lends further credence to our evaluation. More importantly, Turkish households are inclined to the long position, which contradicts many other emerging markets where the households are in effect indebted. A glance at the banking industry reveals a high level of financial preparedness, and an acute knowledge of risk management, as well as robust capitalization. Meanwhile, the industry's capital adequacy and liquidity ratios constitute further strengths and provide another anchor for the Turkish economy. And so, in terms of leverage, I think this business discipline is the most advantageous and competitive aspect of the Turkish economy. One particular risk related to the current account deficit (CAD) concerns the low level of domestic savings. We note that Turkey imports almost all of its energy needs. All in all, when I look at the fundamental indicators, such as productivity, labor market conditions, demographics, and the investment environment, as well as other macro indicators, such as the fiscal outlook, financial service industry resilience to external shocks, and the leverage level, they all imply that the Turkish economy will be much stronger in the future. Therefore, confidence is already present, and we observe this in the approach of global investors as well. Moreover, the fact that we, as Borsa Istanbul, can strike a partnership agreement in 2013 amid market volatility is a clear indication of the high level of confidence in the Turkish market.</p><h4>And finally, what is your outlook for Borsa Istanbul over the next five years?</h4><p>Within five years, Borsa Istanbul will definitely be the center of this region, including Southeastern and Central Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We will establish strategic links and partnerships with highly respected global players, and we have already begun with NASDAQ OMX. We will have a more vertically integrated system, a state-of-the-art business model for the capital markets, and an efficient, effective, fast, confident, and secure market place both for domestic and global investors. I am confident that we will reach all of our targets.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you plan to ensure that Tanzania's energy opportunities and resources become a blessing and not a curse?</h4><p>When many people discuss natural resources they are thinking about a personal fortune, but in Tanzania we try to make sure that our natural resources are for the prosperity of all the people in the country. Energy is the engine of an economy everywhere in the world. For development, it is about the amount of energy per capita that a country is using. Our economy is small; at the moment our GDP is about $28 billion and our GDP per capita is about $600. As a nation we have resolved to do away with poverty and we have a road map to eradicate it. We have a development vision for 2025, which is to become a middle-income country. At the moment, our installed capacity of electricity is 1,438.24 MW. Electricity is essential for growth, and our intention as a ministry and a government is that by 2015, we will double our installed capacity to 2,780 MW. Honestly, we want to have a minimum of 3,000 MW in the next three years. We have changed our energy needs; we used to depend very heavily on hydropower, but climate change has taught us a very big lesson. The government now has an energy mix, which is as follows: for the next five, 10, or even 20 years, our electricity will be generated first by natural gas, second by coal, third by hydro, and fourth by renewable energies. For the renewable energies, we will generate our electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and bioenergy. Luckily, Tanzania has abundant resources for generation. We have come up with that energy mix for economic reasons. Our economic growth at the moment is oscillating between 6% and 7%. Our intention is that in the next two years, our growth should be a minimum of 8%. Economically, that actually reduces poverty, but it is not enough to eradicate poverty. If we want to eradicate poverty, we have to go into the double digits. It should be beyond 10%, preferably 12%, and it must stay at that level for a long period of time because we have to move from the current GDP of about $28 billion to beyond $100 billion by the year 2025. To do that, we need to have a reliable power supply to move the economy forward. What we are doing right now is constructing a pipeline that will help us produce much more power from natural gas. We are also starting plans to build new gas-fired power plants. We have learned over time that the government alone, which was the concept for many years, does not have the financial muscle to satisfy the energy demands of the nation. Our current approach involves both public and private sector investments. There will be three scenarios: public, private, and public-private. What we have at the moment is an enormous amount of energy. It is almost equivalent to 8 billion barrels of oil, which is considerable. Our small economy cannot stomach all the natural reserves that we have. They are both for local consumption and for export. We will use natural gas to propel the economy within the country. For power generation, we will use natural gas for our industries. We will use the natural gas for domestic cooking and other things. We will use it in our vehicles and also as a raw material for fertilizer and other petrochemical industries. However, we are going to export it as well. At the moment, we are discussing where to place the LNG facilities. We have already begun to invite the private sector into this process. If an investor comes and is interested in investing in the energy sector, we are willing to accommodate them. There are others that would want to go into partnership with the government, and they are also invited. We are very open; there is no rigid approach or constraining legal framework. This is a very flexible and open approach. The most important issue here is the negotiations with investors.</p><h4>How will the restructuring of TANESCO increase the availability of electricity to all Tanzanians?</h4><p>Restructuring TANESCO is obligatory. There are technical reasons for that. The predecessors of TANESCO were there during colonial times. In 1931, two companies based in Dar es Salaam came together and formed one single power utility company. This was during the British period. The contemporary TANESCO was established in 1964. You do not need to be a high-level professional to understand what it means when from 1931 until today, only 21% of the country's population has access to electricity. We gained independence in 1964 and still only 21% of the population has access to electricity. This invokes the argument that the structure of this national power utility is not appropriate to speed up the processes of making sure that many citizens have access to electricity; that is number one. The second point is that TANESCO has accumulated a lot of debt. If we are not careful, it will continue accumulating. We have to sort this out. Since 100% of the equity of TANESCO goes to the government, this means that all those huge debts are debts of the government and the people. We have decided as the government to clear these debts. We have to change our current style; we cannot clear the debt and then after one week go back to the same style of operations that led us to where we are today. The third reason is that if our intention is to be a middle-income country, we must have an adequate, reliable, and predictable supply of power. If from 1964 up to today, TANESCO can only generate 1,438 MW, we don't see that TANESCO can take us much further toward being a middle-income country; we have to restructure it. There are economic, technical, and socioeconomic reasons that compel us to restructure TANESCO, and we are going to do that. We have requested that TANESCO itself comes up with a proposition to have a very efficient, quality-driven type of organization. The second document will be submitted by others in the ministry on their own vision. For the third one, we are going to use a consultant who will be paid by the African Development Bank, which will also deliver a proposition. There is no excuse; we have to transform and make sure the power is there. The transmission systems are old and obsolete, distribution is very poor, and so is energy efficiency. At the moment, they have grid losses of more than 20%. We have to bring this down. We cannot do that with the current structure of TANESCO. I do not know what the offspring will look like, but it is likely that we will have more than one.</p><div class="quote">“Energy is the engine of an economy everywhere in the world."</div><h4>How does science and technology accelerate the growth of the energy and mining sectors and help you achieve the 2025 goals?</h4><p>I am a geologist by profession, and I strongly believe that science has the solutions to the problems of global society. I recently told Parliament and the people of Tanzania that economic prosperity for the 21st century, and the subsequent century, has a very simple solution when you put it on paper. However, it is very hard to interpret and implement that equation. Our contemporary economic prosperity equals science plus technology, plus innovation, plus financial capital, plus human capital. These are the five obligatory ingredients for any country to become prosperous in our times, today and in the future. Whatever you touch is science. The country that becomes the most prosperous is the one that generates knowledge. A country that becomes prosperous in modern times is the country that is capable of absorbing new knowledge. It is knowledge that generates technologies. It is the combination of science and technologies that bring about innovations. Those three are very important and they have to be supported by resources, finances, and humans.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Bahçeşehir Schools' educational philosophy?</h4><p>At Bahçeşehir Schools, we consider ourselves leaders in the field of education. Our educational philosophy places the student at the center of the learning process. We believe that children are competent learners that develop in many ways and at various rates. However, all children are similar in terms of their need for a base of nurturing, secure, and enabling relationships. We seek to promote the cognitive, emotional, social, and physical growth of each child within an inspiring and nurturing environment. Bahçeşehir Schools has 43 campuses, 33 primary schools, 16 high schools, and 48 pre-kindergartens. At Bahçeşehir schools, we are always willing to bring in innovations and introduce the most recent technological educational tools to our students on each of these campuses. We believe in the necessity of integrating ICT in our teaching and learning processes. Thus, we highly prioritize the use of interactive whiteboards, smart TVs, iPads, and PCs. In cooperation with our universities, we also follow the most recent educational trends and implement those in our schools, such as the Global Citizenship Bilingual Program. Moreover, we aim to transform all of our schools into Digital World Schools. Our academic staff designs and writes the curricula and the content to be used in our iPad experiential learning sessions. We are privileged to have the facilities to publish our own educational materials.</p><h4>How would you explain the demand for private schools in Turkey?</h4><p>Education in Turkey is generally governed by the national system. In fact, 98% of Turkish children go to public schools. However, there is huge demand for private schools in Turkey. When compared with OECD countries, the demand for private schools is about 12%. Turkey has significantly expanded access to education in the last decade, but remaining challenges wait on two key fronts; quality and equity, as stated in a recent World Bank report. The highest performing education systems are those that combine equity with quality. School failure penalizes a child for life. Educational failure also imposes high costs on society. The statistical data confirms that after years of schooling, many students who graduate from secondary schools do not reach even the minimum level of skills required for their development. Improvement starts with changes in teaching and learning focusing on student success. When the support practices in OECD countries are observed, some key findings such as school leadership, high-quality teachers, coaching and mentoring programs, context-specific academic improvement strategies, efficient use of a variety of resources, formal common planning time at school, merit-recognition, individualized learning models, the use of ICT, and continuous in-service training can be listed. Considering all of these factors, it can easily be said that the education offered in private schools is better than that offered in public schools. For instance, at Bahçeşehir Schools, our priority is to use the most effective learning models that are based on a set of guiding principles, which take equity and equality in teaching and learning into account. These guiding principles include creating learner-centered and child-friendly learning environments, using social, inclusive, personalized, structured, and well-designed curricula, which promote inquiry and autonomous learning. Within the scope of the private school education industry and market in Turkey, Bahçeşehir Schools have substantially grown over the past 20 years since our foundation in 1994. Bahçeşehir Schools rank among the most prestigious educational institutions across the country and abroad, and continue to be the leaders in the field of education.</p><div class="quote">“We provide our students with a variety of academic programs and the most up-to-date educational tools."</div><h4>What makes Bahçeşehir Schools unique in the private education system in Turkey?</h4><p>We provide our students with a variety of academic programs and the most up-to-date educational tools at our different school campuses, such as Bahçeşehir Science and Technology High School. Bahçeşehir Science and Technology High School, which opened in 2006, has proven to be the most successful high school in Turkey through its national and international achievements and awards in competitions, as well as its outstanding academic success. All students at the high school win full-tuition scholarships. These students are accepted by the most prestigious universities all around the world and are often awarded merit-based scholarships that are based on their academic, athletic, artistic, and other abilities. During its third year of education, Bahçeşehir Science and Technology High School increased its admission rates by accepting students with the top 100 scores on the National High School Placement Exam (SBS). In other words, we accept the top 24 students among a population of 1.5 million across the country. The Turkish educational system is based on numerous standardized exams. Students who attend private schools receive a high-quality education and they achieve great success in all national placement exams as well as international exams such as TOEFL, IELTS, and the SAT. These students easily pass the exams and become eligible to study at prestigious universities both in Turkey and abroad. The reason why Turkey has such a large number of exam preparation centers is that students who do not have the opportunity to attend private schools opt to take remedial courses in order to be successful in national placement exams. As a consequence, many exam preparation centers have opened all around Turkey. Bahçeşehir Schools opened Uğur Exam Preparation Centers across the country. In total, there are 200 of our centers offering high-quality exam preparation programs for a variety of purposes in order to meet different requirements and the needs of students from grade one to 12. In these centers, we work with highly qualified teachers and our resource center offers our students a rich learning environment. We provide our students with academic support to bolster their study habits and hone in on their study strategies. We also offer one-on-one sessions with peers and professionals, as well as a variety of workshops. We focus on promoting a disciplined approach to study, fostering active and independent learning, developing an awareness and understanding of one's own thought process, and advocating the strategic use of resources that are available in the centers. Our centers serve as academic referral, training, and information resources for all of our students. We also work in collaboration with Bahçeşehir University's Faculty of Education. The faculty provides comprehensive teacher training to all of our academic staff. In other words, Bahçeşehir University represents a network of scholars with a shared focus and a set of goals that reflect a true sense of community.</p><h4>How important it is for Bahçeşehir University to develop international connections?</h4><p>Every year, Bahçeşehir University welcomes hundreds of international scholars and students to its campus and sends hundreds of Turkish students abroad, offering opportunities not only for study, but to share cultures and foster respect for and an understanding of differences. At Bahçeşehir University, international programs and connections function as catalysts for internationalization and hubs for foreign activities. These programs provide leadership and support for internationally oriented teaching, research, and creative work. To this end, Bahçeşehir University aims to promote international scholarships, educational exchange, and linkages with individuals and institutions abroad. Bahçeşehir University has opened campuses in Germany (Berlin), the US (San Diego), Canada (Toronto), Azerbaijan, and Singapore. Our basic purpose is to further globally oriented knowledge and activities across the world and help create a community and society responsive to the increasing global needs and obligations of citizenship.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abu Dhabi is quickly becoming one of the world's top business destinations. What are the factors that lend credibility to Abu Dhabi as an international business hub?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is one of the world's most modern capital cities, offering a vibrant business environment and secure living conditions. Guided by the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, the economy has reduced its reliance on the oil sector and laid greater emphasis on knowledge-based industries. At the same time, there is considerable effort to leverage the Emirate's substantial resources and experiences in the energy sector by investing in an evolving world energy market that is increasingly looking to renewable energy. Modern logistics infrastructure and new industrial zones have been created to support heightened economic activity. As a result, today, Abu Dhabi is seen as a leading business hub and gateway for global players and is attracting investment from all over the world.</p><h4>How has the UAE Federal Government's economic policy changed as a result of the global financial crisis?</h4><h4>The UAE was not immune to international and regional economic developments following the global financial crisis due to the open nature of its economy and the UAE being an important supplier of oil to the rest of the world. However, this did not derail our policy of economic diversification. Instead, the UAE government has been aggressively pursuing the diversification strategy into non-oil, high-value manufacturing and service sectors. Our policy has been to stay focused on the path of innovation and partnerships, which we have identified as essential elements in building the nation's competitiveness.</h4><h4>How will the UAE government's announcement of an unprecedented economic expansion of more than AED100 billion worth of public and private projects improve the economy?</h4><p>Economic diversification has opened new avenues for investment in the UAE, with the non-oil sector contributing 68.7% to UAE GDP in 2011. The core focus will be on the industries of the future, including transport, logistics, hospitality, tourism, and renewable energy, which will drive employment generation and economic development. Also, a raft of new projects in social infrastructure, health, and education will make the UAE one of the best places to live and work. Together, these projects will pave the way for the creation of a sustainable economy.</p><div class="quote">“The various initiatives of each Emirate are aimed at supporting the overall growth of the UAE economy."</div><h4>How has the privatization of some government services improved competency levels and allowed the government to concentrate on other key areas?</h4><p>The privatization of government services has shifted a significant component of government activity to the private sector. By including the private sector in the development process, the government has not only been able to keep the money flowing within the domestic economy, which has reflected positively on the overall economy, but the initiative has also helped revive the internal investment process. As a result, while on the one hand the economy has become more competitive, on the other the government is better placed to focus on major areas of development activities.</p><h4>Is there a risk that high levels of government spending will crowd out the private sector?</h4><p>The UAE's economic situation is in no way discouraging private investment or leading to higher costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses. On the contrary, the UAE has created an attractive business environment that provides investors stability and a wide room for the growth of their businesses as well as many other benefits. That is why today the UAE is the regional headquarters of over 25% of the top 500 companies in the world. It also ranked the 26th easiest place to do business, moving three places up, out of 185 countries worldwide on the World Bank's Doing Business 2013 report. It also stands out first in the region and fourth in the world in the IMF's Ease of Doing Business Index.</p><h4>What is the UAE government's strategy to boost FDI in the Northern Emirates?</h4><p>The Northern Emirates hold plenty of opportunities for development activities, particularly for oil, engineering, and construction firms. The UAE is a leading FDI destination, and FDI inflow into the country is estimated to have surged 21% to $9 billion in 2012 from $7.6 billion in the previous year. Currently, major infrastructure projects are underway across the Northern Emirates and the government welcomes FDI activities matching local development requirements.</p><h4>In order to maintain a sustainable economy, how important is it for Emiratis to seek employment in the private sector?</h4><p>Sustainable economic development will not be possible in any economy without the engagement of the local population in the realization of economic goals. The UAE Vision 2021 envisages a sustainable economy in which UAE citizens will carve out their future in a spirit of entrepreneurship and responsibility. It is estimated that only 22,000 Emiratis are working in the private sector despite recent figures indicating that the sector itself provides for more than 4 million jobs. The private sector is a key component of the UAE economy, and certainly we need the support of a UAE national workforce to contribute to a vibrant economy.</p><h4>The Dubai government has undertaken an ambitious plan to make the Emirate a hub for Islamic banking. What role will the UAE Federal Government play?</h4><p>Islamic finance has become an important component of the global economy, and the UAE government has been supportive of initiatives to tap the massive opportunities available in the industry currently valued at more than $1.6 trillion globally. The UAE is already one of the biggest markets in the region for Islamic banking, and we expect that Dubai's ambitious plans will help further improve this vital segment's contribution to the economy. The Islamic banking sector has a bright future in the UAE as it has been playing a major role in financing infrastructure projects, residential properties, and corporate expansion.</p><h4>Abu Dhabi and Dubai are beginning to implement similar destination services (e.g. finance and media free zones). How is the UAE Federal Government ensuring the two Emirates are complementing each other rather than competing?</h4><p>The various initiatives of each Emirate are aimed at supporting the overall growth of the UAE economy. We need not look at such initiatives being confined to the competitive level. The UAE government would encourage initiatives such as these to serve complementary purposes by focusing on different parts of respective industries, building up on areas of strength to support the overarching economic framework.</p><h4>How has recent instability impacted the economic relationship between the UAE and other MENA states?</h4><p>While the UAE is concerned about political instability in the region, the situation has not come in the way of our efforts to build key economic relationships. As a vibrant regional economy, the UAE has maintained good economic relations with most MENA states and is engaged in an integrated action plan to boost economic ties with a number of partners.</p><h4>In 2013 at Davos you said you were taken aback by the pessimistic approach toward the world economy by your international peers. But given European sovereign debt and a slowed US economy, what is your outlook?</h4><p>The UAE's optimism is based on the competitiveness of its economy and its positive outlook. We are aware that the economic climate is still far from congenial in many parts of the world. However, the UAE's economy has shown that it is possible to remain competitive even in a challenging global environment by staying focused on the path of innovation and partnerships. This is reflected in the Global Competitiveness Report issued by the World Economic Forum for 2013-2014, in which the UAE has advanced five positions in the total competitiveness of its economy in one year, from 25th last year to 19ththis year out of 148 countries, coming ahead of such countries as France, Ireland, and Australia. Looking ahead, we are hopeful about stronger international economic relations, particularly in terms of the UAE's trade and economic relations with the rest of the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Claro's milestones over the 2012-2013 period?</h4><p>We have been working toward the integration of systems and networks, both fixed and mobile, in order to be able to move forward into convergence services. This requires some time, but we will see that come to fruition soon. The other milestone for us is 4G. After a lot of discussion regarding Claro's participation in the 4G auction, the issue was resolved and we became one of the main players in the ICT arena, offering 4G services to our customers. These are the two emblematic elements in terms of innovation within the ICT industry at the present time.</p><h4>What is unique about Colombian customers?</h4><p>Colombia in general has been slow in implementing new technologies, but once it starts, it happens very quickly. With the mobile market, innovation started in 1994, five or six years later than the average Latin American country, but it still reached 100% penetration very quickly, probably faster than other markets in the region. Another good example is represented by computer usage; a lot of different companies are looking at Colombia as a growing market at this point in time because it is taking off really fast, and this does not regard computers only, but pretty much any other service. In addition, I consider Colombian consumers to be very price sensitive. For example, mobile rates are probably the lowest in the region and perhaps in the world. The average price per minute rate in Colombia is probably about $0.06, while Claro's is probably about $0.045. Colombians talk a lot, almost twice as much as other Latin Americans. For example, Colombians talk about 210 minutes a month, while an Argentinean is closer to 130 minutes per month.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia in general has been slow in implementing new technologies, but once it starts, it happens very quickly."</div><h4>How is the competition in the sector in Colombia?</h4><p>If you focus on the sector, today you have four more companies that are providing mobile services, so there is competition, as well as different Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) options for consumers. The churn rate—the switch rate from one provider to another—stands as one of the best indicators of competition. Colombia has the highest churn rate in the world: about 4%. With no competition, this figure would be very different.</p><h4>What are the current issues in the sector, especially regarding the lack of infrastructure?</h4><p>There is no lack of investment. Clearly, there have been commitments from all the companies, and especially from Claro. There are indicators that prove that to be the case; for example, the coverage of 3G today is probably one of the highest in the world. Around 95% of the municipalities have access to 3G. Given the fact that each municipality defines its own regulations regarding the deployment of infrastructure, permits take forever to be issued, which creates delays and slows our ability to deploy infrastructure. We cannot go as fast as we would like to keep up with the ability to invest. Also, the electricity issues, especially in rural areas, can be regarded as something else holding us back from moving forward.</p><h4>What was the role of Claro in terms of broadband improvement?</h4><p>Claro has two big fronts: keeping the share of the market that we have from the mobile side, and, at the same time, growing very quickly in 3G coverage. One of our biggest challenges is to be able to provide speedy broadband at all times. Since this is shared infrastructure, the quality of service varies depending on different times of the day. Regardless, the major chunk of the growth is still coming from the mobile side, and that is our driver. From the landline side, we have grown a lot in broadband, even to the point where today we are close to being the leader among the five major broadband providers in Colombia.</p><h4>Can you talk about Claro's Wi-Fi hotspots?</h4><p>We are growing our Wi-Fi coverage with the idea of being able to complement the two networks, to funnel traffic from the wireless side into the wired side, and to use that capacity throughout the country. Given the restrictions we have on the deployment of infrastructure, this task is something that is not under our control in terms of managing traffic from the two networks.</p><h4>What improvements will the submarine cable, AMX-1, bring to Colombia and Latin America?</h4><p>We have a certain amount of data capacity in the country overall. The AMX-1 will multiply that capacity by 50 times, which will enable us to manage the internal network and the local country network. We will then have the company's networks, both wired and wireless, meshed together, and be able to funnel traffic through either of those channels. Today, due to continuous innovation, the network is really becoming one. On top of that, we are adding the fiber optics project, which will add coverage to different parts of the country and bring significantly higher speeds in terms of data transmission, allowing us better connectivity with the rest of the world. For the future competitiveness of the country, we hope for faster infrastructure deployment. It is becoming evident this is something we are missing in order to take advantage of our free trade agreements (FTAs).</p><h4>What does cloud computing represent in terms of strategic management and IT services for the companies?</h4><p>It allows companies to bring technology closer to home, allowing businesses to be more competitive. Furthermore, it represents the adoption of technology from the mass market. We will see people being able to use the memory capacity to store files remotely, and it will hopefully bring down the cost of broadband and computing because you will not have to own that memory locally in order to use it. That is part of the evolution of shared software, which is something we are doing with partners like Microsoft.</p><h4>Which areas of the IT sector have more potential for growth?</h4><p>Broadband, as well as data services, continue to be our drivers for growth—fronts on which we are working really hard. Today, for example, we have 250 municipalities covered with cable. About 80% of that is already bi-directional, which allows you to provide not only TV services, but all the other services as well. It is clear that huge investments will be necessary, provided that we can resolve the instability that we are seeing today. I believe the cloud will be the engine because I think companies will very quickly start offloading all the things that actually bring down companies—things that are outside of their core business.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the ICT sector in Colombia for 2014, and for the role of Claro in it?</h4><p>For the ICT sector, it is clearly a year for investment and 4G will be the key driver of that with many companies testing different business models. In keeping with our present business model of offering mobility to Colombians, Claro's future plans will be no different from the past. We are reinvesting about 70% of our profits year after year and Claro is a large corporation compared to the size of the country, so the amount of investment is remarkable. The other area of focus will be the customer service area, where we are working on improving and having much better indicators in terms of customer satisfaction. We want to make sure people get the answers and have the services they are looking for. This is a challenge, but we are investing in a lot of new points of sale, customer service centers, call centers, and in all the different channels to become better on that front.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does GlobeMed contribute to developing the healthcare sector in the country?</h4><p>We have a new motto: “Taking Care of Healthcare," because we believe our role is not just to manage the claims and see whether a bill is correct. Rather, we want to improve healthcare standards, and to communicate with the insurance companies and healthcare providers on best practices to ensure patients get the best healthcare at the lowest cost.</p><h4>How do you assess the healthcare industry in Lebanon?</h4><p>Lebanon remains the hospital hub of the Middle East because of its excellent education system. Health care and education are highly symbiotic; doctors and nurses have access to excellent universities, and Lebanese universities have access to universities in France and the US, from which they source cutting-edge technology. They are always on the lookout for new therapies and equipment. Health care in Lebanon, and healthcare delivery, are very good sectors. We have excellent hospitals, diagnostic centers, pharmacies, and doctors. The problem we are facing is in the cost of healthcare versus what people can afford. And this is where we come in. It is always a struggle to balance the quality and cost of healthcare. Because our country is blessed with very good healthcare and people who are ambitious about providing patients the best quality of care, they are always keen to have the best equipment, to perform the most modern operations or procedures, and to make use of the latest technologies and drugs. Of course, all of this has a cost.</p><div class="quote">“We have created alliances within and beyond the region."</div><h4>What is the added value of your expansion for your cardholders?</h4><p>We have created alliances within and beyond the region. Our insured members move around; they go from Saudi Arabia to the UAE, they come to Lebanon, they go to Syria, and return to Saudi Arabia. We wanted each of them to have our GlobeMed card and be recognized by all of our contracted healthcare providers so that they do not have to pay when travelling and then bring the bill when they go back to Saudi Arabia to be reimbursed. Healthcare providers contracted with any of the GlobeMed TPAs honor any GlobeMed card (wherever it is issued) and provide cashless services to cardholders against seamlessly automated guarantees of payment generated through a swipe of the card. Subsequently, we acknowledged that people travel beyond the region and we wanted them to benefit regardless of where they were. Accordingly, we signed contracts with organizations around the world to provide similar services, wherever our card members we to be found. Today, the original 17,000 healthcare providers that we were contracted to within the region have risen to more than 500,000 worldwide.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy?</h4><p>Our strategy follows three principles. First is our vision of developing according to a schedule that covers the MENA region. We need to be present in every country there; this is where we want to be because it is our region, our language, our culture, and our backyard. We want people who are insured with any of the companies that we serve to be able to travel around the region and be served wherever they may be. The second strategy is more opportunistic in nature. We have visited places like Nigeria and the Ivory Coast having perceived an opportunity, even though they were beyond the scope of our immediate expansion strategy. As we have a team working in North Africa, and are already present in Egypt, we are currently working in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, and Sudan. We are also contemplating locations of high potential, such as Turkey and Central Europe. The third strategy involves the franchising division. It is all about strategizing the way we work—making sure that the 12 current operations, and those coming about this year, all work uniformly. This not only involves the same color scheme, logo and name, but also the same information system, operating procedures, and more importantly service levels as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps are being taken to promote the financial markets in Lebanon?</h4><p>In an effort to foster the development of the financial markets in Lebanon, the Lebanese parliament endorsed and promulgated the Financial Market Law No. 161, in which I had the honor to participate. We have been discussing organized financial markets since 1996. Many drafts were made, but in the end the new law was finalized with the help of the central bank and the Ministry of Finance, and was voted in by parliament in August 2011. The law is now the basic feature for organizing the financial markets in Lebanon. It governs all operations related to issuing, purchasing, and promoting financial instruments that will be offered to the public or listed on the stock exchanges. It is about to boost the activity of the Lebanese financial market by ensuring and easing the market's transparency, liquidity, and efficiency. The new law, which is now under implementation, dictates the appointment of a new capital market authority formed of six members (three of them are experts that are full time) in addition to a chairman (the governor of the Banque du Liban). This capital market authority will be responsible to develop, create, and establish all the regulations for the financial market in Lebanon. Members of the authority are preparing the regulations related to transparency, governance, and disclosure with help from the World Bank and experts from the central bank. We are placing great hopes that the authority will be like those in London, Paris, or New York. It has exactly the same very strong powers to ensure the operations of the financial market and its regulation. Also, the new law provides for the establishment of a special financial market tribunal to settle and look into all disputes concerning the financial markets to avoid going to the lengthy procedures of normal tribunals. It has disciplinary powers as well as regulatory powers. Another important point in the new law is that within one year the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) will have been transformed into a joint-stock company from its current status as an official establishment. In the first step, all the shares will be possessed by the government, because now the government owns it, but within six months it has to be privatized and sold; however, the law does not say to whom. Therefore, it is left to the financial authority to decide how much of a stake the government will retain.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing Lebanon's capital markets?</h4><p>We are among the remaining countries that have a stock exchange that is considered a government institution. Most of the exchanges now are purely private companies. As well, there is a lack of trust and confidence from institutional investors due to the absence of a capital market authority. In terms of companies, many private businesses are family-owned and they hate disclosing their activities.</p><div class="quote">“The best opportunities in Lebanon are in the real estate sector and the large banks."</div><h4>What advantages does Lebanon offer for international investors?</h4><p>In addition to the strategic geographical location of Lebanon, at the crossroads of Africa, Asia, and Europe, the Lebanese economy is characterized by trust, openness to trade without restrictions, a sophisticated banking system, a flexible exchange rate regime, and the absence of any restrictions on the inward or outward movement of capital. You are free to import and export your capital and all your benefits are given to you and are unconditionally convertible. Also, we have a well-developed legal framework that protects private property and grants Lebanese and foreigners equal rights concerning the assets they have. We have some restrictions on the foreign ownership of land, but this is normal; once you own, you are completely protected and you can buy and sell as you like. Lebanon is considered, and has always been, a financial center. It lost this privilege for the time being, but we hope to recover this position despite the existence of other centers due to the capacity and quality of our personnel and human resources, who are well-educated, multi-lingual, and very active. We feel that we have all the elements and conditions in place to recover this situation and develop even more.</p><h4>How would you assess the stock market's activity in 2013?</h4><p>Market activity at the BSE witnessed a drop in trading movement during the first four months of the year. Cumulative trading during this period totaled 13.6 million shares valued at $88.5 million, compared to 17.3 million shares for a value of $126.2 million for the corresponding period of last year. This represents a decrease of 21% and 30% respectively on the volume and value of shares traded. On the other hand, the stock capitalization of the listed shares increased by 5.4% to reach $11.1 billion at the end of April 2013 against $10.5 billion at the end of April 2012.</p><h4>Where are the current investment opportunities in Lebanon?</h4><p>The best opportunities in Lebanon are in the real estate sector and the large banks. I do believe that most shares listed on the BSE are traded at around or even below their net book value because of the political and security turmoil in the Arab countries surrounding Lebanon, and not due to sell-offs led by poor investor sentiment. That is why I do believe that the current prices of most listed instruments provide a good investment opportunity for local or foreign investors willing to diversify their portfolios.</p><h4>What is your outlook for IPOs in 2013?</h4><p>There will not be a lot of new listings; all that we expect is the additional listing of preferential shares from banks. We don't really expect to have new IPOs for 2013. This is due to the current situation surrounding Lebanon. However, we hope at least for Middle East Airlines (MEA) as well as other companies to list in the years to come. MEA, as well as other companies, had decided to go partially public; however, they are postponing this step. MEA is owned by the Banque du Liban. It is not the job of the central bank to own an airline, but it was necessary at a certain stage to reform this company and put it on the right track—and it succeeded. We also have communication and mobile companies that are owned by the government. The companies that run them are private, but only deal in the management of the networks. They don't have the obligation of properly developing the infrastructure of these companies. We do believe that the launch of a privatization plan for these companies through the financial markets will add substance to the stock exchange and increase the appetite of locals and foreigners to invest in the BSE.</p><h4>How important is online trading?</h4><p>It is very important. Now, everything is online. We are very well organized technologically for this and we are always updating the system.</p><h4>What is your outlook over the long term for the BSE?</h4><p>Now, we are looking forward to the implementation of the new law in the coming few months, and we are confident that the creation of the new capital market authority will give a clear message to investors that Lebanon now has the proper legislation to control and regulate the financial market. We are sure that this enforcement will contribute to the development of a successful domestic and regional exchange. With the amelioration of the political situation, this will help to make the BSE again one of the most important regional exchanges.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of Lebanon as a regional entertainment hub?</h4><p>The main advantage is the people themselves, who take pleasure in socializing and enjoy spending money. In addition, of course, there are the diverse outdoor venues, while in the summer it's difficult to resist the call of the beach. The entertainment business is kept alive by ordinary people who run their own businesses, rather than by major investors. The bars are usually run by the owners themselves. Many young people who started from scratch ended up opening their own premises, and hence the market tends to be more local than big-chain oriented. This adds a personal flavor to the entertainment scene. It is also quite unlike the regular scenario in Europe, where the streets feature anonymous huge bars without a personal story.</p><h4>What makes the Lebanese customer unique?</h4><p>Lebanese people are very open minded and accept changes in entertainment, but not in terms of culinary taste. They enjoy eating Lebanese food, and that is why all of the restaurants have the same menus. Lebanese food is excellent. However, this aside, the entertainment sector is open to music and anything new. That is why Lebanon cannot easily be compared to other tourist destinations. People enjoying the nightlife today have been doing so for the past 10 years in an atmosphere of familiarity. This makes for a very local market where people tend to know each other. Tourists usually tend to mingle and dance, but that is not really the case with the locals. It is a very small community. A couple of years ago, the situation was different because there were many more tourists. On another level, Lebanon would clearly suffer without the regular contribution of Lebanese expatriates. Few understand that the Lebanese economy has been floated on families' wealthy children living abroad, or by the comfortable uncle or aunt who pays the bills. These expatriates absolutely sustain this country. In short, Lebanese people are eager to spend, and love to party.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon would clearly suffer without the regular contribution of Lebanese expatriates."</div><h4>What makes White different from other clubs in Lebanon?</h4><p>White is a more fun and cozy place compared with other entertainment venues in Lebanon. We stage dance shows regularly, and our primary mission is to ensure that our customers are having fun. This concept was borrowed from my sister, who is the official architect at all of our venues. She created the name and the concept of White. The name itself comes from the fact that the club is located on a rooftop, and can be lit with different colors. However, we usually use white light to illuminate the dark night around our customers. Being surrounded by light creates a certain positive vibe. White is more appealing for an open-air venue in stark contrast to the subterranean atmosphere of clubbing venues that some find dark and unwelcoming. In fact, for this reason, White is appealing to all generations. In addition, we play a chilled and commercial music set, compared to the usual clubs, where “underground" music is the norm. We are not in the market for heavy music, but seek our customers' happiness. People dance much more at White than at other venues, largely because of the choice of music.</p><h4>Is Addmind planning to open any new venues abroad?</h4><p>We are opening Iris in Abu Dhabi on Yas Island, where the Formula One event takes place, a truly beautiful location. Additionally, we opened a club similar to White in Dubai on August 22, 2013. In Lebanon, the market is already saturated, so we are currently brainstorming ways to expand in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai. The problem is that the Lebanese market experiences many up and downs. Indeed, 2013 has been a notably unsuccessful year in terms of profits. In light of this instability, when volatility arises, we have to close, which means 300 employees have lost their income. This happened to us during the war. In contrast, however, when business comes, it booms. The huge number of customers we receive during boom years is practically unbelievable.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of DuPont's philosophy and presence in Mexico?</h4><p>DuPont was founded at the beginning of the 19th century in the US. The first 100 years were mostly about explosives, which were used to build infrastructure in many countries in the 1800s. In the 20th century, it was more centered around chemistry. That was when we developed and launched products like nylon and spandex, Teflon®, and a wide number of high performance and differentiated products. About 15 years ago, we started a new era at DuPont, characterized by a transition from being a chemical company into a science and innovation company. We have very strong knowledge and capabilities in a number of scientific disciplines, from biology, chemistry, and physics to advanced materials, which has allowed us to develop cutting-edge solutions for a range of industries. This is why we are moving into the food, nutrition, and health sectors, where we work toward addressing nutrition-related challenges that the world will be facing in the coming years. The world population reached 7 billion in 2012, and it might reach 9 billion by 2050. That is an extra 2 billion people that will require food and services in a number of areas. I try to put these numbers in terms of the Mexican population, and have worked out that the population of our country is growing by about 2 million per year, which places increased demands on infrastructure and supplies. The capabilities and skill set we have as a company allows us to be well placed to become an important player in serving a growing society's needs. The area of energy, of course, will become increasingly important, and the government is trying to pass reforms aimed at boosting the potential of the energy sector that will address both today's and future energy needs of our country. We see ourselves as a science company that drives innovation through strong collaboration with customers and stakeholders along the value chains where we participate, with a particular focus on food, nutrition, energy, and protection.</p><h4>In what ways would you like to increase the importance of the Latin American region for DuPont?</h4><p>DuPont was founded at the beginning of the 19th century in the US.

We have very strong knowledge and capabilities in a number of scientific disciplines, from biology, chemistry, and physics to advanced materials, which has allowed us to develop cutting-edge solutions for a range of industries. This is why we are moving into the food, nutrition and health sectors where we work towards addressing nutrition-related challenges that the world will be facing in the coming years. The world population reached 7 billion in 2012, and it might reach 9 billion by 2050. That is an extra 2 billion people that will require food and services in a number of areas. I try to put these numbers in terms of the Mexican population, and have worked out that the population of our country is growing by about 2 million per year, which places increased demands on infrastructure and supplies. The capabilities and skill set we have as a company allow us to be well placed to become an important player in serving the growing society's needs. The area of energy, of course, will become increasingly important, and the government is trying to pass reforms aimed at boosting the potential of the energy sector that will address both, today's and future energy needs of our country. We see ourselves as a science company that drives innovation through strong collaboration with customers and stakeholders along the value chains where we participate, with a particular focus on food, nutrition, energy and protection.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico could become an extremely attractive investment destination."</div><h4>Could you tell us about the agribusiness divisions of DuPont and their performance in 2012?</h4><p>Three of the 13 business units that we have globally are related to the agro-food and nutrition platform, namely under the crop protection business, the pioneer seeds business, and the nutritional and health business. The range of new products that we have been able to launch over the last five years and the products that we have in the pipeline for the next five years suggest strong growth in these three divisions. This year is no exception. The industrial sector of DuPont has had an average year, but not as good as expected. Despite that, our three businesses related to agro-food-nutrition and health are growing aggressively, at a consistent growth rate of 15%-20% a year. Just three years ago, these businesses represented less than 30% of the total turnover of our company, while in 2012 they represented 38%. I have no doubt that in a few years it will be closer to 50%. We are very happy with this progress, and are excited by our ability to reach customers' expectations. Also, Mexico has a lot of potential in the food industry, so we see that as a major driver of our growth in the coming years.</p><h4>Which business units have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Several of them. We have an engineering polymers division that is very closely linked with the automotive industry. I expect a lot of growth in this division because of all the investments that have been announced here for the automotive industry. In the next four years, production capacity in Mexico will grow from the current 2.5 million vehicles to 3.5 million annually. DuPont Mexico has been in operation since 1925. Our competition is very strong, but we have a lot of experience and also have great people so I am confident that we will continue to succeed. We have another division that we refer to as Packaging &amp; Industrial Polymers, which is for developing new and creative packaging films to preserve the shelf life of products and to improve the printing techniques that enhance the value and power of brands before consumers. We also have a pigments division, where we produce titanium dioxide; we have a very large manufacturing site in Altamira, in the State of Tamaulipas. We are making a very significant investment of $580 million in this site to more than double the current capacity—this is a project that we hope will be complete by the end of 2015. We have five such plants in DuPont; three in the US, one in Taiwan, and one in Mexico. We decided to invest in Mexico because the productivity and competitiveness of that facility is second to none. DuPont is the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, and it manufactures it using a technology that we invented and patented back in the 1950s, which gives us a technological advantage. We also have a very interesting division that sells safety, operational excellence, and sustainability know-how to customers. For instance, we have very good relationships with several oil and gas companies, operating plants to the highest safety standards, incorporating sustainability into how all of these operations are ran, and making assets more efficient. This business division has also grown as standards become stricter in these sectors, so our services are becoming more valuable to a larger number of customers every year. We collect the knowledge and experience we have gained from running our own plants and offer it as a package to these our customers. Mexico has a strong industrial base; the exports from Mexico to the rest of the world are greater than the exports of all Latin American countries put together. Mexico exports $1 billion a day worth of products to the US on average, while, in comparison, Germany exports around $300 million.</p><h4>What kinds of projects is your innovation center working on?</h4><p>The DuPont Mexico Innovation Center is a concept that came together about three years ago. The center is, in essence, a big showroom, nicely put together, with meeting rooms and workstations equipped with high-tech conferencing and telecommunications facilities. We are in constant contact with our clients, whether they are current or potential customers. We try to understand their ideas for growth in the future, and what their real needs are based on their own business strategies. Once we understand that, we invite them to come to the center, put together an agenda, and give them a demonstration of what we can do to help them. We invite our scientists from around the globe to talk about specific solutions via video conferencing. Offering global access to our best scientists and engineers around the world has proven to be something customers value very greatly and have has allowed us to improve the speed at which we find and develop solutions. The Mexico Innovation Center was the first one in Latin America and our fifth in the world. It has been a big success, with 245 meetings with customers in our first year. We had a total of 1,100 customers visiting during the first year of operations, with a total of 53 projects identified for development. In its first year of operations, $25 million was generated for DuPont from these projects, and it is just as dynamic in the second year. It helps our own employees to understand our total offering and the drivers that influence growth in different industries. As an example of a success story, we worked with a company named Repshel on a low-cost housing solution mostly for rural areas. The “Polymer Housing" concept and design was developed together by Repshel and DuPont and has been a great success. There's a lot of flexibility in the size of the house that can be built, and what makes it extremely attractive is the lower cost to its next best alternatives and the speed at which a complete house can built; just seven days. The roof of the house, for example, has an integrated solar panel that provides the household with electricity, and the whole housing unit costs just around $8,000-$9,000. This concept was developed in Mexico, and, thus far, 7,000 houses have been built. Peru has requested 500 houses, and 500 more have been ordered for a country in Africa. We are also working on a number of food packaging solutions for rural areas. The center has truly boosted excitement for our employees, customers, and government agencies that have visited the center.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Dolphin Energy in Qatar?</h4><p>Dolphin Energy began as an initiative back in 2002, when the UAE and Qatar started talking about working together to meet the UAE's demand for natural gas. The project eventually came to fruition and is unique because it brought three nations—the UAE, Qatar, and Oman—together in a gas network for the first time. This project was very high profile from the start. Everyone was looking at it because it was the first of its type in the region and would have a significant strategic impact. As such, it received a lot of support from the countries involved.</p><h4>To what extent would you say that the project has impacted the economies of not only Qatar, but also the UAE and Oman?</h4><p>The Dolphin Gas Project has impacted all three countries and supported industrial growth and development, although the biggest impact has been on the UAE, where it meets 30% of the country's energy requirements. However, with a strong track record in community outreach, Dolphin Energy has also played a key role in societal growth and development. Nowhere can this be seen more strongly than in Qatar. The company is a keen supporter of the Qatar National Vision 2030 and the opportunities it offers to drive economic development, environmental stewardship, and societal wellbeing.</p><h4>What strategy is Dolphin Energy following in order to boost exports?</h4><p>There is an agreement with Qatar that covers natural gas supply for a period of 25 years. This agreement obliges us to deliver 2 billion standard cubic feet per day to the UAE and Oman, not including liquids. The strategy is to maintain supply reliably and safely because this is essential to both countries and our customers. We are, in a sense, responsible for energy generation, so you can imagine how important it is to provide uninterrupted supply.</p><h4>Regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR), what are some of the specific initiatives that you have been involved in here in Qatar?</h4><p>I think that people don't realize that we were committed to CSR from our inception. For example, the baseline study for the UAE was conducted to ensure there would be no damage to coral and marine habitats when plotting the subsea export pipeline route. Our commitments developed over the years and today we have a strong track record in community engagement, from supporting Qatari nationals through recruitment and retention, endorsing platforms such as the QP Environment Fair, to the Dolphin Energy Doha Dash, the first mass community fun run that is endorsing the vision behind Qatar National Sport Day.</p><div class="quote">“I think that natural gas will continue to be the main source of energy."</div><h4>To what extent do you collaborate with education institutions here in Qatar?</h4><p>We have a good relationship with all the institutions, particularly Qatar University and Texas A&amp;M University. It is critical we support these institutions—Dolphin Energy requires highly skilled engineers and these universities provide the caliber that we need. We are currently focusing on recruiting Qatari graduates in order to improve Qatarization levels, which currently stand at 32%.</p><h4>In May 2013, you received the Crystal Award. What does this represent for Dolphin Energy?</h4><p>We did, and in addition we received a certificate of appreciation the previous year for the same category: training and development. Receiving the Crystal Award represents an important step in our commitment to Qatarization and is the result of the hard work and dedication of our nationalization team. We work hard to excel in areas where we can display the highest possible standards and have also been recognized for safety and environmental stewardship. This makes us very proud, but the challenge now is to maintain this level.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector as a whole here in Qatar?</h4><p>I think that natural gas will continue to be the main source of energy, as well as the cleanest and most reliable. Qatar is also looking further into the diversification of energy production, particularly into nuclear and solar energy. Another area is shale gas supply and how it could be a challenge for producers.</p><h4>What are the strategic medium-term plans for Dolphin Energy?</h4><p>Our aim is to continue to supply gas to the UAE and Oman. We continue to work hard to make sure that we maintain the uninterrupted flow of natural gas to meet customer requirements. We are also doing well in terms of sustainability reporting and will continue to deepen our commitments in this area and support the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) affected the export sector of the Dominican Republic and what opportunities have arisen from it?</h4><p>At ADOEXPO, we're very focused on generating diversity for the sector, not only in terms of products, but also diversity of markets. We believe that the CAFTA-DR was a logical and necessary step for our country. The US had been our main market for a very long time, accounting for almost 80% of Dominican exports. Thanks to CAFTA-DR, our products have started entering Central American markets, which has really helped in terms of export diversity. Also, it gave us access to resources intended for export capacity building and technical assistance, which has helped the private sector gain knowledge and skills in trade-related matters. Our commercial structure has evolved since, and nowadays our exports to the US account for less than 50% of our total exports—we aim to diversify even further. In that sense, we admire the Chilean model; Chile's exports are roughly divided into quadrants: 25% Asia, 25% Europe, 25% US, and 25% Latin America. That's the model we're working toward as well. Besides the CAFTA-DR, which has been in effect a long time now, we hold other important free trade agreements (FTAs), such as CARICOM-DR, which still has some difficulties in its implementation, ones we are currently working on solving by strengthening regional communication and integration. Also, we enjoy the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Europe. We're trying to adjust our products to suit the foreign market requirements of countries we have trade agreements with, as well as others with great potential and demand for our products. The CAFTA-DR was a learning experience for us because it was our first big trade agreement. We've learned a lot since then and have improved our negotiating skills. The EPA is a great example of that, really establishing the parameters in which we're going to negotiate from now on.</p><h4>What sectors dominate Dominican exports?</h4><p>Right now our most demanded products are medical supplies, textiles, mining, agro industrial, and construction products. As for agricultural products, our main exports in 2013 were cocoa, bananas, coffee, and sugar. Agricultural products are being improved and made more sophisticated, becoming value-added products in the Dominican Republic. Right now, we're the largest exporter of organic bananas and organic cocoa globally. When your products become more sophisticated, they become less sensitive to price fluctuations and they reach specific markets, especially if they are, as is our case, certified in different production and distribution aspects. We are adding value in every step of the process.</p><div class="quote">“We're trying to adjust our products to suit the foreign market requirements of countries we have trade agreements with."</div><h4>What measures are you taking to help enable SMEs to invest in more technology?</h4><p>We just finalized a project recently with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Thanks to this program, we were able to assist many SMEs in obtaining different quality certifications such as Best Agricultural Practices and Best Manufacturing Practices. They were also able to adjust their packaging and labeling to market requirements, and some even got certified and recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). Through programs like this one, we are able to give Dominican SMEs the tools and information needed to be able to export successfully. In terms of investment, I could use the example of Dominican melons. Recently, ADOEXPO participated in the celebration of Dominican Week in the UK, during which we met with many buyers and distributors of fresh produce and discovered that our soil has very similar conditions and quality as that of India, for example, which presents Dominican producers and exporters with a great opportunity. The UK has a very large Indian community, and tropical foods and products are very much a trend right now. So, we brought over investors who knew their market and the specifications of the products their consumers demanded and are now studying the possibility of investing in Dominican production. Through the possible joint ventures and agreements that might result from these efforts, we'll be able to receive important know-how and technology. Now, we're developing new ideas and products of important varieties and great quality.</p><h4>How do you help SMEs get easy access to financing their operations?</h4><p>The creation of a Dominican export bank is underway. It was previously known as the Banco Nacional de la Vivienda, and it was for housing. Now, it has been reformed as BANDEX, the Bank of Development and Exports. President Medina has made it one of his priorities to increase and improve access to finance for producers and exporters, setting up the National Presidential Table for Exports. It's meant to meet regularly with the President so that he can keep up-to-date with the strengths and weaknesses of different sectors, and help design and implement solutions to our challenges. With BANDEX and the National Table for Exports, our exporters are going to experience a lot of positive developments in the next couple of years.</p><h4>What is the significance of the transport and logistics sector for the companies engaged in exports?</h4><p>We're working toward making the Dominican Republic the Caribbean hub. This is what our government, through the work of the CEI-RD, is stimulating. DP World Caucedo is the most modern and complete port in the Caribbean and the only multi-modal port in the region. The port is constantly being upgraded and renovated to suit the changing demands of the transportation sector.</p><h4>What changes would you like to see in the regulatory environment that might help further export growth?</h4><p>We're working together with the customs department of the Dominican Republic in the development of a single window for foreign trade. It's an inter-agency tool that will bring together all the different public institutions that work with export and import regulations and requirements. We're very happy about this one-stop shop for our sector. It should be up and running by the end of 2013.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the mining sector in Colombia and where do you see potential for its development and growth?</h4><p>Mining is an ancestral economic activity in our nation; even before the arrival of the Spanish our indigenous population had a mining tradition. This is why it is not surprising that the mineral potential of Colombia is vast. Nowadays, we have defined 11 strategic minerals, including coal, both metallurgical and thermal, iron, copper, gold, and platinum, among others. These are categories in which we have identified a huge potential for exploration. The government is working, through the National Geological Service, to gather detailed scientific knowledge of the subsoil in order to widen our knowledge base, which will increase investment in the mining sector. The gold sector has mostly been developed by SMEs, and there are estimates that Colombia's potential may be around 35 million ounces, an interesting point for exploration companies. There is also potential in nickel, copper, phosphates, potassium, and emeralds. Emeralds from Colombia are widely known as being the most special in the world due to their particular characteristics. Additionally, we have potential in coltan, a combination of columbite and tantalite, which is a very important mineral for electronic devices. The National Mining Agency (ANM) is in charge of overseeing the mining sector, granting concessions, and issuing titles. We have two ways of doing this, one of which involves a bidding process, which we are restructuring. The other process, according to the law, is a first-come, first-served system. We already have more than 9,700 titles around the country, 35% of which are at the exploration stage and 35% of which are at the production stage. The remainder is in the building and construction phase. Of particular importance is the fact that less than 5% of the territory has been granted and less than 1% is being explored. One challenge the government is facing is finding a balance between mining, environmentalism, and agriculture. For that reason, we are working to reach that equilibrium. If we can do so, the sector has considerable potential. There are, however, other areas that need to be dealt with before this can happen. One central issue for us is the occupational safety of our miners, especially those who are working in underground mines, which account for 86% of the sector. We have introduced new equipment to support the work of rescue teams responding to emergencies. It is the responsibility of the government to work with mining companies and bring them up to the highest safety standards.</p><h4>How would you characterize the demand for coal, given its importance in Colombia?</h4><p>The demand for coal is still growing. We have been working with different organizations that have been monitoring the world coal markets. Coal will be the engine of energy production because it is the cheapest option; there is no cheaper source of energy nowadays. So, even though prices are fluctuating and are not as good as they used to be, the investments that large companies have made confirm that coal will remain in demand for a long time. In fact, some studies show that the majority of energy generation infrastructure that is going to be built in China over this decade will be coal based.</p><div class="quote">“One challenge the government is facing is finding a balance between mining, environmentalism, and agriculture."</div><h4>What potential is there for metallurgic coal?</h4><p>At this point the price of metallurgic coal is higher. According to recent coal trends, demand from China is on the rise again. Secondary industry is demanding coal. The problem with metallurgic coal here in Colombia is that it is located in the central region of the country, an area that is disconnected the rest of the nation, in particular from the ports. However, several improvements are being made in infrastructure, especially railroads, and the potential for metallurgic coal should be realized in the near future.</p><h4>What was the average coal production for this year and what do you expect for 2014?</h4><p>It was at around 90 million tons, and we aim to produce around 104 million tons of coal next year.</p><h4>Which minerals do you think have the greatest potential for trade, apart from coal?</h4><p>Gold is very important in Colombia, and we forecast about 69 tons of gold production for 2014. Potentially, there are 35 million ounces distributed across 19.9 million hectares. Additionally, we have potential in coltan, as well as platinum and uranium. Nickel is produced in Colombia by a company that belongs to BHP Billiton. Environmental and social responsibility issues are highly important in the exploitation of these materials.</p><h4>What do you think is necessary for the sector to develop further?</h4><p>A refining of environmental responsibility regulations is necessary, and not only from the point of view of companies, but also from the government. Clarifying and stabilizing laws and regulations is something that we have been working on, yet still need to improve on.</p><h4>Could you describe the licensing process for private companies looking to enter the mining sector?</h4><p>We now have an improved technological platform to which proposals can be submitted from anywhere in the world. Three days after the initial proposal, all necessary documents in support of the proposal must be submitted. There are also certain legal, financial, and technical requirements that must be complied with in order to obtain a mining title in Colombia. We re-opened that window on July 2, 2013, and since then we have received approximately 3,100 submissions. We have also reserved an area of 20.5 million hectares to grant through a bidding process, which we are structuring and hope to be able to launch soon.</p><h4>In your opinion, what role does the mining sector play in attracting foreign investors?</h4><p>It has been very important, especially as Colombia is ranked seventh out of the 25 most attractive countries for foreign investors. Even though commodity prices are falling, FDI figures continue to grow as security has improved in our country thanks to government efforts. According to the World Bank and the Fraser Institute, we are very strong in terms of the rule of law and foreign investment protection. Moreover, there is a huge potential for the mining business, in particular considering that our knowledge of the subsoil is still limited; our knowledge of geology is 51%, 20% in geochemistry, and 5% in geophysics. There is a lot to explore in Colombia.</p><h4>How do you see the future of the Colombian mining sector?</h4><p>There is not much optimism for the mining sector mainly because of the pricing environment. Yet, while this is not the best scenario, the demand for commodities, along with market developments in China and India, indicate that prices may rise again and create stronger demand. And, as Colombia has strong mineral potential for minerals such as gold, coal, platinum, and coltan, among others, we think that the mining sector can be developed if things are done properly. We are working to solve our environmental issues and to engage with affected segments of the population. President Juan Manuel Santos is actively involved and the relevant authorities are keen to facilitate the licensing process, not only for mining, but also for environmental licensing and agreements with other sectors. Institutional reforms are central to any future success, and the Ministry of Mines and Energy is keen to develop the mining sector. In addition, the Geological Service is gathering data, not only for us, but also for the hydrocarbons sector. Overall, regulations and the improved rule of law are strengthening the sector, which means that investors know more about what to expect in Colombia.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main goals of your visit to the UAE?</h4><p>This visit is about further developing an already strong and mutually beneficial relationship between Ireland and the UAE. In particular, I want to raise the profile of Ireland not only as a provider of the highest quality food and ingredients in the world, but also as a source of technical expertise in the agribusiness sector that can help partner countries build their own food production capacity. In this regard I believe that there is significant scope for mutually beneficial commercial opportunities in the provision of agro-services in areas such as food safety and quality, innovation, and product development that can lead to successful co-operation and collaboration between Irish and Emirati partners. The reputation of Ireland as a good place to do business, and of Irish companies as honorable, effective, and reliable business partners, is critically important. These are values we share with the peoples of the UAE, and the personal, face-to-face engagement that a visit of this nature facilitates helps to build the kind of confidence that can develop and sustain lasting business relationships. And, of course, we also share a love of all things equine. In Ireland, we breed the finest horses in the world, and have built an excellent and very close relationship with this part of the world, which we hope to further develop and nurture. I hope that the work we do this week to further develop the already strong relationships at the political and commercial levels can be a building block for an even more exciting and mutually beneficial relationship into the future.</p><h4>Where do you see the big opportunities for partnership between the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and Ireland in the agriculture sector?</h4><p>There are strong and obvious synergies between Abu Dhabi's food security policy objectives and Ireland's strategic plan for the expansion and development of its agribusiness sector. Ireland is a small country of just over 4 million people, but already produces enough food to feed 36 million people. Under its Food Harvest 2020 program, we plan to increase the value-added in these sectors by 40% and the value of exports by 42% in the period to 2020. In addition, our long tradition of food production has allowed us to develop expertise in the areas of food research, product development, and production engineering, and I believe that there are commercial opportunities for fruitful engagement between Irish and Emirati companies in these areas. I have already mentioned our strong relationship when it comes to our love of horses. In Ireland, horse racing is part of who we are, and although we are a small nation, we have a proud record of world-class achievement when it comes to thoroughbred breeding. Irish-bred horses occupy four of the top 10 ranked places in the LONGINES World's Best Racehorse Rankings, and five of the last seven European Champion two-year olds were bred in Ireland, with six of them trained there. We already have a very close relationship with the UAE when it comes to the horse industry, and I am confident that we can work together to develop further opportunities in this area.</p><div class="quote">“There are already strong links between the Gulf region and Ireland when it comes to the provision of technology."</div><h4>Why should consumers in the UAE buy Irish food products instead of those of rival exporters?</h4><p>Ireland is a small island nation that is not rich in mineral resources. However, we have a mild maritime climate, plentiful supplies of water, and a landscape of natural pasture lands. We are fortunate to live in an environment designed by nature for quality food production. Our dairy, beef, and sheep products come from grass-fed animals reared outdoors in the most natural conditions possible. As Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine, I am acutely conscious of the rare value of these assets. In planning for the development and expansion of the agribusiness sector in Ireland, maintaining a focus on quality production in a natural environment while harnessing the latest technologies to ensure that food is produced in the most sustainable way possible is a key priority. The sustainable production of high-quality foods has been the hallmark of the food industry in Ireland. More than 11% of internationally traded infant formula comes from Ireland, and the fact that three of the four largest manufacturers of infant formula in the world have chosen Ireland as their home is a testament to our reputation for quality, safety, and sustainability. These are the values upon which Ireland stakes its reputation, blending tradition and natural production methods with state-of-the-art technology to produce the best quality food in the world. This is what people buy into when they purchase Irish food products.</p><h4>How prevalent is knowledge transfer in this sector between the UAE and Ireland?</h4><p>There are already strong links between the Gulf region and Ireland when it comes to the provision of technology and expertise in the agribusiness sector. The Irish Food Safety Authority has established strong links with its counterpart in Abu Dhabi, and provides advice and information exchange in that field. There is considerable scope for further knowledge transfer, however, and I hope that we can replicate this tremendous success story elsewhere by connecting the right people and developing the right commercial relationships. I hope to be in a position to make a positive contribution to this effort during this visit.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your appointment has been described as a move that will help honest discussion within Mexican society, with the potential for effective public policies that will help build the country. What is your incoming strategy?</h4><p>In the energy sector in particular, we are faced with the challenge of making public policy in an environment where it is necessary to disseminate information about the status of the energy industry, and in which the degree of knowledge and the opinions of the public cover a wide spectrum of ideological positions. Before putting forward any concrete proposals, we believe that the public must be informed about the current status of our energy sector, the steps that need to be taken in order to revert the observed trends, and the price we would pay as a country if we fall behind technically, technologically, and in terms of infrastructure for failing to act. Promoting cultural change among the public is very important, a change that will be revealed in a better use of energy resources and in a new individual relationship by each of us with the world of energy and the stewardship of the environment. We also need to be less introspective and retrospective when it comes to energy and consider the sector in connection with the country's immediate and future needs, concerning both production and consumption. In this regard, the Pacto por México (Pact for Mexico) contemplates that energy reform will begin to be designed in 2013 for the purpose of exchanging points of view and developing both the goals and the technical arguments to back it up. Once this effort is consolidated, the changes needed in the current legislation will be put forward. The reform proposal will be discussed, and we hope it can be passed in order to begin implementing the important transformations Mexico is expecting.</p><h4>What part will energy reform take in realizing the Pact for Mexico, and to what extent will the focus be placed on reducing the tax burden of PEMEX ahead of privatization measures?</h4><p>The Pact for Mexico is very clear regarding the timetable agreed upon for the reforms. It therein establishes that during 1H2013, design of the energy reform will begin, followed by an exchange of points of view, and the development of the technical objectives and arguments to back the proposal. Once this effort comes to fruition, necessary amendments to the legislation in force can be proposed. The reform proposal will be discussed, and we expect it to be approved so as to begin implementing the significant changes entailed. There is a significant difference between privatization and modernization. Privatization entails the transfer of property and operation of resources from a public agent to a private one. Modernization, on the other hand, reaffirms the state's stewardship of oil while at the same time seeking manners in which to improve the design and operation of the industry. This approach based on modernization lies at the heart of the reform. Thereby, reform is not a privatization mechanism; the objective is to modernize the sector and achieve the expansion of the benefit of our energy wealth. In this, President Peña Nieto has been very clear: PEMEX is not to be privatized, nor is it for sale.</p><h4>What continued levels of investment into deep-water reserves do you anticipate over the coming years, and how important will this remain to Mexico's long-term energy strategy?</h4><p>The worldwide energy environment has changed dramatically over the last decade. Readily accessible oil is fast disappearing and the world is now turning toward unconventional resources, including deep-water and ultra-deep-water oilfields. Mexico is not exempt from this change and has classified the potential of deep-water and ultra-deep-water oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico as a priority. The recent discovery of the Trion and Supremus beds bode well for our potential in the Gulf of Mexico. The prospective resources of the exploration project Área Perdido, estimated at up to 13 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BoE), could double the current proven reserves of Mexico. In fact, approximately one-fourth of all prospective resources in the country are found in beds of this type; such is the scale and importance of deep-water oil drilling in Mexico. PEMEX faces huge challenges in deep water. Some experts have analyzed the constraints that such operations pose, such as a significant fiscal burden, a low level of budgetary and administrative autonomy, and the impossibility of scientific and technological development. All this has hindered us from gaining more experience in deep water. The challenge now is to grapple with these issues and increase our production in these zones so as to recover the frontline position of our industry. It is imperative that we increase our production in deep water and ultra-deep water at the same time as we draft a solid regulatory framework that will guarantee the security, sustainability, and transparency of operations in the sector. We must focus our efforts on preventing accidents, pursuing international standards, and strengthening our industrial safety and environmental protection processes at PEMEX. If we are to optimize our results in deep water, we must assign clear roles to the various stakeholders in the sector. That is, the regulatory agencies must act based on a clear and independent mandate from the operators and institutions in charge of promoting oil activities in deep water. Given the magnitude of the investment required, we need public agencies to oversee transparency and accountability, as is the case in other oil-producing nations. The Pact for Mexico also contemplates strengthening the industry's regulatory agencies, as well as sustainability ingrained in the processes and operations of PEMEX.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico has great wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and hydraulic potential for power generation."</div><h4>The efficient exploitation of Mexico's shale gas reserves has the potential to transform Mexico's energy landscape. What measures should be taken to realize this potential?</h4><p>In 2010, PEMEX Exploración y Producción (PEP) began work to evaluate the potential linked to this resource. The geological zones of Sabinas, Burro-Picachos, Burgos, Tampico-Misantla, and Veracruz have been identified as oil and shale gas precursors. At present, an investment project is underway to determine the investment needed to carry out geological and geochemical studies as well as the acquisition, progression, and interpretation of 3D seismic information in areas deemed to have unconventional plays. The foregoing will give way to greater certainty regarding the estimates of oil, gas, and recoverable condensate volumes. Also scheduled is the drilling of exploration wells to prove the concept and productivity of the oil beds in the geological zones considered. These elements will make it possible to determine investment programs focusing on the regions offering the highest production potential. Before this happens, the rules for exploration and drilling must be expanded and applied to shale projects in order to reduce the impact on communities and the environment.</p><h4>What do you see as being the key opportunities for Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico has great wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and hydraulic potential for power generation. Currently, 13% of all electrical power in the country is generated through alternative power sources, 10% of which takes place through the use of large hydroelectric plants. Nevertheless, this percentage can be increased through the participation of private investment, by making use of the power-generating schemes contemplated by the Electrical Power Public Service Act. In connection with energy efficiency, we must profit from technological advances in order to attain the full potential for savings in the domestic sector. We should also promote greater efficiency in transportation systems and in the construction of buildings. On the other hand, there is enormous potential within the energy sector itself, through achieving a reduction of transmission network losses, using intelligent networks to promote distributed generation, and substituting expensive fuels for lower-cost alternatives, such as natural gas and hydro-electricity for the generation of energy.</p><h4>What current key opportunities exist for the private sector in Mexico's energy industry?</h4><p>A modernizing reform, doubtless, will seek to increase autonomy in the administration of PEMEX. With increased autonomy, the company will be able to make decisions that will optimize its profitability. At the same time, this approach envisions the participation of the private and social sectors in the non-essential activities of PEMEX, as well as in projects that are not to be included in the investment portfolio. An initial step has already taken place as a result of the 2008 Reform, namely, the establishment of Comprehensive Contracts for Exploration and Production, permitting PEMEX to increase its execution capacity and remain the sole oil proprietor. In regard to the rest of the value chain, the Pact for Mexico mentions that the energy reform will seek to create an environment of competition in the economic processes of refining, petrochemicals, and transportation of oil and do so without privatizing PEMEX's assets. In this manner, the complementarity of public and private investment is sought.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the department reaffirm the ongoing support of the government toward the real estate sector?</h4><p>The Land Department is a fundamental part of the government of Dubai, dealing with the ownership of land and property. It was set up as a committee to work in this field in order to facilitate planning and registration for the ownership of property and to safeguard property rights. In recent years, the Land Department has created and enforced a much more comprehensive and transparent regulatory framework. Our achievements have been very important in the evolution of the market and its recent turnaround. Apart from the continuous development of the regulatory framework, we have adapted to constant technological expansion plans within our procedures and processes while providing extensive training and development programs related to the real estate sector. The Land Department's scope is the internal mechanism, while the Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) deals with external issues in relation to developers, owners, and business regulators.</p><h4>How do you create the right real estate investment environment to attract international investors to Dubai?</h4><p>Attracting international investors is an integral part of the community's economic development strategy. The Land Department has created an ideal real estate investment environment that draws in millions of investors worldwide due to various factors. Firstly, because our strong legal and regulatory foundation is based upon transparency, it becomes a major supporting factor for sustainable and competitive business. Secondly, Dubai is well renowned for being a tax-free haven, thus, by practicing the same, the real estate sector attracts large potential investors. Furthermore, purchasing property in Dubai is a relatively straightforward process wherein property development companies readily sell property without necessarily appointing an agent. This factor streamlines the buying process, making it swift, easy, and simple for investors. Another factor that draws potential investors to the real estate sector in Dubai is the easy access, readily available information, user-friendly guides, and the emphasis given on customer service. Investors are driven by these factors and insist on easily accessible information when making business decisions, which is why the real estate sector of Dubai is exemplary.</p><div class="quote">“The ability to achieve competitive advantages depends on the attributes of the resources and capabilities that we possess."</div><h4>What competitive advantage does Dubai offer in the field of real estate?</h4><p>The ability to achieve competitive advantages depends on the attributes of the resources and capabilities that we possess. Dubai has built very strong infrastructure, from airports to roads, bridges, and trains. This is in addition to the flexible laws and regulations that have put the Emirate in a unique position, not just on a regional scale but on a global one. However, one of the competitive advantages of Dubai's real estate sector, which often gets overlooked, is that it has managed to mix innovation with affordable labor costs. This combination gives developers the ability to deliver quality products at competitive prices. Furthermore, this country's “relatively liberal economic environment" has evolved to “become one of the strongest economies and fastest growing in the world," according to the World Trade Organization. Lastly, our competitive advantage also lies in the ability to build a highly secure nation with great advancement toward becoming a global financial hub with a variety of finance options widely available and easily accessible. Being the business hub of commercial life in this part of the Arabian Gulf, it has the edge to be the center of the world.</p><h4>What is your relationship with real estate developers?</h4><p>We are not only responsible for regulating the real estate sector, but also help in the formulation of the sector's strategies and regulation of the activities of companies that manage residential compounds, as well as the activities of real estate brokers and the owners associations. We also issue rules and regulations that qualify the activities of brokerage, lease contract registration, and certification, as well as issue licenses for real estate development entities. We have a dual relationship with the real estate developers. First of all, we provide assistance to developers in the process of registering property, land, or any specific projects. In order to do this, we have introduced precise mechanisms and user-friendly guidelines to make client transactions easy. Furthermore, we also regulate real estate developers by means of the introduction of an escrow account. Amounts collected from buyers for off-plan properties or project financers are deposited into an escrow account. Its aim is to regulate the functioning of the construction process of units sold off-plan, thus safeguarding the rights of investors. The law, referred also as the Oqood Law, applies to all developers in Dubai, without any exception, who sell properties off-plan in Dubai, and in return they receive payments from the buyers or financers. In addition to the rental aspect, we have launched a very large project called Ejari, which in English means “my lease," and is available on our website. Renewals, cancellations, transfers, and terminations can all be logged. Providing this service on a digital platform enables customers to access it everywhere or on their mobile.</p><h4>What have been the agency's major developments over the past few years?</h4><p>On the leasing side, we not only regulate and develop software but also educate people. In our view, we ensure that the professionals working in real estate continue to learn and train in new techniques to advance their business propositions. We have introduced conditions for licensing and certification. Ejari is one of our major developments and it is a system that enables the registration of rental/lease agreements accessible to owners and real estate management companies. The Ejari system provides a full portfolio of services beyond registering the initial lease agreement. Lastly, for our employees to be able to renew their licenses, they must adapt to continuous learning. We also keep them updated on the latest regulations, systems, and other essential information.</p><h4>How do you see the future of the rental sector in Dubai?</h4><p>Rentals always involve fixed income, and so if you compare them to the interest received at a bank, or to a sukuk, it is always higher in value. There is currently growth in property prices and leasing amounts. These prices increase annually; it is a perpetual source of income, which is a better financial proposition than simply concluding a deal once and for all. I think the basis for investment should always be the security of fixed income. Before the crisis, Dubai was engaged in developing its infrastructure in the broadest sense, to include airports, roads, a metro system, and hotels; today, the prospects are greatly improved as a result, with a much stronger footing than in the pre-crisis era. In fact, in the event of another crisis, the country would be better prepared than in the 2005-2006 period. Therefore, now is the time to pursue fresh opportunities. From the owner association perspective, we started this business from zero. A title deed had previously only related to an entire building, or else to land, but not to an individual apartment. The Land Department was responsible for introducing precisely such title deeds for apartments. From our side, we have to regulate the real estate sector to reflect the environment of Dubai, and this is why, upon examination of the sector in other countries, we designed an owners association model specific to Dubai. We are providing something new in combining real estate licensing and lease management activities under one roof. Previously, people would ask the property to pay our service charge if it was considered too expensive. Today, we have devised a “service charge index" to be linked to each specific plot and tower in Dubai. It will be ready on our portal for all investors and owners to consult before purchase. To receive RERA approval, a summary of the service charge and the full contract also need to be submitted. The developer/property manager is required to submit International Standards on Auditing (ISA)-compliant audits of the service charge financial statements, which are required to be prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These must be accepted by the owners association. We have also completed another innovative project for owners that will shortly be launched. It involves professional software that manages the owners association of a building, where one exists, which is also a first for Dubai.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of CorpBanca Investment Trust over the past few years?</h4><p>I think that it's important to look at it from both a financial and a market perspective. Regarding the former, we have increased our revenues dramatically over the past three years. Business lines that we consider strategic have generated our revenues. It is important to know that in the fiduciary sector, the license is quite wide. Fiduciaries can engage in any branch of business. In our case, we deal with asset management and custodial services. Also, we support our bank with trust structures that help to strengthen relationships with the existing customers of the bank. Meanwhile, in terms of the market perspective, we believe that the role of fiduciary institutions at the present time is more related to deepening the capital markets. In this sense, we have taken the initiative to find the best scenarios for growth in the asset management business and custodial services. The asset management business line involves the mutual fund business and discretionary portfolios, and the main service is global custody, the principle clients of which are foreign. We have launched an innovative product aimed at retail customers in mutual funds, which is the main responsibility of the asset management industry. In relation to GDP, the level of assets under management in mutual funds in Colombia is 6%. In Chile, the figure is at 17% and in Brazil it is at 60%. Finally, we have become the second largest provider of custodial services in the Colombian market, after Citibank. This is good news for us because it is a very important business line with recurring incomes and revenues.</p><h4>You present yourself as an exclusive investment alternative in one of your slogans. What is unique about the service you provide, and how do you view the competition?</h4><p>That slogan refers to an investment fund that we manage, and through it we wish to express that we deliver on our value proposition. When you are selling a customized product, uniqueness is crucial. We offer innovation, high-quality standards, and solutions that are easily adapted to the needs of our customers. We compete on quality, not quantity. We are not interested in the mass business. For competitors in this industry, the model is generally the opposite of our own. We care all about quality, innovation, and the customization of our mutual funds services. With trust structures, the principle objective is to stand out through quality service and innovative products.</p><h4>Is there a strong understanding of the fiduciary sector in Colombia?</h4><p>It needs to improve. It is important to further deepen financial education to ensure that all Colombians understand the various facets of the trust industry. One of the principle vehicles for doing this is a massive advertising campaign to convey knowledge about the attributes and characteristics of investment funds. Through financial education, we must continue to ensure that Colombians recognize or know about mutual funds and other fiduciary vehicles. The driver is that we need to improve public education about the industry.</p><h4>Which companies do you work with mostly?</h4><p>Currently, we have three business lines: asset management, custodial services, and trust vehicles. We have different clients in these business lines. For example, in mutual funds and asset management, our clients are retailers, small businesses, and universities, which consider our fund to be a good alternative for investing and generating savings. Also, we have corporate clients that consider it to be a good option for cash management, and mutual funds. In custodial services, our clients are mostly global custodians. Our average client is somebody who is interested in portfolio investment in Colombia and who needs a local custodian to carry out activities like safekeeping and settlement, which are the services we provide. For trust services, our clients mostly approach the bank for bespoke fiduciary structures such as Fuentes de Pago, or sources of payment.</p><div class="quote">“In terms of investors, we primarily look to the US and to a certain extent Europe."</div><h4>CorpBanca Investment Trust is responsible for the investment of resources through different schemes and collective portfolio development. Which segments in the economy possess the greatest potential for development?</h4><p>The traditional high-value sectors include infrastructure, banking, services, mining, and oil. Now is a good time to think about other sectors or vehicles with different risk profiles. For example, at CorpBanca Investment Trust, we believe in entrepreneurial environments and we think that the venture capital sector, IT, clean technology, healthcare, and other sectors are where we can also find value for our investments.</p><h4>Does your portfolio involve foreign clients, and are you planning to expand even more in global terms?</h4><p>Absolutely. Currently, in custody services, the IT sector is a key driver. We are in the middle of making a decision about our use of IT, in the form of more efficient software that will allow us to provide better services. Global custodians are interested in Colombia, and I think that CorpBanca Investment Trust could be at the level to provide the best service, taking into account our investment in IT technology.</p><h4>Are you looking at markets in the US and Asia, for example?</h4><p>In terms of investors, we primarily look to the US and to a certain extent Europe, because communicating information and market needs is easier to provide when you are in the same time zone. I think that the US is a good opportunity, although there are also some clients in Europe, principally family offices or private banks in Switzerland or the UK.</p><h4>What challenges are you facing in the fiduciary sector in Colombia?</h4><p>I think that we are in the midst of a disruptive climate in terms of the trust industry. Changes in the regulatory environment are affecting the way that we manage the business. From now on, specialization will be preferred over generalization. With this in mind, our sector faces an uncertain period in which trust companies will have to re-think their business models to compete. Sooner or later, we will need to transform to respond to market shifts and adapt our current business model to other marketplaces.</p><h4>You are now Vice-President on the board of the Fiduciary Association of Colombia. Considering your central role in the sector, what are the most important characteristics needed to succeed in this business?</h4><p>I have always maintained a consensus position to find common interests among participants in the industry. On the other hand, my mindset was always to look for new business and industries. I put key issues such as innovation on the table, and focused on the shift of mindset needed to exploit environmental conditions. The other participants in the industry give me a confidence vote to lead the industry. In sum, I believe that a sympathetic attitude toward colleagues is key.</p><h4>How did CorpBanca Investment Trust perform financially over 2012, and how do you expect to perform in 2013?</h4><p>With regard to the 2013 forecast, we are concerned with profitability and continue to pursue income from greater quality and sustainable recurrence. Recurrence is the most important word in relation to revenue. We need to earn a constant and recurring income. For 2013, we are projecting profitability of $4.5 million and our asset owner management line will be close to $5 billion, mainly in assets under custody. We are also prepared to adapt to new market conditions and continue to provide a differentiated service in all our business lines. This is a challenging time to be a trust company, and we are prepared to take advantage of the opportunities and approach diversification in new ways. Our goal is the long-term maximization of value.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What first brought Jindal to Mozambique?</h4><p>The core business of Jindal is steel and power, so the idea behind coming here was to mine coal for our own steel production operations in India. Mozambique is one of the richest countries in the world for mineral resources. In 2008, when we saw that coal exploration in Mozambique was beginning, and particularly coking coal, we came here to set up a mining operation. Actually, before we set up here, two major companies had already done so. Our strategy is not to mine and sell the coal in the local market here, but to utilize it for our own international expansion program. Mozambican coal has the opportunity to respond to the growing market of coal in India, so one of the challenges is to find coal at competitive rates, which is where Mozambique fits into our plans. In addition, risk analysis suggests that Mozambique is a sensible destination for our company, as there is relatively reliable political stability, a strategic coastal location, and good people, in addition to the fact that things move fast here. Overall GDP growth in Mozambique has been at over 7% over the past decade. The only real issue is one of language, although many people speak English, and Portuguese is not too difficult to get a grasp of.</p><h4>There are a number of major international players in Mozambique's mining sector. Do you view these companies as competitors?</h4><p>We do not consider them our competitors since we are the end-user of the coal that we mine. In fact, we may even have to buy coal off them, depending on our requirements. We talk to the other companies through the common forum that is the Coal Association, however, the effectiveness of this body will depend on the miners themselves. It has the potential to be used as a platform for the discussion with the government, such as the future projects including the expansion of the ports, railway, and other infrastructure.</p><h4>You began your first exports from the mine in 2013. What are your next steps for developing your presence here in Mozambique?</h4><p>We took 1.5 years to explore the mine, and on finding the coal we signed a contract with the government of Mozambique, which gave us mining rights for 25 years. It took us another 1.5 years to develop the mine infrastructure. When fully operational in terms of necessary infrastructure, plants, accommodation, and utilities, we began exploiting it. Since mid 2013, we have exported more than 150,000 tons of coal. However, the quantity is short of our requirements, as the infrastructure is not yet synchronized with production. In phase I, we have developed a 3 million-ton-per-annum (mtpa) capacity coal processing plant and now we are moving ahead with another 7 mtpa plant, so, within the next three to four years, we should be able to reach the 10 mtpa level with an option of  reaching up to 20 million mtpa if infrastructure is adequately developed.</p><div class="quote">“The core business of Jindal is steel and power, so the idea behind coming here was to mine coal for our own steel production operations in India."</div><h4>How is the slurry pipeline providing an innovative solution to Mozambique's logistics challenges?</h4><p>The slurry pipeline, while not a new concept globally-speaking, is innovative for Mozambique. We have already done preliminary studies that confirm prove the feasibility of transferring coal to the slurry pipeline. This would be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly means of transporting the resource to the nearest port, approximately 500 kilometers away. It is very feasible, and will support infrastructural capacity. With government support, the system could be online within a couple of years.</p><h4>How would you assess the contribution of the mining industry to economic growth?</h4><p>All the developments over the past few years have had an amazing effect on the country. The mining industry is responsible for providing training and education, and a range of corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects. Ultimately, as the industry grows, there is a knock-on effect on the country itself and its economy, as the sector grows and provides more employment for the citizens of the state.</p><h4>What efforts do you make to confront human capital challenges in Mozambique and provide development opportunities for your workforce?</h4><p>Developing human capital is an integral part of any business. If the proper resources in terms of equipment, manpower, and knowledge are present, then your business can be developed. We are trying to leverage what Jindal has already done in India and across the globe, and to convey our experience to workers. Training is necessary, however, at all levels of the organization, myself and other management-level staff included. We should strive for continuous, unlimited improvement of our skills and knowledge.</p><h4>How does Jindal invest in CSR in Mozambique?</h4><p>CSR is also an integral part of any business. Our strategy is very clear; we identify the projects that people need to improve their situation, specifically the kind of training, education, and healthcare needed. We have worked on clinics that provide free healthcare and medicine for villagers. We have renovated a number of schools, and we distribute study materials. We also send individuals for training from Mozambique to India. In 2012 we sent 25 people, and are planning to have sent the same number by year-end 2013. Water problems are another huge issue. We are in partnership with Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), one of the largest companies engaged in hydroelectric energy, and another mining company to bring water to the surrounding region. That project alone is worth ‚¬9 million.</p><h4>What is your vision for Jindal Mozambique?</h4><p>Simply put, to make Jindal the fastest-growing, and largest company in Africa.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the founding of Qatar Petroleum International (QPI)?</h4><p>QPI was founded with the aim of securing a prosperous future for Qatar through the creation of strategic and commercially attractive international investments across the energy value chain. QPI leverages existing inter-governmental and IOC relationships to become a partner and supplier of choice across the industry, and, ultimately, to develop into a worldwide investor through the acquisition, development, and operation of an integrated portfolio of assets in the areas of upstream, gas and power, and downstream petrochemicals.</p><h4>What are the goals of the Nebras Power joint venture, and what was the vision behind it?</h4><p>The main objective of establishing Nebras Power was to introduce a global Qatari player to the power, electricity, and water industries, and to harness the synergy and extensive experience of the three Qatari shareholding companies. This venture will not only bring together Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC), Qatar Holding (QH), and ourselves under one roof with an aligned strategy, but will also strengthen cooperation between Qatari companies, and, in turn, bolster Qatar's global investment outlook. Moreover, it will take full advantage of the economies of scale and scope that a multi-billion dollar mega-investment company is able to leverage. QEWC will own 60% of the joint venture, and QPI and QH will each own 20%. The shareholders have initially invested $1 billion as startup seed capital to stage the future funding of larger-scale investments. The main investment principles in forming this company include diversifying assets, maturing technology, minimizing risk exposure, optimizing returns, growing Qatar's human capital on the global stage, and positioning Qatar's strategic interests for the long term. The venture's shareholders seek to achieve its set goals within the next three-to-five years. I think that as a result, Qatar is becoming a large player in the power sector. It fits well within QPI's value chain and it utilizes all of Qatar's strengths. Instead of the country's influential companies competing with each other, we complement one other.</p><div class="quote">“As an emerging international arm of QP, QPI has an ambitious plan and strategy to enter international energy markets."</div><h4>What have QPI's main downstream investments worldwide been, and what plans do you have for future investments?</h4><p>To date, QPI has secured several investments for its downstream activities. In 2008, QPI signed an agreement with Shell and Petro China (an arm of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation) to develop a world-class integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. In 2009, a joint venture company was formed between QPI and Shell Singapore, providing QPI access to the integrated olefin and polymer value chain in Southeast Asia. In 2011, QPI signed an agreement with Siam Cement Group of Thailand and Petro-Vietnam, to develop a petrochemical project in Vietnam. Currently, QPI, together with Egypt General Petroleum Corporation and Citadel Group, is developing a secondary refinery in Cairo. This project is in the EPC phase and is expected to start operations in 2016. When complete, it will treat fuel oil to produce high-quality diesel and gasoline, and will virtually halve the import of expensive motor fuels, as well as cut environmental emissions. Going forward, we will continue to develop other opportunities in line with our strategy of diversifying within the industrial sector. We are working to become part of the value chain and to create a meaningful energy portfolio based on three pillars: upstream and downstream activities, gas, and power. We would like to secure good resources in the upstream segment, which will constitute around 60% of our activities in the future. The downstream segment gives us the opportunity to diversify by going into the full stream of the value chain. Compared to other markets, the size and capacity of Qatar is a small niche for Qatar Petroleum (QP); it has to move into the international scene and diversify.</p><h4>What potential does QPI see in African countries?</h4><p>Apart from the established hydrocarbon provinces in the north and west, Africa has remained largely under-explored. Several new prolific hydrocarbon provinces have emerged in the last decade in the Central and East African rift basins (Sudan, Chad, Kenya, and Tanzania), as well as the intra-cratonic basins, such as Taudoni, Murdi, and others. These emerging hydrocarbon provinces have attracted small independent exploration companies and other major IOCs and NOCs. Exploration results have revealed encouraging results that point toward significant potentialities. From a business perspective, these technical and geological successes are encouraging; however, they are countered by several commercial and political factors, such as a lack of infrastructure, weak domestic economic growth, insurgents and civil wars, and some inter-state tensions. Nevertheless, QPI is capitalizing on the positives, while seriously considering and mitigating negative risk factors. We approach these challenges as potential opportunities.</p><h4>What upstream investments are in the pipeline for QPI, both in Africa and elsewhere?</h4><p>As an emerging international arm of QP, QPI has an ambitious plan and strategy to enter international energy markets, including upstream, downstream, and gas and power. Upstream investments require more and more stringent analysis and due diligence. The short-term plan focuses on risk-adverse ventures by leveraging government-to-government relations, and by capitalizing on relationships with major IOCs that are built on trust and the long-term relationship with Qatar. In the near future, we see QPI becoming a major integrated energy player that can venture into exploration growth opportunities. In regards to this, QPI has embarked on two projects. First, in April 2008, QPI acquired a 20% stake in two blocks of the Mauritania Exploration Venture and became part of the venture as a non-operator with Total E&amp;P-Mauritania. The agreement marked the first upstream investment by QPI overseas. The drilling commenced in 2009 on a land area of 58,000 square kilometers and exploration activities are still in progress. Secondly, in May 2013, QPI signed an agreement for our intention to participate in a capital raising exercise for Total E&amp;P Congo, which, if completed, would result in taking on 15% of that company's equity. Additionally, QPI remains active in studying and analyzing various opportunities on a relatively unexplored continent, with the objective of maximizing our share across various energy value chains. Under the leadership of His Highness the Emir, Qatar is emerging as a key player in the world business and political arena. Leveraging and building on this role, QPI is seriously considering several opportunities for energy projects in Africa. Also in line with this strategy, QPI is actively considering opportunities without geographical boundaries. The main objective is to build a financially, technically, and geographically diversified portfolio of upstream, downstream, and gas and power projects. While being risk-aware, we seize any value adding opportunity that meets our technical and economical criteria. Upstream projects in the pipeline include the acquisition of a sizeable interest in partnership with Centrica in the Suncor assets of the Western Canadian Basin, and evaluating additional direct energy assets in the Western Canadian Basin with the objective of acquiring a sizeable interest under the same partnership to create synergies. QPI is actively seeking investment opportunities on a worldwide basis in the energy sector where it can have an active, rather than passive, financial participation. Based on the amount and variety of business opportunities and projects that Africa can offer, and the strategic relationship that Qatar enjoys with African countries, that region remains an area of focus and indeed, a priority for QPI.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What long-term plans are in place for gas in the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE has long been relying on its gas resources. In 2007, the Dolphin Gas Project began to import more gas to the grid from neighboring Qatar. This was the start of our reliance on alternative resources in response to rising gas demand. Since then, the government of Abu Dhabi has also started to revamp its plans regarding more ambitious gas exploration. We started to look at the master plan to assess future growth potential and demand. In 2007 and 2008, business was booming on double-digit growth. We saw the potential for a decline in this growth level should we be unable to satisfy demand. During the crisis we slackened our pace; however, we were still experiencing growth and we needed to secure sufficient gas to justify it. Also, we looked at diversifying beyond gas alone. Gas is cleaner and we, as a country, are keen to target clean fossil fuel energy, rather than just relying on diesel or fuel oil, which are both more expensive and harmful to the environment. They are also unsustainable because they require many refineries, which present a logistical problem. Therefore, we initiated a roadmap that takes us up to 2030. We asked ourselves several key questions about sustainable growth and supply. We are still working on the roadmap, since it consists of several elements, such as diversification and renewables, for example. We are now looking to diversify our gas supply. Emirates LNG is building the largest receiving facility in the world, with a capacity of 9 million tons of LNG, double that of the one in Dubai. Combining the two, the UAE will be the one of the most significant players in the world when it comes to importing liquid LNG, re-gasifying it, and channeling it to the grid. Abu Dhabi alone is planning to spend $25 billion on gas development. We are looking to maximize our development to ensure sufficient domestic gas production to complement our imports.</p><h4>What does rising oil production entail in terms of increased workforce and project spending?</h4><p>We have a duty as an OPEC member to ensure sufficient volumes of hydrocarbons and crude oil in the market to cater for future growth. Increasing our capacity is the right step to ensure the balance of demand and supply. Our role is not to produce constantly, but only when required. We believe that the increased capacity we have planned will satisfy global medium-term needs. For example, many countries maximized output during the crisis to keep prices sustainable for consumers. We don't want the prices of our products to rise prohibitively. When crisis occurs, prices usually spike. We wish to avoid this by having an additional reserve capacity. As the domestic use of hydrocarbons increases, part of the increased production will fuel growth within the UAE, be it liquid, refined products, or otherwise. That is the plan; we are investing and moving ahead with this project. By 2017, we will be able to produce 3.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d).</p><div class="quote">“Today, Abu Dhabi is the largest national generator of electricity, supplying the Federal Electricity &amp; Water Authority (FEWA)."</div><h4>What does the commissioning of the solar power plant, Shams 1, mean for the country?</h4><p>It is a demonstration of what the government of Abu Dhabi is capable of. It is testament to our commitment to promote renewable energy, not only in the UAE, but also globally. We have completed several projects, whether through commercial projects or grants in developing countries. We have completed a project in Mauritania that contributes 10%-12% of the country's total power supply through solar energy. This project was realized through a grant similar to that of those we have completed in the Seychelles and other countries. My view of renewable energy is that it is complementary energy resource, and not a replacement, for gas. However, we need to promote such projects to reduce costs so that renewables become more affordable in the future, and can compete with natural gas. We progressively see that the cost of solar energy is declining compared to that of liquid fuels, which are very expensive today. With diesel, the dilemma is that we cannot know its future price. These projects demonstrate our commitment and keenness to develop technology through R&amp;D. I am optimistic that the price of renewable technology will fall, despite certain challenges in the sector in Europe. Initially, it needs to be subsidized, and we must invest today in order to reap the benefits tomorrow. We also need to remove the barriers that make it difficult for investors to operate. Striking a balance is rather difficult.</p><h4>Can you talk about the UAE's ambitious target to generate 25% of Abu Dhabi's power through nuclear energy?</h4><p>Today, Abu Dhabi is the largest national generator of electricity, supplying the Federal Electricity &amp; Water Authority (FEWA). It also partially meets Sharjah's electricity demand. We anticipate a nuclear capacity of 5,600 MW by 2020, with each reactor providing 1.4 GW in capacity starting from 2017. However, even an initial ratio of 18% to 20% of national supply is a very ambitious plan. Russia, for example, targets 20%-25% of its total generating capacity to come from nuclear power, but it has been investing in and developing this technology for years. This crucial nuclear project has bought us some valuable breathing space for future planning. We selected the location very carefully to minimize any seismic risk.</p><h4>How do you see the western region transforming as a result of these energy projects over the next decade?</h4><p>Historically, the majority of people in Abu Dhabi come from the Western Region. Even though it has very limited water resources, the Liwa Oasis sustained our Bedouin ancestors in the past. The oil industry also started there, and the bulk of the country lies in that region. Even our agriculture sector started there. Visiting tourists are surprised to see the farms and the 120-kilometer green belt that lies beyond the desert. The government of Abu Dhabi is working to create jobs. There are many more jobs nowadays, and the oil sector, the main employer, is well developed. The new rail link, intended for industrial purposes, will make the region more accessible to the whole country. Today, it is attracting more people to live there, as new infrastructure, public services, and educational opportunities, among other things, make it much easier than before. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure to make the Western Region a major energy hub—and not just nuclear power. Indeed, the region is an example of diversification, where three forms of energy are in use: nuclear, oil and gas, and solar.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Energy looking to develop the UAE's human resources in the energy sector?</h4><p>Human resources have been the country's major historic concern. Even though we always had capital, we lacked a qualified workforce. And while we have a small population, we prefer not to solely rely on expatriates. Accordingly, we commenced a system of scholarships enabling our youth to attend some of the best universities worldwide. I, and many others, have been a beneficiary of these scholarships. Today, the challenge is still to develop the young people that will join our ministries and assume the responsibility to deliver results. We need to compete on both a regional and global scale. We are building a specific industry, and do not seek to compete in every field, which is unwise. One of our selective areas, energy, requires the formulation of a reliable, long-term strategy for diversification. You will find that very few countries have diversified efficiently.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has INTEC recruited the best human resources into the Dominican workforce?</h4><p>We rely on our reputation as an environment endowed with creative and innovative ideas, aiming for the best human development.</p><h4>What values does INTEC promote that set it apart from other universities?</h4><p>We are specially committed to a moral obligation to contribute to the development of the Dominican Republic, not only through our scientific activity, but also through the promotion of solidarity and social responsibility. We don't see INTEC as just an educational institution; we think of INTEC as a development machine. That's a very different approach!</p><div class="quote">“We rely on our reputation as an environment endowed with creative and innovative ideas."</div><h4>What is the profile of the student that chooses INTEC instead of another university?</h4><p>INTEC's students are very different from the average student in the Dominican Republic, because we have implemented a very strict selection process. That being said, we are open to students with any background. In some sense, this is a challenging institution, but at the same time it is a very friendly environment for any dedicated person.</p><h4>What advantages do you have in terms of attracting students?</h4><p>The quality of our education, our faculty, the feeling of being part of something special, and our inclusiveness are all key advantages.</p><h4>How do you manage to preserve that quality when you offer so many different programs?</h4><p>We are a technological institution, which has strong programs on Engineering, Health, Business, Humanities, and Basic Sciences. That is not a contradiction, but an opportunity for complementariness. Engineering, for example, is a perfect complement to Health, and our Math program is an excellent complement to our Engineering courses. Our academic structure is well synergized.</p><h4>To what extent do you focus on R&amp;D?</h4><p>We are perhaps the only educational institution in the country that has persistently dedicated more than 2% of its budget to R&amp;D. This enables us to establish communication and contact with government institutions and agencies; therefore, we see ourselves as a provider of scientific knowledge for government and business entities.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your partnerships with established international institutions, such as Pennsylvania State University?</h4><p>Indeed, we have strong partnerships with many of the best universities in the US, Europe, and Latin America. The basis for these partnerships is the quality of the education we provide, and our determination to practice internalization as a cornerstone of our institutional strategy. This also enables us to attract good international students. The figures are still low, between 2% and 3% of INTEC's population, but this will continue to increase.</p><h4>What is your view of the Dominican Republic's educational sector as a whole?</h4><p>Unfortunately, the educational sector is divided into separate tiers; very high quality and very low quality. Our mission is to preserve our quality while trying to contribute to the development of other institutions in the country. I believe collaboration and partnership are very important in order to improve the educational sector in our country.</p><h4>We've noticed that a lot of firms in the private sector have many INTEC graduates. Do you interact a lot with the private sector?</h4><p>Indeed. In addition to human capital, we provide research and consulting services to the business sector, and we maintain a constant dialog with business leaders. For example, we have a monthly lunch with 10 or 12 CEOs on campus to share ideas about our mutual interests. In addition, many leaders or professors of INTEC are members of several commissions in the business sector, so we have a very organic relationship.</p><h4>How strong are INTEC's relations with the public sector?</h4><p>We have very close relations with various institutions in the public sector, including the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Industry, the Finance Ministry, and so on. By the way, it is nice to say that, in particular, the President of the Dominican Republic, Danilo Medina, is himself an INTEC alumnus. We are very proud of that.</p><h4>What is INTEC's message to the potential new students willing to become part of the institution?</h4><p>We demonstrate that it is a good idea to face challenges in order to succeed in the appropriate way. INTEC provides an opportunity to enjoy a full university experience in this country.</p><h4>What is your plan for the coming years?</h4><p>Our goal is to become a complete model of higher education, based on academic strength and on a strong commitment to the development of our society. We will focus on research, international partnerships, and solid relations with the government, business sector, and society. We look forward to continuing as the number one choice for the best students and professors in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges for the development of the agricultural sector in the country?</h4><p>The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the UN has a long history of supporting and strengthening agriculture, but in recent years FAO has focused very much on hunger and hunger education. It is a simple term, but it is quite a difficult job. We know that, worldwide, we currently have about 870 million hungry people, and these figures have been quite stable over the last three-to-four years. Some countries have made progress in the reduction of their hungry population, including the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic has already reached the Millennium Development goal of halving the number of people experiencing hunger. In 1991 and 1992, more than 30% of Dominicans were under-nourished. For 2013, our figures indicate that it is 15.6%. The Dominican Republic has already obtained its goal, and these are things that FAO would like to promote. At the same time, we have to recognize that the situation has not improved in a number of countries, despite good agricultural conditions and possibilities. Currently, in the Dominican Republic, we have found a good environment because the government wants to reduce poverty, and poverty is the other side of the coin in terms of food insecurity. Therefore, if poverty reduction is part of the country's development initiatives, it supports and strengthens food security in the country. It is not only that there is food available, but also that there is access and the capacity to manage and be able to buy and use the food. That is the general worldwide situation. In the Dominican Republic, we have noticed about 7% of GDP is coming from agriculture, and about 14% of the country's employment is provided through the agricultural sector. Therefore, it is quite a strong and important sector; however, in certain areas, production and productivity is lower than in neighboring countries with similar conditions. I think that, from the point of view of food security, the biggest crops are rice and plantains. In terms of area planted, rice is the major crop in the country. The rice production level could be better and in general the productivity is low, because the use of technology is limited and knowledge is lacking. We see this as one of the major challenges in agricultural production. If you are looking at the whole value-added chain, from production to final product, there are not many activities in the Dominican Republic. There are only a few companies producing food items here, for example. Very often, the Dominican Republic exports its primary products. I think that there are a lot of opportunities to correct this and, at the same time, provide more employment and make better use of natural resources from the country itself.</p><h4>What are you doing for small-scale farmers in order to improve their conditions?</h4><p>Around 70% of the Dominican Republic's producers are small holders and they are also the majority of the so-called staple food producers, i.e. plantains and rice. However, there is not a very good information basis about the agricultural situation in the country. The last agricultural census was done in 1981, so we have initiated, with the National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Agriculture, the process of launching an agricultural census, and we hope that this will provide a better information basis on agriculture and also address issues. When we talk about small holders, very often farmers do not have land titles and, if you do not have a title, you are not subject to good credit conditions. It is very expensive to get a land title because it has to be measured. This is also a priority for the Ministry of Agriculture. In the agricultural census, this question will be addressed and we hope that we can have a better picture about the agricultural situation and the distribution of land, productivity, and generally better figures. I also see the agricultural census as providing a sustainable basis for agricultural investment; it is the basis for having better information, but also better planning and better-targeted measures for the agricultural sector. This is part of improving the framework conditions for agriculture and, therefore, we are also in discussions with local politicians and NGOs as well. Also, we are assisting the National Water Resource Institute in developing a new law for water management, covering issues of water distribution and the like. Similarly, we are working with the Ministry of the Environment, which is responsible for the forestry sector, in order to improve its legal measures so that the forests can be better utilized in the country. We do not normally try to address individual farmers; we try to address their associations or cooperatives. We try to strengthen farmers to share and work together with other farmers when they buy and sell things, and when they are confronted with agricultural problems, such as sanitary issues. The issue of cooperatives was pushed in the 1980s and early 1990s, but there were apparently some bad experiences with the misuse of funds. Now, this idea is coming back, so we are trying to strengthen cooperative agricultural associations so that farmers have better selling, buying, and negotiating conditions and also so that they can find better solutions for addressing their problems and have more cost-effective, efficient, and productive agricultural practices.</p><div class="quote">“I think that we could really create a new industry and consciousness about the better use of food."</div><h4>Where are the major needs in order to provide new technology and better equipment in the meat, fish, and crop sub-sectors?</h4><p>We are on an island and the national consumption of fish is low, but it has to do with history, tradition, and also with storage problems. You have to eat fish fresh or you have to know how to treat it, and the transportation of fish was not easy in the olden days. These factors combined have led to the lower consumption of fish. I think that the major food item now is chicken, which has taken over from pork. Here, there is a National Commission called CODOPESCA and we are working with its members in a number of areas. Recently, we have been doing a study on Lago Enriquillo. The size of the lake is advancing and certain roads are already flooded; farmers have lost their land. We have observed that there are a lot of crabs now in Lago Enriquillo and we are trying to train some farmers in fishing practices in order to compensate for their loss of land. There are some other initiatives using the crab meat to sell and be bottled, so these are some of the initiatives to improve the use of seafood and fish in the country.</p><h4>What is next for the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Still, I would say 1.6 million-1.7 million Dominicans do not get adequate food daily, which is a shame for a country where there is a per capita GDP rate of $5,600-$5,800. Poverty has remained around 50% in rural areas and about 40% in urban areas and that has not changed over the last several years. Therefore, we try very much to strengthen the efforts of the government to reduce poverty wherever we can, but we also strengthen social initiatives in order for poor or vulnerable populations to have better access to food. There should be a continuation to reduce the current 15% to an acceptable figure; eradication of hunger is our vision. When we say there is no hunger, we mean less than 5% undernourished people in a given country. The aim is to work in order to have a situation where every Dominican has sufficient food. This is also in the new food security law, which includes the right to adequate food. When the law is passed, it will provide a legal instrument for Dominicans to claim for food. We also recently received a request from the Vice-President, Dr. Margarita Cedeño, to strengthen the approach to food banks. There are some small initiatives in the country already and FAO is managing major initiatives in Argentina and Colombia. We will try to address this issue here in order to strengthen the social aspects for the provision of food in schools, to the elderly, and to poor people who are covered by the Vice-President's program, Progresando con Solidaridad. Under it, 600,000-800,000 people are getting special cards that provide them with certain benefits. It could be a good starting point for this food bank. There is a huge private sector in the country, and I am certain that within supermarkets there are some problems when the expiry dates on food items gets closer. Maybe there could be an arrangement with some supermarkets that might be very interested in their food items still being used as intended so they do not have to destroy the food. Worldwide, more than 30% of the food produced at farm level is not reaching our mouths. But here, it is not only in the supermarkets, it goes down the drain to the small shops, the colmados. I think that we could really create a new industry and consciousness about the better use of food. I think it would create a kind of win-win situation with the private sector to establish a food bank, and that it would strengthen access to food for poor people.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The name Grupo Pegaso has long been associated with the communications sector. What led to the extensive and successful diversification of the business?</h4><p>My grandfather pioneered the communications industry in Mexico and he was a key player in the 20th century development of our country. His steps became my foundation, and thus I have always been inclined to pay more attention to the wireless industry. When you like what you do, you tend to do it better. In regard to our diversification, it has come about because my office receives an average of five diverse business proposals per month. Our exposure to other industries is very common.</p><h4>What sectors of the economy do you believe hold particular potential in terms of strengthening Mexico as a contender for the title of Latin America's largest economy?</h4><p>In 2012, Mexico's stock exchange was the second best performing stock market in the world, lagging only behind Germany's. In the next decade, we should become not only the largest economy in Latin America, but one of the most dynamic among emerging markets. Three industries are set to drive this development. Manufacturing presents tremendous opportunities. For years, China has always been the go-to place for manufacturing, and according to JP Morgan, Chinese workers earned half of what Mexican workers earned in 2002. Today, they earn just 12% less than their Mexican counterparts. There are a number of Chinese companies moving their operations to Mexico to save on costs. Companies in 41 different countries are also looking to set up multimillion and multibillion dollar manufacturing facilities in Mexico. If most of these interested parties decide to build facilities in Mexico, construction companies will experience tremendous growth, not only in terms of these new facilities, but also in the construction of infrastructure to support the manufacturing explosion. Energy is another area where there are many opportunities. According to the US Chamber of Commerce, Mexico is the world's most energy secure nation among 25 of the largest energy-consuming countries. Our Congress will pass a new energy reform bill that will inspire investments of billions of US dollars in Mexican energy companies, as the nation opens up the industry to private capital. We export 80% of our goods to the US, so it helps to be a neighbor of the largest economy in the world. In 2012, we earned $227 billion exporting goods to the US, and this will only get better since what it could take a month to receive from China, it only take a few hours from Mexico. With the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), there are no trade wars or tariffs to negotiate, and everything is set. These are a few reasons why the world is bullish about Mexico.</p><div class="quote">“We will continue focusing our investments in fields that are beneficial for the social and economic development of the country."</div><h4>What is Grupo Pegaso most interested in developing in its portfolio and what are your growth and expansion plans?</h4><p>We are taking a close look at the energy industry and, as always, the telecoms industry. As for growth, we are very bullish when it comes to the energy industry and more conservative in telecoms, but it is still early in the game to be specific.</p><h4>Where do you see the main opportunities for the private sector?</h4><p>US economist Jeffrey D. Sachs has expressed his views that in the US, there is a new progressive era in which the government will play a positive role in providing education, fighting climate change, rebuilding infrastructure, taking care of the poor and disabled, and generally investing in the future. Mexico needs all of its players to act in concert for the benefit of all Mexicans and in all areas of our economy, and all businesspeople should examine some projects from a purely financial perspective and others with more social benefits in mind. In regard to our future success, it depends on the ability of the government to implement a number of reforms, and also on its ability to be prepared for the implementation of the changes that need to happen.</p><h4>What would you say are the key challenges that need to be addressed to enable Mexico to optimize its potential as an economic hub, particularly from an economic perspective?</h4><p>We need to have judicial certainty in all aspects of business development, but especially in terms of fairness in market competition. The business community around the world, as well as local entrepreneurs, need to believe that they can invest in Mexico and compete on equal terms with local incumbents.</p><h4>What are Mexico's strengths as a host country for major sporting events?</h4><p>We have held all sorts of world-ranking sporting events in Mexico, such as two FIFA World Cups, and that experience helps. In addition, Mexico is a very hospitable country with a tourism industry that consistently ranks as a top income producer. I believe it is within our DNA to feel comfortable as a host nation. We do not compete with the US, simply because there are enough events for everyone on this planet. We have our own unique style that is not comparable to anything or anyone else.</p><h4>What can be done on the national level to address the current lack of high-profile tennis players in Mexico?</h4><p>In the early 1990s, Mexico had four tennis players among the top 100 in the world. However, today we do not have any. We need to encourage and support young talented Mexican players to reach the highest levels, because while our country does have a tennis culture, we lack high-profile players. I believe that the Mexican Tennis Federation should work to bring in more expertise in this field. For example, we could organize seminars and courses with the best tennis coaches in the world, as well as host high-level youth competitions in our country. In this context, we are closely working with the private sector to strengthen the game of tennis in our country. For that reason, we are looking at establishing business partnerships and securing funds for projects and infrastructure. We believe that as soon as Mexico has a high-profile tennis player, the sport will experience a boom.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>I have a positive outlook for this year. We will continue focusing our investments in fields that are beneficial for the social and economic development of the country. Agribusiness and Stevia production are two of our main investment activities. Also, we will expand our presence and infrastructure along the border region, as well as continue working to generate new content within the sports and communications industries.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pillars-of-policy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You define Tanzania's current foreign policy as “economic diplomacy." What does that mean, and how does it differ from Tanzania's traditional foreign policy?</h4><p>Our traditional foreign policy was centered on African unity, liberation, and the promotion of neighborliness, regional integration, non-alignment, and adherence to the UN Charter. It took a long time for countries in Southern Africa, such as Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, and South Africa, to get their independence. After Africa was fully liberated, we then began thinking about what to do next. We decided to direct our attention to economic development. We determined that one of our pillars of foreign policy would be economic diplomacy, which we defined as promoting investment, trade, and tourism. Moreover, we are encouraging investors in extractive industries, agriculture, and communications. We have encouraged our overseas embassies to look for investors who are interested in coming to Tanzania, while also providing Tanzanians with economic opportunities in other countries based on the information that our diplomatic missions gives the business communities through the Tanzanian Investment Center, chambers of commerce, and the media. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has succeeded in doing this. It has created a boost in tourism as well as greater investment into agriculture, the extractive industries, manufacturing, telecommunications, and trade. Over the last decade, we have seen fantastic development.</p><h4>How would you define Tanzania's regional leadership credentials and the importance of regional integration?</h4><p>We feel very powerful in the region because we are strategically located and took part in the liberation struggle. We are among the creators of the East African Community (EAC). We have reached the common market level in the region and now have free movement of labor, capital, goods and services, capital as well as common external tariffs. With regard to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, we have reached a free trade agreement (FTA) that allows the free movement of goods. This is a market of 500 million to 600 million people, and any commodity that Tanzania makes can find its market there. However, we believe we can do better. Tanzania is strategically located in the region in the sense that it has a deep natural harbor and is surrounded by seven landlocked countries. We have the Port of Dar es Salaam and two railway lines running from Dar es Salaam to Zambia and from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma. This is a dream coming true. Tanzania is both a member of the EAC and SADC, and we are comfortable in enjoying this dual status. We cannot abandon one region in favor of another; we believe we can serve both. We are doing our best in terms of promoting trade and investment.</p><div class="quote">“Over the last decade, we have seen fantastic development."</div><h4>One of your goals is to increase the number of Tanzanian embassies abroad. What impact will that have?</h4><p>It will have a huge impact. We now have 35 embassies, and our mission is to reach at least 50 by 2020. Four or five years ago, we had no tourists from Turkey and no business investment from Turkey to Tanzania. However, as soon as we opened our honorary consulates in both Ankara and Istanbul, and when flights began between the two countries, we saw business beginning to flow. When an embassy or an honorary consulate is opened, you can see an immediate impact as business people and tourists begin to flood in. We are now planning to open embassies in Turkey, South Korea, the Comoros, and the Netherlands.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what do you attribute your growth and success during 1Q2013?</h4><p>Net profit for the first quarter of 2013 recorded an impressive QAR395 million, as compared to QAR390 million for the same period in 2012, showing an increase of 1.4%. Loans and advances grew by 14.9% to reach QAR34.4 billion as of March 31, 2013 from QAR30 billion last year. Total assets increased by QAR4.5 billion—growth of more than 8.4%, from QAR52.8 billion on March 31, 2012 to QAR57.2 billion as of March 31, 2013. Customer deposits increased to QAR33.2 billion from QAR31.4 billion for the same period last year, registering growth of 5.9%, evidencing the strong liquidity of the bank. Despite a drop in our interest income by 1.4% in 1Q2013 when compared to 1Q2012, our net interest margin remains at 3.12% in 1Q2013 and is better when compared to our competitors. Our fees and commission income had increased by 12.7% in 1Q2013 when compared to same period in 2012. Our  earnings have also increased by 1.3% in 1Q2013 in the same timeframe. Our non-performing loan (NPL) ratio has come down from 3.41% in 1Q2012, to 2.81% in 1Q2013, on account of effective risk management. The bank has become extremely strong over the years with shareholders' funds as of March 31, 2013, at QAR8.5 billion, registering an increase of 28.8% during the last 12 months. Through the strategic utilization of the shareholders' funds by way of increasing our performance levels, the return on average equity (ROAE) is 21.2% as of March 31, 2013—one of the best in the industry. The bank, given the scale of operations, has achieved a very high return on average assets (ROAA) of 2.81% as of March 31, 2013, which is a clear demonstration of the effective utilization of shareholders' funds and optimum asset allocation strategies.</p><h4>What sets Doha Bank apart from other local and international banks in Qatar?</h4><p>We are one of the most innovative banks in Qatar. Doha Bank has launched Al-Dana 2013, which is the 10th anniversary of its Al-Dana savings program. Keeping within the theme, we will award QAR10 million in cash, 10 Mercedes E-300 luxury cars, and 10 vacation packages to the winners of its lucky draws during 2013. Doha Bank and Visa announced the completion of their latest promotion, awarding 30 cash prizes to 30 lucky winners who used their Doha Bank Visa debit cards outside Qatar in foreign currency transactions at points of sale and at ATMs. As part of its commitment to its customers, Doha Bank also allowed customers to utilize their Doha Bank Dream Loyalty Points to purchase their tickets at designated outlets where Doha Bank has exclusively installed point of sale terminals with loyalty acceptance. In another significant development, Doha Bank extended its arrangements with Indiabulls Group to offer non-resident Indians (NRIs) exclusive deals on homes. Doha Bank has again set a new Guinness World Record for having built the world's largest soccer ball, which is currently on display in the country. We also promote green banking as a means of sustainability.</p><div class="quote">“Lending is expected to pick up in the contract financing, government, and SME sectors."</div><h4>What led to the formation of TADBEER Corporate Cash Management Solutions and what is its strategic goal?</h4><p>TADBEER is an integrated cash management software platform addressing a full range of collections, payments, and liquidity management, as well as reporting services. Doha Bank's cash management solutions also include an innovative service called “SecureDoc," which is a door-to-door document and check collection service that will accept checks (including post-dated checks) for deposit into a client's account. Similarly, the Bank's “SecureCash" collection service helps large volume cash businesses, such as retail stores, with a door-to-door collection service for all cash deposits. These two collection services are available anywhere in Qatar. It is designed to help clients maximize the value of their banking relationship with Doha Bank without having to visit a branch or be constrained by time or geographic access. More importantly, it helps large and small corporations better manage their finances in real time, while benefitting from a slew of value-added services. This is one of the most critical benefits that will help such clients bridge the gap between operating locally and being able to function efficiently in a globalized market. The TADBEER product would be in line with the new global formula of brick-and-click banking. Currently launched in Doha, the strategic goal would be to enable clients to access Qatar from any part of the world, as it is a web-based interface.</p><h4>How do your operations here in Qatar benefit from the global outreach of Doha Bank?</h4><p>The representative offices in London, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Singapore, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, and Sydney are the largest network of its kind in any GCC bank. They support the growing trade finance business of the bank in all operative units, as they cover all the major trading partners of the GCC. They also support wholesale banking activities, with a focus on the large infrastructure projects in the GCC. They also enable us to participate in cross-border deals and syndications.</p><h4>How would you rate the popularity of Doha Bank's banking solutions for SMEs?</h4><p>We rate Doha Bank's SME banking solutions in the market leader category. It is our diversified product base, covering all aspects of a customer's requirements, that has earned us this position. We cater to each and every business need, whether it is local purchase requirements, import requirements, working capital financing, or CAPEX. Short-term procurement financing for local purchases is one of the attractive products for SMEs. Our fully fledged online banking platform for customers, as well as corporate credit card propositions, add value for SMEs. We have coverage of various business segments, including trading companies, contractors, manufacturing, and service-oriented sectors like schools, restaurants, boutiques, and clinics. In addition, we assist start-up companies primarily through our tie up with QDB. We finance eligible start-up companies through QDB's Al Dhameem scheme up to QAR15 million. When Doha Bank started servicing SME customers in 2008-2009, the SME clientele were not extremely financially savvy, nor experienced enough to even have proper accounting in place. At this stage, we had an advisory role to play; helping them to grow professionally and acting as partners in their growth. To facilitate the process, some of the initiatives that we undertook included having accounting firms to conduct sessions for our SME clients on how to prepare their budgets, partnering with CNAQ in having workshops arranged for our customers on strategic planning, providing the venue for the pioneering event of Qatar Exchange in its efforts to list SMEs on the stock exchange, just to name a few. We continue to expand our market share, and our SME customers value their relationship with the bank—irrespective of the large number of new players in the market and the tight competition. We consider our customers our greatest asset, and we value the relationship and the goodwill they maintain with us</p><h4>Is your customer base comprised of mainly corporate or retail clients?</h4><p>We have a mix of both corporate and retail clients. Normally, retail is large in number for banks, and this is the case of Doha Bank. In terms client numbers, approximately 10% would be from corporate and government clients and 90% would be from retail. However, as far as our loan book is concerned, 25%-30% of our loan book pertains to retail and 70%-75% pertains to corporate and government clients.</p><h4>How large are your operations here in Qatar in comparison with other markets?</h4><p>At the end of December 2012, operations in Qatar contributed 94% of total assets. Counterparties domiciled in Qatar comprise 78% of the group's total credit exposure and 62% of the group's total unfunded facilities. We have 32 branches in Qatar, three international branches, eight representative offices, and 23 electronic branches. Our representative offices are in China, Germany, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, Australia, and the UK. Being a Qatar-based bank, Qatar will continue to remain our largest market, even though we spread our business through our branches and representative offices.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Qatari banking sector in the short term?</h4><p>In April, the IMF revised the economic growth rate for Qatar to 5.2% in 2013. The non-hydrocarbon sector is expected to grow by 9.6% in 2013. By the end of 2013, service activity is expected to contribute more than 60% of the total growth in Qatar's economy. Construction activity is also expected to perform strongly this year. In 1Q2013, lending in the Qatari banking sector grew by almost 1.5% year to date. The retail and contract segments are the key sectors that have driven growth this year. Lending is expected to pick up in the contract financing, government, and SME sectors.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Human Factor]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-human-factor]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the overall goal and strategy of Abu Dhabi Health Services Company (SEHA)?</h4><p>It goes back to 2006 when the government of Abu Dhabi hired McKinsey &amp; Company to look at the health sector and how healthcare was provided, how financing was done, and the level of health coverage for the population. It was a massive study and one key recommendation was that the provision of healthcare, the funding of healthcare, and the regulation of healthcare should be separated into three autonomous organizations. The Health Authority of Abu Dhabi (HAAD) was formed to do the regulation, Daman was formed as the national health insurance company, and SEHA was formed as the provider of public health services. Our job was to own and operate all of the government's healthcare assets. We brought them all together under one organization and became operational in January 2008. We owned the assets, land, buildings, equipment, the vendor contracts, and all the employment agreements with employees.</p><h4>What are we talking about here in terms of the change?</h4><p>The objective was to instill the discipline of a private company, in terms of accountability, to stakeholders and the production of financial statements and budgets, through a legally private, albeit 100% government-owned, company. The most important objective was to then focus on improving the quality of care and the level of service to patients. It was perceived at the time that the quality of care and the level of patient services were below expectations. At that time, there was really no empirical data; it was all anecdotal because there were no systems in place to accumulate data, so we spent a good deal of our early years just trying to understand baselines. It took a long time to get all that in place because we started from very disparate, disorganized, and unsystematic systems that were in place at that time. If you contrast that to today, it is a world of difference.</p><div class="quote">“We have systems in place to monitor results, so we know if the actions we are taking are related to improving outcomes."</div><h4>Do you feel that there is an increasing trust in health services?</h4><p>I do feel that there is a rising level of confidence, but one of our biggest challenges is still to earn back the credibility that was lost in the early years prior to SEHA. You do not earn that back quickly, so that is something we are constantly trying to improve on. The issue of people going abroad is not an area of responsibility for SEHA; this falls under the purview of the HAAD, but if you break the data down, there are many reasons why people go abroad. One reason is we do not have certain services here because it would require very rare and specialized physicians. It is easy to build the building and buy the equipment, but getting the physician and the ancillary support staff to come here is sometimes an extreme challenge. Secondly, we might have the service, but we do not have confidence from our client base. We have an immense ability to improve our situation here and reduce the number of people that do go abroad for treatment. That is one of our main objectives to help the government in that regard.</p><h4>How do you bring international standards to the workforce and knowledge transfer to locals?</h4><p>We do a lot of different things. First of all, on the clinical side, it starts with the education system. We do not run medical or nursing schools, but you have to have special qualifications to come and work for us. Not enough Emiratis are pursuing medical careers, so we have started visiting high schools, for instance. We also work with the Tawteen Council and other Emirati organizations to convince students at the high school level to enter the health profession on the clinical side. The second thing we do is to provide post-academic training in our hospitals. Once nurses graduate, we bring them into structured, formal graduate nurse training to help them develop sub-specializations and finish off their education in a practical setting. We do the same thing for physicians by running residency programs. We recently received ACGMEI Accreditation for these residency programs, so now when our physicians finish the program, they have a better documented process of education to become specialist doctors. That then allows them, in their last year, to practice medicine of a higher caliber. Right now, less than 2% of our nurses are Emiratis, but almost 22% of our doctors are Emiratis because of these training programs. We have looked long term at where we will be in 2030 with our percentage of Emiratization in the area of doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals, but I do not think that we can ever achieve much greater than about 20%. There are only so many Emiratis, and only so many that are going to go into clinical work. Our longer-term goal is to reach somewhere in the 20% range on the clinical side of our business. On the administrative side, we have very structured programs for the senior leadership. We really focus on these individuals at the leadership level. We work with them on a mentoring basis, where we do a lot of on-the-job and structured training to increase their leadership skills. As a result, we have gone from about 33% Emiratis in the administrative group, to over 50%. We think that we can get to 75% Emirati administrative staff by 2030.</p><h4>Are there opportunities for more international partnerships?</h4><p>We are changing our model for partnering with international organizations. Initially, we started partnering at the hospital level. For example, when we took over Mafraq Hospital, we partnered it with a Thai company. We partnered Al Ain Hospital with an Austrian company, Sheikh Khalifa Medical City was partnered with the Cleveland Clinic, and we partnered Tawam Hospital, Corniche Hospital, and Al Rahba Hospital with Johns Hopkins. When SEHA was first formed, we did not really have a lot of management and system tools, so one of the reasons for these partnerships was to rapidly advance our ability to implement computer systems and accounting regimes. Now that is done, we are changing our model. Instead of partnering at the hospital level, we are asking these organizations to partner with us to treat a patient population of medical services. They will not be management contracts anymore; they are migrating to clinical affiliation agreements. We will work with Johns Hopkins, for example, to clinically support our women's health services across all of our hospitals and clinics. They will not manage our hospitals, but will help us clinically support managing a population of medical services. We have identified 15 of these clinical service lines and, of those, we will partner five or six with international organizations. We have a tender out now on pediatrics, and we have identified seven or eight top organizations in the world and have offered them the chance to respond to the tender. Over the next three or four years, we will be working with our existing partners to migrate from these hospital-specific to clinical, population-specific contracts. We are in discussions with Cleveland Clinic and Johns Hopkins to do that and we will bring in new partners.</p><h4>In the short term, what will we see in Abu Dhabi in terms of the standard of healthcare and the kind of facilities that are available?</h4><p>Addressing the facilities, first of all, as many of our hospitals are 30 or 40 years old. We are replacing them. We will be opening a new Mafraq Hospital in 2015, and we are going to replace the Al Ain Hospital. We are building and expanding hospitals in the Western Region. We will build a new Sheikh Khalifa Medical City over the next six years. A new Corniche Hospital will be developed and placed on the campus of the new Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. We have already done a lot in the outpatient setting, and we have done much for dialysis care. We have opened a new facility, the Mafraq Dialysis Center, and we are going to open one at Tawam and one at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. The facilities side is well planned and the road map is there for the next six years. That is the easy part, though; the tougher part is getting the right staff to really make a difference. For that, we have to boost the skills of our current workforce. When we replace people, we will bring in people with more skills, and also train internally. We need to get more physician consultants, upgrade the skills of our GPs, and obtain more nurses who are specially trained in areas such as neo-natal, pediatric, and surgical intensive care. We have a lot of work to do. We are understaffed today. The quality of the care is directly related to the number of nurse and physician hours per patient, and we are continually improving that. At the same time, in order to know if we are making a difference, we have to monitor clinical outcomes. We have systems in place to monitor results, so we know if the actions we are taking are related to improving outcomes. We can then see quality correlations as we deploy more tools.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At the center of this year's campaign, what issues are the most important for Azerbaijani voters?</h4><p>The most important subject for the voters is the democratic process of choosing their President. There are a number of issues driving the campaign, including economic policy, foreign affairs, and social development. But at the heart of it all is the right of voters to choose the current status quo and continue the current direction, or to vote for a change. If they choose to go ahead with the current trajectory, they are going to vote again for President Ilham Aliyev. If they choose change, they are presented with nine alternatives. However, according to independent surveys, 80% of the voters believe that President Ilham Aliyev's term should continue. This is the result of the President's success in putting Azerbaijan on the international map and instituting a social and economic policy that has resulted in dynamic and equitable growth for the nation and an increasingly prominent position in world affairs.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to improve the transparency of the electoral process in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>This year we have placed webcams in one out of every five polling stations around the country—of 5,000 polling stations, 1,000 of them have webcams. These devices will allow us to record the voting as well as the counting process, and verify the final results. The election process will be visible to everyone from all over the world who would like to watch. In addition, we have 40,000 official observers registered. Approximately 2,000 of them are from international organizations such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the European Council and Parliament, and election commissions from other countries, as well as international election centers like the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). The rest, approximately 38,000 observers, are people from other parties in the country, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from around the world, and embassies. Our people are also involved in this process. Our citizens will be voting in front of 30-40 observers at each polling station. The voting boxes are transparent as well. In other words, you can literally see the ballots. We also invited members of the local and international press to watch the process closely and announce the results in real time to the world. We have tried our best to create a transparent environment.</p><h4>How have demographic and economic changes in Azerbaijan since the last election cycle impacted the dynamics of the electorate?</h4><p>Azerbaijan has developed significantly since the last election—not only economically, but also culturally and socially. In addition, the geographic spread of Azerbaijan's growth is increasing, meaning that there is a real emphasis on improving the quality of life in accordance with economic growth throughout all regions of the country. Specific areas, such as ICT, are having a revolutionizing effect on Azerbaijan. Major advancements, government policies, and private sector progress have created an environment where people are using technology to educate themselves regarding the elections and the issues at stake. Thanks to the various mediums, including TV, computers, and smart phones, voters know the candidates and their policies. That means a more informed citizenry, one that is empowered to make the best decisions. They can also follow up everything during the actual election itself. This represents an important step in the development of voting and elections in Azerbaijan and elsewhere.</p><div class="quote">“We have tried our best to create a transparent environment."</div><h4>What role has political stability played in Azerbaijan's highly successful economic model?</h4><p>We can't talk about investment if there is no political stability. Local and international investors do extensive studies on this subject, since it represents probably the first condition they look at when analyzing the risk for their investments. In the last 10 years Azerbaijan's political stability has been settled. Additionally, the business environment has been liberalized. This has played a very significant role in allowing Azerbaijan to improve its rating economically and financially as well as to attract international investors in a variety of sectors. Including foreign investments, Azerbaijan has seen some $150 billion in investment over the last 10 years. The investments that have been achieved over the last five years amounted to between $20 billion and $25 billion on an annual basis. These investments were made by investors mainly from the US, Europe, and other countries. One of the major reasons for this is that our political stability is getting stronger every day. Political stability remains at the heart of Azerbaijan's development.</p><h4>According to independent polls, President Ilham Aliyev has an approval rating of over 80%. To what do you attribute this exceptionally high rate, and what have been President Aliyev's key accomplishments over the last term?</h4><p>During President Ilham Aliyev's term over the last 10 years, he has taken care of the people's needs and demands. He diagnosed what the country needed to develop, and he put together a visionary government plan. During this time, Azerbaijan's GDP has increased 3.5 fold. When he assumed the presidency national GDP was $1.5 billion-$2.5 billion—now it is $25 billion-$30 billion. Additionally, President Ilham Aliyev has formed very good diplomatic relationships with other world leaders. He did what his people needed, and that's why Azerbaijanis don't see any other alternatives. The other important subject is that he put together social reforms, covering social and cultural advancement, improved education and healthcare, as well as a stronger pension system and other forms of social security. Azerbaijan has turned into a leading country regionally and internationally. That's the reason why people vote for him.</p><h4>How would you define President Ilham Aliyev's current campaign platform, and what is his vision for a new term?</h4><p>Our motto is “Continuation," which means continuing the current term and the policies that have put Azerbaijan on its ongoing path of social and economic growth. We have already prepared a strategic plan for Azerbaijan. Our target for 2020 is to achieve “Developed Nation" status for Azerbaijan. Right now, Azerbaijan is a developing and middle-income country. Our GDP per capita is $6,000-$7000 and our target is to make this number $10,000 to $12,000 in the next seven years. We are currently on target for this goal, and that is why “Continuation" has resonated with so many voters across the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-prudent-dream]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company's market share grown since it was established in 2008?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi Finance (ADF) was launched with the aim of becoming the best provider of residential mortgages in the UAE. Whilst this vision does not necessarily mean we intended to become the biggest mortgage provider in the country, I am pleased to confirm that we quickly established ourselves as the mortgage provider of choice in Abu Dhabi, which was our preferred market of entry. There is no official data available to confirm the total mortgage market size in the UAE, but our market intelligence reports confirm that by 2011 we were providing more than a quarter of all conventionally financed mortgages in Abu Dhabi. This trend has continued through 2013, and we believe that our service standards and relentless focus on client service has helped us achieve these results. We were particularly proud of the industry recognition we achieved in 2013 when ADF was awarded “Best Home Finance Company in the Middle East" at the Banker Middle East Industry Awards 2013.</p><h4>How did ADF formulate its business strategy in the aftermath of the economic downturn?</h4><p>ADF launched just as the crisis was unfolding at the end of 2008. Our fundamental strategy of focusing on providing exceptional client service and becoming the best mortgage provider in the UAE did not change. ADF set out to be, and will remain, a prudent lender. Our credit policy has served us well throughout the downturn and our credit book has one of the lowest delinquency ratios in the industry. We have focused on technology and process enhancements to ensure we are able to provide flexible products to our clients at a reasonable cost. This has allowed us to consistently improve our turnaround times and mortgage processing speed at the same time as reducing administration and staffing costs. I was particularly proud when ADF was awarded the “Best Use of Technology" for our Oracle system implementation at the Banker Middle East Industry Awards in 2011, as this reflected two of our core values: '"One Team. One Goal" and “Continuous Improvement." In addition to the above responses, we delayed our planned launch into the Dubai mortgage market during the downturn, but we are now actively providing residential and commercial mortgages in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi.</p><div class="quote">“The main challenge is the ability of mortgage providers to match their lending with their own borrowing requirements."</div><h4>What effect are European sovereign debt and the slow US recovery having on ADF's operations?</h4><p>Everyone knows that the real estate market is a cyclical market that is exposed to all forms of global economic crisis. The recent challenging economic conditions adversely impact all players in the sector, including the government, developers, and finance providers, as well as prospective investors and home purchasers. The debt crisis has made it harder to access long-term liquidity, which is something that will be critical to the development of a long-term, sustainable mortgage market in the UAE. Recently, however, we have seen an improving liquidity situation and economic outlook. Consumers are more confident and, in fact, August 2013 was one of our busiest months since launching in 2008. We have a funding line in place with First Gulf Bank, and with ongoing shareholder support are well positioned to continue providing residential and commercial mortgages across the emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p><h4>The UAE is still experiencing growth despite the stagnant Western markets. What trends are you noticing in the demand for your products and services?</h4><p>We are seeing several trends, including: a renewal of interest from non-resident real estate investors; an upturn in applications from business owners looking to invest in a home for their business with the help of our Tijarati commercial mortgage product; and a shift in the balance from mortgages being used for investment purposes to mortgages for end users. In addition, as the financial services market matures in the UAE, client expectations of service levels are increasing. At ADF, we pride ourselves on our passion for clients, and so we welcome improvements in service standards across the board. We ensure we do our best to exceed client expectations through enhancements to our product range, our mortgage process, and our training programs for staff. We were very pleased to receive the “President's Award for Customer Experience Management" at the 2012 UAE Customer Service Week Star Awards.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the competiveness of the sector?</h4><p>ADF operates in a very competitive sector, with low interest rates and many mortgage offerings available on the market. Clients are prepared to spend more time shopping around for the best mortgage offering available to them. A number of competitors tend to dip in and out of the mortgage market as they have a portfolio of products to focus on. As ADF is a mortgage specialist, we aim to offer a consistently superior product and service range. As we are currently seeing an upturn in the real estate sector across the UAE, a number of new entrants are joining the mortgage market. Competition across service and price is great news for home purchasers. We are seeing a number of aggressive products in terms of loan-to-value (LTV), which is of some concern to me. There is a danger that a real estate bubble can be created through the easy availability of mortgages, where little or no deposit is needed from the client. This can encourage flippers or speculators to take on mortgages in the hope they can sell the property quickly, clear the mortgage, and make a profit without risking their own capital. ADF prides itself on being a responsible lender and, whilst we will always try and help a client buy the property of their dreams, we also encourage them to be prudent in relation to the amount they can afford to borrow.</p><h4>What can be done to ensure the Dubai real estate crisis in 2008-09 is not repeated in Abu Dhabi and the UAE?</h4><p>The real estate sector is cyclical and there is always the risk that unexpected or unavoidable external events can trigger a real estate crisis. However, there are a number of areas in which the government, regulators, developers, and finance providers can help. There have been a number of positive developments at the government and Central Bank level in the past few years. For example, recently enacted laws concerning cancelled projects in Dubai enhance the ability of borrowers to recoup investments from failed projects. Government level control over developments and developers can help to ensure an appropriate balance of supply and demand.  Well-targeted fees and charges at the municipality and developer level can deter speculators from entering the market and be used to stimulate long-term investors in the real estate sector. Regulators can help to ensure that the hot money that flows into the country is controlled, and that banks are lending in a prudent and sensible manner. Increased capital charges for high-risk mortgage lending is one way in which this could be done. Finally, the availability of long-term funding, through securitization vehicles, is also important to allow lenders to match fund the mortgages they are providing. Currently, there is little activity in this area, which makes it challenging for mortgage providers to ensure a steady flow of mortgage loans into the market place.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges facing the real estate finance market?</h4><p>The main challenge is the ability of mortgage providers to match their lending with their own borrowing requirements. Whilst there will always be an element of liquidity mismatch, this challenge is particularly severe in the UAE. There is little international appetite for securitization vehicles backed by UAE property due to the lack of fully developed laws and regulations. There have been few, if any, successful residential-backed mortgage securitizations in the UAE in the last few years, and this is the major challenge. Re-possessing property, which unfortunately is part and parcel of the mortgage lending business, is also time consuming and expensive. A smoother re-possession process that reduces costly court procedures is required, and ensures customers are treated fairly. This would enhance the affordability and availability of mortgage finance in the UAE.</p><h4>Earlier in 2013 the company launched Tijarati, its commercial mortgage product. How has this been received?</h4><p>The launch has gone well. We are seeing plenty of interest, particularly from the SME sector, across Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We are on track to meet our commercial loan book target for the year and intend to expand the product further in 2014. Clients have been excited by the product offering, and particularly by the availability of longer-tenor mortgages, which have not previously been available for commercial mortgages.</p><h4>What plans does the company have to launch new products in the near future?</h4><p>We are working on enhancing the flexibility of our current mortgage product, which will ensure the ADF mortgage offering continues to be the most flexible in the marketplace.</p><h4>What will ADF look to focus on over the next five years?</h4><p>ADF has three areas of continued focus, including: providing the best range of residential and commercial mortgage products to support the real estate sector across the UAE; continuing to provide the highest levels of transparency and client service in the market; and ensuring we continue to develop our staff and add value to the communities in which we operate.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the success indicators seen in local healthcare provision of late, and what innovations can we expect to see in the medium term?</h4><p>Over the past two years, significant progress has been made, with over 11% of outputs completed. The outcomes of the National Health Strategy (NHS) will, more often than not, be realized after the outputs have been achieved. In order to measure the NHS, a robust monitoring and evaluation framework is being established to ensure all outputs are measured and reported appropriately. In addition, the NHS has grown over the past two years, and with this growth comes more detailed planning, as well as a 27% increase in outputs. The NHS is building evolving foundations over time for a long-term sustainable change in the health sector. Some of the other indicators of success we have achieved so far are better governance, a comprehensive primary care strategy, the first phase of a social health insurance, the establishment of the Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners, a laboratory integration and standardization strategy, some key legislation developed to support the work of the NHS, and increased collaboration on projects to improve the health system of Qatar. Over the coming two to three years, the NHS is due to complete a number of projects. Some of the successes that the public will soon see are the launching of an appointment system to make a more efficient use of time, the opening of 18 new health centers, an increase in the number of rehabilitation beds available across Qatar, and the opening of a new physical medicine and rehabilitation hospital with 200 beds in 2015. Also, we are going to be publishing a national mental health strategy to promote good mental health and wellbeing, to prevent mental illnesses, and to develop tailored, quality services that can be accessed when mental health issues occur. Similarly, a community pharmacies strategy will improve patient access to pharmaceuticals at a wide range of convenient locations.</p><h4>How will the new approach to healthcare in Qatar look to address lifestyle issues?</h4><p>The establishment of clinical guidelines for Qatar based on international best practices is also something people can expect to see, as we move from a curative approach on healthcare to a preventative one. In that regard, a national action plan for tobacco will focus on tobacco cessation and enhance the enforcement of the new tobacco law when it is decreed. Similarly, we are developing national dietary guidelines to encourage people to eat a healthy diet that focuses on foods and beverages that help achieve and maintain a healthy weight, promote health, and prevent disease. We are also planning the development of robust occupational health and safety guidelines to mitigate occupational health diseases and accidents across all workplaces and a food safety authority that will provide consumers with the reassurance that they are receiving safe and high-quality imported and locally produced food. For parents, there will be a breastfeeding and complimentary feeding education program to support new families. Finally, Qataris can also expect to see more effective patient advocacy services as well as the establishment of e-health services.</p><div class="quote">“Changing human knowledge, attitudes, and practices is our target."</div><h4>What efforts are being made in order to increase the propagation of e-health in Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar has an immense vision for developing and embedding e-health into the fabric of its healthcare system. It has committed considerable resources through the NHS to establish a health data management program (NHS Project 2.3). The country has already made great strides in e-health and health information management. The three main government providers of healthcare, PHCC, HMC, and Sidra, have all started implementing Cerner Millennium, a sophisticated electronic medical record and clinical information system that will improve patient care. This, combined with the national strategies and infrastructure that the SCH will be leading, will deliver a high-tech, e-health system that supports the functions highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO). For example, later in 2013, the SCH will begin developing a long-term national vision, national strategies, and action plans for improving health data and data management, as well as e-health in Qatar across all providers. Through NHS projects 2.3 and 2.4, a number of initiatives and outputs will show Qatar leading the way in e-health in the Middle East. These include a centralized data warehouse for all healthcare data, electronic health records, an innovative health information exchange to facilitate sharing health records between providers, data governance, security and confidentiality policies, national data standards that standardize data across the country, and a range of other enabling technologies and structures.</p><h4>How is the SCH's Department of Research helping the country become a center of research excellence?</h4><p>In alignment with the Qatar National Vision 2030, this department aims at high-quality research directed at improving the effectiveness and quality of health care. Qatar has embarked on an ambitious research program to allocate 2.8% of its GDP for research. Research activities, however, need to be carried out with the highest scientific practices and be performed in accordance with national and international laws. The SCH plays a central role in setting forth the research governance framework within the health R&amp;D ecosystem in Qatar. This framework aims at the coordination of research activities, the allocation of funds, and the development of a stakeholder exchange mechanism across the spectrum of biomedical research, clinical research, public health research, and public policy. While clinical effectiveness research is an essential tool for the successful promotion of health and effective health services, it can also involve an element of risk for the safety and wellbeing of participants. Therefore, in order to eliminate this risk, the Research Department has developed a systematic model that is aimed at governing the ethical conduct of research in Qatar. The Department has developed a number of policies and regulations for conducting research on human subjects, the use of stem cells and gene transfer in humans, and clinical effectiveness research. These ethics regulations have been recently promulgated into a legislative decree. In order to ensure that research activities are ethically responsible and scientifically sound, the Department has developed a system for the registration of reliable institutional review boards, committees, and the like to comply with national regulations. The Department is striving to embed the rules of research ethics within the research community in Qatar via continuous training and guidance, and an international publication, BMC Medical Ethics 2012, has recently placed Qatar on top of the list in research ethics and regulation in the Middle East.</p><h4>How is the Ministry helping to increase awareness of family planning and the prevention of endemic diseases?</h4><p>First, in Qatar, I confirm there are no endemic communicable diseases, as we don't have any recognized hosts that can spread communicable diseases. In addition, we have one of the lowest incidence rates of HIV and malaria, and we are working to strengthen tuberculosis control. In terms of endemic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), we do have a high prevalence of diabetes (17%), high blood pressure (32.9% for adults between 18 and 64), and other risk factors, such as obesity (more than 40%) and smoking (16.4% for both sexes). As more than 60% of deaths are due to NCDs, SCH is working on different awareness programs targeting nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles, and smoking cessation. SCH has also established NCD clinics in each primary healthcare center and launched a diabetes center in Hamad General Hospital in July 2013, with a plan to roll out such models across the country in the subsequent months. Changing human knowledge, attitudes, and practices is our target and we have started to move toward it, but it will certainly take some time before we can achieve the results we desire.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012, the EU approved a multilateral trade agreement with Colombia and Peru in order to promote trade between the two nations and the EU. How is this cooperation reinforcing commercial relations in each country?</h4><p>There is a long tradition in Peru and Colombia in working together on integration projects, such as the Andean Community, which was established in 1969, and the Pacific Alliance, which came about in 2011. The agreement that we both have signed with the EU equally benefits our countries, as well as creates new opportunities for us to pursue in the future with optimism. Besides the multiple benefits of every trade agreement, this one strengthens cooperation between Colombia and Peru by promoting similar trade and investment policies. This homogenization includes also social issues, for example, democratic clauses, and the commitment to defend the human rights of citizens. This agreement is complemented with the purposes of the Pacific Alliance and the efforts of borderland improvements between our countries.</p><h4>In June 2013, Peru and Colombia signed the Plan de Desarrollo de la Zona de Integración Fronteriza. Why is border integration important for both nations, and how is this plan impacting populations settled in the border regions?</h4><p>Peru's border integration area comprises more than 2 million square kilometers and five neighboring countries. Colombia and Peru share around 277,000 square kilometers of border integration area, with more than 600,000 persons in poverty and extreme poverty living in that area. It is a particularly vulnerable borderland, not only because of its difficult accessibility and population dispersion, but also because it encompasses an important area of the Amazon rainforest, which involves the need for sustainable development programs and projects. The signing of the Plan de Desarrollo de la Zona de Integración Fronteriza is a sample of both countries intention to have a tool to guide common initiatives to seize the opportunities of border integration. We are looking forward to an intense work agenda in order to achieve positive results in the coming years. In this regard, I would like to highlight the recent creation of our National Commission on Border Development, which certainly will allow us to facilitate our common agenda. The challenge for Colombia and Peru is to integrate effectively our countries in those border areas, where it has always been more difficult for our states to arrive and provide adequate services to our populations.</p><div class="quote">“Bilateral meetings, as well as signed agreements and integration mechanisms, serve indeed as instruments to strengthen our relations."</div><h4>What are the advantages of the Pacific Alliance to Colombia and Peru?</h4><p>Peru and Colombia, together with Mexico and Chile, are part of the Pacific Alliance, which aims to promote economic, political, as well as social union within the four countries. The Pacific Alliance is, indeed, one of the most successful integration mechanisms in the region. It is also an effective platform for different cooperative projects beyond trade and investment. As I mentioned before, Peru and Colombia share an important Amazon rainforest area. Thus, every single intention of economic growth projects in the borderland between our countries must be linked to sustainable development concepts. There is no doubt that environmental issues and sustainable development projects will also be an important part of the Pacific Alliance commitment to the world. In 2010, Mexico held the UN Climate Change Conference and, in 2014, Peru will be the host. This is certainly a great chance for us to highlight the relevance of sustainable development concepts in economic growth and development projects. I am convinced that for all the Pacific Alliance members to achieve economic growth, social inclusion, and the development of our people inevitably involves strong sustainable development policies.</p><h4>In 2011, President Humala and President Santos met in order to discuss the common ground and strong bonds between Peru and Colombia. What is your opinion on future bilateral relations between the two nations?</h4><p>Peru and Colombia have not only similar opportunities towards development, but also akin threats and obstacles to overcome. Bilateral meetings, as well as signed agreements and integration mechanisms, serve indeed as instruments to strengthen our relations. I firmly believe our future with Colombia is positive and full of promise. During the past few years, we have been working strongly in different areas, such as border region development and our active participation in the Pacific Alliance, which will allow both countries to provide the world with plenty of investment and trade opportunities, and to attract international cooperation in order to continue making efforts toward social inclusion and sustainable development projects. In my opinion, we can talk about firm joint development policies if we try to project bilateral relations between Colombia and Peru. Both nations look at the future in very similar ways, and we are sure this view can only grow stronger.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your overview of the first three years of Vodafone's activities in Qatar and how it managed to break the monopoly of QTel (Ooredoo)?</h4><p>Telecommunications was one of a number of sectors where the Qatari leadership decided to liberalize and create more competition. What we have noticed in Qatar is a concerted effort to create an industry, where you have the move from a monopoly to a competitive environment. There was a license auction, and Vodafone in partnership with the Qatar Foundation won that license and set up operations in 2009. We are government regulated by ictQatar, under the leadership of Dr. Hessa Sultan al-Jaber. We are really pleased with the way they have gone about creating genuine competition and an environment where operators can really thrive and be successful, while at the same time giving customers a different level of service because of that competition. We currently have 30% of the mobile revenue in the market, which by any industry benchmark is a good performance. Our progress is driven by the environment we are operating in, and it is a well-structured industry. It is also driven by the fact that the population and the overall economy of Qatar are growing considerably, and as a mass market consumer business everybody has a mobile; therefore, we grow with the population.</p><h4>What makes Vodafone stand out here in Qatar?</h4><p>We are a very well-known global brand and much of the population of Qatar originates from countries where Vodafone is already very established, and so that gives us a nice starting point. We have been able to come through with a way of serving customers and providing value for money that are significantly different to what customers have experienced here in the past. Because we are part of the Vodafone Group, we are able to offer international products, international calling, and roaming services at a lower cost base, and therefore at a lower cost to the customer than our competitors. Many of our customers are expatriates spending their disposable income calling home, so a low cost is important. We have been improving our network quality, adding international coverage and a high-speed data network, and we have been able to attract higher value customers with our post-paid service, which was launched in 2012. We are now moving into profitability as well, and we are pleased with that. It shows that we have a growing business, but also have a well-structured cost base and profit margin.</p><div class="quote">“Currently, the telecoms market is worth around about QAR8 billion."</div><h4>What are your plans to ensure this continued growth?</h4><p>The good news is that we are very optimistic about the next phase in Qatar. As a country, clearly the population growth as far as we can see will continue, and soon we will pass the 2 million mark; this market is just going to continue to grow. Currently, the telecoms market is worth around about QAR8 billion. The overall sector is going to continue to grow, and the second thing is that because of the competition in the sector, there is no incentive or reason to bring in addition players, in either licenses in mobile or fixed. What we think will happen—as long as it stays like this—is that you have a very fast growing market with a duopoly, where the operators are doing well, and therefore are able to invest in quality and infrastructure, and the customers are happy because they are seeing improvements and declining prices. Furthermore, we are now just launching Vodafone for business to provide services to SMEs, multinationals, and the government. We really do not have any market share in that segment to date, but we will. We are just entering that segment, and very quickly that will be our next phase of growth. Of course, it is where a lot of the engine of growth in the Qatari economy is as well, and so every company that is coming in will consider Vodafone as their service provider. At the same time, we are moving to fixed services, and that is a really important part of our overall story. Vodafone was issued with the second fixed license in 2010, and in the intervening period we have really been building infrastructure to be ready to provide fixed-line services, which is still a monopoly environment. We partner with an organization called Qatar National Broadband Network (QNBN). This is the growth story for us. We will always be best value for money; it is written in the way we operate. At the same time, the customer service that we offer is very different to anything that has existed in Qatar before. We are bringing modern ways of serving customers to take the Qatari service environment forward to one that is friendly and flexible. I do not think that is the norm in Qatar yet, but we are hoping to try and be the role model for that and to drag the whole service industry up to a higher standard. So far, we have been successful and we are being recognized as the customer service leader in Qatar.</p><h4>Moving forward, how would you evaluate Vodafone's participation in the diversification of Qatar away from oil and gas?</h4><p>One of the clear pillars of the Qatar National Vision is to be able to provide world-class infrastructure, and telecommunications is clearly a fundamental part of the overall infrastructure of the country. Therefore, not only do we want to contribute to the diversification of Qatar and the delivery of the National Vision, we also have an obligation to do that and we will really have to provide the highest-quality infrastructure that is connected to the whole world. There is no reason why Qatar should not have the best telecommunications infrastructure in the world, bar none. Vodafone Qatar is keen to be a role model within the Vodafone Group to deliver a standard that has not been achieved anywhere else in the world. We think we can achieve that and at the same time, support the overall national vision. It is just about world-class quality and connecting Qatar to the world. Qatarization is also an important issue for us; 18% of our staff are Qatari and that is going up by one percentage point per quarter. We are trying to have a genuinely diverse workforce with a significant proportion that is Qatari, with the aim of transferring our knowledge to the Qataris.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the telecommunications sector here in the short term?</h4><p>We are very optimistic about the prospects for Qatar; we do not see any significant clouds on the horizon. We see a very strong economy that has an excellent incentive with the World Cup to move quickly and to get the overall infrastructure of the country moving fast, and that is going to bring people to the country. We see it continuing to grow at a relatively stable rate, yet in a competitive two-player market, with the establishment of a fiber-optic, fixed-line environment that really drives capability and business, and at the moment that does not exist. It is mostly slow copper-based internet stuff, and it can be very frustrating. We are very optimistic, and we see it continuing to grow.</p><h4>What is your medium-term vision for Vodafone in Qatar?</h4><p>Our vision is to be the most admired brand in Qatar, in a market where the Q-companies (state-owned entities) tend to have a virtual monopoly. We really want to be the first multinational, mass-market brand to achieve huge levels of admiration from the whole country, particularly from the Qatari population. We set out in the way we operate to be respected and admired, meaning that we think in a way that appreciates the Qatari culture and traditions and focuses on supporting their national goals.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision for the future of Ecuador's external economy?</h4><p>The trade agreement with the EU will be one of the most significant issues of my term as Minister of Foreign Trade, and international negotiations are a must. The EU is one of our main markets for non-oil exports, and based on the President's instructions, we're working toward restarting negotiations with the EU. We went on a trip to Brussels in July 2013 to meet with members of the European Commission and the European External Action Service to discuss the desire that Ecuador has to restart negotiations as soon as possible, as well as the political and technical necessities. I'm very optimistic and confident that we can successfully finalize these negotiations and reach an agreement by the first trimester of 2014.<br></p><div class="quote">“One possibility we're working on for the future is a free trade zone in goods with other countries in the Pacific Alliance."</div><h4>What will be the economic impact of your efforts to geographically diversify trade?</h4><p>We're going to continue our efforts to diversify the destinations of our exports. We'll concentrate on the areas where we've been working until now, like Latin America, especially the parts of the continent where we've yet to realize our full potential, such as Central America and the Caribbean, as well as countries in Mercosur and Mexico. The Andean Community and Chile are our traditional markets, and we're already strong there. The aim now is to branch out into parts of Latin America where we have little presence in terms of exporting Ecuadorean goods. Another country we want to work with more in the Americas is Canada. Outside of the Americas, we're going to accelerate our diversification in Europe, concentrating especially on those member states of the EU where we're not very strong at the moment, mainly the Central and Eastern European countries ­­­—such as Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Austria, as well as the Scandinavian and Baltic countries. Outside of the EU, we're going to work with countries in the CIS region, including Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and others—countries that have enormous potential, are growing rapidly, and buying Ecuadorean goods. We also want to work with Turkey and expand Ecuadorean goods through Turkey to the region surrounding it. Finally, we'd also like to expand in Northeast Asia, Japan, South Korea, and China in particular. Those are the main markets where we seek to diversify exports.</p><h4>How important is membership in the Pacific Alliance for Ecuador, and how important is South-South cooperation for your country?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance is a very interesting initiative in which the main objective from the trade and commerce point of view is to strengthen relations between countries that are part of the alliance, looking to work together to expand their capacities to export goods and services to the other side of the Pacific, Asia, and Oceania. Ecuador is naturally very interested in following the process and seeing how we can get involved based on our vision of international trade and showing our interest in the process. That's why Ecuador first chose to enter the Pacific Alliance as an observer. We were accepted in that status at the last meeting in Cali, Colombia. Now that we're a part of the process, we'll analyze the possibility to continue, advance, and participate directly in some areas. We could begin by participating in export promotion activities and strategies. This would involve joint promotion of our member states' goods in areas of the world where we don't have so much experience, or where the overall supply we offer as a group is more important than our individual capacities, so we can all work together to be able to satisfy that demand. We have to look into the future and see the possibilities of stronger integration. One possibility we're working to have in the future is a free trade zone (FTZ) in goods with other countries in the Pacific Alliance. The only member of the Pacific Alliance with whom we need to strengthen relations at the moment is Mexico.</p><h4>Ecuadorean exports to Andean countries increased 11% in 2012. What role do you envision Ecuador playing in Latin America?</h4><p>I believe Ecuador will play a leadership role in the region. The country has been very successful both from a political and economic point of view. We have a stable economy that is expected to continue growing, especially as we develop. We should be able to grow 5%-6%, or maybe even 7% in the next few years. That will help us reduce the gap between developed countries and Ecuador, and will give us more regional influence. On the other hand, we're at the middle point between countries such as Cuba and Venezuela, which have very specific political systems and an important state role in planning the economy, and countries such as Chile and Colombia, which are very free-trade and free-market oriented. This gives us the chance to enable the two systems to coexist in the region, acting as a kind of pivot. Hopefully, Ecuador will have a role in strengthening the new institutional structures that exist in the region, such as UNASUR for South America, and CELAC in the Latin America and Caribbean region. We should be able to influence those institutions for the sake and interests of the Latin American and Caribbean regions.</p><h4>What are your main priorities during your term, besides the trade agreement with the EU?</h4><p>Our priority is to change the economic and productive matrix of the country. To influence and help this process is the main objective of the ministry. We want to change the matrix to one that is based on higher value-added goods, where the main factor of production is talent and knowledge. For that, we need economies of scale and large markets. It's not possible for us to build that kind of project as Ecuador alone—we need to find adequate international partners in order to achieve this goal. At the Ministry we have to be the ones to help those new industries to open up to the markets and we keep track of what the tendencies are in the market for the goods and services that consumers demand. Besides, we are aiming to diversify Ecuador's international market for goods and services. Our trade depends mainly on the Andean Community, the EU, and the US. We want to expand into new markets, and this lessens our exposure to risk, which is otherwise significant if we are dependent on just one or two markets. There's still instability in the international arena, and we've yet to completely overcome the latest financial crisis of 2009-2010. We also want to introduce new actors to the international marketplace. We want more democracy in our international trade sector. Right now, international trade is concentrated in a few hands in Ecuador, and we want to introduce more actors—especially SMEs and even micro enterprises.</p><h4>What is your mid-term outlook for the Ecuadorean economy?</h4><p>We have the economic resources to continue to grow. Our GDP will continue to increase, and there will be greater welfare in Ecuadorean society. We'll have a stable economy with a better introduction to international markets and more investment coming into the country, with Ecuador coming back to the international capital markets and being able to attain better financial access. The country is planning for fantastic infrastructure and a more skilled labor force with high levels of education and training. There will be political and economical stability, with sustained economic growth. We'll continue to focus and develop South-South relations, considering the most growth in the 21st century will not be seen in the developed world but the developing world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Latin America. Overall, the country will change for the benefit of the majority of our country, and Ecuador will be well placed between two future economic powerhouses: Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-next-leap]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does technology influence monetary policy in Tanzania?</h4><p>There are two media channels through which technology has a large influence on monetary policy. One is the payment system. There, we are seeing the introduction of the mobile payment system as a platform for delivering a variety of services. That already has made a huge impact. The platform is widely available and the number of mobile money accounts that have been opened and registered amount to almost 28 million; those in active use (defined as once every 90 days according to a survey we undertook) number about 8.5 million. This comes from almost zero in 2008-2009. That is a very rapid rise. The reach is extremely wide, which means financial services are available for everyone everywhere. This has also reduced the cost of delivering financial services. Using physical branches to reach everyone is simply too expensive. That is why we only have about 550 branches and 2,500 ATMs. If we went exclusively through that route, there is no way we would have been able to reach the majority of the country. Now, we are seriously working on increasing the range of products that can be used through this platform. The first is money transfer, which has made a huge change in the way people interact in terms of transactions. It has also made a huge change in terms of meeting social obligations. Currently, for example, you can participate in a funeral from wherever you are by making a contribution over the phone. Funeral contributions are very important in Tanzanian society. It is also being used to pay bills and taxes. Additionally, banks have elected to use mobile payment agents to provide banking services, which means they can now expand the reach of their services. This has enabled us to leapfrog ahead in terms of reaching the majority of Tanzanians with financial services. Given the poor infrastructure that we have, it has bridged distances. Of course, the big challenge now is to ensure that the system is secure. If we can't ensure security, mobile money services might disappear. Fortunately, the tests that have been carried out internationally on mobile payment systems have proven very robust and resilient. As the Central Bank, we have the attitude of letting innovation take its course without being overcautious. However, that doesn't mean we can lower our guard on this. IT is another important direction, as it can do incredible things in terms of enhancing productivity and improving logistics. We often discuss the infrastructure bottleneck in Tanzania and investing in hardware; however, if we don't invest enough on the logistics side we can't get the increased output to the destinations we require. The majority of logistics depends on IT. It is time to seriously talk about the importance of technology in improving our logistics capacity. We have invested in more than 10,000 kilometers of fiber-optic network, covering the whole country, which also connects to undersea cables. We have also connected our neighbors to these cables using the fiber-optic network. Now is the time to see how services can be offered using this particular investment. We need to define how IT and data firms can invest in providing services to Tanzania and make the country a gateway for data services in the region. There is no doubt that we have made huge progress in terms of the internet, enabling us to access financial services. We used to have people bring their bidding forms to the Central Bank in person; now, it is all done online. Given the ubiquity of access to high-speed, low-cost internet, I believe we should be able to automate a wider range of financial services and make them more efficient and cost effective.</p><h4>What can regional central banks learn from each other?</h4><p>Central banks have tended to be the pioneers in the expansion of technology for financial inclusion. Most of the members of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) are central banks. We have a chapter that deals only with mobile money among African central banks. This is one area where Africa is a pioneer, so we have a lot to learn from each other. Unfortunately, not everyone has moved as quickly as Kenya or Tanzania, but this provides us with an opportunity to engage in a dialogue about what it takes to be successful and sustainable.</p><div class="quote">“Central banks have tended to be the pioneers in the expansion of technology for financial inclusion."</div><h4>How does technology influence the gathering of economic information?</h4><p>First, it has significantly simplified data collection, storage, and analysis. There are surveys that we can now do simply via mobile phone, which is quicker, easier, and cheaper than ever before. These are the best set of attributes for good research. Second, interacting with the frontier of knowledge is important. The frontier of knowledge is available through the internet, the data systems of highly reputable institutions, and video conferencing. Now, we can engage with leading economists without calling a conference and bringing them all here in person.</p><h4>How will the implementation of technology in Tanzania's banking sector help it to achieve its Vision 2025 goal of becoming a middle-income country?</h4><p>IT is a powerful tool for productivity growth. In order to achieve the goals for 2025, we have to raise our growth rate. Our current growth rate of 7% is not enough. We have done the arithmetic and we need to grow by between 8% and 10%. Technology will help us to improve that productivity. Logistics and organization are important parts of gaining efficiency. Technology is also helping even SMEs get better market data, information on crop husbandry, and extension services—it provides remote access to expert information. The most significant aspect is the productivity-enhancing and growth-enhancing features of technology. Another part is simply giving us the ability to learn from others much more effectively and quickly in terms of access to information about best practices. Technology allows us to access non-resident expertise, including on the medical side. It is no longer necessary to fly in a consultant or a surgeon to treat the patient. I also believe that technology will allow our diaspora to return virtually rather than physically to play a role in our economy. Top professors teaching elsewhere in the world can offer courses here and guide research from a distance, even when they can't find time to come back physically. It is truly a platform for quantum change in the way we do business.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a part of Vision 2030, Abu Dhabi is moving to diversify its economy away from oil and gas. What is the potential for clean energy in the UAE, and how is the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) supporting its growth?</h4><p>ADNOC works with other Abu Dhabi-based companies and institutions on cleaner conventional forms of energy, including alternative and renewable energy. Our cooperation with the Environment Agency—Abu Dhabi (EAD) and the Abu Dhabi Company for Future Energy (Masdar) are two of many such examples. Also, since 1995, ADNOC has taken significant steps toward gas flaring reduction, which has now reached 75%. ADNOC has set a target of reaching zero flaring. Due to our strong belief in the potential of gas as a cleaner source of energy, ADNOC has embarked on various projects and developments that meet such expectations. In the 2013 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition &amp; Conference (ADIPEC 2013), of which ADNOC has been the main supporter and sponsor along with the UAE's Ministry of Energy for years, will give more attention to gas in terms of discussions, participating companies, and papers presented by participants in a move to shed more light on forms of cleaner energy, including gas, which complement the overall direction of the UAE's government in utilizing all forms and sources of clean energy. All such joint efforts and work are part of the government's overall plans in regard to sustainable development and the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 and UAE Vision 2021, in which adding a greater variety of energy resources would bring more diversification to the UAE economy, which ADNOC takes major pride in being a part of.</p><h4>What opportunities are you seeing from the UAE's proximity to Asian markets?</h4><p>Asian markets have a major significance for ADNOC in terms of cooperation and activities, especially in the oil, gas, and petrochemicals business. It is reported that 25% of Japanese crude oil imports come from Abu Dhabi, and ADNOC supervises and conducts all the upstream and downstream crude oil operations. Another example is liquefied natural gas (LNG), on which an agreement was signed to build a plant on Das Island off the coast of Abu Dhabi, with a supply of LNG that will last for 20 years. The agreement was to double production, with Japan importing the bulk for a further 25 years effective from 1994. According to sources, it is believed that one in four street lamps in Japan works on gas from Abu Dhabi. Downstream, one of ADNOC's subsidiaries, Abu Dhabi Polymers Company (Borouge), has a production plant in China to meet many of the Far East's requirements for plastic solutions. These are just a few examples that illustrate the importance of Asian markets for ADNOC and the UAE. There are many opportunities there and ADNOC will continue to sustain and boost its oil and gas trade volume in the region.</p><h4>How is ADNOC investing in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods?</h4><p>The term “post-easy-oil" has been emerging in the industry's discussions and on expert panels in recent years. ADNOC remains keen on turning to the latest technology and innovations, paying close attention to EOR mechanisms, research, and investment. ADNOC has assumed a responsible role in developing Abu Dhabi's hydrocarbon resources by maximizing safe and sustainable recovery from reservoirs, and taking the initiative to assess the opportunities of carbon dioxide flooding for EOR, as well as sequestering it in target reservoirs. As part of the continuous effort to ensure the sustainability of the hydrocarbon supply, ADNOC &amp; its group of companies are currently following an EOR piloting road map to test and prepare the major offshore and onshore fields for such EOR schemes. The EOR Road Map defines the timing, scope, and scale of the projects, identifies gaps in crucial data, sets the priorities for research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) programs, and arranges various development programs for personnel.</p><div class="quote">“Asian markets have a major significance for ADNOC in terms of cooperation and activities."</div><h4>To what degree will ADNOC invest in infrastructure and human capital in order to meet the UAE's 2018 target of 3.5 million barrels per day (bbl/d)?</h4><p>ADNOC has set a target of 3.5 million bbl/d in crude oil production by 2017. And, in order to reach such an objective, it has been investing and embarking on a wide range of development projects and expansions in various lines of its operations. This involves the full capitalization of human resources and the greater integration of talented and qualified Emirati human capital into the workforce.</p><h4>What effect is US shale gas and Venezuelan oil having on the market?</h4><p>It has been observed and noted that light tight oil and shale gas are changing the traditional mode and approach of producers and, as a result, consumers in the energy business. In the US, large recoverable resources of shale gas, coupled with an unexpected breakthrough in technology, has resulted in a cost-effective energy source. This gives the industry a competitive advantage and stimulus for healthy economic activity. It is fair to acknowledge that the industry would face some challenges, requiring new strategies and skills as the role of key players in the global energy market would change. Nevertheless, Middle Eastern producers will continue to contribute significantly to meeting global energy demands as conventional oil and gas supplies remain vital sources in the global energy mix for the near future. ADNOC plans to drill an appraisal well to assess the commercial viability of the shale oil and gas reserves across some areas in the Emirate. This is a natural progression for our gas sector, and we are open to exploring potential strategic partnerships to fully develop opportunities in the future.</p><h4>How is ADNOC encouraging Emiratis to enter the workforce?</h4><p>ADNOC devotes strong attention to education. ADNOC-affiliated academic institutions and programs, such as the Petroleum Institute (PI), the ADNOC Technical Institute (ATI), the Glenelg School of Abu Dhabi (GSAD), and the ADNOC Scholarship and Achievers' Oasis Programs, have been jointly providing a full-scale educational package to highly qualified and talented Emiratis. The ADNOC Scholarship Program was established in 1974 to assist UAE high school students who are interested in pursuing their university studies at prestigious international colleges and universities. Once they complete their undergraduate and graduate degrees, they are offered job opportunities within ADNOC &amp; its Group of Companies. The ATI was established in 1978 to train young school students who are interested in pursuing their technical ambitions through training and development. The PI, which started to admit and enroll its first batch of students in the 2001-2002 academic year for males, and then in 2006 for females, offers students Bachelor's and Master's degrees in five engineering disciplines related to the oil and gas sector. Graduates from the PI would have the privilege of joining ADNOC &amp; its Group of Companies to apply and utilize their learning experience in the field at the company's various sites and premises. This comes in line with the ADNOC Emiratization 75% Plan by the year 2017.</p><h4>With the Indian Subcontinent on your doorstep and the Far East nearby, how important is the South American market to ADNOC's business strategy?</h4><p>ADNOC has been a key contributor in strengthening and consolidating mutual relations between the UAE and various countries and regions around the globe, especially in the oil and gas sector. This has been illustrated for decades through crude oil field concessions, joint ventures, contractual partnerships, and other related activities such as the exchange of expertise in business and academia. ADNOC will continue on this path with openness to mutual understanding and cooperation in all investments and business opportunities for a better world and more prosperous UAE.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Croatia is a European country whose geostrategic position, natural resources, and human capital represent a good basis for the development of a society that appreciates work, knowledge, and creativity. Croatia's accession to the EU on July 1, 2013 marked the most important stage in the process of Croatia's political, economic, and social internationalisation. We have become part of a market of 500 million people. This is a position that can bring Croatia and its partners outside the EU a significant benefit since this adds the capacities of different markets and creates opportunities that Croatia, realistically speaking, could not have up to now. Now is the right time to use this leeway, together with our friends and partners in the world—Oman certainly being one of them—for the further development and advancement of our relations.</p><h4>WHAT DOES CROATIA WANT?</h4><p>We want to additionally improve our competitiveness in strategic transport, energy, food production, and the creation of new knowledge. We want to significantly strengthen our service sector, industrial production, and commerce. We also want to open ourselves up as a market and we want to open new markets for our products.</p><div class="quote">“Our two countries share a good geographic position, favorable climate, a long seafaring tradition, rich cultural heritage, and an ecological conscience."</div><h4>WHAT DOES CROATIA OFFER?</h4><p>In addition to easier access to the European and global markets, we offer a modern transport infrastructure, safe business environment, encouraging investment climate, educated labor force, and high quality of life.</p><p>Croatian companies have enormous and relevant experience in the construction of infrastructural facilities, which has been confirmed in a number of successfully realized projects worldwide. To all those who have visited Croatia in recent years at least once, it is clear that we have one of the most modern motorway networks in Europe. Croatia's construction industry has proved its expertise in civil engineering and building construction, and I am confident that it can meet the demands of the Omani market.</p><p>I am aware that the Omani side has, several times, expressed its interest in the use of Croatia's air and seaports. A project of modernization and development of the port of Rijeka is underway. This includes development of the port's transshipment and commercial facilities, a passenger port, a boating center, and accompanying commercial and tourist facilities. Opportunities for investment are arising as well as for some other ways of using the capacities of the port of Rijeka and its entire transport direction. It is possible to use the benefits of a free zone there.</p><p>In relation to this, it is necessary to refer to Osijek Airport and its opportunities for the development of cargo transport. Here, as well as in other areas, Croatia expects Omani entrepreneurs and Omani capital with its doors being wide open.</p><p>Croatia can be an interesting partner to Oman in the sector of energy transport and the energy trade. Croatia has plans for the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal on the island of Krk—Omani investors and suppliers are welcome.</p><p>Our two countries share a good geographic position, favorable climate, a long seafaring tradition, rich cultural heritage, and an ecological conscience; all these elements are integrated in the development of Croatia's tourism sector. To its Omani partners, Croatia offers opportunities for investments in its tourism infrastructure. We remain open for exchanges of experience and know-how, in particular in the area of medical tourism, for which our Omani friends have earlier expressed their interest.</p><p>I am acquainted with Oman's policy of providing its citizens with the opportunity to acquire knowledge abroad. Croatia has quality programs, in particular in the field of medicine and engineering, which are open to foreign students. Personally, I would like if students from Oman were among them. In our previous contacts, Oman expressed its need for experts in archaeology, in particular underwater research. In this sense, still unexplored archaeological sites in Oman represent a major opportunity for cooperation with our archaeological experts.</p><p>Regardless of their geographical distance, Croatia and Oman have a political dialogue of high quality and significance. Croatia wants to support it with a strong economic partnership. In this context, this editorial is a political pledge for stronger and more comprehensive cooperation between Croatia and Oman in the future.</p><p>During earlier bilateral talks and contacts, we could identify the areas of interest of both countries, ranging from the development of infrastructure, energy, and tourism to cooperation in science and education. Now is the time to identify the concrete projects that we want to develop within these areas. The initiated dialogue between Croatia and Oman can be moved to a new strategic level. All future efforts focused on this will enjoy my full support.</p><p>Finally, the relations between countries cannot be reduced to their mutual trade, however important it may be. Contacts among people contribute to making the bonds between states stronger. Therefore, I am very pleased that Omani tourists have discovered Croatia and that they visit Croatia in increasing numbers—they are our welcome, appreciated, and dear guests whom we receive with open and sincere hearts. I am looking forward to every opportunity for cultural exchanges and I wish to see more of them in the future, since both Croatia and Oman have plenty to offer to each other in this respect as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - August 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the establishment of Qatar Industrial Manufacturing Company (QIMC) here in Qatar?</h4><p>In the late part of the 20th Century, Qatar's leadership recognized the need for national transformation from being a trading economy to an industrial one. There was a need particularly for small- and medium-scale industries in the country; however, businesses and individuals were still hesitant to invest in industry, which is why the state of Qatar launched a strategy to change the perception of the private sector and businessmen, as well as to encourage them to invest in the industrial sector. The visionary government led the way by investing in fully serviced industrial zones and establishing the Qatar Development Bank. They invited SMEs to invest in industry and established the Qatar Industrial Manufacturing Company. Thanks to the country's able leadership and the hard work of all our employees, we have been very successful and stood the test of time. We now have investments in more than 16 small- to-medium-scale industrial projects, and so far, they are all doing very well. At the same time, we are pursuing our expansion and diversification strategy in earnest.</p><h4>QIMC has achieved a steady year-on-year rise in Net Profit. What do you attribute this to?</h4><p>This is the return on our diverse industrial projects that are already operational. These were undertaken with a view to sustaining growth and profitability. At the same time, we are fairly consistent in providing returns to our shareholders, in terms of dividend distribution, so that they enjoy both short- and long-term benefits. The steady market price that QIMC's shares command in the Qatari Financial Market is testament to the faith our shareholders have in us. We also have many new projects in the pipeline, and are always exploring new opportunities, as well as conducting feasibility studies for new technologies and projects. We work closely with our partners and the management team of all our subsidiaries and associates in shaping their strategies, which differentiates us from other companies that merely play the role of investors.</p><h4>QIMC and KLJ Organic of India signed an agreement in November 2012 to establish a paraffin wax manufacturing plant in Mesaieed. Can you elaborate on this new venture?</h4><p>KLJ has plants that produce chlorinated paraffin in India and Thailand. We reviewed all of its products, marketing, and technology worldwide, and found them to be the best technology partner for us. However, negotiations, legal formalities, and due diligence have taken longer than expected. We are participating in this joint venture with a partnership stake of up to 60%. Now that the project is moving on a fast track, we believe the plant will be commissioned at the start of 2015.</p><div class="quote">“The visionary government led the way by investing in fully serviced industrial zones."</div><h4>What is your overview of Qatar's industrial sector?</h4><p>Qatar is a small market, which is a disadvantage and a challenge. There are limited opportunities in the industrial sector and even within that, there is competition from all over. For example, formaldehyde, chlorinated paraffin, and sulfuric acid are supplied to the country from around the region, and even though we have our own group of companies producing these, we still have to compete with international entities. Qatar is currently reliant upon its oil and gas wealth, but this will not last forever. Therefore, we need to diversify and pursue sustainable industrial development. And to do this, we need to understand what our resources are and formulate a strategy around our competitive advantage, which we can successfully execute. Of course, we must be conscious of the need for social change and active participation of the Qatari community in various areas, which is essential for the success of such a strategy. We are working hard, but I still think more needs to be done, particularly with regard to industrial zone infrastructure and the industrial sector as a whole, so as to encourage the private sector to focus more on value-added manufacturing using locally available resources. We currently export oil and gas; however, we have to look at value addition and sustainability, which are very important, and a priority for the State of Qatar. There are many positive developments, as in the case of the construction of the Ras Laffan industrial zone and new infrastructure such as the New Doha International Airport (NDIA) and the new port to support the country's resources. We have to utilize this opportunity. Qatar is focusing its efforts on making the necessary improvements, but I still think there is much more to do.</p><h4>What are your plans and targets for the medium term?</h4><p>We have many projects in the pipeline both in Qatar and the region. In April 2013, I visited Saudi Arabia where we have two projects planned. We hope to be able to announce these projects during 2013. We also perceive opportunities within Qatar in the years ahead and hopefully this will rub off on our entire portfolio. Keeping this in mind, we have already embarked on expansion and capacity building in many of our group companies so that we will be ready for the much-awaited boom. At the same time, we must accept that the country faces huge challenges across all sectors to implement all projects planned for the coming years, such as railways, stadiums, and other infrastructure projects, while successfully managing the economy and not allowing inflation to rise to the point where it harms industry and the people. We need to look at how this will affect the country, the economy, manpower, and inflation, and how the government will manage the resources available to ensure success. This is a major challenge, and not an easy task. The projects need sound due diligence that requires transparency and the availability of relevant reports in the public domain. This will boost the confidence of investors and the public at large. I fervently hope we don't see a repeat of what happened in 2006, with rents in the industrial zone skyrocketing and even small workshop spaces costing QAR3,000 per month. Also, a steep increase in residential rental prices would result in higher delivery cost. It is very also important to ensure that there is a structured implementation strategy and a timetable for completion of all the projects, while keeping all macro economic parameters under control. I have full faith and confidence in the ability of the country's leadership in spearheading and guiding this challenging, yet exciting phase of development. They have already indicated that local companies, especially SMEs, will enjoy preference in the execution of these projects. And so we will ensure that the subsidiaries and associates of QIMC are ready to seize the opportunities and deliver to their fullest potential.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the trust sector evolved in Colombia over the past few years?</h4><p>Since the Association was established, the sector's growth has been exponential. By June 2013, the sector managed assets worth Ps250 billion, representing 37% of GDP. The Financial Superintendency of Colombia (SFC) grants two types of licenses to the trust sector: trust management licenses and collective investment fund licenses. The 27 trust companies currently operating in Colombia manage 126 types of funds amounting to Ps30 billion. In terms of regulation, Colombia has made important advances in different areas. In the last few years, changes in the tax framework and the strict control over the sector by the SFC have enabled the sector to strengthen. Moreover, in June 2013, the government introduced a new regulatory framework, adjusting the collective investment funds industry to international standards, which allowed this instrument of collective savings to become even more global. Regarding the trust business, this builds confidence for customers and the authorities, as well as security for investors, turning the trust instrument into one of the most attractive tools for the development of different projects, particularly real estate and infrastructure.</p><h4>In your opinion, how does society see the trust sector and its companies?</h4><p>The financial performance of the trust sector has been significant in recent years, which means that there is a good insight into this industry. However, we must continue to work in order to provide a wider knowledge on collective investment funds and the trust instrument, bearing in mind that the people perceive them as relatively complex products.</p><div class="quote">“The country is growing and we are living a crucial moment; we are in the international spotlight."</div><h4>What are the core reasons behind the growth of the sector?</h4><p>Behind this success is the fact that we have strengthened our activities in the sectors of infrastructure and construction as our main growth engines. Also, the sector has participated in the administration of social security resources. Today, much of the pension liabilities of the country, as well as health activities, are handled through this fiduciary tool. In regional terms, Colombia is currently the second largest in Latin America after Mexico in terms of the size of the industry.</p><h4>Which economic sectors currently require the trust sector's services the most?</h4><p>At the moment, we have observed great dynamism and positive trends within the real estate sector, especially in shopping malls, office buildings, and housing. Lately, the hotel and tourism industry has also gained relevance. In terms of setting up new companies, trust tools have proven to be of great help for foreign investors in providing access to proper advice on fiscal policy issues to carry on their projects. Locals too, have benefitted from this. Our sector is an essential part in the process of improving the best practices of Colombian industry. We have worked with the authorities for the proper management of public assets, specifically in the administration of advanced payments, which, under the recent anti-corruption law, must be administered through a trust.</p><h4>What are the risks a trustee company has to take to be successful in this sector in Colombia?</h4><p>It is clear that the trust sector faces certain risks in the development of its activities; however, the sector has learned to manage them professionally following legal regulations to mitigate them. The main risk is operational, but this has been mitigated thanks to a better systematization and greater transparency in the technological and operational processes required for this activity. The effective performance of the industry and the monitoring from the SFC has clearly helped minimize the risks inherent in this business.</p><h4>What role does the sector play in attracting foreign investors?</h4><p>Trust companies possess extensive knowledge of the country and its regulatory framework, as well as experience in how to conduct business in a flexible and transparent way. This allows foreign investors to minimize risks and have an easier approach to a new market. In our particular case, the Colombian trust sector has rich experience in this segment.</p><h4>What role does the industry play in the economic growth of the country?</h4><p>Looking at the two types of license, for fiduciary business and investment funds, the sector is a mechanism that contributes to economic development and is an attractive destination for the reception of resources that can be managed through collective investment funds. The arrival of small and large foreign investors is also challenging. In general, the sector plays an important role in the economic growth of the country.</p><h4>What role do collective fund investments play within the industry and the national economy?</h4><p>Our sector is one of the three that hold an official license to operate and manage collective investment funds. Currently, the trust companies manage 77% of this market, the assets of which total $15.5 billion across 126 products. This vehicle is an efficient alternative for investment and saving, for both individuals and enterprises, and can be corroborated by the international recognition that has been given to mutual funds. In terms of the market positions of this mechanism among different segments of the population, transformations will surely occur in terms of the development of the culture of savings and investment in the long term.</p><h4>What have been the landmark achievements of the sector over the past few years?</h4><p>I believe the high levels of stability and cohesion within the sector are some of the most important achievements. In addition, we have been consolidating an increasing perception of transparency and confidence among our present and future customers and the authorities. Our goal is also to promote knowledge of the sector and the products it offers, continue generating mechanisms of best practice for business at all levels, and improve the service offered to customers.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the industry?</h4><p>When reaching such high levels of performance, the challenge is to sustain them. Therefore, we have to work with greater commitment to maintain credibility and consolidate the financial indicators of the industry over the coming years. In this context, the trust industry, and therefore the Association, should continue working toward the further democratization of the tools and services offered.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the Colombian economy in the medium term?</h4><p>The country is growing and we are living a crucial moment; we are in the international spotlight. We are geographically positioned in one of the best places in the world; we look to Europe and Asia, and we are at the crossroads between North and South. This is a very interesting moment for Colombia. We enjoy fiscal, political and regulatory stability, and we are proud of our competent industry, workers and entrepreneurs.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Telmex story?</h4><p>Telmex was a public enterprise that was privatized in December 1990; Grupo Carso was awarded the tender process in partnership with France Télécom and the Southwestern Bell Corporation, today's AT&amp;T. Back in the 1990s, Telmex was a very outdated IT company in terms of technological usage and equipment, therefore we had to modernize the company at all levels; management, technology, and business practices. For that reason, our main priority was to invest in the company's modernization from the technological point of view, as well as to train our workforce to adapt themselves to the company's new practices and levels of technology. We had around 50,000 employees; the main concern was to improve on education standards. Right after the takeover we established the Instituto Tecnológico de Teléfonos de México (Inttelmex), our own training and education facility that has become a leading institution in its sector. Since 1990 up to now, the educational average level increased from 5.9 to 16 years of education. When we acquired Telmex, the company was ranked around 60th in a worldwide ranking—in 2000 we were top of the league, according to Forbes and in 2012 this was reaffirmed by the World Finance Telecoms Awards. This period proved to be a very critical moment for the company. We needed to heavily invest in many fields. Telmex and Telcel have invested more than $44 billion in the Mexican IT sector since 1991, a period of 22 years in which the IT sector has become very competitive, attracting foreign players. We have supported the development of telecommunications and broadband services in all market segments nationwide, covering more than 105 million Mexicans. Telmex's investments represent over 80% of the sector's overall levels. Today, our company reaches over 97% of Mexico's population, and we take our social responsibility to serve the Mexican people in terms of connectivity and digital culture and education, as well as in national social programs, seriously. At the same time, we are pioneers in many fields worldwide, and, for example, Telcel was the first company in the world to introduce pre-paid mobile telephone services in 1996.</p><h4>What are the main developments you have seen in Mexico in terms of the provision of broadband services, and what role has Telmex played in this context?</h4><p>We started offering broadband services in 2001, four years later than the cable operators in the country. Back then, Telmex had around 67,000 clients, whereas our competitors had around 165,000. In terms of market share, we had around 28%. However, if we look at figures from 2011, Telmex owns more than a 70% market share—we have reversed roles. Investment and more investment has been key in this process, and I am proud to say that thanks to our growth and development the broadband segment in Mexico has been growing at an annual rate of around 54% over the 2002-2011 period, which represented one of the highest growth rates in the world.</p><div class="quote">“We have financed over 3.5 million computers in Mexico from 1999 up until today."</div><h4>What are the main lines of investment Telmex prioritizes for the future?</h4><p>Today, we put a lot of emphasis on investing in cultural and educational programs, such as digital libraries. We believe it is a natural step after experiencing such impressive growth in segments such as broadband. In this regard, we need to strengthen broadband penetration in the low-end market spheres of the country, an area where the main hurdle to overcome is the low purchasing power of Mexican families and the lack of computers in households. The National Institute for Statistics and Demographics (INEGI) says that there are only 10 million households with a computer in Mexico, whereas there are over 30 million households in the country. Telmex has played a key role in increasing the number of computers in family units by selling them through economic programs that enabled families to pay them back little by little through their telephone bills. In fact, we have financed over 3.5 million computers in Mexico from 1999 up until today. Therefore, we will keep a strong focus on increasing penetration rates in these segments. For that reason, at the moment we are also heavily investing in digital culture and internet programs. Today, more than 86% of internet users utilize it for entertainment purposes, and we need to boost the number of people who use it for other applications such as e-government, e-banking, e-health, and e-education. According to the ITU's Measuring the Information Society 2011, only 1.2% of Mexico's population uses the internet for government-related purposes, whereas the same figure in Europe stands at around 46%, Brazil 11%, and Chile 12%. At the same time, only 18% of Mexico's primary schools have internet access. Therefore, Mexico has great development opportunities in the segments that depend on current penetration rates as well as educational programs, because we have the necessary infrastructure that let us create massive events of digital culture such as Aldea Digital Telcel 4GLTE - infinitum (Digital Village), which received more than 154,000 visitors and obtained the Guiness World Record as the largest worldwide event of digital inclusion.</p><h4>What role is Telmex playing in developing educational facilities in this sector?</h4><p>Telmex is playing a key role in this process, and we have launched more than 3,600 digital classroom/libraries; we worked with public schools, Telmex Classrooms, among others in the country by providing computers and broadband access, and we have already facilitated with this program internet access for more than 3 million people. Also, we developed over 350 educational workshops to provide scientific and mathematics education to children. We also spent time training teachers to be ready for these workshops. Finally, we also developed specific management software for schools and teachers to optimize their time, resources, and workload. Over the years, both teachers and pupils under Telmex programs have been nationally and internationally recognized. According to our research, students' performance in the “Enlace" educational evaluation and their learning curve has improved by 35% thanks to our programs, something that has also been seen in the national exams the government carries out. We additionally developed an educational network at the higher education level in order to boost knowledge and technological exchange: its name is Académica. Today, there are over 260 universities at the international level that—free of charge—are part of this technology platform. In addition, we have developed our institution to a higher education level, and those interested can even take MA courses in the Inttelmex IT free of charge. These are just some of the initiatives we are heavily focusing on at the moment. However, we constantly develop other social and educational projects nationally and internationally, such as an alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT/OCW) for the development of online higher education, as well as an educational collaboration agreement.</p><h4>How significant is the expansion of the Triara Data Center you carried out in 2012 for the company's future?</h4><p>Through América Móvil, there are seven Data Centers that operate across Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Peru which are very important for our services and activities, especially due to our commitment to keep improving IT services for our customers. This allows us to guarantee our residential and global corporate customers total certainty and security in safeguarding their information, which is their most valuable asset and where we offer practically unlimited hosting. Additionally, all of América Móvil's Data Centers are interconnected and therefore we are able to offer these services within our territory as well as abroad, which is a huge competitive advantage for us. In Mexico, we have almost 17,000 m2 of Data Centers which are located in two different cities: Querétaro and Monte- rrey, which have the highest quality international standards and certifications in terms of information security, service management, quality, environmental and infrastructure as ICREA Level 5 Certification (HSHA-WCQA: High Security High Available World Class Quality Assurance), ISO 27001, Structured Cabling (BELDEN, TYCO, ADC), ISO 9001, SAS-70, NFPA 75, ISAE 3402, ITIL, CDCP, CCNA, CCNP and Microsoft. In fact, broadband and Data Centers represent two of the main areas of investment for the company.</p><h4>What has been Telmex's approach to the development of the national wi-fi network in public places?</h4><p>Currently, we have more than 8.6 million broadband clients. That means that they all have wi-fi services in their homes—either wired or wireless. On top of that, Telmex has more than 5,400 public wi-fi spots that are continuously growing. They are located in key areas such as universities, airports, parks, public areas and service stations. We have more than 4.8 million connections to our many wi-fi spots every month.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for 2013 for both Telmex and the telecommunications industry?</h4><p>I believe that the sector requires higher levels of investment at all levels in order to further boost its development, because we have to keep in mind that without constant investment our sector cannot be competitive. At the same time, Mexico lags in telecommunications multi services. I believe that operators need to be granted the right to offer all services accompanied with a regulation that gives incentives to invest in order to increase the infrastructure. I truly believe that such a process would boost investment, creativity, flexibility, and development in the sector, and in the end, the main beneficiary would be the consumer and the country. It is a win-win situation for everybody.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon is a leading name in the world of trade and services, in addition to its high standards in the fields of tourism, education, and health care. How can the Lebanese economy further develop its potential and boost its competitiveness?</h4><p>Experience has shown that political and security disturbances have repeatedly had a major negative effect on economic activity and growth. This sensitivity is due to the volatile nature of our main economic sectors. Tourism, financial services, construction, and real estate respond quickly and, more often than not, significantly to an escalation in political tones, intensification of armed skirmishes, kidnapping outbreaks, or tension at the borders. Past administrations have been unable to undertake the necessary reforms and to create the adequate frameworks to allow for the budding of basic sectors that are less vulnerable to turbulences such as industry, agriculture, and international trade. Greater efforts should have been devoted to create a robust network of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to facilitate exports, set-up adequate regulatory bodies to monitor product quality, and build confidence in the “Made in Lebanon" brand and a strong reputation for its brands and image in general. However, for an efficient utilization of these conduits, competitiveness should be boosted and preserved at high levels. This, in turn, cannot be realized without a relatively cheap and abundant energy supply, easily accessible and diversified transportation systems, productive labor, and an advanced telecommunications and information platform. Regrettably, the period during which telecommunications and information technology started developing at a dizzying pace worldwide, Lebanon was immersed in a protracted conflict, which calls for a forceful catching-up process. All of the above need not be perceived as shortfalls, but rather as a vast unrealized potential that opens limitless investment avenues, very promising business opportunities, and a job creation machine that is needed to absorb the yearly 25,000 new entrants to the Lebanese labor market.</p><h4>Following new offshore discoveries, what are your prospects for the Lebanese energy sector and its impact on the national economy?</h4><p>The prospective natural gas and maybe oil resources will constitute a new frontier for Lebanon. Despite what is expected to be a declining path for gas prices due to large new discoveries and the exploitation of shale gas, the impact of new supply and substantial additional revenues from exports on a small economy like ours will be momentous. First, it will radically decrease our energy bill, which, given the endemic deficits of Electricité du Liban, will rapidly improve budget deficits with beneficial ripple effects on macroeconomic parameters, such as a decline in interest rates that free liquidity for private sector credit in a “crowding-in" effect likely to boost growth and employment. One risk of this scenario is inflation, and this is why a set of accompanying measures have to be introduced and monetary aggregates carefully monitored. Second, an increase in exports will help correct the imbalances in our trade sector and alleviate the need for substantial balance of payment surpluses every year to stabilize our current account. Third, the decrease in energy tariffs that will inevitably ensue and, beyond their direct effect on competitiveness for enterprises, will free chunks of disposable income for individuals that will uplift their consumption and saving patterns with positive consequences on investment. It is important to note also that the moment prospection zones are allocated, it is expected that oil and gas companies are going to start investing massively to rent offices, buy cars, hire accountants, lawyers, and employees. Experts say that the inflow during the first year, that is three to four years before gas is effectively produced, could reach $1 billion.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanon is an attractive destination for FDI flows."</div><h4>Why is Lebanon an attractive destination for FDI and what are you expecting for 2013 in terms of inflows?</h4><p>Lebanon is an attractive destination for FDI flows because of all the potential I outlined, but also in view of the fact that rates of return are consistently very high. In addition, it is a known fact that the country has never defaulted on its debt nor has any bank been allowed to collapse despite the extremely difficult circumstances that we have been through. Therefore, domestic, regional, and international investors have never suffered from the type of ordeals that they have sustained in other countries. Even real estate, which slows in periods of tension, has never witnessed a bust, although it has gone through double-digit price increases for prolonged periods of time. The reason behind this healthy environment is a draconian set of measures related to real estate lending, which impose high equity requirements. We can add to all this a good quality of life with a vast array of cultural, touristic, and leisure activities and high level services delivered by an educated, multi-lingual population. But maybe most of all, it is because Lebanon is a free society. We have paid a hefty price in the past for this openness and this freedom, but we shall remain committed to its ideals. Freedom is one of the pillars of our culture. As for our expectations regarding FDI flows for 2013, they are modest given the difficulties in Syria. However, hopes are high that once political stability is restored, Lebanon will greatly benefit from reconstruction efforts. Prospects, therefore, remain extremely appealing especially that, contrary to other countries that face economic difficulties, the space for reform in Lebanon is very vast. A simple correction of electricity subsidies and an improvement of custom duties and tax collections (without the passing of any new taxes), will immediately decrease budget deficits and generate a virtuous economic circle. The vitality and the multi-dimensional contribution of the Lebanese diaspora remains a major asset for Lebanon and the prospects of its development.</p><h4>What role does Lebanon play in the defense of stability and democracy in the region?</h4><p>“Lebanon is more than a country, it is a message of freedom and an example of pluralism for both the East and the West…" these were the words of HH Pope John Paul II in describing Lebanon. We have tried to protect this message by maintaining a persistent adherence and an unflinching loyalty to the Constitution and by constantly fighting to preserve the institutions and safeguard their free interplay. Our mission during the past five years has been to maintain cohesion, conciliation, and dialog among the various political groups. It has not been easy because Lebanon is a tributary of complex regional, often conflicting interests and influences. We have seen peoples around us rise and die in pursuit of freedom and democracy when we have set an example in both areas and, in particular, we have established and preserved a consensual democracy in which every part, irrespective of its size, has access to the levers of responsibility and power. Projecting that image and giving others the desire to identify with it and to seek it for themselves is the role Lebanon can play in the defense of stability and democracy in the region.</p><h4>What is your vision for Lebanon's economic future?</h4><p>The ultimate economic objective is wellbeing. We want to guarantee to all citizens access to education and health services of a decent quality as well as a job, allowing each individual to earn a living in a dignified way. We also need to ensure, for retirees, pension levels commensurate with a growing cost of living and a safety net to protect them from the vagaries of old age. To fulfill these aspirations, we need to create a framework that compounds the joint inputs of both the public and private sectors given the major importance of private enterprise in the Lebanese economy. Our feeling is that what is needed, first of all, is an extensive assessment of the domestic economy and its limitations. It should be followed by serious consideration on what is the nature of the economy we want in order to reinforce the production sectors and limit volatility. Concerted efforts in this regard imply serious legislative action on the part of the public authorities to motivate a determined investment drive on the part of the private sector. We firmly believe that a law on decentralization, another on public private partnership (PPP), and a battery of decrees to enhance the credibility and dynamism of the capital markets have become an urgent necessity. Investment is unquestionably the main pillar of growth. Consequently, everything should be done to encourage it and to give investors a feeling of safety and the assurance that their interests are protected. This ranges from responsible fiscal continuity to shoring up the legal apparatus by modernizing and upgrading the Lebanese courts. The lack of transparency, accountability, and proper governance is a very costly deficiency because the economic price of impropriety has a direct effect on competitiveness and it is the public authorities' responsibility to address these issues and cure them radically. Extensive reform is overdue in so many areas and the task is colossal, but it is a sine qua non condition to realizing the double-digit growth we should aim at reaching and maintaining for the coming decade if we want to satisfy our legitimate ambitions. We have the means, and now we need a stronger will and a higher political sense of responsibility. Besides, in a way, the fact that so much remains to be done is in and by itself a reason to invest in Lebanon, for had we been a mature economy, margins for windfall returns would have been much narrower. What might help in harmonizing all these different thoughts is the setting up of a new ministry in charge of planning; not in the classical centralized-economy understanding, which is an outdated notion, but rather a vehicle for developing visions, perceiving prospective trends, and accommodating policy on a permanent basis to fluctuations in those trends.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In December 2012, a new law was implemented that led to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) taking on a supervisory and regulatory role for insurance companies. Do you feel that such a change will lead to increased insurance penetration in Qatar, where the levels are currently some of the lowest in the world?</h4><p>As the overall economy continues to expand, Qatar's insurance sector is likely to register strong growth in the coming years. You would appreciate that besides being a high-income country, there are a number of reasons for the low insurance penetration rates in Qatar, including the State's comprehensive social security system that provides for pensions and other support services through the General Retirement and Social Insurance Authority. Another factor contributing to the low penetration in the non-life sector is that compulsory insurance in most segments is not mandated by law. This is all set to change soon with the recent announcement of the broadening of the compulsory insurance pool in the health sector. Moreover, the QCB would frame a comprehensive set of insurance regulations that are in line with international best practices. Efforts are underway to develop an effective and harmonized authorization and supervision framework for insurance firms. In this regard, we would lay greater emphasis on governance, prudential standards, group supervision, and macro prudential surveillance. All these factors would contribute toward the healthy growth of the insurance sector in Qatar.</p><h4>The same law also calls for provisions relating to the conduct of financial business in Qatar with regards to consumer protection and client confidentiality. How do you intend to implement these reforms?</h4><p>We would develop a coordinated approach among the three regulatory authorities to ensure that financial services firms are transparent with their customers. Such firms should understand the needs of their customers and put in place adequate systems that avoid disputes. In this regard, the dispute resolution mechanism has to be timely and conclusive. Furthermore, consumers have to be safeguarded from unauthorized and unlicensed illegal financial service providers through stricter enforcement of the law. In view of this, the regulatory perimeter for financial services operating in Qatar needs to be drawn, outlining those financial services that can only be provided by financial institutions licensed in Qatar. Moreover, we need to frame regulations for financial institutions relating to consumer protection. For maintaining client confidentiality, it is necessary to strengthen the existing rules protecting customer information and specify the circumstances when confidential information held by financial institutions could be disclosed.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar's financial sector outlook remains buoyant given the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the country."</div><h4>The Financial Stability and Risk and Control Committee (FSRCC) was recently formed with the mandate of ensuring financial stability. What strategies led to the formation of this committee, and how it is expected to work in practice?</h4><p>The new QCB law lays greater emphasis on the macro prudential framework in Qatar and it is from this perspective that the law has established the FSRCC. The FSRCC will minimize the regulatory overlap and plug the gaps through coordinated action from the three regulators. The FSRCC is chaired by the Governor of the QCB and includes the Deputy Governor and the Chief Executive Officers of the QFMA and the QFC Regulatory Authority. The FSRCC is responsible for: identifying and assessing risks to the financial sector and markets and recommending solutions to manage and mitigate such risks; coordinating the work of the financial regulatory authorities in the state; and proposing policies related to regulation, control, and supervision of financial services, businesses, and markets. For its regular functioning, the FSRCC would draw resources from the three regulatory agencies. The decisions of the FSRCC will be implemented by each regulator within their own regulatory ambit and jurisdiction.</p><h4>There has been talk about Qatar changing its currency peg away the US dollar. What preconditions would need to be met before such a change takes place, and how would a deviation from the status quo benefit Qatar?</h4><p>As I have repeated many times before, Qatar's decision to keep its exchange rate pegged to the US dollar is based on key considerations that encompass the current economic realities of the country. With our emphasis on greater economic diversification, we aspire to develop the non- hydrocarbon sector over a period of time so as to reduce our reliance on the hydrocarbon sector in future. Moreover, our financial markets would have to deepen and develop further in order to provide the appropriate instruments for the hedging of risk in a more flexible exchange rate environment.</p><h4>What role does the development of Qatar's financial infrastructure play in achieving the goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>The National Development Strategy introduced by the government constitutes the main pillar of our development approach in realizing the goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030. At the core of this strategy is to develop a diversified and more resilient economy, in which the financial sector will have a predominant role. As a part of this initiative, we have already made significant progress in developing the financial markets and related infrastructure. Illustratively, major initiatives have already been taken to develop a deep and liquid debt market through regular issuance of treasury bills and government-dated securities. This would lead to the development of a risk-free yield curve that would facilitate the pricing of new financial market instruments. Moreover, the three regulatory agencies are working together to harmonize and strengthen regulatory oversight of Qatar's payment and settlement systems infrastructure, in line with international standards and practices. In this regard, the objective is to gradually integrate QFC firms, which are hitherto outside the domestic payments and settlement system, into the national mainstream. Furthermore, in view of the new QCB law, we are also strengthening our legal and regulatory framework in order to safeguard consumer protection.</p><h4>Moving forward, what is your outlook for Qatar's financial sector in the medium term?</h4><p>Qatar's financial sector outlook remains buoyant given the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the country and continued government support to the financial sector. The country enjoys a strong credit rating and has a very favorable tax regime. The faith of the international community in the economy is reflected by the fact that recent issuances of sovereign bonds were over-subscribed by a wide margin. Cumulatively, these factors have resulted in the country enjoying a high level of international investor confidence. As mentioned before, we are focusing on the financial sector to play a bigger role in developing a more diversified economy over the medium term. Being a predominantly bank-based financial system, this has entailed strengthening the banking sector through various measures. Accordingly, policies are being attuned to international best practices, while meeting the requirements of the financial sector. Moreover, we have adopted a coordinated strategy whereby the three regulatory agencies, i.e., the QCB, the QFMA, and the QFCRA, would harmonize regulatory and supervisory standards in Qatar across different jurisdictions. As the apex body and the supreme competent authority for the entire financial sector, the challenge for the QCB is how best to achieve this transition in a non-disruptive manner, while taking cognizance of the views of all stakeholders.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will the liberalization of the railroads provide opportunities to foreign investors?<br></h4><p>Foreign investors will be able to take part in the Turkish railway sector, provided they form a company in Turkey and satisfy the necessary qualifications. They will be able to make the investments they would like to in order to develop their business and compete on equal terms with the other operators in the sector. Once we accomplished our objective of bringing the private sector into the railway sector in 2003, the number of privately owned wagons went up from 771 in that year to 3,159 in 2012. Because of the success of our policies, we also enter into joint ventures with private companies including EUROTEM (a joint venture between Hyundai Rotem of South Korea and TÜVASAÅž) for the production of high-speed trains, for which the technology doesn't yet exist in Turkey; VADEMSAÅž (a joint venture with Austrian steel company Voestalpine and Turkish steel producer Karabük Demir Çelik) for the production of switches; and SİTAÅž (a joint venture with the Italian company Margeritelli) for the production of sleeper cars.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Ankara-Istanbul high-speed train (HST) project for the Turkish economy?</h4><p>The Ankara-Istanbul HST Project will be integrated with other HST projects and with the Marmaray project that connects the Asian and European continents. It is expected to carry up to 10 million-12 million passengers a year and will be as successful in reducing road traffic as the Ankara-Eskişehir HST. When the Ankara-Eskişehir HST opened in 2009, the share of total passengers traveling by bus between Ankara and Eskişehir dropped from 55% to 10%, and private vehicle passengers dropped from 37% to 18%. The percentage of passengers traveling by train, on the other hand, went from 8% to 72%. The Ankara-Istanbul HST Project will change Turkey. For example, there will be a drop in energy expenditure of up to $161.4 million, a reduction of vehicles and passengers on motorways that saves $571.1 million, and approximately 6.8 million vehicles will be withdrawn from inter-city roads. In addition, there will be an 880,000 ton reduction in CFC gas emissions, which will lead to a drop of $91.6 million in environmental expenditures. Most importantly, when the Marmaray, Ankara-Istanbul HST, Ankara-Sivas HST, and Kars-Tbilisi projects are completed, there will be an uninterrupted, fast, and economical railway connection between Europe and Asia, East and West.</p><h4>What are the expansion plans for the ports of TCDD in the coming years?</h4><p>Our institution, at the same time as managing its railway operations, managed the Haydarpaşa, Mersin, Izmir, Samsun, Derince, Bandırma, and Iskenderun ports. All but Haydarpaşa port have been subject to privatization as part of the Privatization Board's legislation of December 30, 2004. In line with this law, the ports in Mersin, Samsun, Bandırma, and Iskenderun have been transferred to private companies through the operation transfer model. Izmir Port has been restructured to serve as both a passenger and freight port in line with Privatization Board Law 2010/89 of October 25, 2010. Following the completion of the Izmir cruise port project, larger cruise ships will be able to dock in Izmir, bringing Izmir Port's total passenger capacity up from 500,000 to over 3 million.</p><p>Izmir Port will be the driving force of Aegean trade and industry, providing optimum service as a distribution and collection center, taking a major share of Mediterranean freight trade, with the potential to become Turkey's main port. The port will also be deepened so that the depth limitations on large Post-Panamax type ships will be eradicated, enabling these ships to be able to use the docking canal and port basin. The most important stage of our work is widening the navigation canal on the route from the Yenikale Passage entrance to Izmir Port by 250 meters and making it deeper by 14 meters. There will also be further basin deepening work so that ships can navigate and maneuver more securely, ensuring that the material extracted in the deepening project can be reutilized to create a new container storage area that will expand the port's existing capacity to accommodate 350-meter, 10,000-TEU capacity ships. It can currently only accept 200-meter, 4,000-TEU ships. As a result, the value-added of freight transport done in Turkey will increase.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Turkey's current R&amp;D capacity, and what steps is the government taking to help Turkey become a global leader in R&amp;D?</h4><p>The path to economic development passes through production. In recent years, Turkey has become a country that produces more and generates greater value-added. Annual exports, 95% of which consist of industrial products, have reached $152.5 billion as of 2012. Production is one of the most important targets for Turkey. However, we also need to ask ourselves: What will Turkey produce and how will it do it? A decade ago, Turkey was a producer and exporter of low-tech products. In 10 years, the share of low-tech products in overall production has reduced to 25%, whereas the share of medium-technology products has reached 70%. By 2023, the share of high-tech products in overall production will increase to 20%—25%. Turkey desires to create at least 10 new global brands. The government of Turkey and the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology carries out significant projects to enhance the scientific and technological capacity of the country. The High Council for Science and Technology has been convened for its 25th session. Prime Minister Erdoğan chaired 16 of the 25 meetings carried out in 30 years, and this clearly represents the science and technology policy that is adopted by the government. We strictly follow and successfully implement the decisions made by the High Council for Science and Technology. The Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology implemented the Industrial Strategy Document at the beginning of 2011. Out of 72 actions that are determined by the document, 23 are carried out under the “Technological Development of Companies." Compared to 2002 figures, the share of R&amp;D expenditure within the national income of Turkey has doubled and is almost 1%. This, however, is not enough. By 2023, the share of the R&amp;D budget in overall national income is expected to reach 3%, and two-thirds of the overall R&amp;D spending shall be covered by the private sector. In other words, R&amp;D spending made by the private sector is expected to reach $40 billion, with over $20 billion coming from the public sector by 2023. The government of Turkey has considerably increased the budget that is reserved for education and R&amp;D. What is even more important is that the right policies are formulated and the budget is allocated to rightful purposes. Together with KOSGEB and TÜBİTAK, affiliated bodies of the Ministry, we strive to promote innovation and entrepreneurship based on technology as well as collaboration between the universities and the industry.</p><h4>To what extent does collaboration between the academic and private sector play an important role in building Turkey's high-tech capacity?</h4><p>In order for a country to become the leader in the world in terms of economic development, it must possess universities and academia that are in line with world standards. The researchers and academics must be able to generate knowledge or publish papers that create value. Knowledge and information that is the result of tremendous efforts set forth in the universities must find its way into the markets, and must not be left on the shelves of the libraries. Bearing this in mind, the Ministry has undergone a transformation process in 2011. Both the title and the responsibility areas of the Ministry have changed. The Ministry focuses on both academia and industry. Providing mechanisms for industry-university collaboration is one of our major tasks. Enhancing the quality of universities and bridging the gap between them and industry is a great challenge that we ambitiously strive to overcome. The Innovative and Entrepreneur Universities Index is a quantitative and concrete instrument for measuring the innovation capacity of universities in Turkey. Until 2002, there were only two technoparks in Turkey. Today, there are 50 technoparks, of which 34 are operational. A performance index pertaining to these technoparks has also been prepared and announced. The enterprising company of the Informatics Valley, a specialized technopark, has been established. Many companies are expected to carry out their operations in Informatics Valley. The Law of Technology Development Regions offers many incentives, support mechanisms, and various exemptions to companies and academics that operate in those regions. The Techno-Entrepreneurship Capital Support Program and Industrial Thesis Program are two very important instruments delivered by the Ministry. The new Patent Law has introduced significant arrangements concerning the promotion of university-industry collaboration. Universities will now be able to own patents and generate income from their licensed products. Academics who are the inventors of products will also have a share of at least 30% of the patent rights. Our main target is to ensure that the universities undertake the main role in this endeavor.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Turkey as a location for foreign investors to base their manufacturing operations?</h4><p>Turkey is distinguished from its neighboring countries in many ways. There is political stability in Turkey, and there has been continuous growth for almost 10 years. Turkey has even become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. It has clearly demonstrated its determination to regulate the banking system and stated that there would be zero tolerance of any factor that would deteriorate fiscal discipline. There will be no concessions from the fiscal policies that have been implemented in the last decade. Such strict policies are indeed behind the relatively low impact of the global financial crisis on Turkey. Political stability enables swift decision-making and implementation. Macro economic balance and political stability are two very important benchmarks for foreign investors. Turkey offers very attractive opportunities to foreign investors thanks to its well-functioning democracy, well-educated labor force, and a decreasing amount of red tape in bureaucracy. Surrounded by seas on three sides, Turkey is an advanced country in terms of transportation means, energy resources, and industrial infrastructure. Turkey is a three- or four-hour flight away from the most important trade centers in the world. Countries in the Caucasus, Middle East, and Africa, which bear great potential, are also very close to Turkey and we hold cultural and historical bonds with these countries. Trade volume between Turkey and those countries increases everyday. There are railway links from Turkey into Central and Eastern European countries. To support investors, state incentives were updated in 2012 and state aid has reached a noteworthy level compared to many countries in the world. Tax advantages, advantages on customs duties, state contributions to insurance premiums, free allocation of parcels for investments, support on credit interests, and covering the corporate tax received over income of the employees are important components of the new incentive package. In addition to these, the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology along with its affiliated bodies offers up to 60% grants in cash. In terms of tax rates, Turkey is one of the countries with the lowest rates. Free zones are created to promote exports from Turkey. The production in those free zones is exempt from all kinds of taxes. Specific regions are established to promote technology and R&amp;D. Tax advantages are introduced over the income that is generated in those regions, and the cost of employees for employers has been reduced to a minimum level. Similarly, in order to ensure efficiency, promote clusters, and provide common solutions to the problems of industry, Organized Industrial Zones (OIZs) have been established. Companies that are located within the OIZs are exempt from several taxes and operate free of all the bureaucratic procedures. Moreover, companies that are established within these zones enjoy better state incentives. Turkey holds a significant internal market potential with its population of 75 million people. Purchasing power is increasing. Turkey is emerging as an attractive country with its domestic market and easy access to a population of 1.5 billion people in Europe, Eurasia, the Middle East, and North Africa.</p><div class="quote">“We strive to promote innovation and entrepreneurship based on technology as well as collaboration between universities and industry.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of Ekol Logistics?<br></h4><p>Ekol is a traditional family company that goes back 22 years. Ekol is built on “heart and technology." It started as a services company with its main goal being to focus on our customers' needs. The ultimate objective was to serve the customer at all costs, literally. Ekol is a brand name that can and will prevail as a leader across the region and Europe. Ekol employs more than 5,400 people and has annual revenues of ‚¬300 million. We have 1,200 people working internationally and more than 4,200 in Turkey. Ekol is not just a logistics company or a warehouse provider. Ekol is a multicultural, international, Turkish-based, integrated, logistics-solution provider. Those we serve can continue with their business while we provide what I call the “neurological background." Our clients do what they do best, and Ekol will add value to that by ensuring their product is handled, managed, and delivered wherever and whenever. As a company, we have certain strategic advantages.</p><h4>How important is technology and R&amp;D?</h4><p>Ekol is the only company in the sector that develops and produces its own software. We have more than 60 experts whose job is to translate our know-how into software so we can best serve the needs of the customer, often creating tailor-made solutions. The importance we give to technology has helped us to win an award from the Ministry of Science and Technology as the first—and only—R&amp;D company in the logistics sector. Today, we have PhD students and engineers working with us, creating new programs and systems to serve our company and the sector. To receive such an award means we have become the older brother in the industry; the one responsible for generating new technologies. Another advantage is that we receive certain tax breaks and incentives due to our R&amp;D efforts and investments. The sectors we are most active include textiles, automotive, pharmaceuticals, and the rapidly growing e-commerce sector. These are all very sensitive industries, and require serious care and handling. Ekol's team of experts is working on a number of projects, including software and systems development. We are trying to eliminate as many non-value-adding elements as possible. We want to develop an efficient and sustainable service. The combination of youth, energy, and innovation is our strength.</p><h4>How would you characterize Ekol's expansion strategy in Europe?</h4><p>Our vision from day one was to be a top brand, not only at home but in the EU as well. In 1996, we opened our first consolidation center in Germany. We have been a dominant force in Central Europe ever since. Now, with the addition of our centers in Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, France, Italy, and Scandinavia, the company has truly become European. In Romania, we have local drivers and number plates, in Greece we have two headquarters with Greek employees, and in Italy and Bosnia the same too. They are small teams, but up and coming. Today, we are the fastest growing company in our region, and a fast-growing company in Europe too. We recently joined the CargoLine Logistics Network, and we are the only Turkish company to do so. We believe in building strategic alliances. We have always been keen on associating with international organizations and networks. CargoLine will give Ekol several inroads into new business opportunities. I believe it will be a real success.</p><h4>How does Ekol work to integrate environmentally friendly practices into its business?</h4><p>When we were building our headquarters, there was a tree that needed cutting down; however, we decided to keep it and build around it. Today, the tree remains in the middle of our building. At Ekol, we have always placed great importance on the environment since day one. We try to save as many kilometers on each logistical route as possible. We have saved the equivalent of 750 football fields worth of forests, and more than 3 million liters of carbon dioxide emissions. That is green.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Turkey for Lufthansa as a global airline group?<br></h4><p>Germany and Turkey have a long and solid relationship. It started in the 1950s with flights to Istanbul, which was the first Turkish destination for Lufthansa. That continued with flights to Ankara and Izmir, and now we also have flights to Antalya in summer as well. Turkey is currently the only country in Europe that has large GDP growth, and the airline business is growing as well. Lufthansa Group is a proud part of that. The country is very important for the Lufthansa Group—not just Lufthansa—because we also partnered with Swiss and Austrian airlines. We would like to increase our flights, frequencies, and even passenger figures in the coming years. In Turkey, we have many ongoing projects with the German and Turkish governments. The German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, came to Istanbul in 2012 to observe its strong connection with Germany.</p><h4>How do Lufthansa's operations in Turkey fit into the global Lufthansa strategy?</h4><p>Lufthansa Group, including Swiss International and Austrian Airlines, provide excellent connections via home hubs in Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna, and Zurich. Our goal for the upcoming years is clear; we would like to increase our share in the Turkish market. The company's strategy is to continue to be Europe's number one airline with our premium services. Lufthansa has long-lasting experience of providing exclusive premium services, giving its customers the freedom of ultimate relaxation and peace of mind whether on board or on the ground. Worldwide, 60 state-of-the-art lounges with a total space of 38,000 sqm invite customers to relax and escape the busy atmosphere at airports. Furthermore, a vast number of on-board service initiatives featuring carefully selected wines and dishes created by top chefs, the widest first-class bed in the industry, as well as a state-of-the-art fully flat business class seats make Lufthansa one of the leading premium airlines. In 2012, we almost reached the 1 million passenger mark in Turkey. We launched summer flights from Istanbul to Berlin, which are not open in the winter yet, but we are hoping to open those in 2013 as well. We are also considering flights from Ankara to Berlin, but those have not been confirmed.</p><h4>How would you characterize the advantages and disadvantages of Istanbul as an air-travel hub?</h4><p>Istanbul's biggest advantage is its geographical location. It is quite close to the Far East, but it is not too far from North America. However, infrastructure in Istanbul is a problem. The traffic to the airports is really challenging. You might get stuck in a traffic jam that lasts half the length of the flight time to Frankfurt. This is a disadvantage for local travellers as well for cargo. Atatürk International Airport is quite an overcrowded airport, from the travel side as well as on the runway. Sabiha Gökçen is a more modern airport, but it is far away from the city center. There are two international airports in the city, but we just need one airport with modern facilities, strong infrastructure, and room for growth.</p><h4>How does Lufthansa stay competitive in Turkey?</h4><p>I quickly learned that Turkish people love to eat. Lufthansa is changing its food and beverage menu to include more local food as of January 1, 2013 in business class. We will do this for three months, then switch back and review feedback and make a decision from there. We are trying to make the food less Western and more Turkish, so we decided to work with a well-known Turkish chef. We always have a very famous chef working on our European and international flights. Lufthansa is always looking for other famous chefs, and it will be no different on our Turkey flights. The food and beverage menu is probably one of the most important things to change. It is very important that you have good, quality food to enjoy on your flight because the passengers remember it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Trump Towers Istanbul within the global Trump real estate portfolio?</h4><p>Istanbul is among the leading cities of the world owing to its history. Throughout its history, kingdoms and empires fought fiercely with one another in an effort to rule the city. Istanbul is a magical city in every aspect. Trump is one of the most important brands in global real estate. Trump Towers Istanbul is the first project of its kind here by Trump International, one of the leading real estate development and operation companies in the world. Trump International preferred Istanbul as the first location in Europe because the city has always been a symbol of development, advancement, and energy thanks to its amazing historical texture. The cooperation between Trump and Doğan Holding presented one of the most valuable development projects to the most priceless cities of the world. At the moment, Trump Towers Istanbul is at heart of the city with all of its glory and modern face. Doğan Holding, which brought Trump to Istanbul, is one of Turkey's most important holdings. So, when you have those three brands together—Trump, Doğan, and of course Istanbul—you are on the right track. Trump Towers is a $400 million project. It is right in the middle of Istanbul, and it is comprised of towers, residences, offices, and a mall. The project really stands out because it has got the Trump brand on it. There is one Trump Tower in the US and one in Turkey, and that is it. I think that is very significant. Trump International paid close attention to all the details of Trump Istanbul, from technical aspects to architecture. Today, one can feel all glory of the international Trump brand at every point of Trump Istanbul as it is an extremely important project.</p><h4>Do you think this indicates that Istanbul is becoming an important brand in international real estate?</h4><p>Definitely. Istanbul is a world city and is among the top cities for the foreign investors in the arena of international real estate. As you know, the Turkish economy has been growing rapidly and has been very stable over the last 10 years. The current government is committed to restructuring the economy and also to changing the architectural topography and feel of the city. It is a process they call “urban transformation," involving the building of solid, modern, well-constructed, and aesthetically pleasing new buildings throughout Istanbul. Turkey offers a lot of investment opportunities in this regard. Today, the real estate sector is one of the driving forces of the Turkish economy. The government has undertaken serious efforts to attract foreign investors to the Turkish real estate sector, including the new Reciprocity Law, which enables foreigners to own property in Turkey. I think this will lead to a boom in the Turkish real estate sector as more foreigners invest in land, residences, offices, and other buildings. The government is 100% committed to this process. Other projects such as the Istanbul Finance Center, new financial and residential investments in places like Ataşehir and Maslak, the third airport, the third Bosphorus bridge, and various ongoing infrastructural projects all mean that Istanbul is fast becoming a brand name, not just in terms of real estate, but overall as a global city. Existing developments will carry the Turkish real estate industry to a very prominent position in the international market. Istanbul is being publicized in the international arena, which bears its fruit in a very short time. Our top priority should be a continuation of these public efforts at a higher magnitude. Nowadays, the government as well as associations and companies have been offering infinite support to these publicity efforts. We will create opportunities to introduce the Turkish real estate market to foreign investors in the best way possible. In the comfort zone of political and economic stability, a negative situation is not likely to arise when we show the magnificence and beauty of Istanbul.</p><h4>Who are your main clients in terms of residents?</h4><p>As of July 2013, 75% of the offices in Trump Towers have already been rented out. Our clients are both locals and international clients. Everyone knows the Trump name, and that is a great advantage in terms of attracting potential clients. When it comes to residences, 70% have been sold already, 20% of them to foreigners. We are promoting our brand especially in countries like Russia, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, and the UAE. We need to appeal to those relatively wealthy markets.</p><div class="quote">“The real estate sector is one of the driving forces of the Turkish economy."</div><h4>What are the benefits of Trump Towers as a place to live and work?</h4><p>We have 204 residences, 70% of which have been sold. These are A+ residences, which are top quality. Trump Towers Istanbul is an ultra luxurious project rising in the heart of Istanbul. It is composed of a triple concept: residence, office, and mall. Trump Towers Istanbul promises a different life experience, a brand new lifestyle with its iconic architecture, authentic interior design, advanced technological features, and the very special services it offers. Each apartment offers an authentic style. Apartments sizes range between 94 sqm and 686 sqm, and they are a place where comfort and peace meets Trump quality and service understanding. Apartments planned as a glass facade from the ceiling to the floor bring Istanbul and Bosphorus scenes and the pleasure of life at high standards together. Trump Tower Residence exhibits its difference with the services it offers. White glove concierge service meets any request from the residence occupants instantly on a 24/7 basis with its professional team. Owing to the butler and valet service, it is possible to organize everything from shopping orders to the payment of bills, from hotel, flight, restaurant, or concert bookings to invitations on lounge floors. Trump Towers Residence features the first and only wine cellar in Turkey conforming to European standards. Each apartment has its own private wine cellar for 70 bottles. In the cellar there is a total capacity for 16,800 bottles, and residents can host their guests and organize wine tasting days. The occupants of Trump Towers Residence also experience the privilege of Trump Shopping Mall, one of the most elegant shopping malls in Istanbul. Indispensable items of social life such as entertainment alternatives, food and beverage areas, cinema, theater stage, exhibition hall, and a special kids' floor are available at Trump Shopping Mall, where the best local and foreign brands are in service. The occupants of the residence can emerge from their apartments and enter the colorful world of Trump Shopping Mall by simply using an elevator. Located in the hub of Istanbul, Trump Towers enjoys ease of transportation due to subway and Metrobus connections. The residents can get to Levent or Taksim from Mecidiyeköy in only 10 minutes amidst the traffic jam of Istanbul.</p><h4>What is the appeal of Istanbul as a destination for international real estate investors?</h4><p>It is definitely a center of attraction for foreign investors. Political and economic stability as well as improved ratings from credit rating institutions are moving us higher up the list of countries with a compelling investment story. Foreign investors have a quite dense presence in Istanbul through joint ventures, acquisitions, or totally new projects. It is obvious that such interest will further increase following  legislative reforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Successful Strategy in Turkey]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[successful-strategy-in-turkey]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Aerium entered the Turkish market in 2005. What was the strategy behind this decision?</h4><p>Coming to Turkey in 2005 was part of a strategy we had to expand globally. We saw new markets opening up, and this was an important window of opportunity for us. First movers have a better chance of succeeding in a market, particularly in retail real estate, because you can secure the best locations for shopping centers and retailers such as hypermarkets, which is crucial for their success. I have seen this play out from experience over the years through our work in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania—markets that were not exactly emerging but were new markets for French investors. Turkey was one of the countries we were looking at very strongly with regards to demographics, growth capacity, and its dynamic government. When we started to invest in Turkey, our strategy was to become a long-term investor. We never expected to come to this market, buy an asset, and exit like opportunistic investors do. We had a long-term vision to be part of the shopping center industry in Turkey and take advantage of the huge potential of the retail sector at that time. We were one of the first global funds to enter Turkey by investing in the Carrefour malls portfolio, as well as in CEFIC, the Turkish leader of property and leasing management activities, in a joint venture with Simon Property Group and Ivanhoe. We wanted to achieve the best value creation for our fund and for our investors. One of the major difficulties in emerging markets is a lack of experience and expertise. A key factor of our success in Turkey was vertically providing high standards and integrating all the different stages of management, from the bottom to the top. This integration and control of activities has been crucial, as has creating a high efficiency and, above all, creating value. You can't just be an investor; you have to be a global actor in a country and consider yourself as an active local actor. Like other major shopping center specialists such as Multi, Redevco, and Corio, you have to be close to the community, the customers, and the partners and directly control your marketing, leasing, and management teams—this is considered as a key factor for success. With a team of over 100 people, we are one of the leaders of the shopping center sector in Turkey with over $2 billion in assets under management and over $2 billion worth of projects under development.</p><h4>How did Aerium's strategy enable it to continue its success through the recent crisis?</h4><p>Following the fallout from the financial crisis and the debt crunch, our industry has undergone a structural transformation. These changes enabled Aerium to identify clear trends and opportunities in specific markets and sectors, on which we placed all our efforts and focus. This resulted in a very successful investment and development strategy during the last 10 years. In 2009, we invested over ‚¬200 million in the middle of the crisis period and extended or renovated our portfolio of shopping centers in Turkey and Europe, with a considerable impact on the performance and value-added of our assets. Our specialization in the office and retail investment and development sectors in Europe secured our leading position and enabled our group to identify and source high-quality assets for our investors. We position ourselves as a traditional investment manager, but also as an expert in the fields of retail and commercial real estate. In the market, we are recognized as a niche player. When most of our competitors were looking at downsizing and outsourcing to reduce costs, we positioned our group as a full-service Real Estate Investment Manager (REIM). We enjoy excellent relationships with international retailers and corporate tenants throughout Europe and Turkey. We are always available and ready to assist them in their future expansion. We are proud to have achieved, despite the financial and eurozone crises, one of the best track records of investment management efficiency for our equity partners and shareholders.</p><h4>How would you characterize the environment for foreign investors in the local real estate market, and what can Turkey do to attract further investment?</h4><p>Fitch Ratings upgraded Turkey to investment grade on November 5, 2012, a move long coveted by Ankara, citing  underlying strengths and an easing in near-term risks for the economy. The transparency and business environment in Turkey have improved significantly thanks to the strong, prudent, and stable government. The Turkish government has enacted new regulations regarding reciprocity for owning real estate in Turkey by foreigners, which has definitely had a positive impact, especially on the residential market. However, there are still uncertainties, especially about urban planning, government taxes, and regulatory policies. Several retail and shopping center organizations and councils are collaborating with the authorities regarding new regulations for the improvement and sustainability of the shopping center sector. We trust that the Turkish government will consider the opinions of these prominent organizations in order to preserve and promote the growth and sustainability of investment in the country.</p><h4>How would you characterize the outlook for the retail real estate sector in Turkey?</h4><p>At the end of 2012, there were some 313 shopping centers in Turkey, representing over 8.1 million sqm, ‚¬75 billion in retail turnover, and 50,000 sales points. Total private consumption expenditure was over $600 billion in 2012. With a population of 75 million and an average age of 28.5 years, Turkey has the youngest and second largest population in Europe. Its 25 million strong labor force places it fourth in Europe. Each year, 450,000 graduates emerge from Turkey's 161 universities. The unemployment rate is stable and decreasing, and was under 9% in 2012. Turkey went through an unstable period between 1990 and 2001 due to international and domestic crises. The post-crisis period was shaped by fantastic stability and growth for all sectors of the economy, and particularly modern retail and shopping centers. Today, Turkey has the second highest gross leasable area (GLA) in the pipeline in Europe after Russia, representing over 3 million sqm over the next three years and focused mainly on Ankara and Istanbul. Turkey ranks 10th in global retail sector sales and stands seventh in Europe. Retail sales increased 15% in the first half of 2012 compared to 2011. The total size of the Turkish retail market is expected to reach $313 billon in 2012, while average annual growth is projected at 10% up until 2016. Over the next 10 years, my vision of Turkey is that we are moving from a strong development market to a high-potential investment market. Just as a plane has to reach the right altitude to fly, Turkey is now reaching the right moment to soar. We have to keep the industry at the top of its game and pilot our centers through turbulence over the next few years. Turkey will reach, regarding retail development, saturation in some cities in the next 10 years; some weak centers will close with the arrival of the stronger malls. The older first-generation malls will have to be refurbished or extended. Some will die and the new generation will take their place; others will keep their market share with smart management. Investors will have some great opportunities to get into the sector as regulations become more streamlined. The next 10 years will be a very promising and exciting time in Turkey for the retail and shopping center sectors. The market is moving from the development to the investment cycle, and from an emerging to mature situation. The quality and attractiveness of the assets and particularly their management will be key to distinguishing the centers from the competition. The door is now open for US, Middle Eastern, and European funds to come to Turkey and take a position in one of the world's most dynamic markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Paksoy leverage its experience and reputation to provide the most innovative and expert advice for its clients?<br></h4><p>Our experience and reputation creates value for clients because we focus on solutions and on what the client receives from our contribution to their business. We are aware of our strengths and what clients expect and don't expect from us; therefore, we put emphasis on value rather than costs and time. We emphasize our differentiation from our competition in terms of solutions and bring problem-solvers instead of specific products, services, or expertise.</p><h4>How will the new Capital Markets Law affect the regulatory environment for investors?</h4><p>There are several driving forces behind the preparation of a new Capital Markets Law. Among them, the most important ones are the alignment of Turkish capital markets law with the European Union acquis communautaire, the reflection of changes introduced by the new Turkish Commercial Code into the capital markets' legislation, the update of the outdated capital markets law with new concepts, and the experience gained over the recent years of economic crises. Fortunately, all these targets are met to a significant extent and, as a result, we may say that with the new Capital Markets Law, the capital markets will be more transparent. The capital markets' entities will be more trustworthy, efficient, and financially stable; the markets' infrastructure will be close to its globally known equivalents, the capital markets will be easily accessible, and, most importantly, investors will be well protected and safer than before.</p><h4>How would you characterize the regulatory environment for foreign investors in Turkey?</h4><p>In the last decade, Turkey has adopted an investor-friendly attitude to all foreign and domestic businesses, having ratified significant legal and regulatory changes. These include the liberalization of markets, easing red tape, reducing formalities, marshaling the procedures in setting up companies, as well as improving corporate governance rules. The Turkish government, along with regulators in telecommunications, media, securities, and banking, issued quite a lot of regulations and took measures aligned with EU standards to ensure and oversee a reliable, predictable, transparent, and efficient legal and regulatory landscape for investors. These were very positive steps aimed at improving the country's investment environment in a vast array of sectors, thus fostering a palpable increase in foreign direct investment flows.</p><div class="quote">“The first half of 2013 has proven to be very positive with increasing activity in M&amp;A."</div><h4>In which sectors do you expect to see the greatest amount of interest from foreign investors over the coming year?</h4><p>Energy, health care, media, as well as financial services, including insurance, pension, and asset management, will continue to see an increased amount of interest from foreign investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for international investment and M&amp;A activity in Turkey over the coming year?</h4><p>The first half of 2013 has proven to be very positive with increasing activity in M&amp;A, despite the financial and political predicament in eurozone countries, which include Turkey's main trading partners such as Greece, Italy, and Spain. I expect more M&amp;A activity by private equity and strategic investors, particularly from China, Korea, and Japan, in the second half of the year with more focus on energy, infrastructure, financial services, and  health care.</p><h4>What advice would you offer for foreign companies looking to invest in Turkey?</h4><p>I would say there are a lot of opportunities, ample investment, and potential growth areas in Turkey that provide a friendly investment climate to foreign investors. It is time to explore these opportunities by investing in this country. When doing so, they need to reach competent, experienced, and innovative advisors and lawyers who can add value to their investments and act along with them in providing solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Türk Traktör grown and developed in Turkey's agricultural machinery sector since its foundation?</h4><p>Türk Traktör was established 65 years ago as an engine manufacturing company for airplanes; however, in 1954, the Turkish government re-established the company as a tractor manufacturer. In 1963, Türk Traktör started manufacturing tractors in Turkey under the Fiat license. The ownership of the company in 1998 was shared between Koç Group and Case New Holland (CNH) Group, a Fiat Group company. Both partners ended up with the same shareholding at 37.5%, the remaining being on the stock exchange since 2004. The decision by Fiat and Koç to invest in Turkey is due to the fact that this is one of the largest markets worldwide for tractors. In fact, it is the fifth largest in the world after India, China, the US, and Pakistan. Until 2008, Fiat and Koç had another venture called Trakmak, which handled local sales and marketing operations for the Turkish domestic market. In 2008, Trakmak and Türk Traktör merged, making Türk Traktör both responsible for the manufacture and sale of the tractors produced locally, as well as the importation and distribution of tractors and agricultural machinery imported from CNH Group. The locally produced tractor range covers engine sizes from 48 hp to 110 hp, which accounts for 98% of Turkey's domestic tractor demand. Türk Traktör is the longest-serving and most established company, and has a market share exceeding 50%.</p><h4>How does being a larger manufacturer distinguish Türk Traktör?</h4><p>Much like companies within the automotive sector, Türk Traktör manufactures a large portion of its tractor components, which is peculiar for Turkish industry. Another advantage is that Turkey has a lower cost of production compared to other countries, thereby making overall prices competitively low. Fiat's agricultural division, CNH, has plants all over the world, and many of them procure parts from Turkey, directly or indirectly. Being able to manufacture in-house presents great advantages in the areas of cost and potential technological development. For example, by controlling the production of engines and drivelines—the most important parts of a tractor—the company is managing the potential for technological innovation while creating product variations to fit market needs. We have five different families of products manufactured at our plant that allow us a wider scope of control and a greater reactivity to changes in demand.</p><h4>To what extent does Turkey's domestic agricultural sector determine the way you design and manufacture your tractors?</h4><p>It does not make much sense to manufacture tractors solely for export. The domestic base's volume of sales is contingent upon levels of investment. It is nice to have CNH Group take over certain parts of our tractors, but this is hardly an issue to the farmer in the field. We send our people to the field and have them watch the production output of our tractors. Turkey is diversified in terms of crops and microclimates. It is a wonderful place to test tractors. Certain parts look like Central Europe in terms of agricultural climate, but, in the southeast, for example, you can grow produce atypical to the region, such as bananas. There are few places of this size where you can have such variety. For this reason, developing a tractor for the Turkish market is the most sensible course of action. In fact, we recently changed the way we developed tractors. We are pushing our R&amp;D department to enlarge our range and offer more. Through the evolution of the regulation in Turkey for tractors, we are reaching a standard that allows us to supply products to Western countries, growing our export business.</p><h4>What is the role of exports in your business, and how do you tailor products to different export markets?</h4><p>Exports have always been one of our main focuses. Along with many other firsts in our past, we were the first company in the Turkish automotive sector that exported to the US. We are currently in business with over 90 different countries, which is challenging. This is why it is convenient for us to have CNH Group analyzing customer needs in order to demonstrate to us the nature of the international market. We develop tractors for the Turkish market along standards very similar to those in Europe. Since Turkey adopted European regulations in machinery production—engine emissions, noise, and safety, for example—Turkish tractors are almost totally aligned with those made in Europe. There is a slight difference in our emission levels that should be solved within the next few years, but we do not have to change noise emissions to send our products to Europe, for example. Other countries have had to change their manufacturing standards prior to export. Tractors in Turkey have been export-ready since the beginning.</p><h4>How important are your R&amp;D operations and how would you characterize Turkey as a base for R&amp;D?</h4><p>Typically, tractor groups make either tractors or components. It is unusual for a group to create both under the same roof. Because we do this, we act as a center for CNH Group. We are also designing newer generations of engines, as well as tractor cabs. For CNH Group, this is very convenient because it is receiving a genuinely good product from a trusted producer. The R&amp;D potential in Turkey is still young compared to other countries in the world. However, there is a lot of commitment from the government to develop the sector by providing support through incentives and energy. Turkish engineers and developers are very hard working and committed to their projects. You can challenge them to hit certain deadlines and deliver certain targets, and they put a lot of energy into achieving them. We might not have all of the sophisticated, tested methodologies that European countries utilize, but we have a good understanding of technology and speed.</p><h4>As Türk Traktör begins to play a larger role in developing and producing its tractors, what is your outlook for the next decade?</h4><p>We are not only creating more tractors, but more areas of tractor production. As well as producing the engine, transmission, and overall vehicle, we have begun manufacturing axles. We are completely extending our coverage of the tractor as a concept. On top of that, the tractor itself is evolving. We are seeing the varying stages of its evolution in the context of mechanics, hydraulics, and electronic components. We have started including more hydraulics in our transmissions, which offers farmers more comfort. However, at this stage, it is not economical to aggressively inject new and sophisticated technology into our tractors. In 10 years, I hope that farmers will be affluent enough to afford newer technology and therefore render them as standard in tractor production. Hopefully, we will be expanding beyond the tractor itself, using technological know-how and manufacturing capacity to produce all angles of a tractor. Through these, we can potentially be more successful than if we were to continue importing parts from other suppliers. This will also help Türk Traktör extend its research in terms of exports and stabilized production.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dual-nature]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bilgi University grown and developed since it was founded?</h4><p>Bilgi was one of the first in the second wave of universities founded in Turkey. Its story goes back a bit further to the time of private universities, because private universities were not allowed to set up. Initially, the school was set up as a private university that was doing dual-degrees with UK universities. It was established by nine founders who were not entrepreneurs; they were simply in love with education. They wanted to set up a university in Istanbul to introduce a synergy between the poorly served neighborhoods and wealthy students. It serves the A+ to A category in terms of non-scholarship students. Since 2009, we have been a very highly perceived social science university. Because of the competition in mass education, we decided to become a fully comprehensive, national university rather than an Istanbul city university. We added engineering, architecture, health sciences, and many Master's and PhD degrees. For the first time in Turkey, we created a bilateral exchange agreement with the University of Liverpool in the UK. We were the first to do so in a foundation university. And we were the first to do a 3+1 degree in Turkey, where you study three years here and spend your final year in the UK, ultimately receiving two accredited degrees. It was a major accomplishment. We have seven such degrees available now, and we want to grow in that area.</p><h4>Bilgi University is spread across three campuses in underprivileged areas of the city. What was the motivation for organizing the university this way?</h4><p>The motivation is very simple. Universities in developing countries need to be part of the process of the equal distribution of income and opportunities. That is how we started in terms of our thinking. Therefore, in order to get these neighborhoods involved, we need to be in them. Many schools are in the better neighborhoods, and they try to visit the less fortunate neighborhoods. We find it better to be physically in the area, so we can best serve the needs of the neighborhood. When I say “we," I refer to both the academic students and the staff who are aware of Turkey's greater problems rather than just the problems on the street. That is why we went in with that concept and it worked. Bilgi was initially criticized regarding security concerns, but it has not had a single major incident. We try to serve not just the student population, but also the entire population of these neighborhoods. We have a law clinic that provides free legal services. We try to provide for local educational needs and even food needs to an extent. It is not endless, but we do what we can. In addition, Bilgi has educational services for youths and young adults. Whether through vocational, language, art, or performing art classes, they have the privilege of paying a low tuition fee to attend if they are able to get into the university through the entrance exam.</p><h4>What should Turkey do to increase participation in post-secondary education?</h4><p>I think that the Turkish government understands the need to address the youth problem first, and employability second. The government started the demassification process in 2007 when it doubled the size of universities in Turkey. At first, it did this through public means, though there is only so much that can be done by raising taxes. The government stopped at 103 universities. Then, it began to increase establishment approvals to found new universities—the number went from an initial 23 to 65 universities today, and up to 70 as we speak. There were 173 universities in 2012 compared to 80 in 2007. Of course, there are going to be ups and downs, and problems with the new schools—and even with the old schools—but eventually we will find a way to create opportunities for more university graduates. The third phase is going to be the privatization of education. Private education is coming. There is a debate because the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) has announced that it would like to have international branches, but because of past problems in the Middle East during the economic crisis, they may be allowed to partner up with institutions here. Once that goes through, I think there will be another five-year cycle before the demand and supply problem will be solved.</p><h4>Why is Turkey such a large exporter of students?</h4><p>In terms of exporting students versus importing students, we have a big deficit. Turkey is one of the top seven countries that send students abroad. Malaysia has a population of 34 million and it imports 80,000 full tuition-paying students. Turkey is over double the size of Malaysia, but we are only importing one-third of that at 24,000, and 9,000 are on full scholarship from the Turkic countries of the CIS. I believe this caught Prime Minister Erdoğan's attention, and through the association we had and through the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) we jointly worked on developing incentives to bring international students to Turkey. Now, there is actually a high-targeted market that would put us at number five in the world. There is a target, by 2023, to bring 250,000 international students to Turkey. Of course, this will require major reforms related to teaching, instruction, language, quality, accommodation, and transport.</p><h4>Is it a priority for Turkey to attract more international students?</h4><p>For private universities here, it is a business opportunity. Eventually, supply and demand might become an issue. If you look at North Cyprus, its universities are surviving through the attraction of international students. It was a problem for them when Turkish students stopped attending and they had to solve this issue. I think it will become a problem for Turkey, and not just for that purpose but because of diversification as well. I think the chalk will be picked up by the private side rather than the state. The established schools in the three major cities will have to pursue this initiative, and of course they will gain tuition out of it; education is not going to be free for international students. Furthermore, I believe it will present an opportunity to have the classroom in a better environment. There will be different languages of instruction, and I think the one thing that the country needs more of is English speakers. Even though people in the major cities do speak English, it is not at the standard that you need if you want to be an international player. If you want to be in the top-10 largest economies, you need to have these tools in place.</p><h4>How would you assess the ability of Turkey's secondary education system to prepare students for the workforce?</h4><p>I think there is a lot of work to do. The system is young, universities are still being established, and because of the absence of competition, the level of innovation is low. Now, there is more competition—not just between each other, but with the state as well, because we are going after the same students. The problem is that in the demassification phase there are many new universities in the system. Even Bilgi, a 16-year old institution, is seen as an old institution, which should not be the case. We need a much longer cycle to become regarded as a “real" university in essence. Turkish secondary education is now crawling up, taking time to develop. We started walking and are now we are running, and that is the best way to describe it. There will be some institutions that stand out, but as an entire system we need to go through that cycle. That is why many Turkish students go abroad to university; to buy the education that is better outside and then come back to Turkey. That will change in time with the introduction of more dual degrees. However, it will also take time to get a qualified workforce coming through. The government has marked a target of 2023 as the year that Turkish secondary education should be sufficiently reformed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Turkey's progress toward reaching its Vision 2023 goal of 50 million arrivals in Turkey?</h4><p>With the development that Turkey has undergone in the last 10 years, our country has become one of the stars of international tourism. This isn't just good news for us at the Ministry—it is also something that motivates and inspires the entire sector. The biggest goal in our 2023 Tourism Strategy is to reach 50 million visitors and attain tourism revenues of $50 billion a year. The requisite potential and infrastructure is already in place for us to realize that objective. As long as we use this potential well, I believe there will be no obstacles in our path. However, I believe that we don't even need to aim for 2023, and we can reach these figures even sooner. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism is a civil ministry that has intimate ties with investors, representatives, and businesses throughout the sector. If we maintain these strong ties, we can reach our goals sooner. Our united aim is to improve and exalt our country's image in the fields of culture and tourism.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to promote a wider variety of tourism?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the world's dominant economic sectors. Because we live in a place with a rich history, geography, and culture, we are one of the principal countries in this sector. Our rapid rise in the tourism sector has focused a lot of attention on our country. This isn't just true of the tourism field, but also in politics, economics, and foreign policy. Considering the international arena, there's an ongoing economic and political shift on the world stage. Within this shift, Turkey is becoming a source of inspiration for other countries. As things are, it's not enough to simply develop our tourism industry and renew and reorganize our strategies. That's why I've stated that what we have to do is protect our well-earned accomplishments and reinvent tourism. In this way, I believe that we will create a chain reaction of rapid development in tourism, the economy, foreign policy, education, and health. This interconnected development will also help create a more diversified tourism sector.</p><h4>How would you characterize the significance of tourism revenues for Turkey's economy?</h4><p>Tourism revenue is a very important issue for countries that have realized the value of the sector. As you know, tourism isn't just sun, sand, and sea. It's something that incorporates all aspects of a society, a sector in which the smallest stone or even a single individual can contribute added value. This inclusiveness also makes tourism indispensable for our economy. Tourism is a valuable source of hard currency. We are working hard to develop and diversify the sector with this in mind. Today, new methods are employed in the calculation of tourism revenue. We now have results that are more comprehensive and real. Tourism has advanced beyond being just a means for increasing our national income or improving economic standards; it's now become a strategic sector for our future.</p><div class="quote">“Our rapid rise in the tourism sector has focused a lot of attention on our country."</div><h4>What steps is Turkey taking to balance economic growth with the protection of its resources?</h4><p>Turkey is full of cultural, historical, and natural riches, and our aim is to protect and pass these treasures down as a national inheritance for future generations. We don't want to think of cultural tourism as merely a consumer sector. To think of cultural tourism as a consumer good would be detrimental to our efforts to foster the identity of us being a nation of culture and would also be detrimental to the inherent dynamics of the tourism sector overall. The promotion of our culture has a major impact on our tourism sector. The human diplomacy that tourism also encapsulates strengthens our standing as a cultural state. Our main aim is to strengthen and expand our image internationally. By attaching the necessary importance and value to our culture, which arouses admiration throughout the world, we will increase its share in the development of the sector and, as a result, our overall economy. We are also working to attract producers to our country through such policies as refunding VAT, for  example.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Law No. 6306, “Law Concerning the Transformation of Areas Under Threat of Natural Disaster," has instigated a nationwide urban transformation project that gives priority to provinces in the first and second earthquake-risk zones. Due to our country's geography, climate, and topography, Turkey is frequently at risk of natural disasters. Natural disasters lead to serious loss both in human lives and economic output. Earthquakes are the main threat among the various natural disasters that our country faces. Our cities have often been built with little-to-no long-term planning, and, unfortunately, the majority of our urban structures are of poor quality against the threat of natural disasters. That is why we have experienced serious loss of life and property damage in the face of natural disasters in the past. In the last century, Turkey has experienced 300 deadly earthquakes, leading to a total of approximately 100,000 lives lost, 180,000 injuries, and over half a million destroyed homes. Article 56 of the Constitution states, “Every citizen has the right to live in a healthy and balanced environment, and developing the environment is the responsibility of the state and citizens." Article 57 states, “The state has a responsibility to develop a strategy to provide for housing needs that take the characteristics of cities and environmental factors into consideration." This is why, having learned from our previous experience in dealing with urban transformation projects, we have made a detailed analysis of the relevant legislation and consulted the necessary institutions to create and apply Law No. 6306. The main objective of this law is to “transform areas under risk of natural disaster, demolish existing unsound structures, and create safe and livable urban areas throughout the country." This law gives priority to a person's right to life, and aims to provide maximum security of life and property. This is why urban transformation is such a priority for Turkey. This project will be carried out nationwide, encapsulating a $400 billion economic tableau. With such a major urban renewal initiative, we will naturally see major activity in the construction sector and supply industries that feed the construction sector. Local raw materials and products will be used, and we will see an increase in investments along with a parallel decrease in unemployment and poverty levels throughout the country. The initiative will create jobs for many citizens. With this investment in planned urban reconstruction and transformation, we will create living areas that have full insulation and satisfy at least basic comfort standards, leading to increased savings of energy and resources, and, most important of all, they will be environmentally friendly. This will lead to increased tax revenues and curtail the grey economy, while also helping develop the construction and technical consulting sector. The project will protect us against natural disasters, reducing the human and economic toll on the country, while also establishing Turkey's position as a vibrant, dynamic economy in a time of global downturn, and ensuring that Turkey's development remains sustainable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey is the top European country in terms of agricultural revenue. How would you characterize the significance of agriculture for Turkey's economic growth?<br></h4><p>The agricultural sector plays an important role in Turkey's economic growth, and it finished the year 2011 with 5.6% growth. As for 1Q2012, growth rates were 4.8%, 3.4% in 2Q2012, and 2.9% in 3Q2012. Continuous growth for 14 quarters has been achieved. In the EU, the agricultural and fisheries sector growth average in 2011 was 3%; whereas Turkey had an average growth rate of 5.6%, which is considerably higher. Agricultural domestic income reached TL104 billion in 2011 from TL36 billion in 2002. Besides the increase in current prices, between 2002 and 2011, agricultural GDP increased 19.2% in fixed prices, and with an increase of 161% it has reached $61.8 billion from $23.7 billion. According to World Bank data, the size of Turkey's agricultural economy has risen to seventh from 11th in the world, and has risen to first from fourth in Europe. With this growth and development in recent years, the agricultural sector has proven once again that it is the locomotive sector for our country and a buffer sector for our economy. The share of employment in the agriculture sector is decreasing. While in 2002, 35% of the workforce was employed in agriculture, today, this figure has decreased to 25%, or 6 million people. Agricultural exports have increased significantly over the last 10 years, and Turkey has become an important agricultural exporter in the region. According to TurkStat data, our agricultural product exports reached $16 billion in 2012, up 4.8% compared to 2011 and 295% compared to 2002. In 2012, our agricultural imports decreased by 7% compared to 2011. Our country consistently has a foreign trade surplus in food products, which is the base of the agriculture sector. The foreign trade surplus in food products reached $4.6 billion in 2012 from $1.76 billion in 2002. Between 2003 and 2012, our country has seen a total of TL36.77 billion in foreign trade surpluses from food products.</p><h4>Turkey has one of the fastest-growing aquaculture sectors in the world. Is this a trend you expect to continue, and what significance does it have for Turkey's agricultural sector?</h4><p>In Turkey over 2011, aquaculture production equaled 704,000 tons; of which 515,000 tons were from fish and 189,000 tons from aquaculture. Since 2013, as a result of the support given to the sector and policies implemented, aquaculture production has increased to 190,000 tons from 61,000 tons with an increase of 209%, comparing to 2002. According to FAO data, Turkey ranks third among the world's fastest growing countries in aquaculture. Once again in a study done by FAO, Turkey has achieved a 25% share in the European sea bream-sea bass market. Furthermore, Turkey is number one among EU countries in trout production.</p><h4>Turkey is the leading global producer of a number of products such as hazelnuts and apricots. To what extent is Turkey becoming an internationally recognized brand in these segments?</h4><p>The cultivation of hazelnuts first started in Turkey, and today we are the biggest hazelnut producer. The world's total hazelnut production is 858,000 tons (FAO 2011), and 600,000 tons of this production—70% of total production—is produced in Turkey. The country exported 230,000 tons of hazelnut kernels during the 2011/2012 period. Approximately 68% of Turkey's hazelnuts exports are to EU countries. The world's apricot production is 3.83 million tons, and 760,000 tons of this is from Turkey. It is the leader in apricots with 17% of total production. Turkey is producing 20% of the world's fresh apricots and provides 85% of its dried apricots. According to 2012 foreign trade data, Turkey exported 170,000 tons of apricots, of which 102,000 tons were dried. Turkey exports 59% of the world's total dried apricots, with 50% of exports going to the EU and the US.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the development and transformation of Turkey's healthcare system in the last 10 years?<br></h4><p>We began the Healthcare Transformation Program so as to provide accessible, quality, and sustainable health care access for all. With this program, we have provided health care access and services to citizens living in some of the most inaccessible regions of Turkey. The speed and extent to which we have improved our healthcare figures has set a standard for success on a global scale. Our citizens have appreciated our success, and satisfaction with healthcare services nationwide has gone from 39% to 76%. We have also been very successful in areas such as mother-child care, vaccinations, and the prevention of contagious diseases.</p><h4>What kind of activities is the government engaged in for Turkey to reach its 2023 objectives in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>Healthcare transformation is an ongoing, innovative, and dynamic process. The ultimate aim is a healthy society, both physically and spiritually. That is why we have created the 2010-2017 Strategic Plan, which sets out the way in which we aim to safeguard and keep improving our citizens' health. We worked closely with the WHO when mapping out this strategic plan. We also took into consideration the Tallinn Plan, Health 2020, and the European Action Plan for the Strengthening of Public Health Capacities and Services. This strategic plan outlines our objectives and aims, foremost of which is our desire to safeguard and protect our citizens' health in an equitable and just way for all. Our ultimate aim is to be in the top-10 countries in the world in terms of the quality of our healthcare sector by 2023. We have the necessary knowledge, experience, and determination to achieve this goal.</p><h4>How would you characterize Turkey's role in the international health tourism market?</h4><p>A decade ago, our citizens would go overseas for healthcare services. Now, our country has become an international health tourism center. Our geographic location, the quality of our healthcare facilities, our qualified and experienced human resources, and our thermal spas and natural beauties all contribute to Turkey having become an international healthcare destination. Our level of advancement in health care puts us among the top countries in the world in this field. With our advanced, high-tech facilities and relatively economic price advantages, we stand out as a shining star in the global health-tourism sector. While improving the healthcare standards for our own citizens on the one hand, we are also offering these same high standards to regional countries. We plan on providing strong healthcare services to a regional population of nearly 1 billion people. We are also creating free healthcare zones to develop health tourism further and cater to the healthcare needs of visitors from abroad. We are offering many advantages for investors in these free healthcare zones. Our country's existing high-quality and cost-effective healthcare services will become even more advantageous through these free zones.</p><h4>What are Turkey's public health objectives in the medium term, and what importance do these have for Turkey's overall economic growth and development?</h4><p>With the reforms we have made in the healthcare sector, maternal and infant mortality, as well as contagious diseases, are no longer a significant health problems. In order to improve even further, we have strengthened our infrastructure and continued to work with the same focus and determination as always. As with other developed countries, we now focus our efforts mostly on dealing with chronic diseases. Our aim is to protect our citizens from chronic illnesses by not only focusing on risk factors and preventative measures, but also focusing on what we call “secondary protection," which involves early diagnosis and effective treatment methods. Besides combating tobacco use and obesity, we also have programs for dealing with diabetes and chronic respiratory and coronary diseases. One of the most important factors for the success and longevity of such a comprehensive healthcare transformation program is sustainability. We have created a healthcare system that is built on solid foundations, that has a long-term vision, and that has, for the most part, become institutionalized. A bright future awaits us in health care.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Emsey Hospital's approach to patient care?<br></h4><p>Our main priority is the health of the patient as well as our ethical values. In this regard, it is very important to us that we don't send patients away if we don't find anything. We tell the patients that we will try to find out what the problem is, because the greatest challenge within treatment is when it comes to diagnostics. We think like the patient, so if the patient demands we find the problem, we will find it. We believe that the most important point is the value of a human life. We have to provide the required value to patients. We believe that we have the highest standards when it comes to this. If a patient comes to the hospital and doesn't leave with a smile, then we have failed. This makes the patient very happy and they are not afraid, but relaxed about coming here. Also, when patients come here they see our smiles.</p><h4>What role does Emsey Hospital play in Turkey's domestic healthcare system?</h4><p>This is a general hospital and we have all the best facilities, including some unique specialties. For example, we have the first A-plus-class intensive care unit (ICU) for newborns in Turkey. Most of the beds in our hospital are for the ICUs. We have approximately 200 beds at Emsey Hospital and approximately 100 of them are ICU beds. You can't make money with ICUs, but you can serve the community. Every country needs ICUs. The other specialty in our hospital is oncology. We have doctors who are very talented in our oncology unit. Professor Ayşen Timurağaoğlu, who is the Head of our Hematological Department, is the President of the European Hematological Association. We are a leading hospital in bone marrow and stem cell transplants, because very few hospitals in the region have the resources to carry one out. Another experienced member of our hospital is Professor Erkan Topuz, who is one of world's leading oncologists. Spinal surgery is extremely difficult to do, but we have an excellent team including neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and physical therapists. These are the leading sectors of Emsey Hospital.</p><h4>How has your background in the hospitality industry helped Emsey Hospital to become a leader in medical tourism?</h4><p>My background prior to health care was in the hospitality industry. I am one of the best-known hotel managers in the country, and I was the manager of the first five-star thermal hotel in Turkey. I am a businessman who knows finance and accounting, and I come from the service industry. These two important points have made me very successful in my position. All over the world, the most important issue for hospitals is to have a good manager that knows business administration and the service industry. At Emsey Hospital, we have everything in one place. Patients come from many countries. Right now, 40% of our patients are international. However, in the near future, we expect more than half of our patients to be foreign. Often, our patients have not been able to find the ideal solution to their problem in their home country, so they come to us. They find themselves very relaxed here, and they can even eat food according to their cultures. We try to give them the highest-level hotel services even including laundry services. They have private rooms, bathrooms, Wi-Fi, mini bars, LED TVs, a telephone, and even a safety box.</p><h4>For international patients, what advantages does Emsey Hospital provide over hospitals in Western Europe?</h4><p>We are very inexpensive and quick compared to Europe, and we have excellent service. Some of our patients have gone to hospitals in leading EU countries, but have been frustrated with the slow service. In many European countries, you could wait six months for a hip replacement or a knee prosthesis. Here, we can perform both of those surgeries immediately. In one case, a patient who had a very serious and time-sensitive condition was waiting for five hours at a hospital in Western Europe, so we told him to fly directly here and we saw him immediately. Health cannot wait.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Bahçeşehir Schools' educational philosophy?<br></h4><p>At Bahçeşehir Schools, we consider ourselves leaders in the field of education. Our educational philosophy places the student at the center of the learning process. We believe that children are competent learners that develop in many ways and at various rates. However, all children are similar in terms of their need for a base of nurturing, secure, and enabling relationships. We seek to promote the cognitive, emotional, social, and physical growth of each child within an inspiring and nurturing environment. Bahçeşehir Schools has 43 campuses, 33 primary schools, 16 high schools, and 48 pre-kindergartens. At Bahçeşehir schools, we are always willing to bring in innovations and introduce the most recent technological educational tools to our students on each of these campuses. We believe in the necessity of integrating ICT in our teaching and learning processes. Thus, we highly prioritize the use of interactive whiteboards, smart TVs, iPads, and PCs. In cooperation with our universities, we also follow the most recent educational trends and implement those in our schools, such as the Global Citizenship Bilingual Program. Moreover, we aim to transform all of our schools into Digital World Schools. Our academic staff designs and writes the curricula and the content to be used in our iPad experiential learning sessions. We are privileged to have the facilities to publish our own educational materials.</p><h4>How would you explain the demand for private schools in Turkey?</h4><p>Education in Turkey is generally governed by the national system. In fact, 98% of Turkish children go to public schools. However, there is huge demand for private schools in Turkey. When compared with OECD countries, the demand for private schools is about 12%. Turkey has significantly expanded access to education in the last decade, but remaining challenges wait on two key fronts; quality and equity, as stated in a recent World Bank report. The highest performing education systems are those that combine equity with quality. School failure penalizes a child for life. Educational failure also imposes high costs on society. The statistical data confirms that after years of schooling, many students who graduate from secondary schools do not reach even the minimum level of skills required for their development. Improvement starts with changes in teaching and learning focusing on student success. When the support practices in OECD countries are observed, some key findings such as school leadership, high-quality teachers, coaching and mentoring programs, context-specific academic improvement strategies, efficient use of a variety of resources, formal common planning time at school, merit-recognition, individualized learning models, the use of ICT, and continuous in-service training can be listed. Considering all of these factors, it can easily be said that the education offered in private schools is better than that offered in public schools. For instance, at Bahçeşehir Schools, our priority is to use the most effective learning models that are based on a set of guiding principles, which take equity and equality in teaching and learning into account. These guiding principles include creating learner-centered and child-friendly learning environments, using social, inclusive, personalized, structured, and well-designed curricula, which promote inquiry and autonomous learning. Within the scope of the private school education industry and market in Turkey, Bahçeşehir Schools have substantially grown over the past 20 years since our foundation in 1994. Bahçeşehir Schools rank among the most prestigious educational institutions across the country and abroad, and continue to be the leaders in the field of education.</p><h4>What makes Bahçeşehir Schools unique in the private education system in Turkey?</h4><p>We provide our students with a variety of academic programs and the most up-to-date educational tools at our different school campuses, such as Bahçeşehir Science and Technology High School. Bahçeşehir Science and Technology High School, which opened in 2006, has proven to be the most successful high school in Turkey through its national and international achievements and awards in competitions, as well as its outstanding academic success. All students at the high school win full-tuition scholarships. These students are accepted by the most prestigious universities all around the world and are often awarded merit-based scholarships that are based on their academic, athletic, artistic, and other abilities. During its third year of education, Bahçeşehir Science and Technology High School increased its admission rates by accepting students with the top 100 scores on the National High School Placement Exam (SBS). In other words, we accept the top 24 students among a population of 1.5 million across the country. The Turkish educational system is based on numerous standardized exams. Students who attend private schools receive a high-quality education and they achieve great success in all national placement exams as well as international exams such as TOEFL, IELTS, and the SAT. These students easily pass the exams and become eligible to study at prestigious universities both in Turkey and abroad. The reason why Turkey has such a large number of exam preparation centers is that students who do not have the opportunity to attend private schools opt to take remedial courses in order to be successful in national placement exams. As a consequence, many exam preparation centers have opened all around Turkey. Bahçeşehir Schools opened Uğur Exam Preparation Centers across the country. In total, there are 200 of our centers offering high-quality exam preparation programs for a variety of purposes in order to meet different requirements and the needs of students from grade one to 12. In these centers, we work with highly qualified teachers and our resource center offers our students a rich learning environment. We provide our students with academic support to bolster their study habits and hone in on their study strategies. We also offer one-on-one sessions with peers and professionals, as well as a variety of workshops. We focus on promoting a disciplined approach to study, fostering active and independent learning, developing an awareness and understanding of one's own thought process, and advocating the strategic use of resources that are available in the centers. Our centers serve as academic referral, training, and information resources for all of our students. We also work in collaboration with Bahçeşehir University's Faculty of Education. The faculty provides comprehensive teacher training to all of our academic staff. In other words, Bahçeşehir University represents a network of scholars with a shared focus and a set of goals that reflect a true sense of community.</p><div class="quote">“When compared with OECD countries, the demand for private schools is about 12%."</div><h4>How important it is for Bahçeşehir University to develop international connections?</h4><p>Every year, Bahçeşehir University welcomes hundreds of international scholars and students to its campus and sends hundreds of Turkish students abroad, offering opportunities not only for study, but to share cultures and foster respect for and an understanding of differences. At Bahçeşehir University, international programs and connections function as catalysts for internationalization and hubs for foreign activities. These programs provide leadership and support for internationally oriented teaching, research, and creative work. To this end, Bahçeşehir University aims to promote international scholarships, educational exchange, and linkages with individuals and institutions abroad. Bahçeşehir University has opened campuses in Germany (Berlin), the US (San Diego), Canada (Toronto), Azerbaijan, and Singapore. Our basic purpose is to further globally oriented knowledge and activities across the world and help create a community and society responsive to the increasing global needs and obligations of citizenship.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you become involved in the hospitality industry?<br></h4><p>We started to invest in tourism in 1991 with an 80-room, four-star hotel in the center of Taksim. At that time, there were three hotels in the area. However, we were faced with security issues such as drug dealers in what was akin to a red-light district. From 1991 to 2007, we were able to build six other hotels in the Taksim area, operating seven hotels and offering almost 1,000 rooms. Over the same period, we also bought two pieces of land in Bodrum and established two other hotels, which are all-inclusive holiday clubs. In 2008, we bought the building that is now Avantgarde Hotel. It took one-and-a-half years to construct the hotel, which was opened in May 2010. Before Avantgarde, our strategy in tourism was to invest in four-star category hotels. Now, we have set up a new company, Lucis Global, which established a 124-room hotel in the Taksim area and it will also be an Avantgarde Hotel; we are now refurbishing that space. In addition, the company opened a new hotel in Bodrum called Mejor Costa. We now have two different pieces of land on which to develop hotels, with other ideas such as offices, residences, and a mixed-use project in mind. One is in Nişantaşi on Rumeli Street, and our main plan is to build a 200-room, five-star hotel there because it is a prime piece of real estate for the hospitality market in Istanbul.</p><h4>How would you characterize Avantgarde's role in the local hospitality market?</h4><p>The location of Avantgarde is unbelievable. On the same road, Büyükdere Street, we compete with respected international brands:  Sheraton, Mövenpick, Le Meridian, the Conrad, the EDITION, and Renaissance. Relatively speaking, operating a hotel in the Levent area is not as easy as operating one in Taksim, as it has its own standard flat occupancy rate and a local rate. At a minimum, hotels in Taksim enjoy 75%-80% occupancy annually for about ‚¬90/night on average.</p><p>The customer portfolio is much more demanding in Levent; our guests know why they choose this location and there is a reason behind their choice. They do not want to stay at a random hotel selected from a huge pool. In fact, 25% of our reservations are made online—bearing in mind how sensitive online consumers are, our presentation is key. Other clients are mainly corporate.</p><h4>What advantages does Avantgarde have in the highly competitive hotel market?</h4><p>Since day one, we have worked to differentiate our hotel by creating more customized approaches. In a typical city or business hotel, the size of a room is approximately 16 to 18 sqm, but here the minimum is 28-30 sqm. Our room sizes go up to as high as 70 sqm. In addition, we offer every amenity to our guests, unlike at some hotels where you have to be a preferred guest with a rewards card to get the full package: bathrobes, slippers, and welcome gifts. We offer these services as part of our daily routine. For our preferred guests, we include chocolates, wine, fruit, and champagne. We are aiming to draw the attention of our guests; as long as they are loyal, we will continue to be very generous. In Istanbul, the successful examples of hotels are those that understand affordable luxury.</p><h4>How does Avantgarde Hotel assure that guests enjoy their stay?</h4><p>Having 84 hotel rooms allows us to treat our customers on a one-on-one basis. We work to ensure that all of their requests are attended to quickly and adequately. Comparing the hotel with its competitors, some have 150 or 300 rooms; it is not easy for these large hotels to treat customers as personally as we do. We are constantly working to show our guests and customers that the hotel is more like a living space.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This is Istanbul's fifth bid for the Olympics. What is different this time around?<br></h4><p>Turkey's Olympic journey began more than two decades ago, but this time around, we have matched our 20-year dream with commitment and capacity. Istanbul is now ready to deliver. Every level of the government is aligned behind a shared vision for the city and the country's future. Hosting the Games is a core pillar of Turkey's long-term development program that culminates in the centenary of the republic in 2023. Istanbul has transformed itself since its last bid. The city has spent an average of $1.5 billion on transport upgrades every year since 2005, and by 2018 another $10 billion will have been spent on a series of groundbreaking projects: the third Bosphorus Bridge, the Haliç Metro, the Eurasia-Bosphorus road tunnel, the Marmaray rail tunnel, and a third international airport will all have made Istanbul better connected well before 2020. As a result, we have been able to guarantee athletes an average travel time of just 16 minutes to and from the venues; 51% of athletes will be accommodated within five minutes of their competition arenas. Istanbul has also earned a formidable reputation as a trusted host of some of the biggest events in world sports. We have shown time and again that we can provide the conditions athletes need to compete at their best, all with a unique Eurasian flavor that can't be found anywhere else. However, the most important difference is that this time around, all of Turkey is behind the bid. The level of government support for Istanbul 2020 is unprecedented in Turkey. For the first time ever, the bid to host the country's first-ever Olympic and Paralympic Games was launched personally by the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. We have created a powerful public-private partnership (PPP); our team of national sponsors has contributed $20 million to the campaign, the largest private sector investment in any sports bid in Turkey's history. The people of Turkey also want the Games. According to our last domestic poll, 94% of respondents in Istanbul are in favor of hosting the Games, and 23 million Turkish sports fans have already expressed a desire to purchase Olympic tickets. A recent poll by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) suggests that 5 million young people under the age of 25 years back our bid in Istanbul alone. We have set the lowest ticket prices at just $10, so they will be accessible to as many people as possible. If we are given the honor of hosting the Games, the Olympic family can expect a truly unforgettable reception.</p><h4>Why is it significant for Turkey to host the Games as an emerging market spanning two continents?</h4><p>Turkey bid four times as an emerging market, but this time, Turkey is bidding as an emerged market. We are the fastest-growing European economy and the second fastest growing OECD economy, with 5.2% average annual economic growth between 2002 and 2011—that's 3.5 times the European average. Turkey is forecast to be a top-10 global economy by 2023. Istanbul 2020's vision isn't about aspiring to international standards—it's about setting new ones. Istanbul 2020 will be the first Olympic and Paralympic Games ever staged in Turkey or the region. It will immerse the Olympic family in a brand-new environment with a rich history and a fascinating culture, unlike any other city in the world. Istanbul 2020 will also be the first-ever Olympics in a nation where nearly 50% of the population is under the age of 25. This will connect fans with the untapped potential of Europe's youngest population and the market's exciting opportunities for the first time.</p><h4>What are your plans to ensure that Istanbul's Olympic facilities are put to good use after the Games is over?</h4><p>Istanbul would leave a profound and lasting legacy, not just for Istanbul and Turkey but also for the region and the entire Olympic movement. We plan to build 20 world-class venues and significantly upgrade a further five. They will be a major addition to the sports world's inventory, and they will empower Turkey and other nations in the region to realize a massive untapped sporting potential. Bringing the Games to Turkey would create a generation of opportunities for the region's youth. Istanbul 2020 would arrive at a unique moment in the history of Turkey and the region, three years out from the celebration of the Republic's centenary. Now is the perfect time for Istanbul.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's tractor sector is dominated by international brands. What challenges did you face while building a Turkish brand in the sector?<br></h4><p>Erkunt Industries is actually 60 years old and is one of the major suppliers of cast and machined parts to the engine and tractor manufacturers in Europe and Turkey.  We started manufacturing our tractors in 2004. Erkunt is a Turkish brand totally designed by Turkish engineers. It is not licensed production. The first challenge was, of course, to be recognized and accepted by the farmers, as it was the first and only Turkish-branded product. The second challenge was competing among the long established and well-known brands in a very competitive sector.</p><h4>What distinguishes Erkunt tractors?</h4><p>Our tractors are known for their low fuel consumption compared to the competition. This is a plus factor when buying a tractor, which is actually a working device. We conducted tests that were witnessed by public notaries and the professors from agricultural faculties of universities in seven different geographical regions of Turkey, each region with different climate and soil conditions. The second factor is being strong and reliable. This can be attributed to the transaxle and the engine we use.</p><h4>Was your goal always for Erkunt to become an exporter?</h4><p>We had exports in mind, but not starting from the very first year. We thought that the first five years would be for the domestic market and gradually we would start to move toward exporting to neighboring countries. There was a lack of self-confidence in the beginning. We didn't know what the farmers' reactions would be toward a Turkish brand. The second question on our minds was whether we would be able to provide the proper services. We first started exporting to Bulgaria in 2007, and later to 26 different countries, such as Iraq, Poland, Australia, and Peru. I must admit I am not yet satisfied with our performance. We are now approaching the subject with a different attitude. We will concentrate on a limited number of countries. We need to build the perception of a new brand and grow within our means.</p><div class="quote">“Our tractors are known for their low fuel consumption compared to the competition."</div><h4>How have you worked to meet the needs of farmers in designing your tractors?</h4><p>During the design stage, we visited roughly 10,000 farmers in all regions. We tried to understand what made them happy or unhappy with their choice of tractors. We wanted to know what kind of improvements they were looking for, and how much extra they would accept to pay for these improvements. We used all this feedback when we were designing tractors. At Erkunt, we are still following the same method for our new models. We know that Turkish farmers want better tractors. If they are using a tractor with a canopy, they want to switch to a new one with a cabin. If they are farming in a hot region, they want air-conditioning. They want four-wheel drive tractors. They want compressors to provide the air for flat tires, and cleaning system for their blocked filters or radiators after a hard day's work in the field.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>A decade ago, when my party, the Justice and Development Party, better known by its Turkish acronym, AK Party, embarked on its journey to govern Turkey, it announced its democratization and development program. The key element of this program in relation to economic policies is a continuous and sustainable economic growth strategy. An integral part, among others, of our strategy has been attracting foreign investment, acknowledging its contribution to economic development. As we have not only included foreign investment in our economic program, we have also implemented effective reforms that have turned Turkey into an attractive destination for foreign investment. Moreover, we have reinforced our economic policies with political stability. In a politically and economically volatile region, Turkey has been an island of political stability and economic confidence.</p><p>This hindsight vindicates that our economic policies and reforms have yielded results. During our administration over the past decade, the Turkish economy has grown robustly with an average annual real GDP growth rate of 5%. In the meantime, Turkey attracted more than $120 billion of FDI. Our sound economic policies and reforms have also strengthened Turkey against economic shocks and crises. During the global financial crisis in 2009, many banks had to be bailed out by governments in the US and Europe, whereas not even a single bank required monetary or administrative support from the government in Turkey.</p><div class="quote">“Our sound economic policies and reforms have also strengthened Turkey against economic shocks and crises."</div><p>Again, while the recent sovereign debt crisis has engulfed many economies in Europe, Turkey's public finance indicators have been impressive; Turkey drastically reduced its gross public debt from 74% of GDP in 2002 to 36% in 2012. That is why, though belatedly, Turkey has recently been upgraded to investment grade by major credit rating agencies. Turkey has been the only economy that has been upgraded several notches since the onset of the 2009 global financial crisis. While the crises have caused many economies to struggle with increasing unemployment, Turkey created around 3.5 million new jobs between 2009 and 2012, whereas total employment in the EU-27 countries decreased by 1.5 million.</p><p>While the above and many other figures have altogether been a test for our economic policies, the real test for them has been our people's trust in and approval of our policies. My party won the last three consecutive general elections with landslide victories, increasing its votes in every one of these elections. This approval by our people has encouraged us to implement more reforms and further improve Turkey's investment climate. As long as we have a political mandate from our people, we will continue to serve them through sound economic policies and reforms. As such, Turkey will continue to be a safe haven for global investors where they can find strong economic confidence backed by genuine political stability that is supported by the will of the people of Turkey.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do the UAE government's plans to increase oil production to 3.5 million from 2.7 million barrels per day (bbl/d) by 2017 mean for OPEC in terms of maintaining reliability of supply to consumer nations?</h4><p>For many decades, the UAE has helped supply the world with its oil needs through exploring, producing, refining, and transporting these precious natural resources, both at home and internationally. Today, with around 100 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and close to 3% of current global production, the UAE is one of the world's leading oil and energy hubs. Its current investment plans reinforce its commitment to make sure its consumers' needs are met. And there is no doubt the world will need more oil in the years ahead, with demand expected to rise by around 19 million bbl/d by 2035. With the majority of this demand increase in Asia, the UAE is also ideally positioned geographically as the global energy axis shifts to the East. Combined with investments in other OPEC member countries, the Organization is demonstrating the seriousness it attaches to the need for adequate production capacity to be in place, not only to meet the demand for its oil, but also to offer sufficient spare capacity.</p><h4>What are the ramifications of increased North American hydrocarbon production and the development of its tight oil reserves for OPEC's GCC members in terms of production targets, pricing, and upstream investment over the coming decade?</h4><p>Over the past couple of years there has evidently been an increasing media focus on North American tight oil production. I think it is important to stress that these supplies are a welcome addition to the global supply outlook, and, at the same time, provide further proof to consumers that the world is not running out of oil. Of course, people have asked how these developments might impact other producers, such as GCC member states. To date, it has been relatively minimal. Yes, the US is producing more and importing less than a few years ago. Yes, some producers have lost some market share in the US. But, we should put these developments into some context. Firstly, we need to remember that global demand is close to 90 million bbl/d, and with demand set to expand further there is room for all producers. And secondly, we need to see how sustainable this type of tight oil production is in the long term. For example, the industry is already seeing tight oil fields reach a production plateau after a year or so and then witness a steep decline rate. There have been reports that shale wells can drop off by more than 60% within the first year. In addition, there are also some environmental concerns, and when looking globally, questions remain as to whether US developments can be replicated elsewhere. As it has done for many decades, OPEC and its member countries will continue to monitor the market on a daily basis, and make sure production and future investments are in-line with how we see the market in the coming months and years.</p><h4>How important is investment in downstream development in the UAE for meeting current global demand for refined products?</h4><p>It is clear that many national oil companies are looking to expand their downstream portfolios to establish synergies between their upstream and downstream petroleum businesses, both at home and overseas. This is certainly true in the UAE, where significant downstream developments are taking place. There is the current expansion project taking place at Ruwais, which will make it one of the largest refineries in the world. And there are plans to build a refining complex at Fujairah, as well as plans to boost the refining capacity of the Jebel Ali refinery off the coast of Dubai. These projects will not only help to meet the growing demand for petroleum products in the UAE, they will also increase the country's ability to export more. Given its closeness to the Asia-Pacific region, it is easy to see the potential benefits. According to OPEC's latest World Oil Outlook, oil product demand in the Asia Pacific region is seen increasing by around 16 million bbl/d by 2035, over 2012 levels.</p><div class="quote">“For many decades, the UAE has helped supply the world with its oil needs."</div><h4>Abu Dhabi is spending some $25 billion on LNG projects. How do you see the future of this energy source affecting OPEC's strategic direction?</h4><p>At OPEC, we recognize the expanding role of LNG and gas in general. In OPEC's World Oil Outlook 2013 we anticipate that gas will increase its share of the energy mix from around 22% today to just over 26% in 2035, whereas oil witnesses a fall from 32%, to converge with gas at around 26% by 2035. So what does this mean for OPEC? While oil's overall share in the energy mix falls, it will still see significant expansion and remain central to the global energy mix. It will thus remain central to member country economies. I do not believe it will alter OPEC's strategic direction. And let me add that OPEC welcomes the efficient and sustainable development of all energy technologies.</p><h4>How does OPEC support clean energy initiatives and diversification efforts such as the recently built Shams 1 solar power plant in the Western Region of the UAE?</h4><p>Obviously, oil and gas remains central to the economies of OPEC member countries and this will be true for the foreseeable future. However, many are now also investing in clean energy initiatives and making huge efforts to protect the environment, as well as diversifying their economies to reduce their reliance on oil and gas. For example, in the petroleum sector, many companies are supplying cleaner projects and investing in technologies such as carbon capture and storage, and in other energies, such as solar and wind power. They are also investing significantly in cleaner energy and the UAE is a great example of this. Its Masdar Initiative, which is focused on R&amp;D, pilot projects, and technology testing for renewable energies and clean technologies, has gained worldwide fame. It is an initiative that OPEC fully supports. Moreover, OPEC recognizes that it is becoming increasingly crucial for oil producers who still depend heavily on oil revenues to look to other sources of income. Diversity, in this regard, is vital.</p><h4>How important a role does the UAE play in OPEC?</h4><p>Every OPEC member country is important to the Organization. In terms of the UAE, it has of course hosted a number of OPEC Ministerial Conferences, seen its ministers sit as OPEC Conference President on many occasions, and afforded OPEC a Secretary General in the 1980s. It has also provided staff to the Secretariat and been actively involved in the Organization's meetings and activities. We respect and appreciate the UAE's support and input.</p><h4>How important is it for OPEC, and its member countries, to expand dialogue and further cooperation with consumers?</h4><p>We live in an increasingly interdependent world, which makes dialogue between producers and consumers ever more critical. I am an advocate of continually evolving collaboration among producers and consumers. In fact, OPEC has long recognized the importance of dialogue and cooperation with producers, as well as with other stakeholders. For example, OPEC continues to maintain a strong and positive relationship with the EU. Its cooperation with the International Energy Agency also goes back many years and has advanced considerably. OPEC has also been proud to have played an active part in the formation of the International Energy Forum, which is located in a GCC member, Saudi Arabia. Additionally, OPEC has had dialogues with both Russia and China, and with a number of other international organizations, such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the World Trade Organization.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the development of high-speed trains (HST) benefit the Turkish economy?</h4><p>Our HST projects are among the most prestigious of our objectives for 2023, the year in which we will be celebrating the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. The demand we have seen for the Ankara-Eskişehir and Ankara-Konya HST lines has convinced us of the importance of further pursuing and developing the HST network in Turkey. When we look at international statistics, we find that the travel frequency of Turkish citizens is much lower than those living in developed countries. This obstructs the homogenous spread of the economy throughout the country and exacerbates regional economic and social imbalances. Besides the direct contribution that the HST investments have on the overall economy, there is also an added dynamism to various sectors and industries in cities connected by the HST network. It will curtail urban migration, thereby contributing to a more balanced demographic distribution of the population, more social sustainability, smarter growth policies, and better urban structuring. Due to the fact that the HST goes through many outer suburbs in the cities it passes through, it will relieve many people of the need to have a second home in another city, thereby easing the burden on family budgets. Those added resources will become disposable income or income that can be spent on other investments, thereby creating new jobs and stimulating the economy. When assessing the economic impact of high-speed rail projects, we have to factor in a whole range of externalities, foremost of which are environmental issues. In the EU, limitations and restrictions have been implemented to reduce dependency on motorways and create alternative modes of transport to reduce the damage to the environment as well as reduce overall costs; railways are a crucial part of this strategy. In line with this, the Ankara-Istanbul HST project is of vital economic importance. Istanbul and Ankara are Turkey's two most populous and prosperous cities. Istanbul is Turkey's business center while Ankara is the political center. Naturally, transportation demand between these two cities is far greater than between any other two cities. That is why we are trying to make the transportation corridor between these two cities as varied, efficient, and advanced as possible. By 2023, we expect that up to 17.7 million people will use the Ankara-Istanbul HST, or 20.6 million passengers per kilometer. With these new HST investments, we expect the total number of road vehicles to decrease by 1.7 million. That means an estimated 354,000 fewer buses and 1.3 million fewer cars. In addition to lightening road traffic throughout the country, there will also be an expected $10.2 million saving on energy consumption, which will contribute to reducing our current account deficit by an estimated $16.1 million. We also expect to save about $58.7 million on traffic accidents and about a 90,617-ton reduction in CO2 emissions, with a total of $9.4 million saved on said emissions. With the savings we make there, the total economic value that the Ankara-Istanbul HST will contribute by 2023 will amount to $78.4 million.</p><h4>What steps is Turkey taking to develop the maritime sector and become a global maritime center by 2023?</h4><p>Today, the safest, securest, and cheapest way to trade is by sea. With this in mind, we have been undertaking all the necessary infrastructural work to make Turkey one of the leading countries in maritime trade. In line with this goal, we have been offering VAT-free fuel since 2004, thereby invigorating the coastal shipping sector. Since 2004, businesses have saved over TL2.8 billion on VAT, thus providing an important source of support for the sector. As a result of these efforts, there was a 52% increase in the volume of goods shipped through coastal shipping, a 57% increase in the number of passengers, and a 67% increase in the number of cars. Therefore, coastal shipping has been given an added stimulus and a significant amount of domestic land cargo has shifted to maritime shipping. As part of our government's export-based growth model, our total exports increased 222% from $116.6 billion in 2003, to $375.7 billion in 2011. Parallel with this growth, there has also been a significant increase in international maritime trade, which has jumped from $57 billion in 2003 to $207 billion in 2011, an increase of 263%. This upward trend has also been reflected in the volume of containers and goods that have been handled in Turkey's seaports, with an increase of 91% in total goods handled since 2003 and an increase of 162% in total containers handled. As a result of bilateral and multilateral agreements signed with countries along the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts, there has been a 50% increase in the number of vehicles transported by Ro-Ro ships between 2003 and 2011. Compared to 2003, our maritime fleet increased 62%, with a 32% rise in Deadweight Tonnage (DWT). The Turkish maritime freight fleet now ranks 15th in the world as of January 1, 2012. With this historic increase in foreign trade figures, our seaports have also expanded so as to be able to handle the increased trade volume, with new ports built and old ports modernized and expanded. We will build massive ports on the Black Sea, Aegean Sea, and Mediterranean coasts. When we consider all these developments in the last 10 years and keep in mind all the ongoing projects, we find that it is only natural that Turkey becomes the world's pier.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance of developing Turkey's civil aviation sector for continued economic growth?</h4><p>Our ministry began the Regional Aviation Policy in 2003, and with this project our aviation sector was opened to the private sector resulting in a competitive environment that led to rapid growth. With this project, 16 million Turks traveled on aircraft for the first time. The number of airline companies offering scheduled transportation increased from 13 in 2003 to 15 in 2012, three of those companies being solely cargo companies, the number of air taxi operators increased 12% to reach 58, and general aviation operators increased 34% to reach 43. The total number of civil aviation firms also went up from 152 to 172. The number of aircraft increased 130% since 2003, from 160 to 374. When you consider that the average cost of an airplane is $95 million, the 212 aircraft that have been bought over the last nine years contributed $20 billion to the Turkish economy. In 2003, there were a total of 64,617 personnel working in the civil aviation sector. That number rose by 140% in a decade to reach 165,000. As for aviation sector turnover, what used to be $2.2 billion in 2003 now stands at $15 billion. In 2003, total passengers on international and domestic flights numbered just over 34.4 million annually. By the end of 2012, that figure stood at 131 million. In 2002, domestic flights flew only out of two cities to 25 other destinations. Now, seven airline companies fly to 49 destinations from seven cities. Our newly built airports as well as our renovated and modernized airports, all stand out for their unique and modern architecture. The third Istanbul airport, which will have a capacity of 150 million passengers, is now in the bidding stage. Of Turkish airports that rank in the top 100 worldwide in terms of passenger traffic, Istanbul Atatürk Airport ranked 40th in 2008, and it now ranks 30th as of 2012. Antalya Airport, which ranked 71st in 2008, now ranks 55th as of 2012. In terms of European passenger traffic, Istanbul Atatürk Airport ranked 10th in 2008, whereas by 2012 it ranked 8th, while Antalya went up from 25th in 2008 to 13th in 2012. Of the 454 airports in 45 countries across Europe, there was an increase in passenger traffic at 266 airports, and a decrease in the remaining 188. While passenger numbers rose sharply in Turkey and Russia in particular, there was a significant drop in passenger numbers in the UK, Ireland, and Greece. According to the ENAC world airline rankings in terms of passenger traffic, Turkish Airlines (THY) was ranked 19th, while it ranked first in the world in terms of its rate of increase in passenger traffic in 2012, with a rate of 22.3%. We aim to increase our total passenger capacity for all airports to 386 million per annum by 2023. Furthermore, we aim to double the Turkish civil aviation fleet by the same year, increasing it to 750 aircraft, 200 of which will be regional aircraft. I believe that our rapidly developing civil aviation sector will continue to have a positive effect on developing Turkey's rich tourism potential and its rising economy.</p><div class="quote">“Today, the safest, securest, and cheapest way to trade is by sea."</div>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the government's planned infrastructure investments enhance the city's ability to play host to the Olympics in 2020?<br></h4><p>The city has spent an average of $1.5 billion on transport upgrades every year since 2005. At the end of May 2013, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Abdullah Gül broke the ground for the third bridge that will cross the Bosphorus Strait. The third bridge, which is due to be completed in 2016, will be the longest combined road and railway bridge in the world, with a daily capacity of 270,000 cars. Currently, 1.4 million people use rail networks in Istanbul, but this is set to increase to 7 million by 2018. The Marmaray Rail Tunnel, running beneath the Bosphorus, is scheduled for inauguration on October 29, 2013, which is Turkey's Republic Day. The line will carry 75,000 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times. The Eurasia Bosphorus Road Tunnel will run beneath the Bosphorus and connect the European and Asian sides of the city. A record-breaking ‚¬22.15 billion tender, the largest in the history of the Turkish Republic, has been completed for Istanbul's third airport. The airport will have an initial annual passenger capacity of 90 million people and is scheduled for completion by 2017. When complete, it will be among the largest airports in the world.</p><h4>Turkey has hosted a number of other major international sporting events. How has this helped the city to develop its sports facilities?</h4><p>Istanbul has forged a reputation as one of the world's leading hosts of sporting events by hosting over 40 major events in the last seven years. In 2012 alone, Istanbul hosted 12 major international sport competitions, including the IAAF World Indoor Championships, the WTA Tour Championships, and the FINA World Swimming Championships. In June and July 2013, Turkey has hosted the 17th Mediterranean Games and the FIFA U-20 World Cup. Hosting these events has helped develop a strong pool of expertise in Turkey. This was clearly demonstrated by preparations for the 17th Mediterranean Games. Under normal circumstances, countries are awarded the Games six years before the event, but Mersin stepped in 18 months ago, after Volos in Greece dropped out due to financial reasons. We successfully completed all preparations in time for the Games. The new venues were constructed by TOKİ, the same agency that will be responsible for delivering all of the Istanbul 2020 venues.</p><h4>Regardless of the outcome, what effect do you expect that the Olympic bid will have on involvement in sports and local infrastructure development in the long term?</h4><p>Istanbul's candidature concept is aligned perfectly with Vision 2023, which includes the 100th Anniversary targets of our Republic, a secular and democratic state. The government is fully committed to engaging Turkey's young population with sports and increasing sports participation throughout the country, independent of being awarded the Olympics. The National Sports Plan provides for a government investment of $500 million annually in sports participation and development programs, and this is supplemented by an additional $2.5 billion government investment. In total, 25 new stadiums and 725 sports facilities will be completed by 2014, for both elite and community sports in Turkey.</p><div class="quote">“Istanbul's candidature concept is aligned perfectly with Vision 2023."</div><h4>What are the government's priorities for sports and youth looking forward into 2013?</h4><p>Generally, we will be looking to engage Turkey's 31 million young people less than 25 years of age and increase the number that participate in sports. This will be achieved through the National Sports Plan and the huge investment in sports participation and development programs. We want to broaden the sports spectrum in Turkey, so our Olympians and Paralympians can start winning medals in a wider range of events. We have a young population and more than 500,000 students graduate from university every year. Our responsibility is to help them plan their future and ensure opportunities. Our Olympic candidature combines young people with the vision of a younger and more powerful Turkey, and it will hold the new generation together, motivate them, and activate their abilities as the well-known Olympic motto says: faster, higher, and stronger.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Mexico such a strong market for Nissan?</h4><p>We are neighbors to one of the biggest markets in the world, the US. To the south, we have a strong Latin American market that is buying close to 7 million units per year. Having 44 free trade agreements (FTAs) throughout the globe also provides great conditions for exports in Mexico. There have always been a lot of connections and trade between the cultures of Japan and Mexico. Nissan came to Mexico because of a trade mission for the Japanese government 60 years ago and decided to stay. The relevance of Mexico for Nissan is very important. We are a major generator of domestic volumes, selling about 250,000 units per year. Our production is almost 700,000 units, which we expect to grow to over 1 million in the medium term. The talent pool has grown and now Mexico is exporting talent to other operations instead of the other way around. Our latest investment is a new manufacturing complex opening in Aguascalientes, which was announced in January 2011. It is an investment of $2 billion and will start operations in December 2013. Phase I will produce over 175,000 units. In parallel, we are building a plant in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and Mexico is training the people who will work there. Mexico is absolutely becoming a center of expertise for Nissan around the globe. Our supplier base around our industry in Aguascalientes is also creating strength. We will triple our purchasing power here in the next five years, so we need the suppliers to invest in technology to give us the power to produce more vehicles in the future. This is a very successful and interesting story. We want to be the best in everything we do. We work hard and our plan is to be the best. If we are even number two, we try to figure out how we can be number one. “Good enough" is not enough. All of our 13,000 employees work hard to be the best and we are proud of them.</p><h4>What can be done to overcome the challenges posed to the industry by the lack of new car purchasers in the internal market?</h4><p>The reality is that we have a wave of products coming from the US that really limits domestic sales in Mexico. When we consider how many people we need to sell a car in Mexico compared to other markets, we come to a figure of 120. Japan, Germany, and the UK might need between 25 and 30 people. Compared to similar economies, we are right in line. The government is aware of this situation. I hope it will try to limit the number because the benefits are there. If you increase local demand, you have more people with the possibility of owning a new car. We need more competitive financing to get people in the middle class to buy a new car and help us limit the impact of the invasion of used cars from the US. It will not be a normal flow of growth. It will be achieved by limiting certain structural situations and the banking and financing community need to develop more attractive financing to get people into new cars. If we do both things at the same time, it will boost the industry and we will get closer to our full potential. We will be a country that soon produces close to 4 million cars locally. If you generate more sales, it generates more employment, which generates wealth, which attracts foreign investment. It is a cycle. Everyone will benefit. There is little poverty in Japan; most of the people are in the middle class. In Mexico, we are trying to generate wealth by getting our middle class into their own houses and cars. With 115 million people, we have huge potential. We need education and the conditions for these people to get active in credit.</p><div class="quote">“To the south, we have a strong Latin American market that is buying close to 7 million units per year."</div><p>© The Business Year - September 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>NATO has undergone a dramatic reorientation over the past 20 years, evolving from a static European bulwark against the Soviet threat to an expeditionary actor addressing a wide range of new security challenges as far afield as Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa and as diverse as missile proliferation and cyber threats. And nowhere is this transformation more evident than in the changed significance of Turkey within the Alliance. Thrust from the far end of the “Southern Flank" to the very middle point of Alliance operations and partnerships, Turkey is now serving as a crucial geographic, political, and cultural outreach asset toward the key Middle East region and is thus helping NATO meet the challenges of the 21st century.<br></p><p>NATO's new Strategic Concept, agreed upon at the 2010 Lisbon Summit, depicts a complex contemporary security environment marked by regional instability, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism threats, and the disruption of transport routes. This long enumeration of threats has a particularly familiar ring in Turkey, a country located at the crossroads of international trade and bordering areas of civil strife and instability.</p><p>For this reason, Turkey has also moved to the forefront of NATO's military, political, and conceptual responses to these security challenges. It has contributed forces to all of the Alliance's crisis response and counter-terrorism operations from 1995 to the present, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Libya as well as the maritime operations “Active Endeavor" in the Mediterranean Sea and “Ocean Shield" in the Gulf of Aden.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey has moved to the forefront of NATO's military, political, and conceptual responses to security challenges."</div><p>In the political arena, Turkey is a traditional supporter of NATO's partnerships, acting as a valuable conduit of experience and expertise to partners in the Balkans, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, in particular. And in the wake of the Arab Spring, many Allies look to Turkey to develop the potential of NATO's Mediterranean Dialogue format and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, which offers practical bilateral security cooperation to the countries of the broader Middle East region.</p><p>Ankara continues to be a powerful advocate of NATO's Open-Door Policy, which has brought new Allies into Turkey's immediate neighborhood and thereby helped to consolidate its security. Finally, Turkey has used its status as a regional player to lend diplomatic clout to Alliance efforts. Thus, former Foreign Minister Hikmet Çetin served as NATO's first Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2006.</p><p>In addition to operations and partnerships, Turkey actively supports NATO's scientific and research efforts to prevent, detect, and defend against new challenges facing the Alliance. Notably, Ankara is home to the NATO Center of Excellence on Defense against Terrorism, which serves as a focal point for allied expertise on this subject. Turkey also hosted an advanced research workshop in critical energy infrastructure protection, and regularly contributes cyber defense experts to related NATO workshops and exercises. Altogether, in the last 20 years, Turkish scientists and experts have taken part in over 400 activities within NATO's Science for Peace and Security program, with Turkey's particular regional and cultural perspective providing unique added value.</p><p>Yet, even as Turkey bolsters Alliance efforts to come to grips conceptually with the often ethereal perils of the 21st century, it continues to live in the shadow of very real threats.</p><p>At their recent December 2012 meeting, NATO Foreign Ministers made the decision to augment Turkey's air defense capabilities in order to defend the population and territory of Turkey and contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis along the Alliance's southeastern border. Significantly, NATO is to deploy patriot anti-ballistic missiles to Turkey according to the framework of the same NATO Air and Missile Defense System through which Turkey contributed its fighter aircraft to the Alliance's Baltic air policing mission in 2006. This underlines NATO's steadfast commitment to the security of the Alliance, and its full solidarity and resolve to protect its populations and territories.</p><p>Moreover, at the May 2012 Chicago Summit, the Allies unveiled the NATO Forces 2020 concept with the goal of ensuring that NATO has the capabilities needed to undertake the full range of operations that may be required to achieve the security to which the Alliance is collectively committed.</p><p>One means of achieving this goal is Smart Defense, which is designed to encourage allies to develop capabilities more efficiently and cost-effectively through multinational approaches and better prioritization. Another way to attain NATO Forces 2020 is the Connected Forces Initiative, which aims to maintain the inter-operability and collective deployability built up in NATO operations, for example through bolstering the NATO Response Force, enhancing NATO education, training and exercises, and the better use of technology.</p><p>Turkey continues to be well placed to support these initiatives. It participates in 55 Smart Defense projects and proposals and is poised to contribute more to the multilateral development of capabilities, as its industrial potential and business links with other NATO countries expand. Moreover, as the host of a Partnership for Peace Training Center in Ankara and the new Land Command of the reformed NATO Command Structure in Izmir, Turkey possesses unique assets to enhance the interoperability and deployability of  NATO forces.</p><p>Most importantly, Turkey's 60 years of collective experience within a now 28-nation strong alliance, coupled with the benefits and obligations of solidarity, offer strong arguments for its continued engagement at the center of NATO. In short, one can confidently state that as Turkey acquires more importance for NATO, NATO also acquires more importance  or Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will plans to privatize Turkish railroads affect the sector in the coming years?<br></h4><p>As air traffic increases and highways become more cluttered, countries are reconsidering the role and importance of rail transport as a viable transportation option. Parallel to the growth of global trade, countries are working to open new and alternative transport corridors. Railways are undergoing significant structural and technical changes in order to keep up with these developments. As a result, railway networks are getting an overhaul worldwide. The aim is to open the railway sector up to competition, not only for the sector to compete with other transportation sectors, but also to allow more than one operator to benefit from Turkey's railway network.</p><h4>What will privatization in the energy sector mean?</h4><p>The Turkish energy sector is strong and has huge growth potential. The Turkish electricity sector is one of the biggest and fastest growing sectors in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In line with population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and economic growth, the sector is expected to surpass GDP growth yet again. The growth potential of the sector is expected to continue for a long time yet, considering Turkey's per capita electricity consumption is still far below that of developed countries. The objective behind the privatization of the electricity sector and the creation of a competitive open market is to ensure that consumers have better quality at their disposal, as well as lower prices. With these privatizations, the efficient management of electricity production and distribution will be obtained and electricity loss and theft along distribution routes will be curtailed. Electricity distribution and trade will become more competitive, investments will be realized with private sector involvement, and regulatory changes made by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) will be of added benefit to consumers.</p><h4>How are the ongoing port privatizations going to contribute to Turkey's aim to become a center of maritime trade in the region?</h4><p>Turkey is centrally located in the middle of various trade routes, and international trade has an important place in Turkey's growth strategies. As with many other countries, maritime trade has a very important place in Turkey's international trade. That's why it's crucial that Turkey's ports are at the desired level in line with our foreign trade objectives. There is extensive investment in ports, both from the public and the private sectors. With privatizations in recent years, we have attained important successes as we have seen a huge increase in productivity in the privatized ports, and these have contributed greatly to the national economy. Besides privatization, many established firms have built ports in different areas and regions, and these facilities have experienced an important increase in productivity. In the public sector, the Filyos, Mersin, and Çandarlı Port projects are very important investment initiatives. The aim of all these investments is to create the necessary port infrastructure and capacity for Turkey to realize its trade objectives.</p><h4>How has privatization been a benefit to the Turkish economy?</h4><p>Until now, Turkey has earned $51.3 billion from privatizations, with $36.3 billion of these funds going directly to the treasury and other public institutions. Many companies and operations that have for many years placed a financial burden on our public finances and economy have now been turned into profit-making assets. The amount of FDI attained as a result of these privatizations stands at $18 billion. In most privatized entities, there has been an increase in production, job creation, investment, and foreign trade figures. However, the main objective of privatization isn't just profit, but also to create competition in the market, to use resources efficiently and productively, and to increase service and product quality. Scientific research has shown time and again that our privatization efforts brought about very positive developments in many different sectors.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the Turkish economy?</h4><p>Our privatization revenue objectives have been determined in line with developments in the international economy. Over 1Q2013, $3 billion has gone to the Treasury and other institutions. We also expect a further $7.8 billion from projects with sale and transfer agreements already signed or ratified, and another $4.6 billion from projects awaiting ratification, bringing the total amount of revenue privatization by the end of 2013 to $12.4 billion. Developments in the global markets after 2014 will directly affect our expectations regarding privatization, while the rallying of the world economy in 2012 and 2013 should lead to greater privatization revenue overall.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[always-on-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering your company's global reach, what importance do you give Turkey within DHL's international portfolio?</h4><p>Very early on we recognized the potential of Turkey for our company. In 1981 we were the first company to offer international express services in the country. Later, we were the first express company to establish a fully owned subsidiary in Turkey. Turkey's geostrategic importance is a huge factor. The country serves as a bridge between East and West, Europe and the Middle East, and also as a bridge between cultures and civilizations. Over the last 10 to 15 years, based on growing domestic demand and exports to Europe and the US, we have seen the Turkish economy go from strength to strength and we have been very proud to be a part of this development. These days we are excited to see new trade lanes emerging; countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE are suddenly amongst our fastest growing destinations, even in absolute terms. A shift is occurring, new relationships in different regions are developing, and we're promoting these new relationships and investing in them. Today, we are more than twice or almost three times larger than our nearest competitor. It has always been a very strong and stable environment for us, and the last decade has been even better in terms of revenue and profitability. The inflows we're generating into Turkey and the outflows we're generating from Turkey are roughly the same size, which is good for us, and fits well into Turkey's goal of growing exports. As for our part, we're seeing equilibrium in imports and exports. Our revenues are heavily export driven, and even our import business is export related, because a lot of the things we're importing are samples, spare parts, and project-driven items that usually create new exports. We're a very localized player in Turkey, and we apply the typical DHL strategy, which is to leverage the power of the network with a very localized team and a localized approach. It has served us very well. Strengthening exports for Turkey isn't just good for Turkey, but also good for DHL. Hence, DHL has been a very active promoter of strengthening Turkey's position as an exporter.</p><h4>In which sectors are you seeing the most demand for Turkish exports?</h4><p>The traditional export segments continue to dominate, although they've all slowed down a bit. The leading segments by far are textiles, automotive, technology, and electronics. Automotive has done better than we expected over 2013. Textiles showed a heterogeneous structure. Some customers are doing very well, especially those with links to Russia and the Middle East, while others are struggling, particularly those that export mainly to Germany and the UK. It hasn't been a homogeneous development this year. We also see first signs of Turkey shifting from a mere production hub for the “old economies" into developing its own brands and strong international OEMs. Expanding this will be crucial in sustaining the success of Turkish exports in the medium to long term. The firms that expand to foreign markets find the chance to revamp their operations in line with the know-how and new technologies they obtain in the international markets as well as the norms that force them to manufacture on a global scale. As Turkey continues to take firm steps forward toward its target of $500 billion in exports, each move made in exports plays an important role in the creation of new business opportunities. To show our commitment to support the efforts of Turkish exporters with the aim of developing, enriching, and diversifying Turkey's export mix, we host them at the “Stars of Exports" competition every year, which recognizes the achievements of firms that shape Turkey's push in exports.</p><h4>Within the newly emerging trade lanes that you mentioned, what are Turkey's advantages for being an integrated logistics hub?</h4><p>International trade is never independent of the basic economy, and trading has always been and will always be a key to the prosperity of the Turkish economy. Turkey, specifically the Istanbul area, rises as a leading international logistics and transportation hub with the advantages of its dynamic, stable, and attractive economy, increasing foreign trade, growing FDI, young population, low-cost labor, strength in pipeline transport, strong highway fleet, and its very central role regarding many upcoming markets and trading routes. Overall, I can say that Turkey has the right dynamics to become a major logistics hub. However, to better utilize Turkey's potential, we should increase the coordination in infrastructure investments both by the government and the private sector, as well as the magnitude and speed of these investments. Further steps should be taken to invest in customs procedures, especially to simplify import and export shipments as well as for improvements in the e-customs program to implement modernized customs processes in Turkey. As the market leader in the industry, our mission here is to increase our investments in new trade lanes in parallel with Turkey's objectives. We will resolutely sustain our efforts to expand our infrastructure and, as part of our exporters' pursuit of new markets, we will continue to offer services aimed at facilitating Turkish exporters' access to new customers and markets. Besides that, we will carry on our investments in technologies in order to support the fast and efficient integration of our customers into global markets. We always use cutting-edge technology and e-com solutions both through internet and mobile platforms.</p><h4>How has being a global company with a strongly localized presence in Turkey affected your management style?</h4><p>DHL is the most international company in the world. Taking our strength from this global network, DHL Express Turkey is very proud to connect Turkey to the rest of the world faster and more reliably than any other transportation company in the world. Keeping this in mind, you could answer this question from two angles. If you come here as an expatriate, you'll feel like this is very much a local company. On the other hand, if you've grown up in Turkish companies for 10 or 12 years of your business life and then came to work here, it would all be so different than a classic Turkish company. We're trying to combine the best of both worlds. This is a global network, and the power of this network we call “as one." The sending country and the receiving country work hand-in-hand, and this produces the quality that our customers want and expect. Hence, we need global procedures and global standards, and we need people to be able to speak to each other in English and run 24/7 operations. On the other hand, we're trying to be really local in the sense that we seek to exploit opportunities in the local market, use local energy, local motivation, and the local power of the people. Approximately 99.9% of our employees are Turkish citizens. Thinking globally and acting locally is more than a buzz word for us; it is an everyday reality. To give a very simple example: by combining the unparalleled global strength of our network with the unparalleled Turkish hospitality we created a product called “DHL Gift Express," through which companies can very easily buy and ship gifts from a DHL catalogue to anywhere around the world.</p><h4>What is your broader outlook for the Turkish economy in the medium term, and where do you see DHL within that outlook?</h4><p>As the express industry is an excellent but not leading current indicator for economic developments, we prefer to focus on the near term and leave the medium term forecasting to the economists. However, in the long term I can say that if Turkey keeps pushing the right agenda, it has healthy fundamentals upon which to build a solid future for economic prosperity. Turkey has huge potential, but some areas could also be improved. For example, the disunity between the labor market and the education system must be eliminated by investing more in education. The reality is that while in some professions there are serious job vacancies, while on the other hand in other professions college graduates can't find jobs, should be reversed. Additionally, the cooperation between industry and universities should strengthen. The simplification and re-covering of the customs legislation and the re-organization of the clauses will not only relieve companies and simplify processes, but also make sure the economy grows more strongly. Lastly, we observe that the Turkish economy is becoming more dependent on construction. Although this dependency keeps the economy alive in the short term, it can create a bubble in the long term, as seen in other countries. In order to have a stronger and more stable economy, production should be escalated and the dependency on Europe should be reduced. These three themes must be taken onto the agenda for Turkey to use its potential more  efficiently.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the appeal of Turkey for Gulf investors, and how does this determine your asset-allocation strategy?<br></h4><p>Turkey has begun to represent stability, continued growth, and a strategic presence for the Gulf and its investors. We realize that there are areas in Turkey that could be purposeful investment destinations for the Gulf, and especially Saudi Arabia. Since the country abandoned self-sustainment policies three or four years ago, Saudi Arabia is now one of the largest commodity buyers in the world. Its businesses are acquiring farms and food-processing companies in order to establish direct food security. Considering the agricultural or food-processing aspects of the business, there are major opportunities. We have a food-related supply chain, and we're also active in the resort and leisure real estate arena. Up until the last three or four months, the Gulf, from an investment standpoint in real estate, has been pretty vacant, but Turkey has been excellent. We have many oil and gas investors. Since we are Gulf-owned and driven, in the framework of the purposeful investing philosophy, Turkey was found to be very strategic in the areas of food-related supply chain, leisure and retail, and energy. This is where we will be heavily focused.</p><h4>How would you characterize the framework for foreign investors in Turkey?</h4><p>The groundwork for investing here is wonderful. The government understands that in order to attract alternative capital, it has to harness the ability to earn alternative capital returns. Because the savings rate in the country is not high enough to create sufficient liquidity levels in the banks to invest, the government works to attract FDI. The government is making sure that it sets the rules to attract non-sovereign money. In this country, there's not a huge amount of capital available to borrow unless it is private FDI. The government knows that, and it is trying to promote FDI through a variety of mechanisms.</p><h4>How would you characterize the demand for interest-free finance products in Turkey?</h4><p>There was recently a sukuk launched by the government, and Turkey is now realizing that there is an appetite for this type of finance product. The appetite might be a little less than perceived, since a sovereign bond is very different from a corporate or a private placement bond, but it is there. We have a presence in Malaysia and a close relationship with Islamic players in that country. They came to us and asked to use our asset management window to create funds for their own placement in Turkey or in Malaysia. We were a pioneer in this industry, and though we would like to create funds for Turkey, I would be perfectly happy running funds for other people as well, since we know the market. It is common to have firm-run funds for other companies. The funds are doing well, and we have experienced another year of positives. Most investors will put their discretionary savings into equities, since most of the yields have money-market aspects. Sovereign rates are down, so even though people have a belief that they will get double-digit returns on everything, it's very difficult if you're involved in low-risk liquid investments. There is an incorrect belief here that in participation banks you get a discount, and a stigma that you will get less with sharia-compliant products, but that's not always the case—it depends on the nature of the funds.</p><h4>What has made Alkhair a pioneer in its field, and what is your vision for the company over the medium term?</h4><p>We are in the first generation of Islamic investment banks. Between 2003 and 2007, about 80% of the current Islamic investment bank initiatives were launched. There was a belief that a huge pool of capital was Islamic and wanted to be invested. However, about 75% of the starters failed because they were undercapitalized and did not have the geographic attenuation to invest with expertise. There is a core set of pioneers, such as Alkhair, which got into lending, asset management, and brokerage as a banking model with an Islamic brand. We have the first funds in Turkey and one of the first tradable sukuks in Saudi Arabia. It's been difficult and expensive because the market wasn't there—we had to create it. In 10 years, I expect us to be about three times this size. There might be a consolidation of Islamic investment banks by investment retail banks seeking investment expertise in Islamic banking, and many institutions will expand internationally as retail banks use heavy advertising campaigns globally. Alkhair Capital could be pulled into one of those trends, since we are broad enough and geographically present with the appropriate expertise, licensing, and the executives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bizim Securities (BMD) grown and developed since 2003?<br></h4><p>BMD started as a boutique investment institution in 2003, and began with an agency agreement with Family Finance. We started offering capital market services to the clients of private finance houses in 2003. Although we are a conventional company, we developed know-how in interest-free investment products. Family Finance was similar to Islamic-style banks abroad, which have been called “participation banks" since 2006 in Turkey. Before 2003, there were no compliant interest-free investment vehicle products in Turkey, and no regulations. The regulations have changed and become more flexible to cover interest-free investment products and tools. In 2003, the finance houses as they were became participation banks and are now regulated by the banking laws. We work with all four Turkish participation banks at the moment, and are their exclusive investment institution. BMD provides capital market services and products for all of the participations banks' clients, including brokerage services and other integrated investment services, such as investment consulting, IPOs, asset management, and similar investment services. That is where most of our growth comes from. We have developed an expertise in Turkey, and now this is the only institution that has an exclusive partnership with more than one bank and serves as an interest-free capital market service and products provider. We started with a few hundred clients, and now have over 50,000. We are almost in the top 10 in terms of assets under custody in Turkey, and we are in the top five in terms of corporate finance revenues coming from IPOs, M&amp;As, and similar activities. We are one of the largest brokerage houses in Turkey in terms of client size and assets under custody.</p><h4>How would you characterize the demand for access to capital markets among interest-sensitive investors?</h4><p>At the beginning, it was huge because there had previously been no market at all. The growth rates naturally became very high, some at 300% or 400% per year. We started with a few hundred clients in 2003 and by 2007 we had close to 20,000 clients. Since there were no products to supply, we provided investment funds and brokerage services for participation banks. The demand was comparatively large. It has diminished over time, but we have been the fastest-growing brokerage house in Turkey since 2006. Back then, we started with one bank, Türkiye Finans, then made an agreement with alBaraka in 2007, Kuveyt Türk in 2008, and Bank Asya in 2009. As we made agreements with the banks, the clients came from these institutions to us. We saw both types of clients; the first being those who had worked with conventional institutions before and who were the clients of participation banks. When they heard that we provided investment services, they came from those institutions. The second type of customer had never been introduced to the capital markets at all; they were fresh, new clients who hadn't been trained or introduced and didn't know anything about the kinds of products on the market. We are trying to push products through participation banking channels. Usually, we are the initiator of demand by introducing products and explaining what these products do. Both people and institutions need to be aware of the products that exist. Because the participation banks never worked in this way, they were not aware of how we investment bankers can add to the value of an institution. This is transforming gradually.</p><h4>What was the significance of the Participation Index to interest-free finance in Turkey?</h4><p>It is a fruit of the process that began in 2003. Back then, the participation-banking sector had no products at all and the Participation Index defined the standards of interest-free investments and equities in Turkey for the first time. To me, this is the most important part of the Participation Index. Turkey didn't have regulations or sector standards. We are the initiator because we have worked with all of the participation banks in Turkey, and we know their expectations and demands for these standards. These are the mutual standards approved by all of participation banks. The other important part is that it's an index in which we can establish investment products, such as ETFs. Now, we expect an increase in the number of licensees. BMD is not an index provider company, but there was no other institution that could do the job, and so we stepped up to the plate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Located in both Asia and Europe, Turkey is a country with a long history and a splendid culture. Istanbul was the gateway to Europe for the ancient Silk Road, and now plays an important bridging and linking role in the China-Turkey friendship. The friendship between China and Turkey goes back to ancient times. The world-famous Silk Road has linked our two peoples together. The exquisite Chinese porcelain collection at the Topkapı Palace is the evidence of a history of friendly exchanges between us. I'm deeply impressed by Turkey's long history, beautiful scenery, and remarkable achievements in development. In recent years, Turkey initiated internal reform, opened up to the world, maintained political stability, and achieved rapid economic growth. People's living standards here have improved significantly. Turkey has become one of the most attractive and dynamic economies in the region and throughout the world. The country is playing an increasingly important role in international and regional affairs. The Chinese people are sincerely happy about the achievements of the Turkish people.<br></p><p>With the concerted efforts of the two governments and peoples since the establishment of diplomatic ties 41 years ago, bilateral relations have made considerable progress. In recent years, we have maintained close, high-level exchanges, our mutual political trust has been growing, and our cooperation and exchanges in economic, technological, cultural, and other arenas have been expanding. The two countries announced a strategic partnership in October 2010, which in particular laid a good foundation for the deepening and development of bilateral relations.</p><p>Our two countries have different gifts. We enjoy strong economic bonds and have great potential and broad prospects for further trade and economic cooperation. We have a lot to accomplish together. With the continuous development of bilateral relations in recent years, the economic and trade cooperation between us has entered the best period in its history and has shown four outstanding characteristics. First, there has been rapid growth in bilateral trade. According to the statistics from our side, our bilateral trade volume increased from less than $1 billion in 2001 to $18.7 billion in 2011, an increase of nearly 18 times. According to statistics from the Turkish side, our bilateral trade volume is as high as $24.1 billion. At present, China has become Turkey's third-largest trading partner. Chinese mechanical and electronic products, clothing, and daily necessities are well received by Turkish consumers, while Turkish mineral products, textiles, chemical raw materials, and agricultural products such as hazelnuts are very popular in China. Second, there has been an accelerating growth of mutually beneficial economic cooperation. Since 2001, the total value of various types of project contracts signed by Chinese enterprises in Turkey has exceeded $10 billion, with the completed turnover exceeding $4 billion. Among the projects, Phase II of the Ankara-Istanbul High-speed Railway, the largest cooperative project between China and Turkey, has been progressing smoothly since the start of the project. Third, there has been further improvement in institutional arrangements for economic and trade cooperation. We have established multi-layered, multi-area dialogue, and consultation mechanisms centering on the subjects of mutual interest such as plans for the development of long-term economic and trade cooperation, project financing, cooperation in third countries, interconnectivity, and trade remedies, and also reached a series of cooperation agreements that have further consolidated the basis for bilateral economic and trade cooperation and have effectively advanced the related work. Fourth, more potential is unfolding for mutual investment. In recent years, there has been a steady increase of Turkish investment in China. The investment of Chinese enterprises in Turkey has also made breakthroughs. In light of the economic strength of the two countries, the potential for mutual investment cooperation is still far from being fully exploited. The Chinese government will continue to guide and encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in Turkey and is willing to cooperate with the Turkish government in amending the bilateral investment protection accord and other relevant laws and regulations so as to create a better investment environment for cooperation between our enterprises.</p><p>In 2012, Turkey held the “Year of Chinese Culture" in Turkey, while in 2013 China will host the “Year of Turkish Culture" in China. We should work together to run these events successfully, which will contribute to deepening mutual understanding and friendship between our two peoples. In the future, we should continue to strengthen cultural and people-to-people exchanges and further consolidate the social basis of the strategic partnership. In addition, we should actively promote cooperation in tourism and the interconnectivity of our roads and railways so as to benefit our peoples.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Turkey's progress toward achieving its Vision 2023 goals for the economy?<br></h4><p>The Turkish economy has undergone a profound economic transformation recently. Although Turkey has experienced deep crises in its history, now it has become one of the main actors in the global economy. Owing to the appropriate policy implementation aimed at solving the structural problems of the economy, the negative impact of the global financial crisis on the Turkish economy has been very limited. Today, Turkey has focused on sustainable long-term targets instead of short-term ones. In order to reach the long-term targets, the Vision 2023 strategy was prepared for the centenary anniversary of the Turkish Republic. The goal of the strategy is to support Turkey in its ambition to become one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2023 through fast and sustained growth. Achieving a GDP of $2 trillion, reaching $500 billion in merchandise exports, $150 billion in service exports, and taking a 1.5% share of the world's merchandise trade are the targets of Vision 2023. Recently, Turkey has showed a remarkable economic performance. Owing to properly implemented policy measures, Turkey will be able to reach its long-term targets. Past successes are the precursor of coming successes. Turkish exports, which were $31.1 billion in 2002, have increased more than four fold, up to $152.5 billion in 2012. In this way, Turkey has exceeded the export target of $149.5 billion in the Medium-term Program (MTP). Foreign trade volumes, which were $87.6 billion in 2002, have increased up to $389 billion in 2012, and service exports, which were realized at $14 billion in 2002, have increased up to $44 billion in 2012. The major problem of the Turkish economy, which is the current account deficit, has declined by 36.8% in 2012 compared to the previous year, down to $47.5 billion, which is considerably below the medium-term target of $58.7 billion. On the other hand, the strategic plans, formed in light of the 2023 export strategy, contain some concrete elements designed to fight the structural problems prevailing in the production and export scheme of Turkey. Through supporting the 2023 strategy with export-oriented production strategies and input supply strategies, we are looking to enhance exports, advance the export-oriented production system, restrain imports, and increase the prosperity level of Turkey by focusing on employment and foreign investment, among other things. Furthermore, channeling savings toward high value-added investments, increasing production and employment, encouraging large-scale and strategic investment that will increase the competitiveness, and increasing FDI inflows are the targets of the new investment incentive schemes. At the Ministry of Economy, we have been taking new steps in line with the Vision 2023 targets day by day, and in this way Turkey will reach the level that it deserves in the future.</p><h4>What effect will Moody's foreign currency credit rating upgrade have on FDI inflows over the medium term?</h4><p>Foreign direct investors take many parameters into account during their decision process, including the economic growth of a country, its prospects, the local market, export possibilities, infrastructure, and the availability of qualified labor. While credit rating agencies also analyze such criteria and reflect those in their ratings, their analyses are much more relevant to financial institutions and financial investments. Direct investors are also interested in the sophistication of financial markets and the availability of credit facilities, but it is not their sole concern. Therefore, in terms of foreign direct investors, the ratings of such institutions are not a major factor in their investment decision process. Still, some investment companies, or consulting companies who provide services for investment decision processes, take the credit ratings very seriously. In some cases, while deciding on a country to invest in, investors may only consider countries that are above a certain credit rating and disregard the remaining countries. Although I believe that this is not a realistic approach for direct investments, Turkey has been upgraded and now it is more possible that our country will be caught on the radar of a certain group of investors who have not previously considered Turkey.</p><h4>As the uncertainty over the future of the eurozone continues, how relevant is the EU accession process for Turkey's future?</h4><p>Despite the economic crisis in the EU, and specifically in the eurozone, Turkey demonstrates its determination to receive full membership of the EU on every occasion. Reforms carried out by Turkey in the framework of the EU accession process aim to fasten Turkey's economic and social development process to increase the welfare and living standards of Turkish citizens, in addition to the purpose of satisfying necessary criteria in the process of EU membership.</p><div class="quote">“The negative impact of the global financial crisis on the Turkish economy has been very limited."</div><p>Turkey's current position also verifies this situation. Despite the global economic crisis, thanks to stable macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and a strong financial sector, Turkey is seen as an example of economic success by many countries in the world. In the current crisis atmosphere faced by the EU, opportunities presented by Turkey become clearer. Today, Turkey is in a strong position to contribute to the EU's economy, rather than being a burden.</p><h4>Prime Minister Erdoğan's first diplomatic trip in 2013 was to Africa. How would you characterize the significance of Turkey's economic relations with the continent?</h4><p>Turkey, with its advanced economy, skilled labor force, and experience in international markets, is committed to further increasing its existing trade and investment relations with African countries. This determination has led us to devise and implement a new development strategy toward African countries that we initiated back in 2003. From the initiation of our strategy toward Africa, we have had noteworthy outcomes and these give us  the power and courage to continue exerting our efforts in an accelerated way. Turkish-African relations, and our strategy, are not subject to only economic and commercial targets; the most important point for us is that we have an integrated policy that includes the development of Africa and regular humanitarian aid. From an economic and commercial point of view, the total trade between Turkey and Africa, which was $5.5 billion in 2003, reached $23 billion in 2013, meaning an increase of 318%. In the framework of our targets for 2023, trade volume with Africa is expected to reach approximately $100 billion by 2023. The financial support that our Ministry provides to our firms in order to reach higher figures in trade will continue in the forthcoming period. It is one of our priorities to further improve the cooperation between Turkish and African firms in the context of both trade delegations and buyers' missions. Our investments, which are concentrated mainly in North Africa, are approaching $6 billion for African and Turkish construction firms, which have undertaken infrastructure and superstructure projects worth over $45.5 billion cumulatively. In the framework of 2023 targets, the total amount of Turkish investments is expected to reach around $20 billion. Turkey has embassies in 32 countries in Africa. The number of Commercial Counselor Offices reached 23 in 2012, whereas this number was only 12 in 2003. Our efforts continue to complete the legal framework of our commercial and economic relations with all African countries, in order to eliminate the obstacles faced by our entrepreneurs who are expanding their businesses there. At present, Turkey has completed commercial, economic, and technical cooperation agreements with 38 countries, FTAs with four, agreements on the avoidance of double taxation with eight, and agreements on reciprocal promotion and the protection of investments with 12 African countries. To sum up, Turkey is well aware of the increasing importance of Africa. With our unique, inclusive, and collaborative approach, which has already been appreciated by every African nation that we have interacted with, we will walk hand-in-hand with our African brothers and sisters to a bright future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Turkey's progress toward achieving its Vision 2023 goals for the economy?</h4><p>Turkey is progressively approaching its Vision 2023 goals for the economy. Turkey aims to be one of the top 10 economies in the world by 2023 with an economy of $2 trillion, exports of $500 billion, and GDP per capita of $25,000. We have more than a decade ahead of us to achieve these targets. Our economic performance over the last decade is a testament to our future goals. Over the past decade, the Turkish economy has more than tripled in size, reaching $786 billion as of 2012, while GDP per capita soared to $10,000, up from $3,500. Similarly, Turkey's exports more than quadrupled, exceeding $150 billion by the end of 2012. If all of this was achieved in a decade, then Turkey can achieve more than that over the next decade.</p><h4>Fitch upgraded Turkey's sovereign credit rating to investment grade in late 2012. How do you expect this to impact foreign investment inflows in 2013?</h4><p>Fitch's upgrade is a clear indicator of the increasing confidence in the Turkish economy. Confidence is essential to any kind of investment, be it domestic or foreign. In a time of economic and financial crises, confidence has gained even more importance. As such, Turkey is offering a safe haven for foreign investors in many areas. Foreign investors had been increasing their investments in Turkey long before Fitch upgraded the country. Fitch's upgrade is just a vindication of what has been going on in the Turkish economy.</p><h4>How has the continued uncertainty in the eurozone affected foreign investment inflows, and what steps is ISPAT taking to attract FDI from a more diverse range of sources?</h4><p>In the face of uncertainty in the eurozone, we have been diversifying the sources of FDI inflows to Turkey. We have developed specific strategies to attract FDI from Asian countries, such as Japan, China, and India, as well as from the Gulf countries and the US. Our efforts have yielded results; we have managed to attract large-scale investments from diverse sources, such as Aditya Birla and Polyplex from India, Sumitomo Rubber Industries and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi from Japan, and 3M from the US. Gulf countries have also been increasing their investments in Turkey. They have recently invested in areas such as energy, finance, real estate, retail, and many other sectors.</p><div class="quote">“Fitch's upgrade is just a vindication of what has been going on in the Turkish economy."</div><h4>How would you assess Istanbul's potential to become an international financial center, and what steps is the government taking to promote foreign investment in the field?</h4><p>Considering its geostrategic location, vibrant local economy, skilled labor force, and technological infrastructure, Istanbul is a perfect candidate to be an international financial center. Today, many multinational companies are already using Istanbul as a hub to manage their operations in the region. They have been relocating their regional headquarters to Istanbul, from where they manage dozens of countries. Moreover, today, more than half of foreign companies established in Turkey are in Istanbul. In regard to promoting foreign investment in the finance sector, the government has already taken the necessary actions to boost foreign investment in the area. With a strong regulatory environment, Turkey's financial sector has been the most attractive sector in terms of FDI over the past decade, attracting around $40 billion between 2002 and 2012.</p><h4>What are ISPAT's FDI goals for 2013, and what is your strategy to achieve them?</h4><p>Turkey's economic potential suggests that FDI inflows correspond to 3%-4% of its economy. That is an annual figure of between $20 billion and $30 billion. Our goal is to realize Turkey's economic potential and make it one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Turkish economy in 2013?</h4><p>After robust economic growth in 2010 and 2011, the Turkish economy rebalanced in 2012. Despite the ongoing economic risks in the eurozone, the Turkish economy will grow by around 4% in 2013. If the eurozone can weather down the potential risks, then Turkey will even grow faster than  expectations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of FNSS Savunma Sistemleri in the Turkish defense sector?</h4><p>FNSS was the first private defense company in Turkey, established back in 1988. It became operational in 1990. At the beginning, we thought this was going to be an eight-year company with just a single contract, because the purpose of the company was to produce 1,700 armored combat vehicles (ACVs) for the Turkish Armed Forces under a single contract signed with the Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (SSM). That program was extended for another two years and it went on until 1999. In the meantime, we had offset obligations that brought the question of whether we could export products. We started to investigate export possibilities, and there turned out to be real opportunities. The first 10 years of FNSS were taken up by licensed production. From 2000 on, it became more focused on the development of new products, more engineering, and, of course, it became more export oriented. After 2005, we won two indigenous development products with the Turkish Ministry of National Defense: the amphibious assault bridge and the amphibious earthmover.</p><h4>As Turkey's first private sector defense company, what kind of unique challenges did you face?</h4><p>During the very first days of the ACV contract, nobody knew how to conduct the acceptance process or how to handle the changes. The user was experienced in employing equipment simply given to it previously. For us and the user, though, it became a challenge to come up with a platform upon which we agreed what was required and how we were to meet all of the customer's requirements and produce according to budgetary and time constraints. In our first contracts there were terms and conditions missing that today are very essential to conducting business. It was a learning process at first.  The big challenge was to gain the confidence of the customer and manage the contract effectively. Since then, over the last 22 years, not only FNSS but also the rest of the Turkish defense sector has shown perfect progress, where we can manage very complex international defense programs.</p><h4>How has that experience benefited your current operations?</h4><p>It was a big experience—everybody learned a lot. In retrospect, what we did proved to be right, even considering the mistakes we made. It was a big experience for SSM and for FNSS. Most of the people in top management positions at SSM have been raised through the Turkish ACV program. After struggling for the first couple of years, it turned out to be one of the best examples within the Turkish defense industry.</p><div class="quote">“We want FNSS to be the biggest land systems company in Turkey."</div><h4>How has the perception of the Turkish defense sector changed since FNSS has been in business?</h4><p>To make a defense export contract successful, a few factors are required. These include a strong proven product, a good price, and sound relations between the two countries involved. In addition, trust in the company is also a must. At that time, however, FNSS was still a new, unproven company. Of course, the US brand names that we were working with provided comfort to our customers. They then saw the quality of our products and our level of service. Today, however, we hide the US flag in many cases. I would not compare FNSS with the rest of  the industry. However, as a private entity, everybody knows and respects FNSS in the regions we operate, and that sort of reputation does not happen overnight. It is the result of several successful contracts, timely delivery, overall quality, and, moreover, sticking behind your product after the sale, which is an important part of defense. You do not gain confidence through advertisements or by appearing in newspapers. This is not the way it works. This is a sector in which you deal with the end user directly, so you cannot lie or manipulate events. The product either works or it does not. In many ways, the sector is different from others, but that is an important distinction: there are no layers between the manufacturer and the end user.</p><h4>What does Turkey need to do to increase the availability of local content for defense manufacturers and to allow its defense industry to move up the value chain?</h4><p>What I will say is consistent with SSM's strategy. We have top-level companies like FNSS and TAI, and we must not increase the number of these companies. We need to support the development of second-tier companies, and those should be coming from the bottom. That takes a lot of R&amp;D, some basic studies, and the incorporation of all of the authorities, organizations, and universities. A good example for land systems is gearboxes. On the subject of gearbox design and production, we can do something here and we are doing something. In an ideal world, I want to be in a position where I can call my gearbox company and say I want such and such a design and I am sending you inputs and outputs—just design me something. And that is the biggest strength of Western companies. In Germany you have that support; in the US you do as well. Here we have to struggle with all of these subcomponents and work to educate vendors. An option is to do everything in house, but then I would need a facility 10 times the size and another 5,000 people to deal with. This is not the right way. We need experienced companies to support not just FNSS, but all of the top-level companies. That way, they would not suffer from big business risks. If my business goes down a little bit they could balance their load with other companies. For land systems, another example is that we need some basic capabilities with materials like armor steel. We need to invest in that area in Turkey. Again, basic industries like power packs, engines, and transmissions are needed. I know this cannot happen overnight, and I am not talking about conventional engines and power packs necessarily. Everybody produces those. I am talking maybe about  fuel cells and electric drives, which are the future. We need to spend time on things that will make Turkey unique in certain areas. There is not much left to do with internal combustion engines.</p><h4>What is your vision for FNSS over the next decade?</h4><p>We want FNSS to be the biggest land systems company in Turkey. We want to be the local defense company for foreign and friendly countries. That means we are going to work very hard to get more business, aggressively, within Turkey. Also, we will continue to explore in order to spread our products throughout the world, mainly in the Middle East and Far East. However, Eastern Europe is also coming into our focus. The next target—once they are released from their Russian influence in terms of old military equipment—are the Turkic republics. Based on our research and analysis, our plan is to reach turnover levels of $400 million to $500 million a year. We want to reach that level in the next five years, and in the five years after that we intend to stay at that level while getting ready for the next jump. This is based on our current strategic plan, and we are about to revise our strategic plan over the coming years. We think this is achievable. For 15 years we have been on average a $100 million company. From 2005 to 2008, we dropped down to $25 million to $30 million a year, which put us into survival mode. We reached levels above $100 million for the last four years, and in 2012 we are jumping up to $180 million. Over these periods we have gone from being a company with 450 people, to 140 people, to nearly 800 people currently. So over the last four years there has been a huge jump, and we want to reinforce our current position for some time before making the next big jump, which has already been planned.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given the size of both the Turkish and US economies, how would you characterize the volume of trade and investment between the two?<br></h4><p>The US is the world's largest economy, and Turkey ranks 17th with an aim to enter the top 10 by 2023. With the importance of both economies in mind, the trade flow between the two is nowhere near where you would expect it to be. Although large multinational companies, such as TABA members Honeywell and Motorola, are familiar with the Turkish market, mid-sized companies remain uninformed about the potential that Turkey offers. For example, many US companies are importing products from Mexico, which they are likely to get for a better price and higher quality in Turkey. Although globalization has made the world smaller, we still see a lot of information gaps that prevent the right markets from finding each other. There is unrealized trade potential between many countries, but the commercial component of the Turkish-American relationship is dwarfed by the level of political and military integration between the two countries. We have been talking about developing the potential in our commercial relations for decades now, but we have finally reached a point that the size and quality of our trade is growing and we are seeing more and more bilateral investment. The commitment of the government of Turkey has been an important incentive as well in this regard. Minister of Economy Zafer Çağlayan has identified the US as a key priority, which helps us to create the right level of awareness and infrastructure needed to seize this momentum.</p><h4>What role is Turkish investment playing in the US?</h4><p>The US-Turkish economic relationship cannot be described solely by looking at trade flows anymore. Now, we are seeing mutual investments back and forth, and not just in traditional areas such as textiles. For example, Eczacıbaşı has acquired a company in the US called Capintec, which is producing nuclear measurement devices. Sarkuysan, a leading producer of copper wires in Turkey, has established Sark-USA with its headquarters in Albany, New York, and therefore now has a solid base of operation and production in the US. Similarly, there are companies like EA Havacılık that have made successful aerospace investments. These are large Turkish companies moving into the US and making sizeable investments, but there are also many Turkish-American entrepreneurs that have started their own companies in the US. There are a lot of exciting stories there. For example, the Sierra Nevada Corporation, which is involved in the aerospace and defense industry, was founded and is run by a husband and wife team from Turkey who now reside in the US. The company employs more than 3,000 people and has a turnover that surpasses $2 billion. This is an amazing success story. Another example is entrepreneur and philanthropist Yalçin Ayaslı, as well as the popular yogurt company Chobani, which was founded by Hamdi Ulukaya. But there are more success stories that people are unaware of, and they are taking place in aviation, aerospace, defense, and high-technology industries, and this is what is truly exciting me.</p><h4>To what extent should the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the US and the EU be a priority for Turkey?</h4><p>I believe it is hugely important, and thankfully the Turkish government has shown early initiative in making sure Turkey is not excluded. We would be wrong to view it as just a free trade agreement (FTA). The likelihood of a transatlantic common market happening between the EU and the US has never been this high, and if realized as envisioned it will undoubtedly have a lot of political effect as well. In a way, I compare it to the Marshall Plan because it could provide the economic spark that Europe needs to lift itself out of its current economic malaise. It is of course hugely important for Turkey as well, because the EU is our largest trading partner. It is important economically, but also politically, because we are invested in the long-term future of the EU. Whether we become an EU member state or not, we want the EU to be a successful political and economic union. As a member of the EU Customs Union and a candidate for membership, Turkey has already harmonized its economic regulations with the EU and would be a logical component of the TTIP. The letter of the Customs Union Treaty requires Turkey to separately negotiate FTAs with third-party countries that the EU signs with. However, I believe the EU has a responsibility toward Turkey to integrate it into the TTIP. To avoid a road accident, relevant Ministers such as Zafer Çağlayan and Minister of EU Affairs Egemen Bağış are taking coordinated steps to ensure parallel negotiations with the US should the EU ignore this responsibility. I think the White House, the Secretary of State, and now the Secretary of Defense all know Turkey very well, and they all understand the strategic importance of the country. My concern is that Turkey needs to invest more time and effort into reaching out to the US Congress. Congress has other reflexes beyond the executive branch, and it has the final say on FTAs. For this reason, I trust that Prime Minister Erdoğan will add Congress to his schedule during any upcoming US visit.</p><h4>What is the Turkish-American Business Association (TABA-AmCham) doing to influence public opinion and lobby the government in the US?</h4><p>We have to go beyond just lobbying Washington. We need to be locally present and we need to show the US that we are investors in the country. We create jobs in almost every region, and we do this by buying products and investing in the US. We are buying American products and our members are involved in the local production of jet aircraft and the national space program. We are more active participants in the US economy, and we need to be more actively involved in local US politics. The way to do that is to first make sure that people are aware of what we do, and this starts with engaging opinion and decision makers. With our new initiative in the US, called TABA-USA, we want to approach congressmen and women in their districts and show them that we are their constituents and employers in their district, and support them in their policies, where there is a mutual interest. This is not a political lobbying group. Instead, it is focusing on highlighting the importance of doing business with Turkey and Turkish-Americans at a local level. The group has no partisan agenda and we will not attempt to lobby about any contentious political issues. We already have excellent diplomats such as Namık Tan who can argue those cases in the right corridors. What we are focused on is grassroots educational activities, highlighting the incredible trade and investment opportunities that both nations can find in our respective countries. I think that if Turkey continues its current economic performance, then naturally the biggest question will be whether it can sustain the economic growth it enjoys. Turkey has shown remarkable resilience with regard to the global economic downturn. Clearly we are not entirely unaffected by the global crisis, because we are all on the same plane, but I think we are certainly flying first class. We have better security belts, and things are running more smoothly on our part of the plane. I think that if we can continue to implement a smart and calculated economic policy, our growth will continue for years to come. Furthermore, if we can pull off the new outreach that the Turkish government has initiated on the Kurdish issue, we can finally rid the country of its largest burden. If we are able to solve the issue with the PKK and free our country of terrorism, we will see a real revolution in growth in Turkey, and achieve our targets for 2023.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey's economic performance over the last decade has been impressive. In 2001, Turkey rapidly reorganized its economy, completed structural reforms, improved its legal and judicial infrastructure, and geared up for unprecedented growth. This has resulted in Turkey achieving one of the highest growth rates in the world over the past 10 years. This change is all the more impressive as a tripling of Turkey's GDP was achieved between 2002 and 2011, a period of severe global economic crisis.<br></p><p>Diageo is the world's leading premium drinks business with an outstanding collection of brands across spirits, beer, and wine, and we have taken a keen interest in developments in the Turkish economy and business environment for many years. Building our business in new high growth markets has played an important role in transforming Diageo over the last three to four years, and these markets now represent over 40% of our sales. In August 2011, we acquired Mey İçki, Turkey's leading local spirits producer and distributor. Mey İçki provides Diageo with a great opportunity to enhance our presence in this new high-growth market.</p><p>Turkey's growth story is remarkable. Over the past decade it has become one of the fastest-growing and most robust economies in Europe. Today, the country is the 16th biggest economy in the world, driven by both increasing FDI and consumer demand. Turkey is also undergoing significant social change and the Turkish economy is benefitting from changing consumer trends, including the emergence of a vibrant middle class. The population is becoming more urbanized and disposable incomes are rising, with around 40% of household incomes now above $15,000, rising to 60% by 2014. Around 60% of the population is currently under 34 years of age, the population is projected to increase to 94 million by 2050, and the growing urban population is increasingly brand-conscious.  These trends lend themselves to Diageo's expertise in premiumization across categories and in innovation.</p><div class="quote">“Within this booming economy, the consumer goods sector has also achieved strong growth."</div><p>Within this booming economy, the consumer goods sector has also achieved strong growth. This is evident when looking at some basic consumer data: between 2002 and 2012, the number of mobile phone owners increased from 23 million to 67 million, and credit card ownership rose from 16 million to 53 million. The number of internet users rose from 4 million to 50 million in the same period and the number of airline passengers increased from 33 million in 2002 to 132 million by November 2012.</p><p>In acquiring Mey İçki, we knew that the transaction would not only create growth in international spirits, but that it would support growth through increased premiumization of the rakı market, both in the local Turkish market and overseas. We could also see the potential for the spirit in export markets.</p><p>Since the time of the acquisition, Turkey has delivered a very strong performance for Diageo. We have seen good growth in the gin category and the more premium Yeni Rakı, coupled with excellent growth of Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff.</p><p>Our analysis indicates that Turkey's economic growth of the last 10 years is only the beginning. It is widely acknowledged that the global economy of the 21st century will be very different to that of the 20th century. An analysis by John Hawksworth, Chief Economist of PwC, predicts that by 2050, the Turkish economy will be one of the largest economies in Europe. The Turkish government's ambitious Vision 2023 target is for the country to become one of the 10 biggest economies in the world and the country's consumer base will, no doubt, be one of the driving forces of future growth. Demographic data indicates that the Turkish consumer base will grow both in terms of people and purchasing power.</p><p>With the acquisition of Mey İçki, we not only acquired a successful company, but also invested in one of the world's new high growth markets of the 21st century. We look forward to working in partnership with the government to support further economic growth, building on the exceptional developments of the past decade, which have left the country well positioned for the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish exports reached over $150 billion in 2012, a 12.6% increase over the same figure in 2011, but still a long way from Turkey's Vision 2023 goal of $500 billion. How achievable is this goal?<br></h4><p>We have a long and difficult road ahead to reach the Vision 2023 goal of $500 billion. But at the same time, we know that the rules of the game for the next 10 years will be different from those in the last 10. Within world trade, the share of developing countries is increasing day by day, and Turkey is advancing toward a much brighter future through the great efforts of dynamic exporters. In order to catch up to the dynamism of the era, we focus on innovation, IT, R&amp;D, entrepreneurship, and, most importantly, skilled human capital. To provide sustainable exports, we work to diversify in new countries and sectors, reach targeted markets of high potential, raise market share, increase the number of exporters, and focus on medium- and high-tech products. In 2023, the machinery, automotive, iron and steel, ready-made garments, and chemicals sectors will leap forward. The machinery sector is targeting $100 billion in exports, while the automotive sector is targeting $75 billion, the iron and steel sector $55 billion in exports, the ready-made garment sector $52 billion, and the chemical sector $50 billion.</p><h4>As Turkey's diplomatic and economic focus shifts toward Africa, to what extent will the continent become a larger market for Turkish exports over the next decade?</h4><p>Thanks to our enterprises in our new export markets, our exports to Africa, the Middle East, and other Asian countries are increasing significantly. Owing to market diversification strategies, we increased our exports to African countries 27% in 2012. And over the next decade, focusing on trade delegations, business forums, and new initiatives, Africa will become a larger market for our dynamic exporters.</p><h4>Iraq is now Turkey's second-largest export market. How would you characterize the potential for Iraq to replace Germany as Turkey's biggest trading partner in 2013?</h4><p>The business volume of Turkey and Iraq is increasing day by day. For example, in 2000, we didn't have any exports to Iraq. As of 2012, Iraq became our second largest export market. Within a couple of years, we want to increase our trade volume with Iraq to $25 billion. Also, Turkish contractors have a majority role in Iraq. The ongoing resolution process within Turkey on the Kurdish issue and the stabilization in the Middle East will leave a positive impression in our relations and boost the economy in all aspects. On the other hand, Germany has been a very important trade partner for Turkey over the decades, and it will continue to be in the future.</p><div class="quote">“Germany has been a very important trade partner for Turkey over the decades, and it will continue to be in the future."</div><h4>To what extent should the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership be a concern for Turkish policy makers?</h4><p>The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership will shed light on the content of a Turkey-US free trade agreement (FTA). Removing the duties will increase the volume of trade between Turkey and the US. We are attaching a lot of importance to this process. We will conduct an impact analysis study and, in the forthcoming period, we will announce the progress and share the findings of the study.</p><h4>To what extent should liberalizing trade in services in the multilateral trading system be a policy priority for Turkey?</h4><p>We are paying more attention to liberalizing trade in services as well. Turkey's service exports are increasing day by day.</p><h4>What will be the major sectors showing export growth in 2013?</h4><p>The olive and olive oil sector, minerals and metals, ships and yachts, leather and leather products, and livestock and aquatic products were the top five export sectors showing growth in 1Q2013. Our leading sectors in exports, namely the automotive and ready-made garment sectors,  will be expanding as well. We are focusing on strong growth in all industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Erdoğan's visit to Yaoundé on March 16 and 17, 2010, was the first ever by a Turkish head of state to Cameroon. Since then, and thanks to our shared determination, relations between our two countries have continued to grow and diversify for the benefit of our two peoples. Proof of this is the exchange of visits, such as those to Turkey by the President of the National Assembly of Cameroon and several members of the Government of Cameroon and, in return, that of Professor Mehmet Görmez, President of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Turkey, to Yaoundé in December 2012. Beyond its symbolism, my visit to Turkey in April 2013, which is also the first to Turkey by a Cameroonian President, testifies to our mutual commitment to strengthening our friendly and cooperative ties within the framework of a win-win strategic partnership.<br></p><p>Turkey, which was already a major power under the Ottoman Empire, has continued to marvel the world. The Republic was built with steadfast determination by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, after the abolition of the Sultanate in 1922 and the Caliphate in 1924. The Republic of Turkey is today a politically stable, economically prosperous, and socially peaceful nation. I honor the memory of Atatürk, the eminent patriot who, at the beginning of the last century, courageously laid the groundwork for a secular and modern Turkey. This remarkable work has been consolidated over the years.</p><p>In fact, thanks to the ambitious reforms and programs resolutely undertaken by its leaders since 2002, Turkey, which ranks as the world's 15th largest economy, is currently one of the major actors of global growth. Such a performance is all the more remarkable as it comes at a time when efforts are being made to get the global economy out of crisis.</p><div class="quote">“Thanks to our shared determination, relations between our two countries have continued to grow. "</div><p>Cameroon, for its part, is currently pursuing a “Major Accomplishments Program," which consists of implementing major projects in the areas of energy, infrastructure, mining, and agriculture, and is geared toward making Cameroon an emerging economy by 2035. To that end, my country has substantial advantages and potentials, namely its strategic position in Africa, huge natural and human resources, political stability, sustainable economic growth, an investment-friendly environment, and a central position in the Central African sub-region. To carry through its lofty national plans that have the support of Cameroonians of all social strata, both at home and abroad, Cameroon knows it can count on the commitment of its external partners, notably Turkey, whose competence and know-how are commensurate with its needs.</p><p>Cameroon and Turkey share common values and principles within international bodies, notably the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), to which both countries belong. This common belonging has enabled us to appreciate the vital moderating role played by Turkey, notably in the Syrian crisis, and in the Middle East region. The country's actions at the helm of the Standing Committee forv  Economic and Commercial Cooperation between OIC members has also caught our attention.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to underscore the importance of the Turkish initiative aimed at institutionalizing a consultation platform between Turkey and the African continent. This Summit of Partnership and Turkey-Africa cooperation based on the principle of equality and win-win cooperation is proof of Turkey's interest in the African continent. That accounts for Cameroon's active participation since its inception in 2008.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Bilateral relations between Belgium and Turkey reach back to the founding years of the Kingdom of Belgium. Less than two months after Leopold I had been enthroned as the first King of the Belgians on 21 July, 1831, industrialists from Lií¨ge and Verviers petitioned the King to formalize relations between our young Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire, convinced as they were of the promising future of closer relations between the two countries on the brink of industrial development and modernization. The first step was the conclusion of the bilateral Treaty of Friendship and Commerce in 1838, followed in 1839 by the establishment of the Belgian Consulate in Istanbul. Business relations started to thrive. Maritime links between Antwerp and Istanbul from the 1850s onward strengthened commercial relations further. In 1862, a new bilateral Treaty on Commerce and Navigation entered into force, granting Belgium the status of most favored nation by the Empire and guaranteeing free and toll-exempted passage through the Straits to both Belgian cargo and ships under the Belgian flag. By the early 20th century, Belgian steel mills contributed to the construction of railways, and Belgian companies operated the first electricity and streetcar networks in Istanbul.<br></p><p>It is useful to dwell for a moment on this rich economic history between our countries, because it underscores the solid foundations that Belgium's diplomatic and economic presence in Turkey can build on today.</p><p>In the 21st century, our bilateral economic relations started to prosper exponentially. Over the last 10 years, Belgian investment in Turkey has exceeded ‚¬5 billion and bilateral trade between Belgium and Turkey approached ‚¬8 billion in 2012. Belgium, benefiting from its central location and assets as a logistical and distribution hub, has become Turkey's sixth largest market in the EU.</p><p>The future looks promising, as it was in the early days. In October 2012, I had the immense privilege to lead a Belgian economic mission to Turkey. It was the largest mission Belgium organized that year and one of the largest ever. About 300 Belgian entrepreneurs representing nearly 200 companies participated. The mission focused on the construction, energy, and banking technology sectors, but other sectors such as logistics and environmental technologies were also represented. The synergies and complementarities that may be exploited between Belgian and Turkish ports again became evident. I was especially struck by the potential of cooperation between Belgian and Turkish companies in tertiary markets such as Africa and Central Asia, where our mutual experience and know-how can lead to genuine added value.</p><p>I was not surprised by the success of the mission. Situated on the crossroads between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Turkey has all it takes to be sure of long-term sustainable growth and is already on its way to becoming one of the 10 largest economies in the world. Steady economic reforms and a stable regulatory environment in combination with serious investment policies continue to provide reassuring guarantees for foreign investors. A business-friendly visa policy enabling Turkish guests in Belgium to acquire their visas in the shortest possible time has also contributed to a multiplication of business relations.</p><p>My last visit to Turkey also enabled me to witness the strength of our relations beyond economy and trade. During several meetings, President Gül, Prime Minister Erdoğan, Deputy Prime Minister Babacan, and Minister Çağlayan voiced their determination to continue reforms and align legislation with the EU acquis. Belgium has always been a staunch supporter of the Turkish-EU accession process and has consistently supported Turkey in meeting the political requirements and other criteria that will help both Turkey and the EU overcome obstacles and prepare for a new phase in their common history.</p><p>Economic, trade, and inter-state relations put aside, what has really allowed our countries to become closer are every-day human relations. People-to-people contact, such as university exchanges that bring more than 400 Turkish students and researchers to Belgium every year, or the yearly increasing number of Belgian visitors to Turkey's cultural and natural treasures, offer ample opportunities to get to know each other better. Most importantly, the significant number of citizens of Turkish descent in Belgium and the quality of their integration into Belgian society have not only contributed to Belgian wealth and prosperity over the years, but also to genuine understanding and the establishment of a mature bond of friendship. The commemoration in 2014 of the 50th anniversary of the 1964 bilateral agreement on the employment of Turkish workers in Belgium will be an appropriate occasion to highlight their valuable role.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>When Turkey celebrates its centenary in 2023, it may well be a very different country. While visiting the dynamic Turkish city of Izmir at the beginning of 2013, I stumbled across a striking example of the rapidly growing economic links between Turkey, the rest of Europe, and the wider world. In the Izmir area, I learned that textile factories are manufacturing an amazing volume of shirts for Swedish retail giant H&amp;M. The Swedish company then sells these shirts to consumers all over the world. Today, the Turkish economy, like that of Sweden, is obviously an integral part of the globalized economic system.<br></p><p>Geographically, Turkey and Sweden are located at opposite ends of Europe. Nevertheless, our bonds reach far back into history. Many people living in Sweden were born or have roots in Turkey and contribute substantially to our economic and cultural development. Today, trade between our countries is substantial. Turkey is also one of the most popular tourist destinations for Swedes.</p><p>Standing in Izmir Harbor, which has radical expansion plans, I watched endless lines of large container ships on their way in and out. Turkey's official growth target of 5% annually over the coming decade seemed realistic. When the country celebrates its centenary in 2023, it could be a totally different country compared with today. However, Turkey is facing three challenges that will affect the extent to which this happens.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey needs a new constitution that reflects its democratization and move toward European integration."</div><p>Firstly, Turkey needs a new constitution that reflects its democratization and move toward European integration. The country has taken enormous reform steps in recent years, but much remains to be done. Improvements are needed in the areas of freedom of expression, women's rights, and the protection of minorities. Work on a new constitution presents a crucial opportunity to address such issues.</p><p>Discussions seem to be in an intensive phase right now and, crucially, the new constitution needs the strong backing of all political parties. Turkish leaders must agree on solutions that are in line with European principles.</p><p>Secondly, there are a number of serious challenges in Turkey's immediate neighborhood: Iran, Iraq, the Southern Caucasus, Cyprus, and Syria. It is necessary for Turkey and the EU to play a constructive and flexible role in any developments. Domestically, the Turkish government also needs to find a political solution to the Kurdish issue.</p><p>Turkey is a crucial partner in building security in Afghanistan and has made huge efforts to avert disaster in the Syrian conflict. The Turkish people have shown great generosity in a difficult time. But what lies ahead could prove to be even more difficult. The EU is also eager to work as closely as possible with Turkey in tackling the wider challenges of the Middle East and North Africa. We must help to prevent the revolution of rising expectations of the Arab awakening, today turning into a revolution of failed expectations some years into the future.</p><p>The IMF has concluded that to absorb the unemployed and new entrants into the labor force, the emerging economies of the Middle East and North Africa would require annual real GDP growth of more than 7.5%—almost three percentage points higher than the average achieved in the past decade. Achieving this—and at the moment the trend is going in the other direction—will require profound economic reforms and steps towards economic integration with the Arab world, the rest of the global economy, and notably the EU.</p><p>Here, Turkey sets an important example. Its impressive economic development cannot be seen in isolation from its accession to the EU Customs Union more than a decade and a half ago. We must be prepared to offer reforming economies of the Arab world the same opportunities. The model of deep and comprehensive free trade agreements is open for them whenever they are ready.</p><p>This brings us to the third challenge: Turkey's EU accession process. It must be possible to give this process new momentum during the coming year. Our EU discussions in Brussels in December 2012 gave new signals. Steps are required from both the EU and Turkey, and Sweden will do its utmost to help.</p><p>Sweden's support of Turkey's membership in the EU is more consistent and stronger than that of many other European countries. Sometimes we are critical friends, and that is because we truly want to support Turkey's continued reform process—the work on a new constitution, the work to better safeguard human rights for everyone, and the efforts at conflict resolution and reconciliation with all of its neighbors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Yıldırım Group grow from a small family company in Samsun to a global Turkish brand?</h4><p><strong>ALP MALAZGİRT</strong> The company started in the 1960s in the trading business in Samsun, buying and selling construction materials. It continued in trading for about 30 years. In the 1990s, it then moved into the coal trade. The year 1993 was very significant, because it was the first time that the coal trade kicked off regionally. Coincidentally, 1989 is when the Berlin Wall fell and Russia started privatizing all its state-owned enterprises. Back then, only about 5% of all businesses in Russia were private. By 1994, in five years, this huge country had privatized about 90% of all its enterprises. During this time, many minerals, such as coal, became more available for export.</p><h4>How did the company's strategy change in 1993 with the inclusion of the coal business?</h4><p><strong>EVREN ÖZTÜRK</strong> The company's aim from that point was to become the largest coal trader in Turkey. We brought the coal from Russia, and we set up a joint venture with the Russians in Turkey to distribute it. At the same time, we had our own coal facilities locally. That business also grew through vertical integration. In around 2003, Turkey started privatizing, so we halted the joint venture because the Russians had started doing business in Turkey on their own. It was at that point that we bought Eti Krom and Gemlik Gübre, making this an industrial company. From there the acquisitions continued, and that's how we became such a fast-growing enterprise.</p><p><strong>MUSTAFA KEMAL ERKANAT</strong> Robert Yüksel Yıldırım believed in the importance of two things for the business. The first one was foreign trade. The second one was an inorganic growth strategy, rather than greenfield investment, which takes much longer. Our strategy was, and is, that inorganic growth can provide a more rapid return on investment. Robert also believed that, in the long run, base metal companies would become much more profitable than oil companies. Now we know that this is the case, with companies like Rio Tinto and Vale doing much better than companies like BP.</p><p><strong>ALP MALAZGİRT</strong> The theme at this time was flexibility. Initially, Robert started doing business in Russia, but as soon as other people started getting into the field and crowding in, he moved to China. He had the flexibility to fold up his tent and go somewhere else to set up shop all over again. He's very entrepreneurial and hard working, with a lot of perseverance. When he went to China, the focus again was coal. Then, after a few years, we changed focus again, and now we're getting the coal from South Africa, through Mozambique.</p><p><strong>EVREN ÖZTURK</strong> The focus was also on related industries. We moved from coal to bulk carriers to shipping. Then, in 2004, when a lot of chemical tankers were being bought and sold, we got into building tankers. We bought the Marmara Shipyard and now we build and sell our own tankers, both externally and to our shipping company. Over the years, we diversified into port investments.</p><p><strong>ROBERT YÜKSEL YILDIRIM</strong> When I came back to Turkey from the US in 1993, my family business was trading construction products and coal. My background up until that point was in high-tech industries in Silicon Valley, and I wondered how I could contribute my skills to our very low-tech family business. I decided to use my English skills and my international business experience to focus on our foreign trading operations. I focused on the coal business, which was changing at the time because Turkey was changing its coal-use habits. The first thing I did was travel to Siberia to meet with Russian coal producers and traders. I saw a lot of opportunities in Russia at that time. I used my experience with international business ethics from the Americans and Japanese and, as a result, the Russians liked my style of conducting business and socializing. This allowed me to present myself as an insider in the Russian coal sector and gave me an advantage over other Turkish companies that were entering it. I learned from this experience that I have a talent for foreign trade, and we took advantage of that to expand into other products.</p><h4>How has the international perception of Turkish business changed over time?</h4><p><strong>ALP MALAZGİRT</strong> In Asia, the perception has changed a lot. Turkey is now becoming a country that a lot of people are looking up to, especially in East Asia. In some Muslim countries like Indonesia, they look up to Turkey. In Central Asia, there are a lot of Turkish companies operating, first in the construction sector and later in the consumer sector. So, clearly, the perception has changed in the East.</p><p><strong>SEAN PIERCE</strong> From an American perspective, I don't think I had a perception of Turkey before I came here. Now, what I see is a real duality; the difference between the skyscrapers we see around us, and what is down at street level.</p><p><strong>EVREN ÖZTÜRK</strong> In 2011, when we were seeking finance for the acquisition of Malta Freeport, we had a lot of issues because we are Turkish. There was a reluctance on the part of finance providers. Even though Fitch has raised Turkey's rating to investment grade, we are still two or three notches lower according to S&amp;P.</p><p><strong>MUSTAFA KEMAL ERKANAT</strong> With Turkish companies abroad, we are like the crusaders. Europe hasn't accepted us at first, but as companies like ours become more intertwined in the EU economy, we will change Europe's perception from the inside and they will accept us in the end. If Turkish companies like ours do such a good job internationally, we will attract investors to Turkey. Our policies go along with Turkish government policies. For example, we are expanding our business in Africa at the same time as Turkey is expanding its influence in Africa. That will bring further investment into Turkey.</p><p><strong>ÖZER ÖZ</strong> Turkey's perception is all about duality. If you're looking at it from the East, Turkey is a Western country. If you're looking at it from the West, Turkey is still an Eastern country.</p><h4>How would you rank Turkey as a base of operations for an international business?</h4><p><strong>ÖZER ÖZ</strong> In some business areas Turkey is very attractive, because it is a hub for transportation between East and West. It is an energy corridor. We have a young population, which makes it attractive to retail investors. Turkey also has its shortcomings, because energy is very expensive here, and we don't have much mining. On the other hand, Turkey offers a young and educated population, so we have something to export. For health care, Turkey is a great place and we are attracting healthcare investment. It is a duality and there are a lot of parameters.</p><p><strong>ROBERT YÜKSEL YILDIRIM</strong> Turkey is between the East and West, but it is more Western. Turkey is in the top 20 economies globally. We are advanced and we are changing, and the new target—to be in the top 10—is extremely difficult, but it is maybe doable in the next 20 years. Turkey deserves more than what it gets right now. If we had some of the opportunities that are given to European countries, we would be in much better shape. Look at Greece and Portugal and countries in Central and Eastern Europe. But still, we are thankful that we don't have oil because oil can have negative effects. Because Turkey doesn't have oil it means we are hard working as we have had to build everything ourselves and we have all the top industries in Turkey. If you looked 20 years ago, the textile sector was very attractive in Turkey. Now the textile sector is behind other industries like automotive, which is now our largest export segment. Steel is improving. In cement, we are in the top five in the world. Mining is also developing. This is all about Turkish entrepreneurs. They used to take what they earned here and spend it outside of Turkey. Now they are re-investing it in Turkey more and more, and now investing it in Turkey and legally investing it in Europe, the US, Asia, and Africa. We now see more Turkish groups expanding abroad. As the Yıldırım Group, we are in France, Belgium, Sweden, and Malta—we are becoming a part of the EU economy. I think that business in Turkey today has more opportunities than in Europe. In Europe everything is planned and restricted—in Turkey we still have ups and downs. This diversity is what makes Turkey strong.</p><h4>What is your vision for Yıldırım Group a decade from now?</h4><p><strong>ROBERT YÜKSEL YILDIRIM</strong> Our intention is to be a pure Turkish company in the global arena. We don't want our boundaries to be Turkey's boundaries. Our identity is Turkish, but our business is global. We need to create international Turkish brands in business. Of course, it is not easy to try to become Turkey's Vale, but we can be a multi-industry group. We can aim to be among the top-20 port operators in the world. And in mining we want to be healthy and making money globally. Our Turkish identity is going to Africa and Latin America and then making the company international, with a head office in Istanbul, but offices and operations everywhere. We want to be less family oriented and more corporate oriented—to be an international company with international partners in major businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is A&amp;T Bank's history and background in the MENA region, and how has it grown and developed since it was founded?</h4><p>A&amp;T Bank was established in 1977 as a joint venture in accordance with the agreement between Libya and Turkey to foster trade between the two countries. A&amp;T Bank is 62.37% Libyan owned and 36.01% Turkish owned, with the Libyan Foreign Bank, a fully owned subsidiary of the Libyan Central Bank, holding all of the company's Libyan shares, while İşbank and Ziraat Bank, Turkey's two largest banks on an asset basis, hold 20.58% and 15.43%, respectively, with the Kuwait Investment Company holding the remaining 1.62%. Currently, A&amp;T Bank has 277 employees and seven branches in five cities across Turkey. For more than three decades, A&amp;T Bank's founders and employees have built up banking and business relationships, expertise, and know-how across the MENA region, achieving steady, conservative growth and establishing A&amp;T Bank as the go-to player in this attractive market.</p><h4>What was the motivation behind A&amp;T Bank's rebranding and strategy change in 2009?</h4><p>The main purpose of rebranding and developing a new strategy was to provide customer-oriented and sustainable growth in the long run, increasing business volumes and becoming more active in the MENA region, especially in Libya.</p><h4>What is A&amp;T Bank doing to expand its operations and become a full-service bank with a presence in Turkey's retail and commercial banking market?</h4><p>In line with the strategic plan, A&amp;T Bank's focus is on improving its sales management processes, expanding and diversifying the customer base, completing its product range, implementing alternative distribution channels, and penetrating into target markets as well as upgrading the technical infrastructure. A&amp;T Bank will continue to meet the banking needs of its customers with improved service quality and with its position as a leading bank in Libya and the MENA region and as a boutique bank in domestic activities.</p><h4>What is the importance of Turkey for A&amp;T Bank?</h4><p>Turkey's geographical location makes it a bridge between the East, West, North, and South, with easy-cost, efficient access to businesses around the world. It is also particularly keen to further strengthen its economic and commercial ties with the countries of the MENA region.</p><h4>How would you characterize the growth of trade and economic relations between Turkey and the MENA region?</h4><p>For many years, Turkish companies enjoyed sharing a common culture and history with most of the countries in the MENA region. This cultural similarity, accompanied by the geographical proximity, is a competitive advantage for Turkish companies, as both sides can understand each other. Turkish companies have undertaken major projects in the MENA region for many years. They have completed hotels, towers, malls, and also projects that need a high level of technical capacity, such as metro projects, airports, pipelines, and highways. Due to its successful projects in the region and developing political implementations, Turkey's commercial relations  with the MENA region have increased prominently over time.</p><h4>What effect has the recent unrest in Libya had on your business, and how would you characterize the outlook for the Libyan economy and for trade and economic relations between the MENA region and Turkey?</h4><p>Because of the recent unrest in Libya, in 2011, foreign trade volumes between Turkey and Libya declined by 62.3% and the construction business by Turkish contractors in Libya stopped completely. This situation affected our business negatively. However, in this period, the foreign trade volumes of Turkey with North Africa stayed at the same levels, while trade in the Middle East increased by 33.2%. Therefore, we compensated for the negative effect of the decline in foreign trade volumes with Libya by improving our business in other foreign and domestic markets. In 2012, foreign trade volumes with Libya and the MENA region increased significantly. MENA's importance as a trading partner of Turkey is expected to increase further with its rapid growth in the near future. The economy of the MENA region has developed a significant GDP and recorded bank asset growth, which resulted in important increases in its trade volumes with Turkey. Foreign trade figures imply that even the latest liberalization developments in the MENA region are boosting the figures. Turkey's exports totaled $140 billion in the first 11 months of 2012, with the MENA region accounting for around 34%, or $47.9 billion, of the total (the 2011 figure was $34.6 billion, or 26%). The MENA region will continue to represent an important share of Turkey's foreign trade volumes, especially in the construction sector.</p><h4>What role does A&amp;T Leasing play in your overall businesses, and how has it grown over the past 15 years?</h4><p>In 1997, A&amp;T Leasing was established as a subsidiary of A&amp;T Bank to perform leasing transactions. Focusing on client satisfaction, A&amp;T Leasing serves an extensive portfolio of companies ranging from small- to medium-sized enterprises. A&amp;T Leasing correctly identifies customer needs to generate the appropriate financial solutions, and then transfers its resources to investors effectively. By relying on itself and its experience as a company, A&amp;T Leasing creates a synergy with customers and offers high-quality services in accordance with their needs. A&amp;T Leasing has fully supported the development of the industrial and agricultural sectors. By financing 2,205 projects, A&amp;T Leasing's cash injections to medium-term projects reached $480 million. By the end of September 2012, A&amp;T Leasing had TL48.3 million in equity, and its asset size reached TL130.2 million, with finance lease receivables amounting to TL100.5 million.</p><h4>What are A&amp;T Bank's medium-term growth plans, and what is its strategy and outlook for 2013?</h4><p>A&amp;T Bank's priority in 2013, and the coming period, will be to maintain and improve foreign trade activities through our experience in the MENA region. In line with our sustainable profitable growth goal, we will penetrate alternative international markets and extend our foreign trade expertise to other regions. Furthermore, we will also increase our domestic banking activities. We will maintain our competitive position in domestic corporate banking through improved products and distribution channel diversification to further increase the opportunities provided to customers. New products and distribution channels, effective marketing strategies, and an efficient organizational structure will be our main strengths in achieving the goals we have defined. We will continue to employ the human resources needed for the effective and efficient functioning of the new organizational model designed under our new strategic plan. We also plan to gradually implement our new projects, which are still under progress. When these projects are finalized, we will ensure a fully customer-oriented structure, which enables us to analyze customers and their needs in more detail to increase cross-selling opportunities through new products and channels.</p><h4>What is your vision for A&amp;T Bank in the long term, and where do you see the bank in 10 years' time?</h4><p>In 2012, A&amp;T Bank demonstrated an outstanding performance and remarkably strong profitability. Compared to the same period of the previous year, A&amp;T Bank increased its unconsolidated net term profit by 56.4% from TL33.5 million to TL52.5 million in the first nine months of 2012. A&amp;T Bank, the asset size of which is over TL2.1 billion, continued adding value to the national economy and support to its customers by its cash loans portfolio of TL569 million, and by its non-cash loans portfolio of TL1.6 billion. Shareholders' equity climbed by 14.8% from TL354 million to TL406.5 million in the first nine months of the year. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is over the sector average by 17.81%. The return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) ratios of the bank, which were 12.89% and 2.08%, respectively, at the end of 3Q2011, climbed to 19.60% and 2.74% at the end of 3Q2012. In the near future, we will start on the implementation of new projects to be much more customer oriented by increasing cross-selling opportunities through new products and distribution channels. We have been playing a leading role in trade achievements between Turkey and the MENA region, notably Libya, as the first Turkish bank specialized in this vision for 35 years. I believe that our experience in Libya and other MENA countries, our wide network of correspondent banks, and our distinguished banking approach will lead our customers to grow with us, and keep us as one of the most prominent players in the banking sector over the next 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps is the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) taking to ensure that Turkey meets its 5% target for inflation in 2013?<br></h4><p>Expectations, credit, and currency are three key variables that determine price inflation. Inflation expectations are close to above our medium-term target of 5%. Measures to curb excessively rapid credit growth will be instrumental in containing any inflationary pressures in the coming months. These measures are mostly macroprudential in nature since rate hikes would be counterproductive in the global low-interest rate environment.</p><h4>To what extent is a structural reduction in the current account deficit (CAD) a priority for Turkey, and how can the country achieve its target for the CAD to GDP ratio in 2013?</h4><p>In 2012, the CBT, jointly with other agencies responsible for financial stability, was able to attain more balanced domestic credit growth. This was instrumental in bringing the CAD from $75.1 billion at the end of 2011 to $47.5 billion at the end of 2012. The 2013 CAD forecast in the Medium Term Program (MTP) of the government is 7.1% of GDP. Structural measures listed in the MTP to boost savings and energy supply are expected to improve the outlook on the external balance, once they are implemented.</p><h4>Turkey's GDP growth has seen a sharp drop from its 2011 high. What steps is the CBT taking to help the country to meet its GDP growth target in 2013 and achieve a sustainable growth trend?</h4><p>Price stability, financial stability, and productivity are the three essential factors that determine the growth potential of a country. The Central Bank Law, which was amended in 2001, charges the Bank with taking the necessary measures to contribute to financial stability besides its primary mandate of achieving and maintaining price stability. The CBT will continue to support balanced growth mainly via these two channels.</p><div class="quote">“The Turkish economy is now closer to a sustainable and balanced growth path."</div><h4>What are the CBT's monetary policy priorities looking forward?</h4><p>Although global risk perceptions have improved considerably as a result of the ongoing monetary expansion in advanced economies, there is still an elevated level of volatility in capital flows to emerging markets. This condition necessitates a combination of flexible monetary policy and automatic stabilizers.</p><h4>How would you characterize the medium-term outlook for the Turkish economy?</h4><p>The Turkish economy has been one of the top performers during the recovery period after the Lehman crisis. Meanwhile, employment has continued to grow rapidly and unemployment rates decreased to levels lower than pre-crisis times despite a significant rise in labor market participation rates. Moreover, the rebalancing between domestic and external demand was achieved to a large extent in 2012. Therefore, the Turkish economy is now closer to a sustainable and balanced growth path thanks to prudent macroeconomic policies and solid macroeconomic foundations.</p><h4>You were selected as the Central Bank Governor of the Year 2013 for Europe by The Banker in recognition of your apt management of foreign inflows. To what extent will this remain a policy priority in 2013?</h4><p>Monetary expansion in the developed economies has been the main factor behind the rising volatility of capital flows. Volatile capital flows pose a significant challenge for emerging market policymakers. As a result, some emerging markets have resorted to capital flow measures in order to deal with the adverse consequences of capital flow volatility. In contrast, Turkey has been using a mix of macroprudential measures along with a relatively low and yet quite flexible interest rate policy in the face of volatile short-term capital flows. The policies in place curbed the excessively rapid domestic credit growth, avoided the excessive swings in currency, and thereby rebalanced foreign and domestic demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's banking sector has seen an influx of foreign lenders in recent years. Is this a trend you expect to continue?<br></h4><p>Foreign investors' acquisition of shares in existing institutions has been exceptional over recent years. Turkey continues to offer higher returns on capital compared to developed markets, and it remains a significant growth opportunity. Therefore, it will not be surprising to see that foreign investors' interest in the Turkish banking sector revives as stability in the global financial markets is gradually re-established. Recent market entries by Sberbank, Bank Audi, Burgan Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., and the Commercial Bank of Qatar prove that interest in the Turkish banking market continues. Foreign banks' interest in the Turkish banking sector gained pace in the second half of the 2000s such that, today, the share of foreign capital rose above 40% when the foreign share of banks listed on the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) is also taken into account. Today, 10 of the 28 commercial banks established in Turkey, excluding participation banks, are classified as foreign banks, where foreign owners' shares are more than 50%. Some of the foreign investors have been in Turkey for more than 30 years, either in the form of representative offices, foreign branches, or established banks. Foreign players have significant shares also in our major competitors. However, we all operate on a level playing field, subject to the same governing laws, under the same regulations. Foreign players and possible new entries in the Turkish banking system definitely intensifies the competition. We believe that increasing competition within Turkey, strengthening cross-border business relations, integrating and aligning the financial systems of different countries, and familiarizing ourselves with different cultures and ways of doing business serve to better position Turkish banks.</p><h4>In late 2012, İşbank entered into a cooperation agreement with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. How will this agreement enhance the services that both banks can provide to their customers?</h4><p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that İşbank and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. signed during the IMF World Bank Meetings in Tokyo on October 12, 2012, aims to mutually provide a comprehensive range of banking and financial services for our clients. The MoU allows for the provision of banking services to those companies who have direct investments in Turkey or set up joint ventures with Turkish companies or consider making investments in Turkey, as well as business cooperation between the two firms in areas of mutual interest such as corporate and trade finance. There is great interest shown by Japanese firms in Turkey through the level of direct Japanese investments in the country, even in the aftermath of a global crisis. This and the existence of a large sum of Japanese investments in Turkey is a testament to the depth of Japanese-Turkish relations. We believe that the cooperation between the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and İşbank will ensure vast opportunities for our clients.</p><div class="quote">“Financial institutions need efficient facilities that provide high-quality living standards  and security."</div><h4>Is the government's 5% GDP growth target for the medium term feasible, and what steps should be taken to ensure that it is met?</h4><p>The Turkish economy continued to grow  in 2012, though at a slower pace compared to 2010 and 2011. Thanks to the measures taken by the authorities such as the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) and the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), concerns about the current account deficit were eliminated significantly. Regarding 2013, it is expected that Turkey will continue to diverge positively and growth will accelerate compared to 2012. In 2013, we expect that the composition of economic growth in Turkey will shift gradually away from net exports to consumption and investment expenditures. The government's growth targets for 2014 and 2015 are set at 5%. The medium growth target of 5% is in fact a conservative target when the Turkish economy's potential is considered. Excluding the years of the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, the Turkish economy grew by an annual average of 7.8% during 2002-2011. What differentiates the Turkish economy from other emerging market economies is the diversity of its economy. Turkey is neither too reliant on exports nor domestic demand; it has a balanced economy. Also, unlike most emerging markets, Turkey is not a commodity exporter; thus, its economy is not dependent on commodity prices. In order to exploit the above-mentioned advantages and achieve an annual average growth rate of at least 5% in the coming period, Turkey needs to improve several weaknesses. Turkey must focus on improving its human resource base through better primary education, health care, higher education, and training, increasing the efficiency of the labor market, and reinforcing the efficiency and transparency of public institutions. In addition, reducing the informal economy and developing active labor policies, improving income distribution, and reducing regional disparities are critical factors for achieving the medium-term growth target.</p><h4>How would you assess Istanbul's potential to become an international financial center, and what changes, regulatory or otherwise, could be made to facilitate the process?</h4><p>The shifting of the dynamics of economic growth from advanced economies to emerging markets after the global financial crisis led to a new way of thinking about international financial centers. Istanbul is the “natural financial center" of Turkey, and our achievements in the last decade point to the fact that Istanbul has the potential to become an important international financial center. Istanbul is home to 18% of Turkey's population and the city is referred to as the “third largest metropolitan area in Europe," after London and Moscow. The Istanbul International Financial Center Project aims to make Istanbul a regional financial center in the next 10 years and then a global financial center in the next 30 years. Turkey has a huge growth potential, combining a large and fast-growing economy with a relatively underpenetrated financial services market. There are numerous growth opportunities in many areas of financial services, focusing on a strong banking market and other markets that require fast development such as the equity market. Stock market capitalization is relatively weak compared to mature countries, but it is consistent with other emerging economies. The government bonds market is relatively developed. Meanwhile, the corporate bonds market, which was virtually non-existent due to the crowding-out by sovereign debt issues in the past, has begun to develop gradually. In addition to the full range of domestic and regional commercial requirements, specific product opportunities, such as derivative instruments, insurance classes, asset management, Islamic finance, and environmental “green" financing are on the agenda of the Turkish financial system. According to the Global Financial Centers Index, the main areas of competitiveness for international financial centers are listed as business environment, taxation, reputation, infrastructure, and market access. Policymakers should focus on these main areas of competitiveness in order to be recognized as international financial centers. Despite the significant improvement registered in the last decade in Turkey, there is still a lot of room to improve the tax regulation and legal infrastructure, as well as reduce intermediation costs in the financial sector. Financial institutions need efficient facilities that provide high-quality living standards, high-tech service capacity, comfortable transportation, and security. Progress in these areas should also be accelerated.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in Turkey's banking sector over the medium term?</h4><p>The high economic growth potential of Turkey and the strong financial structure and dynamism of the banking sector promise huge growth performance in the long term. The demographic features of Turkey also indicate high growth potential in the banking sector. The number of households with an annual income between $25,000 and $50,000 is expected to reach 4 million in the medium term, far from its previous level of 1.5 million in 2005. In parallel, it is expected that the penetration rate will increase and the branch network will continue to widen until the 2020s, while branch and personnel efficiency improvements will also proceed. In the long term, İşbank will continue to enhance its market shares parallel to profitability, efficiency, and risk-focused strategies. The young population creates a dynamic economy with significant prospects for further development in the real sector. Under these circumstances, there is huge potential to grow in both retail and corporate banking, given that household indebtedness is significantly below that of developed  countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given the importance of SMEs in Turkey's economy, to what extent is access to financing a constraint for these businesses?<br></h4><p>It is not the major constraint in the Turkish economy. I believe there is still room for SME loans to grow further. Looking at the number of companies in Turkey, we can see that around 95% are SMEs. Some of these are relatively small, but in terms of financing demand, the share of SME loans in total loans remains limited; it is around 25%. Considering that around 65% of total sales in the economy are made by SMEs, I believe they deserve a larger share in overall loans. They have made significant progress toward accessing further loan opportunities over the last few years. We clearly need to put more effort into promoting the increased importance of their financials and balance sheets and help them to become companies with more professional management understanding rather than family-run companies. The efforts of SMEs and the risk appetite of the banks in the SME segment has provided advantages to SMEs, which can now obtain more affordable loans than in the past. At the same time, SMEs have become more familiar with banks' risk assessment and credit rating methodologies. This means that SMEs are now achieving more competitive pricing, almost at the same level as large enterprises. When it comes to relatively smaller enterprises, the Turkish treasury ensures loan availability for artisans and craftsmen. Halkbank and the treasury have managed subsidy schemes for many years. Up to 50% of loan interest can be subsidized by the treasury, and Halkbank is the sole provider of this subsidy scheme. As of 2012, roughly 260,000 artisans and craftsmen have benefited from this scheme. Over the past 10 years, some TL24 billion has been loaned to those small enterprises through this scheme. Although the share of SMEs in total loans is still not at a satisfactory level, financing is no longer the main challenge for SMEs.</p><h4>How do you think the increased involvement of foreign lenders will change the Turkish banking sector?</h4><p>There are 49 banks operating in Turkey. However, 10 years ago that figure was 80, but after the financial crisis of 2001, most of those banks either closed down or merged with other banks. Turkey is a very big country in terms of population dynamics and economic growth prospects. Given the size of the economy and the growth potential, Turkey doesn't have a large number of banks. In that respect, the inflow of foreign financial players will definitely increase the very competitive structure of the Turkish financial system to another level. That will benefit Turkish society overall, as well as the Turkish financial system, because it will make financing more available and affordable for wider segments of society. Turkey will also grow faster thanks to the greater participation of financial institutions. This will also no doubt bring new products to customers.</p><h4>Turkey has an economic history that alternates between high growth and stagnation. GDP growth has seen a sharp drop from over 8% in 2012 to around 3% in 2013. The government  says it will level out at 5%. Why is this different from previous cases?</h4><p>In past crises, Turkey had not been able to achieve a soft landing. It is easy to achieve 7% or 8% growth if you have a large population with strong domestic demand. However, to contain this growth, to prevent overheating, and to bring about a soft landing is much more important than being able to achieve a year or two of super-high growth. For the first time, in 2012, Turkey achieved a soft landing; 2.2% is not a bad figure. After more than 8%, sure it is a huge drop, but Turkey is still growing. Also, the Turkish government wanted slower growth so as to curb Turkey's current account deficit (CAD), which is now down to 7% of GDP from a high of 10%. If it weren't for that drop, Turkey may not have received investment grade from Fitch. The CAD is the major issue in the Turkish economy, and it was the main focus of the Turkish authorities. I think Turkey will still grow 3% or 4% in 2013. That is not a bad figure at the end of the day. In the past, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) was always focused on the problem of inflation and price stability. Post-2008, in the post-Lehman Brothers period, the CBT aimed at achieving different macro stability figures, not only in inflation, but also growth, employment, and the CAD and foreign deficit has been important. The CBT has been closely monitoring these issues. These are all important if Turkey is to achieve overall financial stability. Price stability is easier, but financial stability is much more important. The CBT and the government both understand this and work accordingly.</p><div class="quote">“SMEs are now achieving more competitive pricing."</div><h4>What are Halkbank's strategies and goals for 2013?</h4><p>After the soft landing we experienced in 2012, I think 2013 offers an opportunity for economic growth. The CBT and other regulatory bodies will stick with moderate increases in loan volumes, which is considered an effort to sustain growth and macro-stability at the same time. The banks will also support these measures, given their positive impact on margins and competition. We at Halkbank have targeted 15% to 18% loan growth in 2013. As a result of strategies over the last five years, Halkbank has decoupled from the banking sector in a positive way, with its efficiency and profitability indicators. We have one of the highest returns on equity (ROE) in the Turkish banking sector, and our aim is to sustain the highest profitability level possible. Our business plan for 2013 is to focus investment on areas of growth that will sustain profitability. We will implement a new credit card brand and program, which was launched at the end of 2012. We want to broaden our customer base by strengthening our position in SME banking. We will also finance various infrastructure projects that are already in the pipeline. Halkbank will continue its growth strategy as a financial group together with its subsidiaries. We expect these financial subsidiaries to continue growing in line with our bank's targets. We have no plans for international acquisitions in the near term, but we constantly analyze opportunities around us. We would like to explore opportunities in Islamic banking, and we have already begun preparing feasibility reports. We should finalize our Islamic banking project in 2013. That means offering interest-free loans, although not as Halkbank, but via an Islamic banking subsidiary. This is also a strategy for tapping into the under-banked segment of the economy. Islamic banking in Turkey has a market share of just 5%, but the potential is much more, I think.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a new addition to the Turkish banking sector, what motivated the Audi Saradar Group to enter the country and how would you characterize the potential of the local market?</h4><p>This is a regional bank and Turkey has always been part of our plan because it is close to each segment in the region: the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and the South Mediterranean. Economically, it is connected to the Western world as well. It is becoming a very good link between many economic centers. Culturally, politically, and economically, its influence is increasing constantly and in line with world trends. Development in Turkey has taken a significant step, especially in the past 10 years. Entrepreneurship has transformed the market into a well-structured, economically well-run, micro-economically growing, and more internationally aligned mechanism. Turkey is part of the global market, but its domestic market is attractive as well. The country has a large, young population with a very diverse culture. So much is happening in Turkey that makes it a very dynamic and evolving place to do business. Because this is a socially developed economy with an impressive export development industry, its ties with the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and the West in general are increasing. The numbers reveal 20%-30% growth every year in terms of exports and investments as well. In northeast Africa, there has been more investment from Turkish companies in the last five years—not only in the construction industry, but also in factories, highways, bridges, and dams, for example. Inward investment from many countries in the region has also been increasing over the last five years. We have also seen an increase in the number of conferences in the last two or three years, which is driving up the cost of hotel stays. This gives stakeholders an opportunity to explore new business lines. The question for us was never “Why Turkey?" It had always been “Of course Turkey." It was just a matter of when.</p><h4>What strengths does Odeabank bring to the local banking sector?</h4><p>We have the advantage of being new. We can use the best technology, systems, and efficiency in our organization. Large banks usually grow over time, with many of their systems becoming obsolete—they cannot manage high growth because they have to fill a gap by bringing in many new people. When growth slows, they still have to keep the extra people, and it becomes difficult to maintain high efficiency. In our case, because we are a bank established by bankers who have come from other banks, we recognize bottlenecks and understand what can be improved—it makes sense that we started with the most efficient system and the highest technology, which is always very important. We have to sell, but we don't always have to sell face-to-face—we can sell over the internet or through call centers as well. Turkey is developed and fast, which is why it is attractive. We use many of the best-automated processes and put some form of creativity into the equation. Maintaining efficient communications between the departments is a very important factor because there are many different people and systems involved. To this end, we are doing some very basic things and also implementing advanced products. We have a group intranet, which is very important as we seek to maintain the overall branding and internal culture of the company. Most institutions don't place too much emphasis on this concept, but as one of the best companies in terms of establishing media, we are working to communicate better. We are progressing and developing every day. From the first day we open a branch, everyone in the company is entitled to see the issues at the branch as well as the procedures and guidelines. Everything is out in the open so that if a newcomer comes in, they can see the whole picture.</p><h4>How will advanced technology become an element that customers experience?</h4><p>When customers enter our branches, they can investigate our service in the waiting room, type “Odeabank" into Google and explore our products online, or benefit from our online entertainment offerings with their children. Other institutions only provide magazines; we are providing customers online games to play while waiting their turn in line. It is also useful for customers to see their account online and learn about the products that are available to save time before meeting our representatives. Our clients can search for what they need and we can provide it for them. We are trying to make use of technology to be efficient in addition to presenting a positive image for the bank.</p><div class="quote">“Our products are going to undergo significant evolution and growth in 2013."</div><h4>What does Odeabank have planned for 2013?</h4><p>Our main vision is to open 26 or more branches because we have to expand. The first six branches have demonstrated the ability to attract a large number of customers, and we are very eager to develop demand further. Odeabank is a young bank, and it will take time to absorb and digest every aspect of the market before we begin expanding. Once we recognize the right path, we will continue steadily. Moreover, our products are going to undergo significant evolution and growth in 2013. For example, the infrastructure behind credit cards is being developed, and we hope to allow their usage at multiple ATMs in the coming year. We have to do in months what other banks have achieved in years. Furthermore, the bank is actively working on branding. In 1Q2013, we plan to offer a variety of different credit cards. Apart from that, we will be receiving and processing applications from other investment banks.</p><h4>How would you characterize the outlook for Turkish banking and how does Odeabank's long-term vision fit into the future of the sector?</h4><p>In Turkish banking, the local banks dominate the scene. This is also common in many other countries. Unlike consumer groups, banking is more sophisticated and geared more toward service and penetration in the market. I do not believe that any of Turkey's top four banks will be sold in the short term, and thus we are not aiming for the top four or five places. The state banks will not be changing hands, but the banks ranking below them are all multinationals. Some of them will stay here, and some might chose to leave if the shareholders change. There are many other smaller local Turkish banks, and we foresee some consolidation. Due to the economic fundamentals in Turkey, there will be continuous interest in buying mid-market banks, so there may be changing shareholder structures among the secondary banks; there will be more activity in that segment. The speed and health of banks similar to ours will also be changing, but we are not going to see the market evolve significantly. We are aiming for a 2% or 3% market share, and all of the banks will grow and have room to do so in the coming years. The expected growth rate is approximately 20% for the Turkish banking system, against 11% nominal growth and 4.6% real growth in the overall economy in 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize your current strategy and role in Turkey's financial sector?</h4><p>We are focusing more on the commercial, SME, and retail sectors as we want to maintain our leading position in the SME and commercial sectors. Türkiye Finans has a 1.5% market share in the commercial sector, and we would like build on this as well as maintain our strong market share in the SME sector. For that reason, we have been investing in a strategy of governance and infrastructure, which was behind the launch of our new retail products in October 2012. This is our main strategy for growth, and our main goal is to increase our market share from 1.5% to 1.8% by 2016. This means that whatever the banking sector's growth rate, Türkiye Finans has to grow 20% over that.</p><h4>Why are SMEs so important to Türkiye Finans and how do you tailor your products and services to SMEs?</h4><p>The raison d'íªtre for participation banks is to support trade and production. We finance retail businesses via a different process to commercial banks. It is not enough  to simply request a sum of money. In the participation banking system, one has to tie that borrowing to a commodity or service and provide us with the invoice. The banking sector mainly supports production and trade. This is the reason for our existence, and participation banks have really advanced on this front.</p><h4>What actions is Türkiye Finans taking to increase its share of the retail banking market?</h4><p>We are launching a new credit card-driven product. It is a pre-credited card. It is not pre-paid, but a pre-credited installment card. The card will have a limit and an expiration date. We decide on the limit, expiration date, and the repayment schedule together with our customers. Upon utilization the customers will be billed throughout the installment period and at a rate agreed upon with the customer. This way, we know the customer spends that money on an invoice. This is a new product, and we have high hopes and hopefully we will be marketing it heavily toward the end of 2012. We are going to invest into our delivery channels, especially on mobile phones. We are now designing our budget for 2013 and are trying to specialize in alternative distribution channels. We are also investing heavily in opening new branches. In 2012, we opened 38 and over 2013 we are going to open 26 branches. Türkiye Finans is also hiring at the moment. Over 2012 we will hire around 1,000 people. Basically, we believe we have a reasonable range and number of products and now it is just the case of transmitting these to our customers.</p><h4>What factors were behind Türkiye Finans' recent decision to issue a lease certificate?</h4><p>In order to issue a lease you need assets, and Türkiye Finans spent time building up those assets. One is leasing and the other is real estate. Since 2011, we have been working heavily on our leasing assets. Now, we have about TL250 million worth of leasing assets, up from TL55 million in 2011. Also, we had very little real estate that we could convert to lease certificates. This is why we have been waiting, and now we can continue with the lease certificate program and go forward with this mandate. Right now, we are about to obtain the authority to give this mandate to one of the brokerage houses to issue a lira-denominated lease certificate—it will be the first of its kind. There are a couple of banks in the market trying to do this. A Turkish lira lease certificate is more important for us than one denominated in a foreign currency, and to prosper you need a long-term local currency source in order to lend. This is why the deal is very important and pioneering for the market. However, we are about to obtain a mandate to issue a foreign currency lease certificate by the end of 2012. We believe we are the optimum size needed to perform such a transaction. If everything goes well internally and externally, we expect to close one or two deals by end-2012 or early 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Turkey's private pension system grown and developed since it was established in 2003?<br></h4><p>Turkey's private pension system is in its infancy. It was initiated in 2003 with a comprehensive strategy. Since the 1980s, Turkey has spent a lot of time, money, and energy on economic, social, and political issues. The main reason was political instability and weak governments. In the early 2000s, after Turkey chose a strong government that has well-designed plans for the next decade, it became a better and more stable country. This comprehensive strategy included reforms on macro issues like tax, trade, social security, and banking, which were very important in particular. It was quite successful. Refinements in the pension system were part of this plan, and these provide a social benefit for citizens by increasing Turkey's wealth. However, a successful government must provide a secure future for its people. The Turkish government now has the ability to provide a standard social security system to all of its labor force, but it can be insufficient sometimes, especially for people who live in cities and have higher living standards. In order to satisfy sufficient social standards, there is a need for a more complementary system. This is the main purpose and function of our industry; to complement the government's social security system. Secondly, and more importantly, the private pension system provides a savings tool for Turkey. Through the last decade, government performance is said to be satisfactory when it comes to saving issues. The government is prosperous also in macroeconomic issues. For example, the budget deficit was 10.2% in 2002 and was expected to be 1.7% at the end of 2012. The debt-to-GDP ratio was 73.7% in 2002, and at the end of 2012 it was expected to be 36.5%. The government is saving responsibly, and even corporations are decent at saving. However, people individually are not good at saving. From one perspective, this is not a bad thing. Turkey has a young, dynamic population that is eager to spend because of increased economic stability and growing disposable incomes. Today, more Turkish people are travelling around the world, consuming luxury goods, buying more cars, and generally spending more. The private pension system is a financial tool that supports the government's saving plan by increasing personal savings.</p><h4>What is Vakıf Emeklilik's background, and what role does it play in the private pension system?</h4><p>Vakıf Emeklilik was founded in 1991, and initially was established as a life insurance company. After 2003, we acquired a license for pensions, so now our company is able to service both life and pension needs. Today, we have the fifth largest fund out of 17 companies. In 2008, there were only 10 companies, now there are 17, some of which are very new and small. Vakıf Emeklilik is a subsidiary of VakıfBank, and we have 650 people working for the company. Our main headquarters is located in Istanbul and there are nine regional headquarters, three of which are in Istanbul. We are a finance and marketing company, and we have a large sales team that has a strong relationship with the bank. We have a large bancassurance branch, both in this company and in the bank.</p><h4>What role do corporations play in Turkey's private pension system, and what is Vakıf Emeklilik doing to increase its corporate portfolio?</h4><p>If we want this industry to grow, we should attract as many corporations as possible. Turkey's corporate fund rate is 3.8%. Vakıf Emeklilik has one of the largest corporate portfolios at 5%. We are now investing in our company and restructuring our corporate sales teams, while establishing a new team for special projects. We will work with some municipalities, large companies, and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. We want to create a more corporate business. This is important for the whole industry to grow, and also for the per-capita contribution rate.</p><h4>What changes do you believe the new pensions law will have on the system?</h4><p>We think that the 25% state contribution is very important; furthermore, it will encourage more contributions and increase the number of people entering the system. It will also increase the per-capita contribution. We believe this will create larger contributions from existing and new clients. Now, the industry's total fund assets are aroundTL19 billion, and the projection of the Association of the Insurance and Reinsurance Companies of Turkey shows that it will reach TL400 billion by the beginning of 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the outlook for Turkey's retail fuel market?</h4><p>The retail fuel market in Turkey shows a very interesting combination of strong regulations and rapidly evolving conditions combined with strong competition. It is one of the most regulated and competitive markets, which has, in my view, no equivalent. There is a saying that “the past doesn't speak for the future," and it is true for this market in a very positive way. The past was sometimes very hectic, but the future looks bright. Turkey proved to be able to overcome tough circumstances, quickly recover, and grow stronger. This is what creates long-term confidence in the future of this market. I am not betting that it will have no ups and downs over the next 10-15 years, but I do believe that whatever happens, the people have the capacity to overcome bad times and continue working for tomorrow. There are no second thoughts about “what could have been"—people take a very pragmatic approach about where they are and where they want to be in the future, and they make it happen.</p><h4>How has Turkey's significance to Total evolved over the time that you have been in this market?</h4><p>Regarding the retail and lubricants business that I am in charge of, we have been in this market for the past 20 years and we see it as a successful journey. We have reached a market share of about 6% in the retail business and 11% for lubricants, which makes us the fifth largest player in the market. The Turkish fuel market itself is booming in comparison to Western Europe. Turkey is both a dynamic and sophisticated market, eager to consume. There is a sustainable growth perspective since the number of cars per inhabitant is five times lower than the rest of Western Europe and half of what we see in Russia. With plenty of room to grow, the Turkish retail market is demonstrating huge potential. Total Oil Turkey wants to be part of it, and will further invest in line with this perspective. We want to be one of the reference retail players by 2018. In the recent past, we concentrated on our core retail business by selling our bottled LPG business two years ago, and then engaged in a resolute growth strategy in the retail sector. For our retail business, Turkey is a strategic place to be. Naturally, it is key because of its vibrant and sophisticated market, located between Europe, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and North Africa. Turkey is also a key cultural reference. Many of the people we work with elsewhere refer to our presence in Turkey as a major asset. Other group subsidiaries are also present in the chemicals industry or petrochemical segment, as well as for international transportation.</p><h4>How does Total adapt its business model to different markets around the world?</h4><p>The key word about our business model in retail is adaptation. Listening is the first core behavior we list in what we call the “Total Attitude." We first listen to the market, the stakeholders, and the communities we live in. Our corporate social responsibility program has a focus on children's education about road safety and our support for the Ancient City of Smyrna archeological project shows what we mean. Another core behavior is boldness. This tells a lot about the way Total Oil Turkey wants to behave. We don't compromise on our international standards, especially when it comes to safety; however, when it comes to the market, we listen and learn from our customers. As a result, the way we manage the business in Turkey is not the copy paste of what we do elsewhere, but fits to this market. For example, in our retail business the Turkish market is very specific in the way that the vast majority of stations are owned by dealers, which is unusual. We adapted to it and the relationship we developed with our dealers has become a key asset in our view.</p><div class="quote">“Many of the people we work with elsewhere refer to our presence in Turkey as a major asset."</div><h4>How does Turkey compare to other markets in terms of innovation?</h4><p>Customer sophistication makes it very interesting in terms of retail business. Turkey has a huge competitive edge in innovation. Customers are young and interested in the future. As a result, Total Oil Turkey fights to be one of the most innovative Total subsidiaries. As an example, our actions on social media make us one of the most active Total downstream subsidiaries, which is welcomed by our Turkish customers. Another example is the new image at our filling stations, which we began to implement in March 2012. One of the pilot sites for a worldwide project was created in Istanbul. Immediately after the project was approved at the group level, Turkey took the lead in terms of the rebranding program with 75 new look realizations by the end of 2012. Now when the company wants to learn how the “new look" is perceived by customers, they come to Turkey. Things go faster here than anywhere else, and the business environment is supportive. The Turkish contractor we worked with for the project has been selected to implement the “new look" stations in many other Total markets around the world. Everyone throughout this process in Turkey, from the dealers to the contractors and customers, has been receptive to innovation, and that is one of Turkey's strengths.</p><h4>One of Total's goals in Turkey is to own 15% of the stations in your network. Why is this an important part of your growth strategy?</h4><p>Competition is tough in Turkey and we expect it to remain so or become even tougher. Still, we have ambitious targets. We want to increase from 430 to 500 stations and grow our sales by 50% between 2011 and 2018. This means we are not happy solely with putting flags on the map—we want larger stations that can handle more volume. The dealers own most of the stations in this market. The general rule for a dealership contract is that it encompasses a five-year duration. Since we invest heavily in this market, we are looking for a longer presence on the sites, in compliance with all market rules. Ownership is one way to do it, and our aim is to achieve this long-term presence in at least 15% of our sites. This does not mean we want to operate all of these stations: the dealership model remains for us the reference model either through traditional relationship or on sites we own. Naturally, we also plan to grow in lubricants from our current 11% in the same way. In summary, what we want is to be recognized by more customers for the quality of our products and services; one thing we keep in mind in order to achieve it is that we are not here to “educate" the customer—we're here to serve his or her needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business continued to grow and develop since 2011?</h4><p>In 2011, Kadoil's market share was 1%, and now it is 1.5%. We've had strong growth in the large cities of Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Adana. Kadoil's branches have expanded in these cities, and we are now starting to put an emphasis on the branches with the best results. Our policy is unlike that of other companies. We only keep open the branches that have strong sales. It's very easy to create branches in this sector, but the important thing for us is branches that are exemplary. In 2011, we had 350 branches, but we shut down 50 of those stores. Our branches may be fewer in number, but our sales are going up and our stores are more profitable. In the past two years, Kadoil has improved and our plan is to continue improving in big cities. We focus heavily on advertising and the local market, and we care about our work. There is tough competition in Turkey and we must keep up. We are also planning to establish our own stations. In Turkey, the structure is to focus on good quality and cheap gas and oil. This focus is causing problems for the large companies, too. It's not enough anymore that a brand is well known. Previously, people didn't know the name Kadoil, so they would only take a few liters of petrol at a time, but now they are filling their tanks and telling everyone they know that this is a quality product. When we took over large-scale stations in Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara, sales increased by around 3%. This shows that the system in Turkey is not focused on brand names anymore. There is an official sale price, but we increase sales by offering discounts. These discounts can be 5%, 8%, or 10%. We are also trying to improve our customer relations. Customers should feel like they are at home in our stores, and we try to maintain a family environment at our stations. We take care to ensure that our facilities are clean and we train our workers on how to interact with their customers in the best way possible. At Kadoil, we conduct special customer relations training to ensure this quality. When you combine these factors, there are many reasons to come to Kadoil. Our customers benefit financially by saving money, as well as emotionally in that they are comfortable in our stores. In a restaurant you care about quality and price; if both are good, you go there more often. That's the logic behind our company as well.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential for the further growth of the retail market for petroleum in Iraq?</h4><p>We are the only Turkish company in Iraq that distributes petrol. In the first stage, we had four stations in Soran, Duhok, Erbil, and Sulaymaniyah. When you put those four stations together, we sell the most petrol in Iraq. We would like to expand our operations; not just in the north, but also in the south. This will probably take one or two years. Our station in Soran is the largest station in our portfolio and has the highest sales in Iraq right now. The largest companies in Iraq are still looking for oil sources. The Ceyhan Pipeline transports oil from Iraq to Turkey, and there is a large amount of petroleum exported to Iran. Plus, in Basra, there are good export opportunities via the seaport. This shows that Iraq is going to get better soon in terms of economic production.</p><h4>What potential do you see for the continued growth of renewable energy in Turkey?</h4><p>Regarding renewable energy, we are not in the place we should be right now. In Turkey, the largest import item is energy. There are currently four kinds of renewable energy: hydro, wind power, geothermal, and waste-to-energy. We are expecting solar energy as well, but it's only in the planning stages right now. We don't expect the wind industry will grow much in Turkey, but geothermal energy should grow here because of our natural conditions. We are also expecting growth in the hydroelectric sector, but Turkey's bureaucracy puts up many barriers. There is also a serious problem building hydroelectric centrals because there is a dearth of skilled people who know how to build and work in these kinds of facilities. In the future, we would like to grow in the solar power sector. We won't even need to market it because the government will support it, and this is the right way to go for the future. You have to encourage investors in this sector and make it easier for them. We have heard from the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources that he is trying to do something to make it easier; if this does happen, renewable energy will improve and expand in Turkey's energy sector. This is the most important sector that can balance Turkey's import/export discrepancy since we are mostly importing energy from other countries. If we can change this, Turkey will be much better off economically.</p><div class="quote">“Turkey is going to be the biggest hub for petroleum in the world."</div><h4>What are the advantages of Turkey's Mediterranean region as an energy hub?</h4><p>Turkey is surrounded by sea on three sides, and has the advantage of connecting the Middle East with Europe. Turkey is a good bridge. Logistically, Turkey is in the best position compared to other Middle Eastern countries. The pipeline starting from Ceyhan makes it especially easy to transfer oil to and from other regions. There are still many programs and plans to invest there in the future. At present, there are a number of companies that are getting permission to build and operate a refinery in Ceyhan. It's good for Turkey to export to other countries. Turkey can use energy and export it to other countries. The country is integrating into the world, meaning it's very easy to do business here. Turkey is going to be the biggest hub for petroleum in the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the oil and gas sector and where do you see Kadooğlu Group in 10 years' time?</h4><p>There are currently 45-50 delivery companies, but only the most organized and powerful companies will survive. The other companies will go out of business and there will only be 15-20 companies left. There is really tough competition in this sector and there are many companies from the Arab world that want to move in. If you can own your own stations, you can survive in this sector. Still, I don't foresee any problems in this sector in the next 15 years. If hybrid cars get into the market, it might drop a bit, but not by much because we will sell electric recharging in the stations as well. We try to take things five years at a time. In five years, we will have 500 stations in Turkey and a 4% market share. We will expand mostly in the big cities. This is what we expect for Kadooğlu, and we have plans to accomplish this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has BP's role in the Turkish market grown and developed over the past century?</h4><p><span></span>BP has been in Turkey for 100 years, and we celebrated our centennial in 2012. BP's predecessor, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, opened an office in Istanbul—then the capital of the Ottoman Empire—back in 1912. Our current downstream businesses, such as fuels and lubricants, date back to the 1940s. We are one of Turkey's first international investors. Having contributed to Turkey's economy and energy sector for more than 100 years, we have witnessed considerable growth in the country. Turkey has gone from being a small economy in the region to the world's 17th largest economy and a major regional economic and political power. Geopolitically, Turkey's location provides it with many advantages. Strategically located on the historic Silk Road, Turkey now has become an energy bridge between the producers of energy in the East and the consumers in the West. BP, for many years, has been the only international oil company that has both an upstream (exploration and production) and a downstream (refining and marketing) presence in Turkey. We have a large fuels presence in Turkey, with over 620 dealer-owned stations and a turnover of $4.5 billion. Our fuels business is usually second or third in market share in the regional markets where we participate. We plan on opening another 30-40 stations in 2013. We are also an important player in LPG autogas, which is sold at BP-branded stations. BP's lubricants business has a leading market share in Turkey's automotive lubricants market with the Castrol brand (30%) and the second largest market share overall. Our lubricants blending plant in Gemlik is one of the world's most modern, high-tech lubricants facilities. From here, we export lubricants to countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Georgia. In addition to our downstream businesses, two of BP's globally strategic projects go through Turkey: the Shah Deniz gas value chain and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline.</p><h4>How does BP integrate community investment into its operations in Turkey?</h4><p>Contributing to the economy and the well being of the communities we work in is one of BP's highest priorities and is an essential part of our job. BP's social investments aim to support development programs that create a meaningful and sustainable impact—one that is relevant to local needs and aligned with BP's business. We work with local authorities, community groups, and specialists to deliver these community programs. Our direct spending on community programs worldwide in 2012 was $90.6 million, which included contributions of $31.7 million in the US, $16.3 million in the UK, $2.3 million in other European countries, and $40.3 million in the rest of the world, including disaster relief. Since 2002, BP and its partners have invested $27 million in community investments along the BTC Pipeline in Turkey alone, making this the largest social investment by a private sector company in Turkey.</p><h4>What trends can you foresee in Turkey's oil and gas sector over the medium term?</h4><p>Supplying sustainable oil and gas for its booming economy over the coming decades is one of the greatest challenges for the country. We expect Turkey to continue exploring for oil and gas in strategic areas such as the Southeast, Black Sea, and Mediterranean regions. Turkey's main aim is to reduce its dependence on energy imports, and find sources of cheap, abundant, and reliable energy. There will be an increased focus on securing supplies from neighboring countries in the region, and becoming an energy bridge, where these supplies are not just consumed in Turkey, but are transported via Turkey onto Europe. In order to unlock the massive gas export potential of the Caspian, Turkey is clearly the key. All the different future sources of gas have to transit through Turkey, and this provides a unique opportunity for both Azerbaijan and Turkey. BP and its partners in Azerbaijan are developing a giant gas project, Shah Deniz Phase II, which will open up the Southern Corridor and, for the first time in history, deliver gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-demand-scenario]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps is the Electricity Generation Company (EÜAÅž) taking to ensure that Turkey meets its electricity demand as the country continues to grow rapidly?<br></h4><p>According to the high demand scenario of the 10-year generation capacity projection prepared by the Turkish Electricity Transmission Company (TEİAÅž) for the period between 2012 and 2021, electricity energy demand is forecasted to reach 467.3 billion kWh by 2021 in Turkey. EÜAÅž is within the scope of privatization, and so works are underway in order to privatize all the thermal power plants of EÜAÅž as quickly as possible. Also, all power plant investments to be made by EÜAÅž are now subject to the decision of the Council of Ministers. For these reasons, EÜAÅž's share of electricity generation in Turkey has declined in recent years and is expected to decline even more by 2021.</p><h4>How will EÜAÅž play a part in the government's goal of generating 30% of Turkey's electricity from coal by 2023?</h4><p>Turkey's objectives for energy resource usage in 2023 were set out in the Electric Energy Market and Demand Supply Security Strategy Paper dated May 21, 2009. It stated that all known lignite and hard coal resources will be put to use for generating electricity by 2013. It is targeted to increase the share of nuclear power plants in generation to at least 5% by 2020, with an aim to further increase their share in the long term. There is also a plan to make use of all the technically and economically available hydroelectric potential in electricity energy generation. The installed capacity of wind energy will also be increased up to 20,000 MW by 2023. The paper projects the commissioning of all our geothermal potential of 600 MW as well. We will ensure the maximum utilization of solar power potential too. With the increase in the utilization of other renewable resources, the share of fossil fuels, especially imported resources, will be reduced. As a result of these measures for the use of domestic and renewable energy resources, we are expected to reduce the share of natural gas in electricity generation to below 30%. The Afşin-Elbistan, Çayırhan, Tekirdağ-Çerkezköy, and Karapınar lignite fields of EÜAÅž have the capacity to establish a thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 17,595 MW. In order to establish these power plants, a public-private sector investment model has to be established.  I believe EÜAÅž will again play a major role in Turkish electricity generation if the capacity of 17,595 MW is achieved.</p><h4>How would you characterize the opportunities for international investment in Turkey's energy sector?</h4><p>Demand for electricity energy is rising rapidly. In order to meet this increasing demand, an increased installed capacity of 3,000-4,000 MW is required in addition to the existing installed capacity. The cost of these investments is about $7 billion-$8 billion annually. In this context, international investments are needed in the Turkish electricity generation sector.</p><h4>How will renewable energy play a part in Turkey's energy generation strategy over the next decade?</h4><p>Energy demand is increasing rapidly in Turkey, and the main objective of the energy policy is to meet this demand. In this context, a support mechanism has been constituted through legislative adjustments for electricity generation using renewable energy resources. I believe that wind, hydro, and solar power plants will play an active role within the next 10 years.</p><h4>What role will privatization play in the continued development of Turkey's energy infrastructure over the next decade?</h4><p>The main goal for the privatization of the power plants is to ensure a more efficient, economical, and uninterrupted generation of electricity while establishing a competitive market structure. Our target is to make huge contributions to the Turkish economy through commissioning both existing and new power plants in the private sector.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in Turkey's energy sector over the coming decade?</h4><p>Turkey has huge renewable resource potential. In parallel with the 2023 objectives, I believe that wind will have the biggest share in terms of construction, efficiency, and investment cost among renewable energy power plants. Turkey also has rich lignite resources. I think new coal-fired thermal power plants will be established over the next 10 years in order to utilize our lignite potential of 12.7 billion tons.</p>]]></richbody0content>
