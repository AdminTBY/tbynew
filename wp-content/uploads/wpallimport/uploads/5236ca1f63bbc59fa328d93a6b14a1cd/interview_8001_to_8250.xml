		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the impact of the development of the sixth airport on the national economy?<br></h4><p>Actually there are five airports, not six: in Muscat, Salalah, Duqm, Sohar, and Ras Al Hadd. The one in Adam has been converted into a military airport. The successful completion of Oman's airport network is integral to Oman's economic development and will indeed provide enormous opportunities for job creation and spur on small and medium sized companies. The strategic thinking behind the airport network and location was connectivity for exposing and promoting the entire country, as opposed to limiting the growth opportunities to the main cities of Muscat, Salalah, and Sohar. One of the principal objectives of this huge initiative of airport development is to promote tourism. While Oman is a popular spot with tourists and Salalah is one of nature's wonders, the beauty of Oman is indeed a well-kept secret. The marketing of the country, the setting up of the entire tour and travel industry, will explode once the airport comes online. Basically, the airport network will put the entire country on the map as opposed to only the well-known city of Muscat, and the somewhat known city of Salalah.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of the National Railway Project for the Sultanate of Oman?</h4><p>Oman's railway project is considered one of the key strategic schemes contributing to achieving the essentials of sustainable development on both social and economic levels by linking the developmental centers of the country. The Sultanate railway is estimated at 2,244 kilometers in length and starts from the Buraimi governorate to reach the Dhofar governorate. Project goals include fostering the development of new services and industries that boost GDP, creating employment, and effectively linking Oman's ports to the GCC network, as well as activating an integrated transport system of ports, railways, airports, and land transportation.</p><h4>What have been some of the key achievements of the telecommunications sector?</h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman liberalized the telecommunications sector in 2005 when the second cellular mobile license was awarded to Omani Qatari Telecommunications Company (Ooredoo). Since this strategic move, the sector had made significant progress towards realizing the Government's Vision 2020, which aims at liberalizing the Omani telecommunications sector by enlisting private sector investment for economic and social development, and turning the Sultanate into an attractive and competitive destination. Further liberalization took place in 2009, when the second fixed-line license and a few mobile resale licenses were issued. The market has since witnessed a visible transformation with the entry of additional players, foreign participation, and an increase in service portfolios in the expansion of services to cover un-served areas. Meanwhile, the government formally approved the National Broadband Strategy (NBS) in October 2013, paving the way for acceleration of efforts and implementation of schemes to realize the goal of high-speed internet to homes and businesses. The Telecommunication Regulatory Act (TRA) completed its first market review in 2013 in the form of  the “Market Definition and Dominance (MDD) Report." This review defines the markets and determines the dominant player(s) in each market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the near future?</h4><p>Keeping in mind that an extensive feasibility study was undertaken by the Ministry, resulting in Oman's Vision 2020 plan, enormous strategic thinking has gone into the preparation of specific development planning for this ministry. The economic development of the country, in particular inland Oman, was key. The Ministry has focused on the airport and its ancillary facilities, the highway systems, and the railway network to ensure the maximum contribution to reaching the Vision 2020 goals. Additionally, the ministry was instrumental in transforming governmental departments into independent public authorities to better steer the structure. The general policy framework of the telecommunications sector reiterates further liberalization and a position of enhanced competition in the provision of services. Initiatives of the organization pursued over the past two years have included spectrum reforming, spectrum migration, revamping of the licensing framework, and formalization of the competition framework arising out of the directions set in the said policy guidelines. Changes in technology, convergence of telecom and IT, consumer preferences and behavior, also guide the regulatory environment demanding a degree of flexibility to ensure sustained investment in networks and facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the potential of the mining sector in  the Sultanate of Oman?<br></h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman's major mineral resources include gypsum, limestone, dolomite, marble, chromite, silica, and copper. Several industries have grown up around them as part of the national development process that, in turn, have boosted the minerals sector's contribution to GDP, as well as providing jobs for Omanis. The mineral industry of Oman is expected to continue to grow significantly in the coming years as international investors can make use of the country's strategic geographic location as a distribution center to India, the GCC, and other Asian and African nations. In the coming years, Oman will become increasingly important in supplying various industrial minerals to India and other Asian countries like gypsum, limestone, and dolomite. The capacity to export industrial minerals is expected to increase through the Port of Salalah, Sohar Port, and Duqm Port. According to the latest reports on the Indian cement industry growth scenario, the existing gypsum supply will be unable to keep pace with demand. Thus, the potential supply of gypsum from the Sultanate of Oman becomes an interesting prospect, and Omani gypsum will be the preferred source of imports in most of the regions in India, even including the northern region. Even after considering the maximum quantity of gypsum supply from Oman to India, the gypsum demand-supply deficit will widen on an annual basis, which will be reflected in an upward trend in the price of Omani gypsum.</p><h4>Are you facing any obstacles to commercial expansion?</h4><p>Currently, the only issue is about the delay in availability of natural gas to add additional value to gypsum investment projects; however, I believe that within the next two years this should readily be available. I believe that natural gas shortage will no longer be a problem from 2016 onwards.</p><h4>What industries do you supply?</h4><p>Gypsum, as a raw material, is used for plaster, gypsum board, and cement, and, hence, the construction industry. Gypsum (around 5%) is normally added to the product as a retardant to prolong the setting time of cement. Gypsum is also used as a primary raw material for plaster of Paris and gypsum board. Natural gypsum will remain the primary source of this commodity for decades to come. There is presently no substitute for gypsum in the production of cement and gypsum board. Our high-quality “SEETROCK" brand gypsum board will be supplied to the growing construction industries in Oman, other GCC countries, and India. Gypsum board manufactured with world-class American technology will be marketed with made-in-Oman branding.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of the joint venture with the USG Corporation and Boral Ltd?</h4><p>In 2012, Zawawi Minerals LLC established two joint ventures with USG Corporation from the US for gypsum mining, gypsum board, and plaster of Paris manufactur- ing projects in the Salalah region. In February 2014, our joint venture partner USG Corporation incorporated a 50:50 joint venture with Boral Limited, Australia and Asia's leading gypsum board manufacturing company, to form a world-leading gypsum board and ceilings joint venture in Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East. The joint venture includes Boral's operations in Asia and Australia, and USG Corporation's wholly owned operations in Asia and New Zealand, as well as USG's joint ventures in China and the Middle East, including the Oman joint venture with Zawawi Minerals LLC. Zawawi Minerals now is part of a transcontinental partnership with USG Corporation and Boral Ltd for gypsum mining and gypsum board manufacturing in the Sultanate of Oman. The USG-Boral joint venture provides Zawawi Minerals with an ideal opportunity to further strengthen our foothold across the booming cement and construction markets of the GCC, Indian subcontinent, and other Asian countries. USG Corporation was incorporated on December 27, 1901 and listed in New York Stock exchange, USG is a multi-billion dollar mining, manufacturer, and distributor of high-performance building systems like gypsum board, joint compound, and a vast array of related products for the construction and remode- ling industries. USG's Industry Leading Brands are: SHEET- ROCK® Brand Gypsum board, DUROCK® Cement Board, and SECUROCKTM Glass-Mat Sheathing. Boral Ltd is an international building and construction materials group, with its headquarters in Sydney, Australia. Boral produces and distributes a broad range of construction materials, including cement, concrete roof tiles, and gypsum board, for example. Boral primarily serves customers in the building and construction industries with operations concentrated in three key geographical markets: Australia, the US, and Asia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the expansion of Oman's maritime sector?<br></h4><p>Oman's maritime sector is witnessing a transformational expansion, owing to the recent global developments in maritime trade and the efforts of the Sultanate's government in carrying out major investments in port development and the Duqm dry dock, bringing them to world-class standards. Another important factor in the expansion is the increasing significance of Oman's strategic maritime position, arising from the perceived risks for the world's oil supply crossing the Strait of Hormuz. This strategic position increased the importance of Oman's coast on the Arabian Sea as an alternate route to the Gulf. Oman's maritime sector also plays an integral part in boosting tourism, by facilitating transport, and as such, its expansion contributes to the economic diversification initiatives by the government. Additionally, in a step aimed at boosting local and foreign investment in services as well as other sectors and diversifying the national economy, the Special Economic Zone Authority at Duqm (SEZAD) recently required all companies interested in doing business in Duqm to register with SEZAD in a simplified process that would take no more than 48 hours.</p><h4>What is the vision behind the establishment of National Ferries Company (NFC)?</h4><p>Our vision is to be “a renowned world class, national carrier for maritime ferry services of people's choice contributing to Oman's sustainable development." The government of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said had a great vision pertaining to the need for ferry services in order to connect the various parts of the mainland with over 3,000 kilometers of coastal areas. This is particularly important in geographically isolated areas, such as Musandam, which poses many challenges because it is outside the borders of Oman and involves crossing border points three or four times. At NFC, we have achieved our goal of connecting the people and the homeland. Additionally, we mobilized more than 34,000 passengers and more than 5,500 vehicles on the Muscat-Khasab route in 2013. We are improving people's lives by connecting very small villages in Musandam, such as Lima. We are also contributing to sustainable development. Our statistics show that NFC's ferries transported labor and goods to Musandam and had an indirect effect of contributing to the efficient supply of goods, services, and labor to the markets in Musandam. As part of NFC's efforts to realize the vision, it embarked on coordinated initiatives involving the standardization of its processes, and as a result the International Standards Organization (ISO)  awarded it the coveted ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 10002:2004 certifications.</p><h4>How are you supporting the tourism industry?</h4><p>Since the launch of its operations in 2008, NFC recorded increasing growth in passenger numbers, reaching a cumulative average growth rate of 30%. Between January and October 2014, we transported 62,831 passengers and 13,315 vehicles on board our ferries. The quality of the service we provide has contributed to boosting the diversity of our passengers' profiles. Typically, 25% of our passengers are residents of the Musandam governorate; we noticed increasing numbers of expatriate workers heading to Musandam, our main hub, for large infrastructure and development projects there. About 94% of our passengers were tourist-class customers, while those in business and first class were 4.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Additionally, significant growth in passengers is expected from the Shannah-Masirah route, which was launched on August 14, 2014 with eight trips daily. In three months between August and October we carried 28,937 passengers and 7,838 vehicles on this route.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the features of your new ferries?</h4><p>NFC strives to provide the most suitable ferries to each area. For example, along the Muscat-Khasab route, which takes about five hours to cross 230 nautical miles (430 kilometers), which constitutes the longest internal fast-ferry trip worldwide, the company deploys high-speed craft (HSC), namely the Hormuz and Shinas, each with a speed of over 50 nautical miles per hour. In 1Q2014, the company added two new aluminum ferries called the Shannah and Jawharat Masirah. These are two Ro-Pax catamarans, each 45-meters long with a 1.5-meter draft, that can go up to 15 nautical miles per hour. NFC tasked Strategic Marine, a renowned international ferry-designing firm, to design the two ferries so that they specifically suit the shallow depth of the Shannah-Masirah route. Each vessel has the capacity to accommodate 154 seated passengers, in addition to 38 cars, or a mixed-vehicle combination of four trucks and 22 cars.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[when-the-boat-comes-in]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges and opportunities of maritime transport in Oman?<br></h4><p>The shipping industry is cyclical in nature and capital intensive, which makes investors naturally cautious. Many are wary of making long-term commitments, and this aspect is one of the difficulties that we encounter. Oman Shipping Company (OSC) has followed the strategy of being a long-term investor by building new vessels for time charter to renowned companies in Oman, such as Oman LNG, Sohar Aluminum, and Vale Oman, among others. OSC seeks to expand through realizing long-term contracts with various commodity producers in Oman, but this is no mean feat, as they prefer instead to carry goods on spot and gauge market reaction. I believe that the shipping market has now troughed, and that prices will rise from here on in. Numerous entities in Oman are keen to export aggregates, as well as limestone and gypsum. In 2013, the prices for newly-built vessels hit a historic low, since then we have seen prices rising; ours is a cyclical market of buying low and attempting to sell high. In my view commodity producers should work closely with shipping companies, and as far as Oman Shipping Company is concerned, we are here to support Omani producers in any way that we can, not only by providing ships, but also shipping solutions.</p><h4>Oman Shipping Company began dealing with liquefied natural gas (LNG). What is the importance of this segment for your company today?</h4><p>OSC currently operates five LNG vessels, with a further vessel to be delivered by 4Q2014, which contribute 14% to OSC's fleet size. Our current fleet of LNG vessels have been contributing steady income to our company. They are based on 20-year contracts, which will remain in place regardless of market fluctuations. Sometimes ship owners say that the market is buoyant and charge high, but if they adopt a long-term perspective it becomes clear that our strategy actually represents a good deal in the long term.</p><h4>What is your competitive advantage over other shipping companies?</h4><p>Our local knowledge and established connections are our chief competitive advantages. We know the decision makers, and how to work efficiently, managing our vessels in house, which adds value to customers. Being a state-owned company, we have good relations with influential sector figures, as well as with our customers.</p><h4>Is the market becoming more competitive?</h4><p>Shipping is a competitive market, especially when you have access to financial resources to purchase vessels. I could buy a vessel, for example, and contract it to a third party to operate, and then contract it to other parties to commercially and technically manage. We undertake the commercial and technical management, and advise our customers on what they can do to generate higher returns, also proposing cost reduction methods that bring good returns.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of the Duqm project and how it will affect your business?</h4><p>In Duqm there are plans for various downstream plants,  although we do not know the volume set to be imported. Perhaps there will be potential in terms of crude movements, using our vessels to import it into this area. Meanwhile, exports really depend on the master plan; if the plan is to refine products for export, there is huge potential for OSC.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2015?</h4><p>I foresee positive developments for the shipping industry in 2015, and thus far there have been few new orders placed for vessels, due to prevailing unfavorable charter rates. In 2015, we hope that charter rates will catch up, and that the supply of vessels will match demand. By 2016, with shipbuilding prices having been low for a period, I predict a potential oversupply of vessels compared to demand, which would again destabilize the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the railway project for the Sultanate of Oman and the entire GCC region?<br></h4><p>The rail project will connect the GCC countries and enable the movement of goods and people around the region, thereby fostering integration between the GCC states. For Oman, it brings a change to the dynamics of logistics in the country. Oman has extremely sophisticated infrastructure, including three major commercial ports: Sohar, Duqm, and Salalah. They are all deepwater ports that can handle large ships and significant volumes. We have a sound network of roads and we will have five airports. The challenge now is how to exploit all of these assets and transform them so they become a feeder to the economy. The rail is the key that connects this entire infrastructure. I think the rail service is an important vehicle for the ports to market themselves as the gateway to the region. The railway can be a land bridge from our ports, for example, to the GCC, and even beyond the GCC in the future. This will change the landscape of logistics and transport in the region. I see logistics becoming one of the major economic drivers for the country—a major GDP contributor.</p><h4>How many phases are there in this railway project?</h4><p>We have divided our network development into three phases. Phase one is connecting the three ports—Sohar, Duqm, and Salalah—to the GCC, which is about 1,500 kilometers of work. Then we have phase two, which is connecting the other economic hubs and commercial centers. Phase three is a long-term development for connecting other cities and towns. We have ordered our priorities based on their contribution to the economy. Our focus at the moment is phase one, which is connecting the three ports.</p><h4>How will the railway overcome the complex geography here in Oman?</h4><p>Unfortunately, we have to go for tunnels, bridges, and viaducts. We require complex engineering solutions, which is one of the challenges we face in Oman. Our network is expensive. I think we are five times more expensive than any other GCC state per kilometer.</p><h4>How are you working to attract other investors to develop the railway here?</h4><p>We have had a great deal of interest in every aspect of the project; contractors to build, manufacturers to set-up in Oman, operators to partner, and the list goes on. For example, there is an appetite from international contracting companies to join the project. When we invited parties to consider the project, we were happy to see more than 100 companies expressing an interest in the development even with the current heated market. These 100 plus companies joined about 34 consortiums to express interest. We carried out an initial assessment of the parties, and we prequalified 18 large multinational consortiums. It is heartening news to see we have so much interest. We hope this will let us get the right partner with the right level of skill to do the job. It also drives the cost down as well.</p><h4>How are you contributing in-country value (ICV) to Oman?</h4><p>Because we are developing new projects in the country, everyone is looking at what that can do directly and indirectly to build local capacity. We started the project a few years ago and we took the view that every riyal spent on the project should remain in the country. First of all, we want to upgrade the manufacturing and service skills in the country. For example, we want to see products manufactured in Oman used in the rail project as much as possible. We are grooming Omani companies so that they have the skills and services to offer not only to the Oman rail project, but also in other markets in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Oman is aiming to position itself as the main hub for logistical operations in the Gulf region. To what extent is Khimji Ramdas involved in and benefiting from this objective?<br></h4><p>One of our four verticals has to do with shipping logistics and transport. We're already well entrenched in that sense, operating at three ports. We have an air cargo facility at Muscat Port. We are also in the trucking and warehousing business. We haven't ventured out into third-party logistics (3PL) because we are short of warehousing space, but once the infrastructure is up we'll move into that area. We'll also go into 3PL in Sohar and Duqm once they're ready.</p><h4>How important is Duqm for the expansion and consolidation of your activities?</h4><p>I'm one of those people who is extremely bullish on Duqm. I think that Duqm can be the natural entry point into the region. When you consider the whole broader region, be it the subcontinent, East Africa, or Yemen, Duqm is the most natural transshipment port. It's not that India or Africa don't have good ports, but in terms of congestion time, draft facilities, and infrastructure, none of them compare to the vision of Duqm. Once Duqm's vision is realized with the extension of the port within the next three years, and the completion of the container terminal, we'll have a port with a huge capacity on offer. Ship building, ship repairs, and dry-docking also all have huge potential. We're already providing tugboat services via a joint venture with Ocean Sparkle, the largest ship services company in India. In that respect, Khimji Sparkle is already providing tugboat services in Duqm, with about 30 of our people living and working there right now. We have a 50% share of all ships coming into the port. We're also the tugboat service provider to the Duqm Drydock Company.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your other joint venture with DB Schenker, which is the world's second largest logistics and transportation provider?</h4><p>We had already represented DB Schenker in Oman for the past 15 years. Then, we realized that with Oman's increasing significance and importance, we needed to establish a joint legal entity, which we did two years ago as DB Schenker-Khimji. There's so much more happening now, with so many more roads and railways being built, and DB Schenker is, without a doubt, a world-class expert in rail cargo. We decided to get into this area using their expertise, even if it was only in the field of rail logistics. Now, we have 30 people working at DB Schenker-Khimji, and we'll also have a dedicated Schenker warehouse, where we will be doing some 3PL.</p><h4>How does Khimji Ramdas import and apply the IT technology that's needed for this sector?</h4><p>We've made a huge investment in IT over the last four years. First off, we implemented the SAP system, from finance to human resources to processes. That was a huge move. Then, we put in a warehouse management system and a huge warehouse out in Barka, which is 27,000 sqm under one roof, making it one of the biggest warehouses of its type. It also has 6,000 sqm of office space. We recently rolled out the new state-of-the-art warehouse management system. With the full integration of that into our finance and banking system, and by connecting our suppliers through that single network, it will create a seamless paper-free organization. The Royal Oman Police and the Ministry of Commerce are both working on their own software and their own paperless applications, which should be implemented over 2015, but why can't we have all that under one system? We need a single seamless network that connects all the ministries. We've done this in our organization, and I think Oman needs to do that, too. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said's decree for the formation of a logistics strategy for 2040 is a crucial move. The Sultan of Oman's Logistics Strategy 2040 will be the cornerstone of which the country's overall economic strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-hub-to-be]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Reaching almost $2 billion in investment, the Port of Duqm is a joint venture between Antwerp Port and the local government. What is the importance of this partnership?<br></h4><p>Knowledge, and the exchange of knowledge, is crucial. To work, the Port of Duqm requires people and organizations that are knowledgeable of this kind of industry. The Port of Antwerp has teamed up with the government, and is the best partner since it has enormous experience in trade—it is a major European port. Once a port is built, you need to make it work; once the port was ready, we made a concession agreement between the owner of the port and the Port of Duqm. It was a concession agreement set up between the government and the Port of Duqm. The Port of Duqm is a 50-50 cooperation between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Consortium Port of Antwerp. Once that partnership was established, the concession agreement was made, and the agreement was to develop the Port of Duqm into a working, active port.</p><h4>How will Duqm reshape and redefine the logistics scenario not only of the country itself but also of the entire region?</h4><p>The potential of Duqm is enormous for several reasons. The most important aspect is its location. Duqm is well located in the new geopolitical center point of the world, the Indian Ocean, which is where all the streams of trade cross each other between East and West. I am not only talking about trade between China and Europe; a lot of trade will shift to the Indian Ocean. Sometimes, people say Duqm has no hinterlands so it is not directly a good container port. I agree with that. It is not a container port to supply Riyadh or Muscat. It is too far away for that. But, of course, a lot of container traffic is hub traffic, i.e. traffic that is just partly unloaded and transshipped to other places; but, also into the country itself, including the Wusta region, the Port of Duqm can be of importance. The Wusta region is by far the richest region in the country. It has a lot of energy and minerals. Minerals are also crucial to Duqm. There are lots of minerals—especially calcite and dolomite—that can be pretreated and then exported. Added-value products are very important for the economy of this country; within a circle of about 300 kilometers, nearly all the energy and the mineral richness of this country can be found. Automatically, that brings in Duqm as a center point. Railroads for Duqm are important; transport by rail is relatively cheap and we need cheap transport because it is a large country. If you serve the users of your product then transport is key.</p><h4>What do you do to promote the port in the international arena?</h4><p>The geopolitical heavy point of the Indian Ocean already attracts the political interests of certain countries. As soon as you are important, then politics starts to look at you. We are regularly visited by several navies, and not only the navies of the US, the UK, and France, but also the navies of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. When they have a joint exercise they come all the way to that area of the Indian Ocean where Duqm is. They come back to Duqm as their base point. That does not mean that Duqm is a military base; it is used as a service point. For us, that is important because it attracts business; the navies need fuel, so it attracts a lot of other activities. A Belgian delegation headed by HRH Princess Astrid visited Duqm. The visit itself was very valuable because, along with the Princess, a trainload of officials rolled in; 70% of the delegation was made up of business people from Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. These people came because it was an excellent opportunity to get the right information about Duqm.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the bilateral relations between Belgium and Oman?<br></h4><p>Over the years, Belgium and Oman have developed an excellent and strong relationship, which we maintain through regular high-level political contacts, and to which the cordial bonds between our Royal Houses contribute as well. Increasing business flows underscore the growing importance of our relations. However, a strong relationship is just as much built on people working toward achieving common goals. Therefore, it was a great pleasure to see a small but growing, dedicated and happy Belgian community contributing to the realization of Oman's development plans during my latest visit to Oman, in company of HRH Princess Astrid and Belgian businesspeople.</p><h4>HRH Princess Astrid, Representative of HM King Philippe of the Kingdom of Belgium, has recently visited the Sultanate. What were the main highlights of this event?</h4><p>Every year, Belgian federal and federated entities organize four economic missions abroad together. These missions introduce businesspeople to new markets, facilitate partnerships, and can boost bilateral trade substantially. Traditionally, these missions are presided over by the Crown Prince. But Crown Prince Philippe became King Philippe in 2013. Hence, in March 2014, HRH Princess Astrid, as representative of the King, lead an important delegation of 200 businessmen and women to Oman. This demonstrates the great interest from Belgian companies to do business in Oman. I am certain the royal welcome we received, the promising contacts we had and the interesting sites we visited, have made a positive impression and will entice more businesspeople to consider Oman as a partner.</p><p>The delegation visited Muscat and Duqm. Of course, the port of Duqm is an exceptional project and it comes as no surprise that the visit to the site was an absolute highlight. The sheer ambition of the endeavor, combined with the potential of the project for the overall development of Oman and even the region is just fascinating. I visited the site in 2012 and the progress that has been made is remarkable. I am proud that through our companies involved, Belgian expertise is contributing in such a significant way to the development of the port.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of the Port of Antwerp's involvement in the development of the Port of Duqm?</h4><p>The Port of Duqm will be one of the key factors in the town's economic growth, and will handle general and bulk cargo, as well as containers. The Port of Antwerp, as one of the most important ports in Europe at the crossroads of international supply chains, has invaluable expertise to offer. This expertise is now put to use in Duqm, where a joint venture between the Omani government and Antwerp Port Consortium will operate the port.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Given our connection to the port of Duqm, infrastructure and logistics are important areas for growth, and energy remains a strong traditional sector. But I see promising opportunities in healthcare, education, and sports technology as well.</p><h4>How do you envision the future relations between Oman and Belgium?</h4><p>I have returned from a satisfying and invigorating visit, believing that we can develop this relationship that rests on solid and longstanding foundations, into a dynamic partnership to the benefit of both countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Sultanate's potential to become a hub for the aluminum processing industry?<br></h4><p>Actually, we made the decision to build this plant following the construction of the Sohar aluminum smelter, the thinking being that this was the best location in the world to develop this business—both from an energy and labor standpoint. Additionally, this country has capital to invest. By contrast, the US is not seeing much expansion in the aluminum business. The available infrastructure here is superb, as is the development of the country. Moreover, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said's desire to develop the Omani manufacturing industry base, to create jobs, and to transform Oman into a global player is extremely encouraging. Additionally, the suitability for the aluminum and rolled products industry in the Gulf is considerable. Oman Aluminium Rolling Company (OARC) is the first aluminum rolled products company to have been built in Oman. We are 100% Omani funded, and employing 100% Omani operators.</p><h4>How will you expand and diversify your operations?</h4><p>As a first step, we will take a portion of our raw materials directly from our plant to a new facility that we are building—it will be part of our company—where it will be painted, which is a further value-added step. We will then ship to end users in the building products sector. We also have plans to expand our finishing capabilities to further process value-added materials. We can produce products down to 75 microns, which can be used as feed stock for downstream foil mills and other applications. We cannot produce the aluminum foil products seen in local markets, but we can provide feed stock to those who can.</p><h4>What contribution is OARC giving to the local workforce?</h4><p>Actually, that is the reason I came here. This is the fifth new manufacturing facility I have started in my 37-year career in the industry, so it was not starting a new plant that excited me. This is the first major company fully funded by Omani investment, and where we are starting with 100% Omani operators. We hired a group of young men, mostly directly out of school, and put them through a year-and-a-half of training—at a cost of $2.5 million—in everything, from the basics of how to work, to the basics of safety, and a degree of technical education. They have risen to every challenge, and today we have a 74% Omanization rate overall. Because we exclusively employ Omani operators, I have hired expatriate department leaders—I needed that in-depth experience to start this plant, and set up our training in order to keep our young operators safe, and able to learn.</p><h4>What are the main obstacles you face in your operations?</h4><p>There are a few obstacles, obviously, one being that, as managers from large US companies, we are accustomed to having access to parts, supplies, and machine shops. There is nothing you could think of that you would need in a factory—if you had to have a part made from a block of metal—in the US  you could find someone within a few hours to do the job for you. Here have to reprogram yourself to think you cannot just assume that there is a machine shop down the street.</p><h4>What is your target in the short term?</h4><p>The target for 2015 is to introduce our fourth shift. This year we will go to three shifts; we will run 24 hours a day, five days a week. In 2015, we will be chasing a production target of 100,000 tons, as we bring on the fourth shift near the end of the year. We will also start the paint line, which will be commissioned by September 2015. So, it will be in production by the last quarter. By 4Q2015, we will introduce our fourth shift, and our plant will become a 24/7 operation, and we will be up to a capacity of 140,000 tons.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did The Times of Oman develop and what are the main achievements?<br></h4><p>It actually started as a weekly newspaper (in 1975) and then went to a daily in 1990. Then we started coming up with  many supplements like Thursday Magazine and so on to keep up with the changes, face the competition, and make sure our readers didn't get bored. Now, with the internet we have the electronic site, and we have also moved into mobile to reach the audience. We also had a deal with hotels around the world and our paper used to reach anywhere around the world on the same day. People used to print out pages of The Times of Oman. We used to send free newspapers to colleges around the world, too.</p><h4>How do you compete with other newspapers in the Sultanate?</h4><p>We respect other newspapers, and we don't put them down at all. In fact, we help them. If their printers are down, we print their papers on our printing presses. At the same time, we like competition because it fosters creative thinking. We have many loyal readers and prefer not to print gossip. We have a wide variety of products for advertisers and readers. Now, we are trying to restructure and enhance our products with separate sections for health, entertainment, news and politics, and other subjects. We also help other organizations print their products for free with us, like the Beacon, from SQU. We don't look at the commercial side and the money; if it's benefiting the community, we will do it.</p><h4>When did you introduce the online version of The Times of Oman? How is it evolving?</h4><p>The website started in 1997. In the beginning, it was a static page with news, but before the fuller evolution of the internet, we also developed the e-paper; the entire paper was online. We continued by adding more technology to the site, and when social media came we added our own videos, again to keep up with change. We are also using mobile apps developed in-house to make it easier for people to reach us.</p><h4>What are the local trends in terms of printed versions versus online versions?</h4><p>The printed paper is two-dimensional, while the online version is multi-dimensional. We are therefore also trying to enliven the printed version. We have developed our own engine so that people can scan the paper with their phone or tablet and have videos or audio clips come up. People still like to read the paper. We are investing a lot of money in terms of technology so that we remain present, both electronically and on paper.</p><h4>What is your target in terms of readers? Can you elaborate on the evolution of the readership in Oman over the years?</h4><p>When it started the number of readers didn't even reach 1,000. It was very limited in range, and mostly read by foreigners, because many Omanis didn't speak English. In 1999 I remember we set a vision to be number one for readership, number one with the advertisers, and number one with the employees. Today, we are trying to become a regional newspaper. We have often been quoted by Al Jazeera, the BBC, or other international media and news entities. We want to be known widely as a source of the accurate news from Oman. We also want to become the number one source for quality news.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Connecting The Dots]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[connecting-the-dots]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Port of Salalah has been ranked among the world's top container ports. What factors are at the root of that constant growth?<br></h4><p>There are a number of factors that come together for the Salalah growth story, and the factors that propelled the port's growth over 15 years ago cannot be the same going forward. Our strengths will need to continuously change and mature with the times. Nonetheless, at the core here is location and connectivity. The Port of Salalah runs the lion's share of container services calling at Omani ports, and connectivity is always integral for customers and cargo owners who are seeking lean supply chain solutions. Shippers can save on costs primarily on the back of Salalah having the least deviation time from the main Asia-Europe trade lane in relation to competing ports in the region. Furthermore, this port was breaking world records in productivity in only its second year of operations, and until today this port ranks the third most productive port in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. This entails having the resources and the people necessary to keep up productivity.</p><h4>How do you differ from the ports of Sohar and Duqm?</h4><p>In the past few years since its inception, Sohar has been primarily involved in general cargo imports and exports for the country, while Salalah has focused on the container transshipment business. As time goes on, Sohar's share of container cargo will increase, while at the same time our general cargo capabilities and volumes will rise. Eventually we will be good at doing similar services but from different locations, and at that point we really need to differentiate our offerings based on the services, natural resources, and markets that each port connects to. That is what we are working toward alongside the government and other Omani ports so that we ensure we are not competing but complementing our unique growth stories. Oman needs for all of its ports to be connected in order for its national economy to grow.</p><h4>How would you assess the potential of the port as a cruise terminal?</h4><p>The basic infrastructure to support a good cruise terminal and a good cruise destination is already here; it just needs promotion and organization. Together with the Ministry of Tourism we are doing just that. We are investing in a new tourism center specifically for cruise vessels which will be located at the port. But we also need the rest of the tourism sector to realize that there are other things for tourists to do when they get to Salalah because it is just fantastic during the Kharif season. Still, we need to extend the tourism season throughout the rest of the year, and the port will do whatever it can to assist in that. The cruise offering in the past was not particularly good, but now we have a far stronger offering. It is still in its early days, but I think for Salalah it is probably a quick win; the more cruise vessels we can get here, then the more tourism we can get into the town, and the more money generated for the local economy.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2015, and where do you see the port in 10 years?</h4><p>My number one priority at the moment is to try to find ways to mitigate the Kharif challenges, and that is to some extent possible via technology and better ways to moor a ship. The long-term priority for the port is the breakwater, and that is the 10-year aim. We also need to promote Salalah as a gateway port; a gateway to Oman and the Gulf region, rather than just a transshipment port. That is the objective for coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the partnership between the Oman Drydock Company and Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering Company of Korea?<br></h4><p>Oman is known for its heritage of sailors, shipbuilders, and traders. To build on that heritage, the dry dock idea came about, but this is a new technology and a new business. We thought about doing it, but we knew we needed a helping hand on the technology side to be competitive. Consequently, we thought about partnering with the right company in order to get the job done. However, this is our project; therefore, the government continues to have a 100% interest in it. We looked around, and Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering Company, as one of the top three in the world in shipbuilding, represented the best option. It builds, and we repair, so the pieces of the puzzle came together. That is how the idea came about. It is not a traditional partnership, but the Korean firm helps operate the shipyard for us and, in the early stages, it helped design the shipyard with its more than 30 years worth of expertise in the sector.</p><h4>How would you rate your performance in 2013?</h4><p>Our performance has been excellent. If you look back, Oman Drydock really started in 2011 on the soft operations side. Since then, we have worked on over 260 ships. We have repaired LNG, VLCC, and container bulk carriers, all the way from the largest ships to the smallest, and even in different business lines. Although the world economy has emerged from the financial crisis, the shipping crisis is ongoing to an extent. Also, shipping is all about reputation by brand. We are a new brand and we are trying to make a name for ourselves. Also, we are the only company that is working and operating in Duqm as an industrial company. That by itself is a challenge.</p><h4>How does Oman Drydock look to stand out from its competitors in the GCC area?</h4><p>In the GCC, we don't look at each other as competitors. We see ourselves as completing each other. One of the reasons we wanted to establish a dry dock in Oman was because of the numbers. More than 30% of the oil exported around the world is sourced from this region. More than 60% of the LNG exports to the rest of the world come out of this region. Oman knows about oil products, from oil to gasoline, and we have six of the largest refineries in this region. As well, Oman Drydock has a number of advantages. First, we are located outside the Strait of Hormuz, in deeper sea and along the main trading lines. We are almost in the heart of the world between East and West when it comes to maritime trading lines. We are close to India and Africa, and today Africa is moving from a developing to an emerging market. We are also close to the Far East and to Europe. Furthermore, Oman Drydock has the latest in technology. We have the largest shipyard space-wise, and we have the two largest dry docks.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to expand your facility?</h4><p>If we talk about our operation, it has been set up in three stages: the first stage is ship repair. The second is offshore and industrial work. The final stage is shipbuilding. We have ship repair facilities and we were supposed to start fabrication in 2015-2016, but we are bringing it forward. As of 2014, we have already started preparing to do jackup rigs, offshore business, and industrial work. We wanted to take advantage of the opportunities because, right now, there is more business there than in ship repair. We will leave shipbuilding to time and economics, and then we will study it and embark on it if the numbers speak loudly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the company's focus since its foundation in 1981?<br></h4><p>We commenced manufacturing in 1982 with the objective of meeting the laundry products demand of the local market. It was widely observed that Omanis take pride in making use of their own country's products. There is a special pride in patronizing local brands and locally manufactured products as long as they meet the quality standards, are easily available, and have a competitive price. I believe this to be a significant factor that certainly enabled the company to grow right from the outset. We ensured the integrity of our quality control by employing technicians and managers from various multinational companies such as Unilever India, and some of the people who joined us 25 years ago are still working with us even today. We were one of the first among the detergent companies in the entire region to have ISO 9000 certification. Once we established our presence in detergent powder, we diversified into dishwashing liquid. We built a second manufacturing plant in Rusayl Industrial Estate for liquid products and a third plant after a few years, where we also began producing toilet soaps. And in 1998, we put up a new unit to manufacture sulphonic acid, which is a key raw material, as an input for our own consumption. Subsequently, we expanded our liquid product plant to produce other consumer products like home care items, and certain personal care products such as shampoo and hand wash liquid. We also have plans to eventually relocate operations to integrate our detergent powder factory under one roof with a higher capacity. In short, over a period of time the company has expanded in phases to become a multi-product firm. We are growing quite consistently in what is very much a competitive industry dominated by multinationals like Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, and Henkel.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What principle challenges does your sector face?<br></h4><p>The challenge we face at Muscat Airport is to continually expand and increase the capacity of our existing airport facilities, with the high level of growth we continue to experience; 2013 growth exceeded 10% in Muscat, with growth of over 15% in Salalah, and for 2014 we are expecting a growth of 6% to 7% in Muscat and more than 15% in Salalah. Our existing airport facilities are 40 years old, and despite having seen various expansions and enhancements over the years, these are at the end of their useful life. We are therefore very keen for a new generation of airports to be brought into service.</p><h4>Investment in aviation projects is due to exceed $6 billion by 2015. How will the new airport networks benefit the national economy?</h4><p>Essentially, the capacity for air transport into Muscat and the rest of Oman is constrained. We believe that many airlines would wish to bring extra services to Muscat, in particular cargo service flights, but they simply cannot be accommodated in terms of their preferred flight schedules and capacity. The new airport should reverse this malaise, particularly on the cargo/freight side of the business.</p><h4>What is the true potential for the cargo business?</h4><p>Currently, much of the airfreight entering Oman in fact arrives at Dubai International Airport, and is trucked down to the Sultanate. Yet once we get the new airport open, with a cargo terminal 10 times larger than the existing facility, all that will change, with a much better service becoming available for importers and exporters.</p><h4>What are the particulars of Muscat Airport and how does it differ from other airports in the GCC area?</h4><p>The main difference is that in Muscat we started our major airport development later than other airports. Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha will shortly open their new terminals and facilities, so in that sense we have lagged behind, but this does not mean that we have any less growth potential.</p><h4>The expansion of the airport will increase the number of existing routes into and out of Muscat. Which regions will be your main target markets?</h4><p>Our major growth in direct destinations derives from Oman Air's plans for fleet expansion and the opening of new routes. Its focus has been, and will continue to be, on Europe, Southeast Asia, and India when air service rights become available, as currently the Oman-Indian routes are constrained by the agreement between the two countries. Oman is no different from other GCC countries, such as the UAE and Qatar, where a huge proportion of the world's population is just a narrow body aircraft flight away. Key developing countries such as China and India have an increasingly affluent middle class with the propensity and ability to travel by air, which corresponds to huge growth potential through the GCC, including Muscat. Civil aviation in Africa, though starting from a low base, is also growing rapidly.</p><h4>As part of the development of the airport, you will see a huge rise in employee numbers. What role will Omanization play?</h4><p>In order to operate these new airports, we are currently in the process of tripling our staff numbers, and retain our 90% Omanization threshold. By that you can see that we are recruiting and training a large number of Omani nationals. That is a major focus of the company at this time, as we are recruiting not only experienced people from other industries, but also university graduates, and are sending many of our new recruits for training, both locally and abroad. For example, our job training schemes send Omani nationals to other airports, such as Munich, Dublin, or Singapore, where on-the-job training is delivered to our young staff.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the strategic development at Oman's maritime ports boost the economy?<br></h4><p>Omani ports will play a significant role in the economy. Starting from the north, Musandam is a medium-sized port. Then we have Shinas, which is currently under review. We also have a large port in Sohar, as well as Port Sultan Qaboos. Of course, there is also Duqm, which is under the Authority of Duqm, and then there is Salalah. We are thinking not only of the economy, but also the social aspect in terms of the employment opportunities it will provide. We expect 90% of freight passing through the ports to be international, and for it to contribute greatly to the economy of the Sultanate.</p><h4>How do these ports complement each other?</h4><p>Port Sultan Qaboos, which is in Muscat, will be a city port for tourism. Meanwhile, Sohar's role is a combination of containers, general cargo, and petrochemicals. The containers moving from Port Sultan Qaboos will be going to Sohar. Duqm will be a general port, as well as a major facility for the petrochemical and minerals sectors. We hope for Salalah to be engaged in the transshipment of containers because of its location and available space. Due to the Salalah Free Zone and the Salalah Industrial Zone, general cargo from the port is growing rapidly. There is a study currently underway at the Ministry to establish the optimum way for the ports to operate in a complementary fashion without duplication.</p><h4>How will the Omani railway connect this port network?</h4><p>This is a vital consideration, as the railway will connect Sohar Port to the GCC as well as to the important ports of Duqm and Salalah, before heading on to Muscat. We are conducting a study to find the best way to connect these major ports to the station. In fact, we plan for the railway to run directly into the ports, and the first to be connected will be Sohar, Duqm, and then Salalah.</p><h4>How would you assess foreign participation?</h4><p>Rotterdam and its long experience is a prime example of how important it is to seek input on the management of a port from those in the know. We are benefiting not only in terms of the ports, but also from observing the Netherlands to boost our own experience and technology base.</p><h4>When will the ports be running at full capacity?</h4><p>Each port is different. Port Sultan Qaboos is at full capacity, and hence its relocation to Sohar, where today's capacity utilization rate for petrochemicals is reaching 80% and is at roughly 30% for containers. Its current capacity is 800,000 containers, and it currently handles around 200,000. If the container business grows it could expand to 3.5 million, which would require a further 10 to 15 years to complete. The port of Salalah reached the 3.5 million container mark in 2013, and this is about 75% of its capacity, while on general cargo it reached almost full capacity due to limited space, meaning it is at 90% capacity today. At the moment, we are expanding the general cargo infrastructure. The port still has the capacity for some 1.5 million containers with the current space.</p><h4>Can Oman be a hub for maritime transport?</h4><p>For logistics, given our location this is possible. However, at the same time we need more foreign investment, and are working with government agencies to make the process easier and faster for companies. Of course, the completion of the railway link will provide the makings of an excellent hub, especially in terms of Salalah, from where the shipping of containers to the GCC will become easier. Moreover, the highways and airports will make Oman an important trade hub in the GCC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-third-party-man]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the factors that led to your expansion in Oman?<br></h4><p>We were very clear about our mission and objectives when we started out as a third-party logistics (3PL) provider. In terms of our processes, systems, facilities, and technology, we stuck to our objective of being a true 3PL provider and sought to apply the best available practices. As a result, we received a good response from the market and expanded to where we are now. Today, we're the only company in Oman that provides an integrated distribution center, providing complete certified supply chain services and a cold chain.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the most demand and who are your main clients?</h4><p>As a 3PL provider we provide complete logistical services, be it freight, shipping, clearance, transportation, warehousing, warehouse management, or consulting. So, we're a complete one-stop shop for all of those services. The oil and gas sector is of course the biggest sector of the economy in Oman, so a lot of our business is there. Among our clients are major players like Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), ExxonMobil, Occidental Oman, and Halliburton. In terms of other major sectors, we focus a lot on the FMCG sector, especially frozen foods. We have the only facility that guarantees the supply chain and cold chain in Oman, and it's the only one that is ISO 22000 certified. We're also developing a new concept based on outsourcing your warehousing needs, distribution needs, and value-added services: we take care of your packaging, bar coding, labeling, and, for some clients, we even take care of the translation of their labels and ingredients into Arabic. We take care of all that so companies can just focus on their core business: retail, purchasing, and selling.</p><h4>What role does technology play in your business?</h4><p>One of the competitive advantages we have lies in the technology we use and apply to our business. In transport, we have a complete tracking system and can track all freight and cargo anywhere around the world via our web-based system. We also have one of the best warehouse management systems (WMS) in the world, through which we can manage the entire inventory, be it reordering in accordance with expiry days or running special offers before the expiry of products. Also, our facilities are completely paperless and the process is also totally paperless, everything from receiving the goods to dispatching and transferring them. You can manage the whole operation from a smartphone.</p><h4>Do you have plans to expand your network throughout Oman and even beyond?</h4><p>Our strategic plan is to expand through partnerships. We're in discussions with major logistics companies in the UAE, Uzbekistan, and Turkey. We're halfway through our discussions, and these partnerships will be investment partnerships. We also have our current network through which we can transport freight to any part of the world.</p><h4>How much of an effect will all the ongoing infrastructure projects in Oman have on your business?</h4><p>Infrastructure is a major driver for Oman's plans to become a major logistics hub. The ports, airports, roads, and railways are all going to be a major boost not just for the logistics sector, but the whole economy. The ports are already in place, like Sohar and Salalah, while Duqm is on its way. The airports are already done or being built, of which Muscat, Salalah, and Sohar will be the major ones. The road connections are there directly with the UAE and with Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. There's a third one to connect us to Yemen. With the addition of the railways, Oman will become very competitive indeed. Freight will be transported easier, faster, and more cost effectively. The GCC railway will connect us all the way to Kuwait, and that may then be connected through to Syria and Turkey, and from there into Europe. So yes, we will benefit greatly from all these projects and this new infrastructure in Oman. We will also expand our own logistical facilities in accordance with this growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of the Special Economic Zone Authority at Duqm (SEZAD) for the development of the Sultanate of Oman?<br></h4><p>The objective of the strategy is to spread economic development around the country by investing in non-petroleum industries to diversify commerce formations, whilst also utilizing the Sultanate's vast natural resources and protecting its many distinctive forms of heritage.</p><h4>What kind of investment are you willing to attract to develop SEZAD even further?</h4><p>SEZAD is a model of integrated economic development composed of eight zones with a land area of more than, 1,777 square kilometers. Other than the world-class port and dry dock facilities, Duqm will have free trade zones, an industrial area, a refinery, a petrochemical plant, an airport, and residential and commercial facilities. We have designated an area of 23 square kilometers for the new town, which will be the backbone of the development area, and we have made provisions to extend it to accommodate up to 67,000 residential inhabitants by 2020. Therefore, we are attracting investment and trade, and many are considering Duqm.</p><h4>What initiatives are you taking to promote and enhance foreign investment in the area?</h4><p>Duqm has positioned itself on the world map, and we have conducted a few roadshows outside of Oman, and Ithraa will play an important role. SEZAD welcomes international investors and we have established several business leads. There is interest in the petrochemical and mineral processing sectors, but these will materialize subsequent to the establishment of the oil refinery and the supply of natural gas to the zone. There is also interest in tourism, staff housing, and warehousing projects. Another area of interest to SEZAD and some investors is renewable energy, such as wind and solar.</p><h4>How will the development of the infrastructure determine the success of SEZAD?</h4><p>This is an important factor. Connectivity with the entire world is important, and that is why the multi-model transportation design to connect Duqm via its port, airport, rail, and road network will insure that goods reach their destinations in less time, assisting both businesses and investors.</p><h4>How much are you investing in technology?</h4><p>Our technology component focuses on the existing project in the port as well as the dry dock; however, we are expecting to see a greater use of technology in the near future.</p><h4>What new job opportunities is SEZAD generating for the local community?</h4><p>The project is creating well-paid job opportunities for Omani youth, especially university graduates. The Omanization strategy at SEZAD focuses on raising the skills and capabilities of the country's human resources so as to enable those occupying leading positions at the Authority. We also urge the companies operating in the Duqm Special Economic Zone to employ Omanis and train them. In the long run, we expect that the projects carried out in the zone will contribute to assimilating more of the national workforce, especially with the increasing number of companies operating in the zone. The zone also allows young entrepreneurs to establish their own projects. Duqm has created permanent jobs as well as temporary jobs through its establishment and operations.</p><h4>What is your deadline for the completion of the area?</h4><p>The establishment of the SEZAD comes as part of the fulfillment of the Oman Vision 2020. Among the Vision's national objectives are to diversify the national economy beyond the oil sector and create a new engine of economic growth, to bring the development of the Al Wusta Governorate in line with the rest of the country, and increase the contribution of the private sector and its share of national GDP.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>HRH Princess Astrid of Belgium, representing HM King Philippe I of Belgium, on her royal duties, developing trade relations between Oman and Belgium, and regional integration.</h4><p>Muscat is a city well known for its beauty and elegance; it is always a wonderful feeling to be in Oman. I feel connected to this country and its people. The Omani people and authorities have always warmly welcomed Belgian delegations. This may explain why the Sultanate of Oman is known in Belgium as a most hospitable and generous country, and a nice place to be.</p><p>As the sister of the King, His Majesty King Philippe, and as his representative, I am proud to have led the largest Belgian economic mission ever to the Sultanate of Oman. I am grateful to my brother to have asked me to preside over this mission. I am also very happy to have had the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Didier Reynders at my side during the entire visit.</p><p>After this fruitful mission, I came to realize that Oman and Belgium, perhaps surprisingly, have a lot in common. Both our countries, or should I say, both our kingdoms, have been blessed with an ideal geographical location at the crossroads of trading routes and with access to the sea. And as we all know, a coastline is like a window on the world. This explains why trading and doing business beyond our borders are part of our national DNA. Both our countries can also be proud of their traditions and cultural heritage. Take for example castles and forts: they are striking landmarks in many places in the Sultanate of Oman, as is the case in Belgium, too. This heritage is attracting tourists from all over the world.</p><p>Both the countries are also active players in regional organizations, and in the case of Oman it is the GCC, and in our case it is the EU. The recent decision by our active foreign ministers to initiate regular political consultations between our governments will also bring Belgium and Oman closer together; there is no doubt about that. But there is even more to report in terms of similarities and proximity between Oman and Belgium: the Omani and Belgian people seem to both have a passion for cycling.</p><p>Our bilateral trade has increased substantially in recent years. Today, here in Muscat, literally hundreds of contacts and meetings have been taking place between Belgian and Omani companies and businesses. The first echoes of these fruitful encounters are very promising. They confirm that we were right to come here and to show our confidence in Oman as a trustworthy trading partner and as a safe investment hub.</p><p>During the visit to the Sultanate, we wanted to show our readiness to contribute to the economic development of Oman while, at the same time, we wanted to invite the Omani business community to come to Belgium. We visited Oman with the best the Belgian business community has on offer in key sectors as diverse as energy, energy efficiency, healthcare, specialized dredging and marine work, pharmaceuticals, and water management.</p><p>That so many SMEs have decided to come with us is also a very promising development. Let me give you one example of what we can achieve in our bilateral relations: our delegation has visited the new port of Duqm. We are proud that the ports of Duqm and Antwerp are developing a new, strong, and long-term strategic partnership for the promotion of this important harbor, another of Oman's anchors to the outside world.</p><p>I would not like to conclude this feature without paying a special tribute to His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Among his main achievements I would like to highlight the scores of educational establishments for boys and girls, from nursery level to university degrees, the excellent health service, and the modern road network and public infrastructure, all of which contributed to making the Sultanate of Oman what it is today, and all of which brought more well-being and prosperity to the Omani people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Humala's administration has been pro-investment from the outset. From a foreign policy perspective, what is the importance of FDI?</h4><p>Foreign investment plays a key role in the development of Peru. The regulatory environment for foreign investment has been one of the key drivers of development over the past two decades. The continued growth in the arrival of foreign investment in the country has been based on political, economic, and regulatory stability. The Peruvian government has a friendly approach to foreign investment with defined and stable rules. These principles have proven to be successful, and we have attracted investment from all over the world. Now, we would like to attract foreign investment conducive to the development of our industry, creating the basis for the development of science and technologies. To date, we have had a strong focus on natural resources—accounting for 55% of our economic output, especially minerals and metals. Building on this, we would like to diversify toward more advanced industry, as well as science and technology. This has been our underlying strategy since President Ollanta Humala entered office.</p><h4>How have relations with China developed since the signature of the free trade agreement (FTA) in2009?</h4><p>The FTA with China came into full effect in 2010, but in terms of bilateral relations between China and Peru, actual trade has doubled since then. In 2008-2009, bilateral trade relations accounted for $7 billion, whereas currently this print is at $15 billion. Last April, Peru and China agreed to further enhance bilateral relations between the two countries, and we now regard each other as comprehensive strategic partners. I was recently in China, whereupon we signed an agreement to generate mechanisms for the development of infrastructure, transport, technology, and natural resources. I think this agreement marks a turning point in the development of bilateral relations. We also signed an MoU for a railway connection study for a line that will run from Peru to Brazil connecting both oceans. These studies will be conducted in conjunction with Brazil and China.</p><div class="quote">“The Pacific Alliance was born out of a proposal made by Peru to the other members."</div><h4>You also recently returned from a state visit to Russia. What is the future of Russian-Peruvian relations?</h4><p>We held a comprehensive and interesting bilateral meeting based on the long-term economic cooperation between both countries. The outcome of this meeting was an agreement to begin negotiations at foreign ministry level leading to a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) within the two countries' service industries. This would mark the first step, to be followed by the signing of a full FTA between Peru and the Eurasian Union of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.</p><h4>How do you anticipate Peru's role in the Pacific Alliance evolving over the coming years?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance was born out of a proposal made by Peru to the other members, making it one of our primary initiatives in the region. Today we have reached 92% trade integration in the alliance, have signed an agreement to create a joint stock exchange, and are working to integrate new members. The main idea of the Pacific Alliance from the outset was to enjoy better ties with Asia, and accordingly, we are working together to target commercial and investment missions that would benefit the region.</p><h4>How does the ministry work towards opening new markets for Peruvian goods?</h4><p>One of our priorities is to make the best use of our FTAs, as they are useful tools in achieving a better diffusion of Peruvian goods into new markets. The current Peruvian government has worked from day one to increase its network of foreign trade offices around the world. Today, there are more than 30 such offices, with many created by the current administration. In total, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a network of over 125 offices among our embassies, consulates, and representative offices around the world. In this context, we complement the work that the Ministry of Foreign Trade implements. We recently signed several agreements with the private sector in order to better use the tools and products that Peruvian companies have abroad. We also have a strong focus on SMEs and are keen to attract investment for them, too.</p><h4>How are Peru's US relations developing?</h4><p>It is important for Peru to achieve an improved regional position, which should strengthen ties with the US in order to boost intellectual exchange and improve human resources movement. We also want to increase bilateral cooperation on national security, and have already begun related work. Peru has comprehensive relations with the US, and we want to maintain that level of sophistication while improving ties with other regions.</p><h4>What are the key Peruvian foreign policy goals for the coming years?</h4><p>Our aim is to establish Peru as an emerging regional power in South America. We want to become a member of the OECD, and are poised to sign a country program to improve national standards toward achieving that goal. This step is the beginning of a medium-term plan to create a foreign affairs and trade policy that would better promote and position Peru in the international arena. Our foreign affairs policy must work to advance our economic interests internationally, strengthening our bilateral ties with countries and their regions. This goes hand-in-hand with a more pragmatic strategy that prioritizes development. The goals are to diminish poverty and incorporate more growth into Peru's economic cycle.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

We also meet regularly at the UN and the Non-Aligned Movement meetings, and also as members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and ASEAN-GCC. The most important are our Bilateral Consultative Meetings, which are held in alternate years. Cooperation between us covers defense, education, health, and cultural affairs.

We have had regular high level and senior officials' exchanges. These have given us the chance to meet and create opportunities for cooperation. Ideas are discussed at meetings and many of them have been implemented, especially in education, where we have both offered scholarships to students. A group of secondary students made an initial study to visit Oman a few years ago, and now we are hoping to have more Omani students in University Brunei Darussalam (UBD). So, all in all, I believe we have a very positive future with Oman, especially as our trade relations are steadily growing.</p><h4>What makes Brunei an appealing destination for Omani Investment?</h4><p>Brunei and Oman have maintained a strong cooperation in investment over the past several years; the Oman-Brunei Investment Company LLC, Renna Mobile, and Kempinski Hotel. Meanwhile, an Omani IT Company, Bahwan Cybertek, invested in a joint venture with TelBru, a local telecommunication company, in 2012 providing domestic and regional call center services. With the recent visit of a delegation from Oman focusing on seeking investment opportunities with Brunei, a number of new investment opportunities were identified in various industries including the upstream and downstream oil and gas sectors, halal food and beverage, banking and finance. These investments need not to be limited to either in Oman or Brunei, but could also be extended to joint investment in third countries. Total trade between Brunei and Oman in 2013 amounted to just under BND2 million (approximately $1.6 million). Brunei exports to Oman fall under the category of “works of art, collector's pieces, and antiques," while Oman exports goods under the category of “miscellaneous manufactured articles." From an economic perspective, both countries can be characterized as being very dependent on oil and gas exports, which consequently leads to a strong drive toward economic diversification.</p><h4>An Omani trade delegation has recently visited Brunei: what is the importance of this event, and how did it strengthen the relation between the two countries?</h4><p>It was important. It confirmed our confidence in the potential for trade cooperation and encourages more business communities in both countries to consider new areas in which we can work together. During the visit, Oman encouraged Brunei to invest in its free economic zone, such as in Duqm. Likewise, Brunei took the opportunity to attract Omani investment. Apart from two-way investment, both sides were also looking at possibilities for a joint investment in Brunei, Oman, or in other countries. The willingness of both sides to work together, share experiences, and offer expertise, will strengthen existing relations.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Brunei and Oman share many political and economic aims. We are both oil and gas producing countries, and have the ultimate aim to diversify our economies. I think we can work very well together in sectors such as “downstream" industries, agribusiness, Islamic finance, tourism, and halal branding. One way of doing this is by expanding the investment opportunities through the Oman Brunei Investment Company (OBIC), which was set up five years ago.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UK is the largest foreign investor in Oman. How would you assess economic and trade relations between the two nations?<br></h4><p>The UK and Oman enjoy excellent economic and trade relations built on deep foundations of friendship and trust. We have been trading for some 400 years. There has always been a long-term and sustainable approach to investment from both sides, and a good example of this is the 30-year agreement signed at the end of 2013 that will see BP invest $10 billion to develop the Khazzan gas field.  The scale of UK investment in Oman is a clear sign of just how close our economic links are. According to recent figures, approximately 40% of FDI into Oman is from the UK. Furthermore, the two-way trade between Oman and the UK surged ahead by 17.5% to £671 million in 2013, over the previous year, mainly on account of growth in the UK's exports to the Sultanate. We hope that the recent launch of the Electronic Visa Waiver program for Omanis wishing to travel to the UK encourage further trade by making it easier for Omani businessmen to travel to the UK. The scheme means that Omanis can travel to the UK without the cost and inconvenience of obtaining a visa, instead simply filling in an online form. We greatly welcome the appointments in recent months of two new Co-Chairs of the Oman British Friendship Association (OBFA), which is the bilateral business council: on the Omani side, His Excellency Maqbool Sultan, the greatly respected former Minister of Commerce and Industry, and on the British side Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, a former senior diplomat with huge experience in the Middle East, who is now senior adviser to HSBC's Group CEO.</p><h4>Why is Oman an attractive destination for UK investment?</h4><p>Oman's stability gives UK investors great confidence. The strength and warmth of the bilateral relationship and our long trading history add to the attraction. Oman's infrastructure and development as a logistics hub through ports, rail, and road construction and expansion coupled with a choice of free trade zones offer a good mix for UK investors. Oman is a prosperous country with a young and ambitious population. Its policies on economic diversification and private-sector development create opportunities for the UK to support and partner in the many innovative companies and industries that are being created as a result.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>As Oman continues to put a lot of effort into increasing connectivity, through seaports, airports, and road and rail infrastructure, we expect companies from the UK, which has a long history in logistics and developing railway lines, to be involved in these projects throughout. The UK's competences are well regarded in areas such as security systems, operation, maintenance, management, training, and inter-modal transport facilities. I also believe there will be great potential for growth in the healthcare sector, where major new projects will present opportunities for long-term partnerships in specialist healthcare areas. The continued drive for private sector growth and job creation in Oman has created demand for education and training services, an area in which the UK has long been active in Oman and enjoys an excellent reputation. There will of course be many areas of potential growth for Omani investment in the UK. The UK is one of the world's most competitive places for investment management, as well as being a hub for finance raising. We would hope to see Oman choosing the UK as its preferred partner in both of these areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>I had the pleasure to visit the capital of the Sultanate of Oman, Muscat, from April 5-9, 2014. I was immediately drawn to the vibrancy of the city. I was also impressed by Oman's dedication to preserving its traditional heritage while developing its cities.<br></h4><p>Singapore is committed to growing its “Enhanced Partnership" with Oman. Our bilateral relations continue to deepen as we look forward to celebrating the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2015. Our links are deeply rooted in history. The Jewel of Muscat dhow on display at the Maritime Experiential Museum in Sentosa, and the redeveloped Muscat Street are evidence of how far in history this relationship extends. Singapore and Oman have had regular exchanges of high level visits in recent years. The then President S. R. Nathan's State Visit in 2009 was followed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean's visit in September 2010. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam also visited Oman in May 2012 and 2013. These visits have built a rapport and familiarity between our leaders and enabled bilateral cooperation to flourish.</p><p>A key pillar of our “Enhanced Partnership" is strong institutional links. The Singapore-Oman Joint Committee anchors the broad engagement between our countries and serves as the key forum for exchanging public sector expertise. The Singapore-Oman Business Council, led by the Singapore Business Federation and the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is an important networking platform for Singaporean and Omani companies to enhance business links. Economic ties between Singapore and Oman have grown steadily. In 2013, Singapore traded $2.07 billion worth of goods with Oman, while Singaporean firms have increased their presence in the country. Singaporean firms have made inroads into Oman's ICT sector, and are looking for investment opportunities in areas such as logistics, airport services, and fisheries.</p><p>Singaporean businesses are also participating in Oman's infrastructure projects. For example, Sembcorp has built an Independent Water and Power Plant (IWPP) in Salalah and will be developing a Centralized Utilities Facilities for the Duqm Special Economic Zone (SEZ). Singaporean companies stand ready to continue contributing to Oman's economic development. In particular, Duqm holds much potential as a greenfield project. The entry into force of the Gulf Cooperation Council-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (GSFTA) provides another excellent platform for the strengthening of economic ties between Singapore and Oman, as well as the larger GCC region. Oman can be a gateway for Singapore's trade with the GCC. Likewise, Omani businesses can use Singapore as a springboard to reach the ASEAN region. The reduced tariffs of goods entering Oman will have a positive impact on the volume of trade. Oman has always been a strong supporter of the GSFTA. Singapore looks forward to working together with Oman to successfully implement the agreement.</p><p>Oman has all the right ingredients. Many Omanis are fluent in English, and motivated to succeed. There is much that Singapore can learn from Oman. We should complement our excellent bilateral and economic relations with more people-to-people exchanges in areas such as performing arts, education, and tourism. This will ensure an enduring friendship between our countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate Oman's economic performance in 2013?<br></h4><p>Oman experienced stable GDP growth in 2013 supported by both an increase in oil production and a rise in government expenditure. According to the latest data published by the National Centre for Statistics and Information, nominal GDP grew 3% in 2013. The share of oil sector GDP was about 44% and non-oil GDP 56%. While Oman crude oil prices dropped from $109.60 in 2012 to $105.50 per barrel in 2013, oil production increased 2.3% to 343.8 million barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2013. Actual government spending in 2013 is estimated to be slightly above OMR16 billion, or 23% above the estimated spending, of which 63% is recurrent expenditure amounting to OMR10.08 billion (50% of the recurrent expenditure is allocated to civil ministries). The increase in government expenditure, compared with 2012 actual expenditure of OMR13 billion, reflects in part the government's focus areas on social development, including job creation for about 56,000 Omanis and increased spending on education and healthcare. In addition, government expenditure during 2013 focused on supporting the SME sector, increasing local and foreign investment in the private sector and initiating new industrial zones.</p><h4>Oman's economy is expected to grow by 5% in 2014. What factors are determining and supporting this achievement?</h4><p>On the basis of a World Bank report warning of an oil crunch in 2015, the Supreme Committee for Planning predicts that international oil prices will rise in 2014 and increased oil prices, hence income, have always had a positive impact on GDP growth. More importantly, fiscal expansion will maintain economic growth. In 2014, the government will increase its investment expenditure on development projects and maintain the current levels of public debt. In addition, the current emphasis on social development, by giving priority to job creation in the private and public sector and increased spending on education, training, and healthcare will have a positive impact on output growth. The first Financial Stability Report (FSR) released by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) in May 2013 expects that Oman's economic growth momentum will continue to be “driven primarily by public sector activities, backed essentially by domestic demand, characterized by an improved diversification of the economy, and reflected in the decline in the excess contribution of the petroleum sector to GDP growth vis-í -vis the non-petroleum sector, while the overall growth process is expected to be sustainable moving forward."</p><h4>What role does the in-country value (ICV) strategy play in achieving the goals of diversification in Oman?</h4><p>The ICV strategy is a partnership between the government and companies that operate in the oil and gas sector. The strategy is to increase the total spending of firms for the benefit of business growth and human resource development, and induce output growth in the country. The government will give tender award preference to firms that are highly Omanized and to firms that have a clear Omanization program in place. The strategy will develop Omani managers and professionals for higher technical and managerial levels in the private sector.</p><h4>How is the Sultanate improving its attractiveness for FDI?</h4><p>Oman's FDI inflow has experienced steady growth since 2004. This increase in FDI is the result of a healthy macroeconomic environment and stable institutional framework including property law. The government allows up to 100% full ownership and investment in key strategic sectors including the oil sector. Furthermore, the government has been promoting competition in major economic sectors such as infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. Government efforts are paying off. The country's competitiveness has been increasing. According to Ernst &amp; Young's 2012 attractiveness survey, Oman ranked as the 32nd most competitive country in the world. According to the study, in 2011, Oman enjoyed an increase of 66% in project numbers, an 89% increase in capital investment, and a 17% increase in new jobs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-reality-approach]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you share with us Ithraa's latest highlights and milestones?<br></h4><p>Ithraa has worked with inward investors and Omani non-oil exporters since 1997, helping them identify opportunities domestically and internationally. And we have been successful. Today, Omani firms export to over 140 countries worldwide, and in 2012 exported just over $9 billion worth of non-oil commodities. Exporting is good for Omani business, good for Omani workers, and good for Omani jobs. Put simply, when Oman exports, Oman prospers. Tapping into consumers in fast-growing international markets and as well as in our traditional markets is crucial to putting Oman's economy on a solid footing. Helping businesses penetrate those markets is what we excel at. Exporting is of course fundamentally a decision driven by local businesses. But, firms attempting to close an export sale can face hurdles, including the lack of readily available information about exporting and market research, challenges obtaining export financing, and strong competition from foreign companies. This is where Ithraa's staff and services play such an important role. We help Omani businesses assess export opportunities, from developing a plan, identifying buyers and markets, and advising on regulations to managing logistics. If I have to highlight some of our recent Ithraa success stories, these would certainly include the 2013 UNCTAD Award for Excellence in Promoting Export-oriented FDI. This is a major international prize, and one we're very proud of.</p><h4>How would you rate the Sultanate's diversification policy to date?</h4><p>Today, we export to over 140 countries worldwide and during the first eight months of 2013 we experienced an 8% growth in non-oil exports compared to the same period in 2012. In 2012, we exported over $9 billion worth of non-oil commodities and expect to see 15% growth in 2014. This is all very healthy. If I'm to talk about diversification and inward investment, I'd have to mention Vale—a Brazilian multinational metals and mining company that made an initial investment of $1.25 billion in Oman. Its operations have generated more than 1,200 direct jobs and injected over $2.5 million into SME contracts, which will lead to further job creation and national capacity building. Vale has invested $10 million in training more than 200 of their employees, all of whom are now qualified mining industry engineers, technicians, and operators.</p><h4>Oman has set a target to increase, by 15%, the value of its non-oil exports. How is Ithraa supporting the government to achieve this goal?</h4><p>We work closely with domestic exporters and run an annual visit program to Omani manufacturers; this helps us identify any export problems or obstacles encountered by domestic firms. The field visits also provide us with an opportunity to brief local exporters on Ithraa-led activities and services. On the international front, we have trade and investment representatives in key global markets all actively involved in promoting Omani products as well as investment opportunities. Indeed, helping domestic companies penetrate mature as well as emerging markets is extremely important to us. With regard to more mature markets, we've been helping local companies participate at major international trade shows in the Gulf, the US, Asia, Africa, and Europe. We've also been encouraging Omani exporters to take advantage of the Oman-US Free Trade Agreement, which has seen Oman's non-oil exports to the US hit $605.7 million in 2012 as against $289.6 million in 2011. This is an increase of nearly 110%.</p><h4>How is Ithraa promoting and branding Oman internationally?</h4><p>In this regard, Ithraa is working with partners in the public and private sector to help differentiate Oman from other places and hence facilitate the promotion of the Sultanate's place product offer. In simple terms, a nation's brand is a multidimensional assortment of functional, emotional, relational, and strategic elements that collectively generate a unique set of associations in the public's mind. This set of associations creates a brand image—a bundle of ideas, feelings and attitudes that people have about a particular country. It's impossible to sum up Oman's brand in a word—it's multi-dimensional and constantly changing—and as the brand's strap-line says: we're on “an evolving journey." We're fully aware that trying to create a brand artificially is dangerous. At Ithraa, we're working on reality, not image. It's this approach that will generate real interest in the Sultanate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant is in-country value (ICV) for the company?<br></h4><p>From its inception, Oman Oil Company has always been there to enhance shareholder value. I believe that actions speak louder than words. If you look at what we have achieved to date, we contribute about 4% to GDP within our portfolio in Oman. Today that consists, globally and internationally, of about 40+ existing investments, plus new developments in about 15 countries. The current headcount locally is just over 8,000. With the existing plans in place, we will probably double that by 2023. That is direct employment. What we are looking at now is raising the bar further by enhancing ICV. We have a human capital arm called Takatuf Oman, which, since 2013, has been corporatized into a separate entity. Our idea is to embed ICV in the way we conduct business, not as an afterthought. It is part of our core business, keeping in mind that we only invest in globally profitable, competitive and sustainable businesses, not social programs. The intention here is going beyond investment. It has to be something that adds value and integrates existing investments with new ones.</p><h4>What are the main projects you are developing in Duqm?</h4><p>Duqm involves several projects. The Duqm Refinery of course is the centerpiece of the development, and it will have a capacity of 230,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). As a result of that, we will also be putting in place a Centralized Utility Company that will provide certain services, such as industrial gases, power, waste management, and cooling water on an integrated basis for new developments. With that, we are also constructing pipelines to supply oil and gas. The oil pipeline will actually go to another investment we are putting together. That will potentially be one of the largest crude oil terminals in the world, about 70 kilometers from Duqm. That terminal will supply the Duqm Refinery using a smaller pipeline, but also be available for crude imports, as well as either for commercial storage or strategic storage. In 2013, we acquired a chemical company based in Germany with operations in the US called OXEA. The next large investment by OXEA will be in Duqm, and we are just putting together the plans for that. We recently launched a master plan for the petrochemicals business, which is scheduled to be ready by the end of 2013. That will take the products coming out of the refinery and add value to the existing molecules we produce in Oman.</p><h4>Can you talk about your investments in the mining sector?</h4><p>In mining, I would say we are still in the infancy stages. We have a mining investment in Canada called Black Rock Metals, which is an iron ore and titanium resource mine in Saguenay; 7,000 people are currently living there. It is nearby to an aluminum smelter owned by one of our partners. We are also studying other potential mining opportunities in Oman and elsewhere.</p><h4>Can you discuss your global presence and your expansion programs?</h4><p>Right now we are focusing on leveraging and optimizing our existing holdings. We have investments operating in over 15 countries. Any new investments will need to have a direct link back into Oman. There is a focus currently on investing in Africa, specifically Tanzania, where we have opened an office. That office is looking into a few potential investments. Given Africa's potential and its proximity to Oman, as well as historical ties, that is why we are focusing there.</p><h4>What is the future of the oil and gas industry in Oman?</h4><p>Most of the resources are maturing, so we will have to be more creative and think outside the box on how to maximize or stabilize the current production. Recently I saw there are 40,000 potential jobs in the oil and gas sector going forward. The positive aspect is that the more complex it becomes, the more jobs you need to generate. The days of easy oil are over and it is time to think a bit more aggressively on how to optimize production.</p>]]></richbody0content>

It is always a pleasure to be back in Oman, in the capital city of a fascinating country that I know well and where I feel at home. Thanks to the leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Oman is today a stable and more prosperous country.<br></p><p>It has successfully combined tradition and modernity, and gained international respect and recognition for its contribution to peace and security, as well as for its capacity to promote dialogue and mediation among nations.</p><p>Spain has a centuries-old tradition of strong relations with the Arab peoples, which is reflected in our language and culture. And now, in order to improve mutual awareness and understanding, we have created Casa Árabe, or “Dar Al Arabí­a," which actively endeavors to bring our societies closer together.</p><div class="quote">“Thanks to the leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Oman is a stable and more prosperous country. It has successfully combined tradition and modernity, and gained international respect and recognition for its contribution to peace and security and for its capacity to promote dialogue and"</div><p>I am proud to note that the Omani authorities are counting on cooperation from Spanish institutions and specialized Spanish companies to undertake landmark projects, among which are the restoration of its architectural and historic heritage, the ongoing interior works at the new National Museum, and the design of the Omani Tourism Strategy.</p><p>The official and business delegation that came with me to Muscat showed how important Oman is in our political and economic agenda. In fact, the businessmen that were here represented renowned Spanish companies with a solid international reputation and expertise in the sectors of infrastructure, energy, oil and gas, and defense. They wish to continue their involvement in the ambitious development projects foreseen by the Sultanate in the framework of its successive five-year plans and Vision 2020.</p><p>We aim at the creation of a solid network of relations between policy makers and companies of both countries. Having undergone a period of economic crisis with a painful loss of jobs, Spain is now returning to the path of economic growth, and foreign capital is strongly returning to our country. That is the result of a strict policy of fiscal consolidation, ambitious structural reforms, and a deep reform of the financial sector.</p><p>Today, our main imbalances are being corrected. At the same time, Oman is facing the challenges of modernity with visionary projects deeply rooted in its rich history as a trade hub and cultural bridge between Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Oman and Spain signed an agreement aimed at avoiding double taxation and tax evasion in income tax. This agreement will regulate the imposition of taxes by the Spanish or Oman's government on individuals and companies residing in each other countries, and it will facilitate economic and trade liaison for investors and businessmen in the two countries.</p><p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in the field of transport implies an exchange of expertise and assessment of transport development, and it will support project planning. It also includes the formation of a joint committee to take the responsibility of coordinating the programs and activities implemented by Oman and Spain. Another important highlight is the MoU in the tourism field: it aims at enhancing tourism cooperation between the two countries, including investment and exchange visits.</p><p>I hope that my visit marked a turning point in deepening a mutual knowledge and relations, not only because of the agreements that we signed, but also because of the bright prospects for cooperation between our two countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>The building of a modern state, which we pledged to establish since the first moment of the dawn of the Blessed Renaissance, required us to exert big efforts in the field of establishing infrastructure, which is the pillar and first cornerstone of comprehensive development.</p><p>The provision of this infrastructure, in all parts of the Sultanate, has provided a major opportunity for construction development in various cities and villages throughout Oman and paved the way for the establishment of many economic, commercial, and industrial projects as well as different educational, cultural, health, and social institutions. Any observer of daily life in Oman will see this quite clearly. Omanis have been, since ancient times, makers of civilization with their great historic heritage, their openness to other civilizations across the seas and oceans, and their ability to communicate and exchange mutual benefits with others. This is why Omanis are well qualified to be an example and a model for others to follow in this age of rapid development and progress, and why they are also capable of coping with the challenges of the modern age, and adopting every new enlightened idea, benefiting from science and new technology, and at the same time always preserving the values and high principles that they believe in, and the traditions and authentic customs with which they were brought up.</p><p>We all know that progress is part of the reality of the universe we live in. However, many ways and means are required in order to achieve it: the first of these is a strong will and determination, and a readiness to face challenges and persist in one's endeavors to overcome difficulties and obstacles. Therefore, every nation that desires to live—in the full meaning of the word—needs to roll up its sleeves and work tirelessly and diligently with dedication and the love to give generously to utilize its capacities and skills and invest in its resources and potential, so that it can build a great and illustrious present and prepare for a decent and prosperous future. Omani people have been granted many of these qualities, and over the past four decades they were able to realize achievements that still stand as clear evidence that cannot be denied by anybody who has the power of vision and insight.</p><p>We have always affirmed our continued attention to the development of human resources, and we said that these resources take top priority in our plans and program as the human being is the cornerstone of every development structure and a pivotal component around which all types of development revolve as their ultimate goal is the happiness of the individual, providing him with means of a decent living and guaranteeing his security and safety.</p><p>As the youth are the present and future of the nation, we gave them the attention and care they deserve throughout the years of the Blessed Renaissance as the government endeavored to provide them with education, training, qualifications, and employment opportunities.</p><p>The forthcoming stage will witness bigger attention and greater care to provide more opportunities for the youth in order to consolidate their gain in knowledge, strengthen their talents in creation and production, and increase their participation in the comprehensive development march.</p><p>As education is the basic pillar of progress and development, and in order to produce a responsibly aware generation with expertise and skills, and aspiring to a higher level of knowledge, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the educational march in order to achieve these aspirations and benefit from the available job opportunities in the public and private sectors.</p><p>The construction, economic, commercial, and industrial projects established during the past in various parts of the Sultanate have absorbed many national workers, and the private sector has proved its cooperation in shouldering the responsibility as it assumed a tangible role in cooperating with the government and boosting sustainable development efforts. We are looking forward to a greater role to be played by the private sector in the future, particularly in the field of the development of human resources.</p><p>As education is the basic pillar of progress and development, and in order to produce a responsibly aware generation with expertise and skills, and aspiring to a higher level of knowledge, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the educational march in order to achieve these aspirations and benefit from the available job opportunities in the public and private sectors.</p><p>We are looking with satisfaction at the efforts made by the government during the recent past in implementing our directives to employ thousands of our sons and daughters in the civil, security, and military sectors, and we express our appreciation for the efforts made by the private sector in this important domain.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on Oman's role within the GCC?</h4><p>Oman is one of the founding members of the GCC. We believe in the GCC and its lofty goals and objectives. Oman will continue its role in promoting cooperation and sound integration between the GCC countries. We are of the view that there is so much that could be done within the GCC framework and institutions that would positively change the lives of the peoples of the region. Oman will continue to push for closer cooperation between the GCC countries and its economic partners in the region and beyond. These actions and measures should bring, in our view, further stability and greater prosperity to our region and the world at large.</p><h4>How would you assess Oman's current foreign policy?</h4><p>To understand Oman's foreign policy is to understand how skilled diplomacy works—how balancing interests, tolerance toward differences, and a determined search for mutual benefits can open international doors and keep them open, even during conflicts. Oman's foreign policy takes its directions from His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said's vision, which aims at building bridges of friendship and opening up new horizons of cooperation and cordial relations with other countries, based on the principles of mutual respect, non interference in other's internal affairs, good neighborliness, and dialogue as the most suitable mean to resolve differences. Oman's foreign policy has become a means of promoting economic and social development at home, as well as a force for peace, stability, and security for the Sultanate, its neighbors, and the world at large.</p><h4>What has been the most significant foreign policy achievement of 2013?</h4><p>Oman strives to promote peace and contribute to eliminating tension in the region and beyond. In this regard, it has played a positive, pivotal role in helping diffuse tensions and narrow differences between countries. We in Oman are content with how things are shaping up between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 5+1 group of countries. We are confident that they will manage to steer the negotiations to a successful outcome that would end years of mistrust and replace it with understanding. We are also confident that the GCC initiative is the most viable tool out there to help our brethren in the Republic of Yemen in their pursuit of reconciliation and a better and a more secure country.</p><h4>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently visited the Sultanate of Oman. What is the importance of his visit?</h4><p>Exchange of high-level visits between countries reflects positively on bilateral relations. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said welcomes world leaders to Oman, and highly values their interest in our country. State visits at this high level provide valuable opportunity to exchange views on various matters of bilateral and mutual interests. The visit of Prime Minister Abe to Oman has undoubtedly provided an opportunity for further cooperation with an important partner such as Japan. The visit was concluded with a Joint Communiqué reflecting both countries aspirations for the coming years. We are hopeful that this visit will further expand relations between Oman and Japan in various sectors including the exchange and transfer of Japanese knowledge and know-how to Oman.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the main highlights of the latest visit of Iran's President Rouhani to Oman?</h4><p>President Rouhani's visit to Oman signifies the importance of the relations between the two neighboring countries. We share with Iran not only geography, but a common history. Oman is confident that closer cooperation would lead to a better and prosperous future for both countries. President Rouhani's visit to Oman comes after His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said's visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran right after the election of President Rouhani. Our relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran encompass a wide range of issues, including politics, economy, and culture. Our cooperation contributes to regional and international peace and security.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the state of bilateral and trade relations between South Africa and Oman?<br></h4><p>South Africa and Oman maintain good bilateral political relations, and the potential for the enhancement of trade relations remains expansive. We have institutionalized our relationship through the establishment of a Partnership Forum to explore opportunities for joint collaboration in the fields of education, economic relations, science and technology, and agriculture at both the provincial and governorate levels. I further undertook a state visit to the Sultanate in November 2011, during which investment opportunities were identified and trade and economic agreements were signed. South Africa and Oman maintains a strong defense relationship. Frequent exchanges of bilateral visits have taken place. Oman is also an importer of military equipment from South Africa, and was the first Gulf country to acquire South Africa's G6 artillery system in the 1990s. We are pleased that total trade between the two countries has shown a strong increase over the past five years, with growth of total trade averaging 178.09% over 2009 to 2013.</p><h4>How can the two countries mutually complement each other both politically and economically?</h4><p>Within the multilateral arena and with the objective of strengthening south-south cooperation, South Africa and Oman cooperate within the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC). Both South Africa and Oman have adopted developmental agendas—the National Development Plan and in the case of the latter, Vision 2020—and we envisage increased cooperation in a variety of complementary fields for our mutual benefit, including trade and investment, and education. We are exploring the potential for joint investment in South African infrastructure projects and tri-lateral investment projects in other parts of Africa.</p><p>We are keen on civil society exchanges to address education/training and health services requirements and on increased trade, especially to address food security issues in Oman through initiatives such as the establishment of a cold storage facility at the Port of Sohar Free Zone. In this regard, agreements have been concluded between the Ports of Sohar and Salalah with Richards Bay Industrial Development Zone. The benefits of these initiatives could potentially be expanded to other South Africa provinces since Sohar serves as an entry point to other GCC countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, while Salalah has extensive connectivity in terms of shipping lines in all directions to the rest of the world and road links to the interior of Oman and Saudi Arabia that could fast-track the transportation of goods. Both South Africa and Oman offer the potential for enhanced tourism between the countries. In this regard, the 2010 World Cup did much to enhance South Africa's image in Oman.</p><h4>Which sectors are both countries focusing on in terms of trade, investment, and collaborations?</h4><p>South Africa has undertaken various business missions to Oman, headed by the former Minister of Trade and Industry of South Africa in March 2006 and by the former Kwa-Zulu Natal MEC for Economic Affairs in May 2006. The Omani Minister of Trade also visited South Africa, accompanied by a business delegation, in November 2006, where a trade agreement was signed during the Business Forum. South Africa's Minister of Economic Development visited the Sultanate in May 2010 and was accompanied by over 25 members of a South African delegation, representing a wide range of industries including automotive, electro-mechanical, agro-processing, logistics, and tourism. Several sectors have been identified as priority sectors for investments and for joint cooperation to increase trade, including: agro-processing; petrochemicals; innovation and technology; the green economy; infrastructure development; and minerals cooperation.</p><h4>Which areas are expected to see a boost in the short term?</h4><p>Cooperation is being explored in the field of sustainable aquaculture and fisheries and in the exchange of technical expertise in defense and security between the South African Police Services and the Department of State Security and the Royal Omani Police Force and the Sultan's Special Forces.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess bilateral relations between the two nations?<br></h4><p>The Middle East prominently features in our foreign policy, as this region alone hosts around 5 million expatriate Bangladeshis. At present, the Sultanate of Oman is a major destination for a Bangladeshi skilled and semi-skilled workforce. They are contributing to the ongoing fast-track development activities in Oman. We deeply value our relations with the Sultanate, which are expanding with time. Our two countries have a commonality of views in promoting the cause of regional and international peace, security and development. The common focus of Bangladesh and Oman in regional and international issues is the fundamental basis for our mutually beneficial bilateral relations. In the pursuit of boosting our bilateral relations with the Sultanate, the past few years have been the most significant. We witness with great satisfaction the establishment of a fully-fledged embassy by the Sultanate in Dhaka. During bilateral talks in the recent past, we have identified agriculture, fisheries, trade, and investment as key areas of interest for mutual cooperation. I am further delighted to know that the Omani authorities have expressed interest to set up an Oman-Bangladesh Joint Development Fund, which I believe will be instrumental in promoting two-way investments in mutually beneficial ways.</p><h4>Why is Bangladesh an attractive destination for Omani Investment?</h4><p>In the past five years, we have consistently attained over 6% economic growth despite the global recession. Our target is to achieve 8% growth in the next few years. The socio-economic indicators have shown remarkable improvement. We have attained most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Our macro-economic management is sound. Foreign exchange reserves are now at an all-time high. Our exports are growing steadily. We are finding new markets for IT, pharmaceuticals, furniture, shipbuilding, and leather products. The current account balance is in our favor. We have ensured good governance and rule of law in the country. If this trend would continue, we are hopeful that we will become a middle income country by 2021. Bangladesh's favorable investment climate has been recognized by many around the world. We have been included in Goldman Sachs' Next-11 and JP Morgan's Frontier-Five list. Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P) and Moody's have also placed us ahead of most countries in South Asia. Bangladesh offers a competitive location for doing business in terms of costs, inputs, human resources, market access, and a business friendly environment.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>In the last fiscal year, Bangladesh's export revenue crossed $30 billion. Key sectors that contributed to the export growth include textiles, readymade garments (RMG), jute and leather products, frozen food, shipbuilding, ceramics, agro-based products, plastics, and furniture. As Oman prepares itself as a re-export hub having a free trade agreement (FTA) with countries like the US, Omani entrepreneurs can effectively utilize Bangladesh's export-oriented production capacities by re-exporting all categories of products to destination countries worldwide.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Oman's economic future and for relations between the two nations?</h4><p>In recent years, Oman's economy has been undergoing a steady transformation, reorienting from oil toward a more diverse set of service and industry-based economic activities. The Sultanate has maintained steady growth, insulating the country from economic tumult elsewhere through prudent economic and fiscal policies. We are happy to see that in the short and medium terms, Oman is making full efforts to reinvest its oil and gas windfalls to raise the quality of infrastructure, broaden social services, and encourage economic diversification through the development of SMEs and other important sectors like tourism, oil and gas, mineral resources, agriculture, and livestock. As always, Bangladesh is a reliable source for the professionals, skilled, and semi-skilled human resources required for those sectors including sharing our best practices for the development of SMEs. My government will remain ready to support any effort needed for Oman, taking all actions necessary to ensure the sustainability of economic gains into the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The first Enterprise Ireland trade delegation to the Sultanate of Oman took place earlier in 2014. Can you elaborate on the main achievement of this mission?<br></h4><p>My predecessor, Minister Joe Costello, led a very successful trade mission to Oman in June of 2014. The focus of the mission was on companies in the water/wastewater management sector. The mission provided relevant Irish companies with the opportunity to explore Oman's valuable and rapidly expanding market. During the visit, the Omani Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Dr Fuad Al-Sajwani, outlined Omani requirements in relation to expertise and equipment in order to develop an indigenous dairy industry and to capitalize on Oman's rich sea fisheries resources. Dr Al-Sajwani undertook to visit Ireland with a team of experts later in 2014.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>There are already 551 Omani third-level students currently based in Ireland, and we hope to see this number grow even further over the coming years. During a meeting between my predecessor and the Omani Higher Education Minister, Dr Rawya Albusaidi, it was agreed in principle to prepare a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on education, which will be signed during the next ministerial visit in either direction. Ireland is working with Oman to ensure renewed access for Irish beef to the Omani market. Oman's food requirements will have to be met by increased imports, and Irish food companies are very well placed to enter joint ventures with Omani companies to meet this growing demand.</p><h4>Anticipating the evolution of Oman's economy, how do you envisage the relationship between the Sultanate and Ireland developing in the coming years?</h4><p>Ireland enjoys a warm relationship with all GCC member states, including the Sultanate of Oman. Ireland and Oman have had a good history of contact and cooperation over the past 30 years. A growing number of Irish citizens work and reside in Oman. Currently, we have as many as 500 Irish nationals residing there. As Oman's economy grows, the number of Irish nationals working in Oman will also increase. Ireland aims to have close bilateral relations with the Sultanate of Oman, and we also wish to promote closer and mutually beneficial relations between the EU and the GCC. Over the coming years I look forward to working with my Omani counterparts to develop our bilateral relationship even further.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the Ministry's latest highlights and milestones?<br></h4><p>The Ministry has implemented several programs relating to the labor, technological education, and vocational training sectors through coordination with government and private authorities. The updating of the provisions of  Omani labor law has positively affected the employment movement and helped improve labor terms and conditions in the private sector, and this has consequently led to an increase in the number of paid national workers since the start of 2013 and until mid-2014. During this period the number of employed male and female citizens in this sector rose to 216,146. The application of the decisions and procedures adopted by the government had a positive impact on the stability of national manpower in the private sector. These decisions included raising the minimum wage of national manpower in the private sector to OMR325 per month as of July 1, 2013, the ministerial decision that granted private-sector employees an annual surge of no less than 3% of the basic salary, besides the decision relating to the transfer of salaries of private sector employees to their bank accounts and another decision that matched private sector holidays with those of the public sector.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to ensure a balanced presence of expatriate workers?</h4><p>The Ministry works towards striking the balance of the labor market based on well-studied principles, as part of the government's trend to ensure that the percentage of expatriate workers doesn't exceed 33%. This will be achieved through the application of provisions of the labor law regarding the employment of national manpower in jobs requiring advanced administrative experience according to the Omanization and replacement programs in establishments operating in the oil and gas sector, and the recruitment of expatriate workers to fill in these posts. It is noteworthy that the Ministry is always keen to meet the actual needs of private establishments operating in the oil and gas fields for national or expatriate workers. And it should also be noted that a balanced labor market, in the light of the government's trend, enhances the activity of the national economy and serves the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>How is the Ministry encouraging education among the workforce in the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Realizing the importance of availing specialist national manpower in the occupations and posts required by the oil and gas sector, the Ministry of Manpower has introduced the specialization of oil and gas engineering in the engineering programs at the colleges of technology. During the period from 2011 up to the end of the first semester of the academic year 2013-2014, a total of 177 male and female students were awarded diplomas in the oil and gas specialization, and there are currently 152 students who are continuing their studies in this specialization. To achieve the strategic objectives of human resources development, the Ministry works toward implementing the government's policies and programs meant to develop vocational education in the Sultanate, with the aim of preparing general education graduates vocationally and providing them with various levels of skills to join the private sector and take up the available job opportunities in the sector and meet the labor market's needs for vocational manpower.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities for the future development of Oman's labor market?</h4><p>The Ministry of Manpower drafts short- and long-term plans and their alternatives based on a scientific basis, after studying the labor market and its developments. Among the top priorities in this respect is how to find employment opportunities for job seekers and the stability of national manpower in private sector establishments. The Ministry also continues its efforts to regulate and ensure a balanced labor market and promote the output of the colleges of technology and the vocational training centers, in accordance with the education and training quality requirements in the specializations required by the labor market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the monetary union affecting the Tanzanian economy in the long term?</h4><p>We feel it will be a positive influence in the sense that it gives you discipline. Once a country ties itself to a monetary union, with related macroeconomic benchmarks, you simply cannot afford not to be efficient. It involves a degree of sovereignty transfer, in terms of running your monetary and economy policy, to the East African Central bank to be formed. The current central banks will essentially become agencies of the main bank. All economic statistics will be monitored to assure efficient performance, and we are ready for that challenge. Firstly, we have cheap power that will if anything become cheaper yet, once we adopt natural gas as the main power source. Currently, we are the only nation on a 15 American cents per unit price of power; most others are on 17 or 18 cents. We should, therefore, be selling power to the rest of the region, rather than the more traditional fruit, grains and coffee. An economy becomes more competitive, not only in terms of exports, but also in terms of its own industry. A 5% drop in electricity costs can work wonders for a textile factory employing 3,000 people, making for a wholly different bottom line print. We feel we will be one of the stronger economies in the East African Community (EAC) because of the various resources that can be utilized to make life much easier for everybody.</p><h4>What EAC projects will be considered a priority for 2015?</h4><p>Universal power connectivity is our main objective, and will allow the grid to address supply deficit in one specific area by leveraging the entire grid. Meanwhile, the improvement of ports, railway lines, roads, and airports will be critical for trade and tourism. This would pay dividends in terms of making East Africa one consolidated destination for tourists. The other thing we are working on is telecommunications, as we are not quite integrated at this stage. The service providers are well-known brands, such as Vodafone, so there is no reason why we should not integrate this, and make it much easier to communicate with each other across borders. We are also working on a tripartite free trade area between COMESA, the EAC, and SADC. It is going to be the largest free trade area in Africa, reaching from Cape Town to Cairo, and will encompass more than half of the African population.</p><div class="quote">“Universal power connectivity is our main objective."</div><h4>What would the full economic and political integration of the EAC mean for the long-term development of Tanzania and East Africa?</h4><p>We feel that once we reach full integration, and for us that means a federation of the states of East Africa, one of the greatest dividends would be regional peace. Countries such as Tanzania, which have achieved peace and stability for a long time, can guide the rest. You would no longer, say, see an insurrection in Rwanda, as all neighbors would then rally as one federated state. In that sense you avoid a situation whereby groups want to cause unrest through another member state; it would be just one sovereign country. Therefore, we feel we can achieve peace throughout the territory. Secondly, there are tangible economic benefits. Take, for example, integration and the single currency; this is something that will create financial and economic discipline and render East Africa an attractive address for investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the dynamic between the traditional Jumeirah Hotels brand and the new Venu brand?</h4><p>The original brand of Jumeirah STAY DIFFERENT has always been the foundation of the Group. We are continuing to develop that brand very successfully on a regional and international basis. Venu, the newest hotel brand that we have launched, is a contemporary lifestyle brand and is very much aimed at competing within the lucrative lifestyle segment. The target audience for the Venu brand might be slightly different, but not necessarily younger than the target audience of Jumeirah STAY DIFFERENT. We see the two brands complementing each other. Having a desirable location is very important for a successful hotel. We could have a Venu hotel in a highly desirable location, which might actually achieve a higher average room rate than a Jumeirah hotel at certain times of year; therefore, it is not necessarily meant to target more budget-conscious travellers. From an investment perspective, with Venu we are more flexible on room size depending on the style and feel of the hotel. While with Jumeirah we usually have a minimum 50 sqm requirement for a room, we would be prepared to consider a room size of 32-35 sqm for the Venu brand.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind your food and beverage division?</h4><p>We are very excited to have launched a dedicated food and beverage division, which is essentially a separate company with 32 restaurants located in our hotels in Dubai. It rents space within our hotels and operates outlets as standalone restaurants. We wanted to give the guests of our hotels the feel that when they use one of our restaurants it is similar to going into a restaurant that is not part of a hotel operation. We offer them a different dining experience, with exceptional cuisine, a dedicated service team, as well as a distinctive concept and theme that is unique to that particular restaurant. The company includes a large portfolio of brands, with the Noodle House being the most widespread. That is a brand we are continuing to develop and roll out across the world on a franchise basis.</p><div class="quote">“We are very excited to have launched a dedicated food and beverage division."</div><h4>Regional and international expansion is of high importance to the Jumeirah Group, and you have representation now throughout North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Far East. Which international markets really present the greatest opportunity for growth?</h4><p>I would say Asia continues to be a very interesting source of business for potential hotel development. When we look at places such as China, it is busy but we could expand our Venu portfolio there. There are still opportunities in China as we are not yet present in Beijing, Dalian, or Tianjin, for example. These are all big cities that could easily host a Jumeirah hotel. I would like to do another hotel in Shanghai in addition to the already successful Jumeirah Himalayas Hotel. Likewise, Vietnam and even Cambodia have good potential; we already have a resort under development in Bali, and Indonesia in general offers attractive opportunities. We aim to be in Malaysia as well. Therefore, Southeast Asia and China are very interesting. The Middle East is of prime importance, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia. I see great potential in Africa, especially for Venu. We have already signed an MoU for a project in Angola, and I am interested in looking at South Africa and West Africa. I went to Abuja in May 2014 and was impressed with what I saw there. I believe the West African region has great potential for Jumeirah, particularly thanks to our colleagues at Emirates who offer good connectivity between the two regions. In East Africa, I see opportunities for resorts in places such as Kenya and the Seychelles, in addition to the Jumeirah resort in Mauritius, which is already under development.</p><h4>Considering the expected influx of three- and four-star hotel investments, how do you see the hotel industry in Dubai evolving over the next couple of years?</h4><p>I think it makes a lot of sense. Any mature market needs to have a complete range of products in terms of the styles and types of hotels. Different people travel at different times and stay in different properties depending on their needs. As Dubai expands and develops its tourism products, including theme parks and other activities that give people a reason to come, they might not always want a high-end hotel; a budget hotel may suit their needs better. You need to have both, and with the growth in numbers of travellers coming to Dubai, I think there will be a great need for more affordable hotel options. The other interesting thing is that Dubai has always maintained a very high-quality image and I think it will continue to do so. Therefore, some of these budget hotels will be the best in class, and that is what Dubai always aspires to. Also, a variety of products is vital for the industry to mature, develop, and thrive.</p><h4>How do you see that affecting the World Expo 2020 and its targets?</h4><p>We are very confident if you look at the hotel development pipeline in Dubai at the moment and the number of rooms that have been planned. In addition to hotels, we are also taking into account the number of serviced apartments coming online, which means Dubai will be well placed. I am happy that we have a target to achieve 20 million visitors before World Expo 2020 because, once the Expo is over, we will be able to sustain that organic growth pattern.</p><h4>Of course there are lofty targets for the buildup to 2020. However, there is also a lot of concern for 2021. What are your expectations given the climate right now?</h4><p>Just imagine if we had 20 million visitors coming in by October 2020, followed by 25 million visitors for the six months of the Expo. As a result, other visitors will not be able to get into Dubai that easily, so there will be considerable increase of demand coming out of 2020. Hence, I think there will be a balance. I do not see a huge number of people being turned away in 2020, but hotels will be at capacity with maybe 25 million people per year. I do not see the graph going along and then suddenly falling off the edge, because of the strength and depth of the tourism market already. Dubai will be able to continue its evolution and growth pattern of visitors subsequent to 2020. This is particularly the case when you look at the continued growth Emirates and the expansion of its fleet of wide-bodied aircraft, and the routes it will serve globally. Having said this, I do not think we can be complacent. We must work hard to promote Dubai and continue stimulating demand.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan's economy is already feeling the heat from falling oil prices and reciprocal sanctions between the West and Russia. What is the position of KMG in this challenging environment?</h4><p>At the moment we are involved in a business transformation process, which is the right way to go. The lower price of oil actually helps, because it gives more impetus to the transformation. In the past, when prices fell to $10 per barrel, companies all over the world were forced to make projects profitable at that price. It makes you think in a completely different way. From my point of view and that of KMG, the oil price coming down is difficult, but we are looking closely at where we can economize and where we can do things more efficiently, while at the same time maintaining our production levels. The business transformation focuses on the future, when the prices rise again and put us in a stronger position. At that point we will be more profitable and value driven, and more efficient. The current oil prices are not very pleasant, and we make sure that we are prepared in case they stay as they are or go even lower. We are ready to react quickly. At the same time we are maintaining our production levels as far as we can. But as one of the people who is driving these transformations within the company, I see it as an opportunity.</p><h4>Production at the Kashagan oil field has been postponed until 2016. What is your strategy to ensure that the delays in oil production there will be compensated by corresponding increases from other major fields?</h4><p>The delay in production at Kashagan is very unfortunate, and we continue working closely with our partners to make sure that we are sticking to our time schedule. Meanwhile, we are accelerating production at other projects. KMG is working closely with its partners through producing joint venture projects, namely the Tengiz and Karachaganak oil fields. And of course we have domestic production, which is mostly onshore. The majority of our own onshore fields are 40-60 years old, which is a late stage of development and, thus, it is a challenge to increase production from those fields. Having said that, there are many opportunities and we are working very closely with the regions to identify opportunities where we can increase production in a sustainable way. But in that follows best practices that we see in fields such as Samotlor in Russia, where they have gone through the process of increasing production through the use of best practices and appropriate technologies. Obviously, Kashagan was expected to be a huge chunk of production, and so it will be difficult to make up for that in less than two years. Our main task is to move toward value generation.</p><div class="quote">“At the moment we are involved in a business transformation process."</div><h4>How is the company supporting the generation of specific knowledge and research in the energy sector?</h4><p>We have a plan to set up our institute here in Astana, namely the Institute for Drilling, which will train technicians in field development, maximizing recovery, and opportunity identification. In the next few weeks a visualization and communication center will open, with an open-plan, collaborative, and integrated working space, where we will have about 150 institute employees. They will be able to use the latest technology as far as the visualization of our reservoirs goes, and enjoy quick turnaround on models. This will allow us to look ahead and predict the behavior of wells and new approaches that we are intending to implement. This will also give us direct communications with our institute in Aktau and Atyrau, as well as our laboratories, which are going to be fully integrated within one institute structure. We will be able to support our operating fields and our exploration projects—onshore and offshore—by using the latest IT and measurement technologies to speed up the decision-making process.</p><h4>What are the main challenges associated with exploration in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The challenge is all about the environment. There are strict environmental controls on the Caspian Sea, and we have to contend with the winter period. KMG has to keep prices at a level that will allow us to develop what we find: it is expensive to ensure that a site will be environmentally secured, meaning that operations won't damage the fauna and flora of the Caspian Sea, and it has to be protected from massive ice flows during the winter period. There are many more opportunities in the Caspian area. On the onshore side, considering the landmass of Kazakhstan, only a very small percentage of the country is being explored.</p><h4>How is KMG working to expand the oil transportation network and pipelines, and what projects are you currently developing and implementing?</h4><p>Transportation is one of our main priorities. We already export the majority of production, so we want to make sure we have access to the right market. About one-third of the country's production will be exported by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), reaching 67 million tons every year, 52.5% of which will come from Kazakhstan, while some will come through Russia into the same pipeline. We are commissioning new facilities. This project is ongoing, and the China pipeline is a huge highlight and, since 2004, we have been commissioning sections of this pipeline. In 2013 there were two new pumping sections.</p><h4>Do you have any specific goals for the upcoming year?</h4><p>I want to focus on our domestic production. Our domestic production established the global reputation of KMG. We are very keen to show that we are capable of a lot, that we are capable of managing our fields well, and that we can increase our efficiency and production in a value-generating way—that is what we are 100% responsible for. We have some of the best-trained and educated staff anywhere in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures does the Ministry plan to implement to improve the quality of health services in Panama?<br></h4><p>The core objective of our Ministry is to provide universal access to healthcare. Public authorities have increasingly invested in health infrastructure; however, we still face inequity of access, and uneven service quality. In the capital, Panamanians enjoy high-quality treatment and advanced technological services, whereas in remote areas of the country the situation is wholly different. We want to institute the same quality of services throughout the country. This will involve changing the mentality of both doctors and patients. It is important that everyone feels that they are an active part of the healthcare system. Geographic issues are another challenge that we face. In the past, infrastructure investment was unequal, meaning that we must address this situation by investing in marginalized areas.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges facing the Ministry of Health over the next five years?</h4><p>Previous public health authorities have prioritized investment in curative medicine. In contrast, our current focus will be preventive medicine. Long-term investment in the latter is more efficient than the former. This represents a fundamental shift in the healthcare culture of Panama, because we must change the mindset of patients to help them understand that they need to pay more attention to their environment, their diet, and their physical condition. Doing so will reduce their chances of contracting diseases, or suffering from other health conditions. It is also important to properly train our doctors as well, because they will play a key role in educating and informing their patients of these developments.</p><h4>What are your investment plans for the near future?</h4><p>A significant part of our budget will be dedicated to operating hospitals that the previous administrations had built. We also want to develop additional oncology centers to provide Panamanians with high-quality cancer treatment. Plans are also in place to build a new children's hospital, as our current facilities do not meet the growing needs of our population. At the moment, we are in talks with a number of international consortiums keen to invest in Panama, which could potentially become partners in the new children's hospital project.</p><h4>What is the potential of Panama to become a regional health hub?</h4><p>Panama is already a commercial, geographic, and logistics hub, and we stand to benefit from becoming a health hub as well. There are already considerable investors interested in developing Panama into a destination for health tourism. International healthcare investment would boost the development of health infrastructure, increase the transfer of know-how, and solidify our position as a leading regional health services provider. Foreign hospitals have shown considerable interest in Panama, and their entry into the market would enable us to increase the geographic coverage of our healthcare system.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of medical education in Panama?</h4><p>The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Panama has been the primary provider of talented and skilled healthcare professionals. We also have doctors working in Panama who have gained experience by working and studying abroad. Over the past few years, private universities have also invested heavily in their own medical training departments. We are proud to announce that recent international tests administered by US health bodies, found that healthcare professionals in Panama were both highly trained and educated. The Ministry co-finances these international tests to ensure that our healthcare professionals have attained a high level of education and qualification in their respective fields.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Panamanian health sector for the next five years?</h4><p>We must work toward ensuring that Panamanian citizens can always enjoy high-quality health services, and this goal is attainable within the next five years. It is also important to continue investing in our human resources, which will attract local and foreign patients to our facilities. Panama is set to become a regional health hub, and health tourism will play an increasing role in our economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have the hospital's major milestones been over the last few years?<br></h4><p>Clí­nica Hospital San Fernando was founded in 1949 by my grandfather Dr. Jaime de la Guardia. He was a surgeon who graduated in the US and he wanted to establish a hospital to treat private patients, and physicians to have the right to do so without restrictions. At that time, there was just one hospital in Panama and it was a closed one, meaning not all physicians could hospitalize patients. Dr. de la Guardia united businessmen, physicians, and family together that believed in him and the project, and they started construction in 1947. He started out with around 30 physicians with a few specialties. The hospital opened with just 30 beds and at a cost of $5 per room. I started my career in the hospital in 1976 as an Assistant to the General Director, and throughout the years I have seen an improvement in medical technology, human resources, and IT, but especially the quality of care. We have more than 600 physicians in three office buildings around the hospital. Since 2011, we have been accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI), and our physicians have to fulfil all of JCI's requirements.</p><h4>Hospital San Fernando is one of the two Panamanian hospitals that have joined the JCI accreditation system. What is the importance of this recognition?</h4><p>The JCI requires us to comply with certain security and quality control standards, which it measures using a system of indicators. The most important factors are quality and the security of the patient. For example, you have to identify the patient and match them up with their proposed surgical procedure. It is basically an ISO system for hospitals. We have our reaccreditation due in 2014; it takes place every three years. We decided to get accredited five years ago, and it took us two years to ensure that we were able to comply with all the requirements. You have to fulfil all the requirements to a level of 90%-100%. There are 144 standards that you have to comply with in total, which is not an easy task. Everyone from our Board of Directors, to all of the hospital's collaborators and employees has to be on board. In 2014, the hospital has to comply with the Fifth Edition, meaning there are more challenges to meet. We were the first ones to gain this recognition locally. Panama has started working on its own accreditation system; however, it is still just on paper. Nothing has been done about it yet.</p><h4>What role does Hospital San Fernando play in health education?</h4><p>That is part of our accreditation; we have to comply with patient education requirements. Our values lie with our collaborators, families, and patients. One of the actions we take for the prevention of disease and illness is the vaccination of our employees and their families. We recently completed a campaign with patients' families promoting the importance of good hand-washing practices. Part of our corporate social responsibility work has a green theme, especially regarding recycling and eliminating levels of mercury. There is also a new Panamanian law regarding  security risks for employees, and in terms of compliance, hospitals and clinics are inspected more than any other work place.</p><h4>What is the importance of medical tourism for the hospital?</h4><p>For private hospitals, it hasn't been substantially important, basically because of the lack of personnel and the demand from Panamanians and foreign residents. However, we have been looking into medical tourism, since it can be beneficial, despite being a risky business. Generally, people that go abroad for treatment are those without insurance, and are looking for a cheaper health option. Medical tourism is predominantly in the areas of plastic surgery and odontology, with perhaps also a few orthopedic procedures. Panama has all the qualifications for becoming a potential destination for medical tourism; however, this has to be combined with the right laws.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have ties with the EU evolved since the signing of the free trade agreement (FTA) in August 2013?<br></h4><p>Following the signing of this FTA, relations between Panama and the EU definitely changed and ensured stronger regional ties between Central America and Europe. This, along with the fact that Panama is the main investment partner of the EU in the region, also means more responsibility for our country when looking at ties between Panama and the EU. The trade pillar is, of course, accompanied by both a political and cooperative agreement. It will lead our country to put more emphasis on global matters that have importance also for the EU. We have shown this by being more outspoken on the Syrian and Iranian situation, both of which are pressing issues for Brussels.</p><h4>Since Panama has shown interest in being part of the Pacific Alliance, what is the relevance of such a partnership for the country?</h4><p>Joining the Pacific Alliance is a normal and natural move for Panama, a country that has been moving forward in terms of regional trade integration. In this context, we are already partners with the founding members of the Alliance, and closed an FTA with Mexico, a country with which we have also had long historical ties. Therefore, taking this context into consideration, it is only normal that Panama advances to a new stage, which is joining the Pacific Alliance. If we have not done it before, it has been due to technical issues regarding the conclusion of trade agreements with some of the members of the Alliance. Ultimately, we see the Pacific Alliance as a key element for advancing our strategy to become closer with Asia. In fact, Martinelli's administration had always stated its aim of signing trade agreements with South Korea and, hopefully, Japan. We also have an important flow of trade with China. The Pacific Alliance is to become a key element in the process of the transformation and development of Panama's foreign affairs policies and strategies.</p><h4>How could Panama benefit from closer ties with the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean region?</h4><p>I think both countries can benefit from closer ties; the Dominican Republic considers itself as a gateway to the Caribbean region, something Panama also believes of itself, in terms of transport, capacity and trade. It is normal and natural for Panama to have such a belief, as we are both situated in the middle of the American continent. I think Panama is another platform for Caribbean countries, and, therefore, we can complement each other in a balanced way. For us, bilateral ties with the Dominican Republic are key and they have helped us to better address issues in the Caribbean region and to better understand its realities.</p><h4>Which sectors have the most potential to further develop trade ties with the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Panama is a services-oriented economy, meaning we believe that we can provide the Dominican Republic with excellent services to support its foreign trade. At the same time, I think we can benefit from light-manufacturing works from the Dominican Republic. For example, the light-manufacturing sector could benefit significantly from closer ties between both countries, as well as the agriculture industry. In this context, the agriculture industry would also include equipment, fertilizers, and related products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Panama signed two agreements in 2012 to boost cooperation in the areas of energy and trade. What is your assessment on the relations between both countries?<br></h4><p>For us, it is energy, and for Panama, which is developing quickly, energy is vital. Recently, a Trinidadian state-owned company called National Petroleum (NP) signed an agreement with a Panamanian company for the distribution of lubricant products. There is also the Energy Partial Scope Agreement that we had before this came as a result of our first agreement for the NP Energy Corporation. There are several other projects from companies that were in need of LPG, because at the time it was advised that there is a third party that was purchasing the LPG and then selling it, which implied very high costs. We looked for ways in which Panama could buy directly from our national gas company, allowing it to buy directly from our producers instead of from a third party, which would help lower costs We were not able to implement that fully because we had contracts with other buyers, some of which will expire in June 2014.</p><h4>What are the main areas of importance for Trinidad &amp; Tobago in Panama, and what is your outlook over the medium term for these relations?</h4><p>For us, the Partial Scope Agreement picked up a lot of agricultural production. Importing food from an area closer to Trinidad and Tobago would be beneficial financially because the costs would be lower for an already elevated food import rate. Another area of keen interest is tourism. We have two kinds of tourism: Trinidad is more business-oriented, while Tobago is still the idyllic island that it was many years ago. Therefore, you can experience the sand, sea, and sun when you come to our nation, while on business. Trinidad is the center for business while Tobago is the place to relax by the sea under the sun. We are also looking for investments in the ICT, maritime, and creative industries sectors, which includes film making, fashion, and music. Our music is some of the most diverse, because our people come from all over the world. It is such a diverse society and music has been influenced by the Spanish, Colombians, Indians, and Africans, with influences from all continents. I think our country has the most public holidays, which is due to the melting pot of religions, creeds and races represented all in one place. Trinidad and Tobago does not have a permanent mission or diplomatic representation in Panama. It is something that we are considering. President Martinelli was vocal in advocating that we establish an office here. Currently, our embassy in Costa Rica is accredited for Panama; however, it is far away. We have an excellent ambassador and she has been promoting Trinidad-Panama trade because of our position in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). I was the Chair of CARICOM until December 2013, and I think that there is tremendous benefit for Panama in liaising with this group of 14 nations, which are still part of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), which includes many Central, Latin, and South American countries. I think Trinidad &amp; Tobago has not had much interaction with Latin and South America. Since Martinelli became President and I took office, I have been working more closely with this part of the world. I do believe in South-South cooperation given the proximity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess bilateral ties with Panama?<br></h4><p>We have enjoyed excellent bilateral ties with Panama since 1929. Today, 97% of our trade exchange concerns chemical and pharmaceutical products. This is in itself a great opportunity, as over the years this trend has opened the door to new trade and business opportunities for both countries. Our collaboration has gone also beyond these fields, and we have exported Puerto Rican services such as engineering training and infrastructure development. This experience has proven highly positive, and we currently also extending these activities to Colombia and Peru.</p><h4>How has the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed between Panama and the US impacted the Puerto Rican economy?</h4><p>Recent studies show that as regional economies expand, so too does Puerto Rico's presence in their trade balance. Therefore, at a time of economic flourishing in Latin America, Puerto Rico is faced with numerous opportunities to expand its economic ties with these countries, while also diversifying its industrial output. Puerto Rico is a natural bridge to the US for many Latin American countries. Over the past couple of years, we have strengthened trade and logistics ties with Europe and Latin America, and have seen several European companies establishing operations in Puerto Rico to reach the US and Latin America.</p><h4>Apart from the pharmaceutical industry, what other strategic sectors does your government aim to develop?</h4><p>We are in the process of diversifying our economy. Agriculture and textile manufacturing have been two traditionally strong sectors in Puerto Rico that we need to revive. Meanwhile, chemical products and medical devices are two segments with the potential to boost our economic diversification. Currently, 48% of our economy depends on manufacturing activities, and we are well aware of the need to diversify to foster a more dynamic economy. In this context, we have taken positive steps within the aerospace industry, as exemplified by Lufthansa. These efforts have also enabled us to attract software production activity related to this industry. The main multinationals in this sphere are present in Puerto Rico, which is significant. They create many job opportunities for our people, and as a country we have been fortunate enough to witness a shift toward R&amp;D activities and broader innovation in our economic activity. Meanwhile, the role tourism plays in the economy is increasing considerably, amid ever-greater arrivals. We attract many cruise companies into the country, while over 1,000 additional beds are imminently scheduled for addition to Puerto Rico's touristic offering. On a related and positive note, we have reduced crime rates by over 20% since I began my tenure as governor.</p><h4>What have been your main landmark achievements since you assumed the position of Governor of Puerto Rico?</h4><p>Puerto Rico is set to pass its first balanced budget in 22 years. This will enable us to allocate more resources toward generating greater employment opportunities. We are also in the process of achieving a diversified industrial base for our economy. Chemical and pharmaceutical products, the aerospace industry, and the software production sector are three fields set to play a key role in our economy in the near future. Meanwhile, we need to transform our agricultural sector into a more efficient endeavor, and also renovate our tourism offering. These elements will enable us to become a more competitive economy in the region and the wider world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in November 2012 by Panama and UK boosted the commercial relations between both countries?<br></h4><p>I was delighted to sign the MoU during my visit to Panama in November 2012. It sets out a shared commitment to strengthening our relationship. But it is not an end in itself; we need to continue to work hard to turn that commitment into results. I visited again in mid-2014 to follow up Panama's new government following the May elections. I was reminded of the country's great potential, and of the reasons why so many British companies are already doing business there. The World Economic Forum ranks Panama's economy as the second most competitive in Latin America, boasting the top-10 global rankings in its airport and port networks, the soundness of its banks, and its access to financial services. That is why the stock of UK FDI in Panama now stands at £1.95 billion, second only to the US. In 2012, for example, we saw the Travelex Group win a concession to operate a foreign exchange bureau at Panama City's international airport, which was a great boost to trade. This airport is now also being further developed with the help of British firm Foster and Partners. Elsewhere, London &amp; Regional continues to lead Panama's urban regeneration through its impressive Panama Pacifico project, while Cable &amp; Wireless has launched transformative new products, such as a mobile banking application. Panama is also increasingly positioning itself as a regional logistics and connectivity hub, which is why companies like Diageo use it to get their products closer to the final market. The Scotch Whisky Association reported £58 million of whiskey sales to Panama in 2013, the third largest market in the region and a 15% YoY increase. These examples demonstrate Panama's growing importance as a commercial partner for the UK in Latin America, and show how the UK has consolidated its position as one of the leading foreign investors in Panama. However, I am convinced that we can do more. The new government has set out its commitment to tackling corruption, and I welcome this. We have found in the UK that foreign investors tend to respond well to certainty and transparency. We are already doing work with Panama to promote a rules-based economic system, and I hope we can cooperate ever more closely in this area.</p><h4>Following the Double Taxation Agreement signed by Panama and UK in July 2013, you expressed your enthusiasm for the strengthening of the bilateral relations. Which are the economic sectors with a bigger potential for development between Panama and UK?</h4><p>The Double Taxation Convention was a really important step. It established a new channel of information sharing between the UK and Panama, which we believe could lead to the recovery of up to £1 billion in tax revenues in the UK alone. And as well as improving transparency, it also has the potential to encourage more UK investment in Panama by reducing the tax barriers to cross-border investment and putting UK business on an equal footing with competitors from those countries that already have a similar agreement in place, such as France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. It is a business-friendly treaty that safeguards against tax avoidance and against other issues that can damage trade. This is one example of the work we are doing to boost UK commerce the world over. I think there is particular potential in our partnership with Panama, not least because of the similarities between us. Just as the UK is the gateway to Europe, Panama is the gateway to Latin America. We are both trading nations at heart, with a strong maritime history. I saw for myself the construction of the astonishing new lock at the Panama Canal, which I am sure will cement its position as the world's busiest trade route. I was able to recall Britain's own connection to the canal, by unveiling a plaque to commemorate the Herculean efforts of the British West Indian community in its construction 100 years ago.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was the free zone established, and with which initial objectives?<br></h4><p>Colón was initially called the “Golden Cup," because the US army was stationed in the city, resulting in a range of employment opportunities. However, the withdrawal of troops from the region left it with a chronic unemployment problem. The initial idea behind a free zone in Panama, therefore, was employment creation, and a feasibility study was carried out to establish its optimum location. And with its port, rail links, airport, and access to the Panama Canal, the choice was made to establish it in Colón. The Canal now generates over 10,000 jobs, while the free zone generates work for 32,000 people.</p><h4>How did the zone grow from 10 original companies to around 3,000 today?</h4><p>The Colón Free Trade Zone (FTZ), as a purely commercial zone, is the largest FTZ in the world. We have gone from a free zone of 30 hectares and 10 companies to one housing 3,200 companies on 1,000 hectares of land, and the Colón FTZ has, therefore, seen impressive growth. In 2009, re-exports and imports were in the range of $19 billion, while 2012 closed on $30.6 billion. In 2013, we saw a decline to $27 billion, due to the problems of Colombia and Venezuela. This year is seeing further decline due to the woes of the global markets, and again, especially due to problems between Venezuela and Colombia.</p><h4>How does the Colón FTZ contribute to national development, particularly in terms of job creation?</h4><p>The contribution is substantial, as it represents 7.6% of GDP, which amounts to around $1.8 billion annually. Aside from the 32,000 direct jobs at the FTZ, indirect jobs number around 60,000. Most of the properties in Paitilla, Marbella, and Costa del Este are users of Colón FTZ, and each has had great success here. The Colón FTZ has contributed greatly to the growth of Panama, not only in terms of GDP, but also for the banking sector. The owners of most banks in Panama are from abroad.</p><h4>What are the requirements for a company to open an office at the Colón FTZ?</h4><p>It is a simple process that begins with the company meeting with our legal department. We also do a background check on the company's directors through Interpol, to be sure of their credentials, and to curb any potential money laundering. Once approved, a key-number is assigned to the company, which allows it to import and export. If the company does anything extraordinary, the key number is suspended and no longer provides access to the free zone. The operations of every company must also create at least five jobs.</p><h4>What impact will the expansion of the Panama Canal have on the Colón FTZ?</h4><p>Actually, the FTZ will not be particularly impacted by the expansion of the Panama Canal, as we will continue to receive our shipments in large or short vessels. The benefit will be for those who manage the shipping due to the significant savings to be made by working with larger ships and ports, and thus due to the handling of a greater volume of containers. There is also the potential for increased tourism as a result of the expansion, which would of course positively impact Colón.</p><h4>Do US and European companies have a strong presence at the Colón FTZ?</h4><p>Our US operations represent around 7%, and Europe represents around 4%. Our commercial activity is mainly with South America, the Caribbean, and Central America. However, 70% of the merchandise that is re-exported and imported to the Colón FTZ comes from Asia. All appliances and electronics arrive from Malaysia, Taiwan, and Japan. We receive extensive merchandise from mainland China and Vietnam, which are also expanding.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have the most important achievements been in the development of the hospital?<br></h4><p>The hospital opened in 2006. In 2002, we negotiated a prosperous affiliation with Johns Hopkins Medicine International, which was important as it allowed us to improve our standards, and obtain Joint Commission International (JCI) certification in 2011. However, the most important achievement for Hospital Punta Pacifica was that our opening had a direct impact on improving the quality of the healthcare providers in the Republic of Panama.  Although the hospital is only in its eighth year, we became one of the 35 best hospitals in Latin America and number two hospital in Central America according to the “2013 Best Hospital Ranking" of América Economí­a magazine.</p><h4>In terms of specialties, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the hospital?</h4><p>Hospital Punta Pacifica is a level IV general hospital; we have all types of medical specialties here. The hospital performs complex procedures such as kidney transplants, oncological, neuro, and cardiovascular surgeries, among others. We are also accredited by the Cardiovascular Surgery Program at the Caja del Seguro Social of Panama, to perform open heart surgery. We help the Social Security Hospital with a long list of beneficiaries who need this type of surgery.</p><h4>How important is medical tourism for Hospital Punta Pacifica?</h4><p>Medical tourism is not very important for our hospital right now. Less than 1% of revenues come from international patients. In my opinion, further legal changes in the healthcare sector in the US, Canada, and some other developed countries are still needed, in order that countries such as Panama can truly take advantage on this market. Hospital Punta Pacifica's volume is mostly related to Panamanian and local residents. Volume comes from gynecology, pediatrics, obstetrics, general surgery, and orthopedics. Medical tourism does exist for developing countries, and the rationale is relatively simple: patients from developed countries looking for less expensive medical services, in hospitals with quality and international standards. This is valid for those procedures uncovered by the insurance companies. Thus, plastic surgery, odontology, and some orthopedics fit into this. There is also international volume for stem cell treatments, given that they are banned or not approved yet in countries such as the US. Hospital Punta Pacifica is not participating in stem cell treatments, as there is not enough strong scientific evidence of its effectiveness.</p><h4>You have an investment plan of $16 million to expand the hospital's facilities. What is the current status of this project?</h4><p>We are currently building four levels of parking, which will give us 110 additional parking spaces. We are also expanding the fifth floor to increase the hospital service area, laying the foundations for enhancements. Two new floors for doctors' offices are being added to increase the number of specialties and physicians. This project will be completed by 2016.</p><h4>How do you see the local market maturing over 2014 in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>If we want to measure the healthcare delivery market in Panama, we can use as an indicator the insurance companies' claims issued by the Superintendencia de Seguros de Panamá. During 2013, paid claims grew 8.4%. In this same period, Hospital Punta Pacifica grew 21% in this segment. In 2014, insurance claims are expected to increase between 7% and 10%. Expectations for Hospital Punta Pacifica are quite positive, around 9%-15%. Panama's growth needs to be fueled by the population's access to education and healthcare. Over the past decade, Panama has faced accelerated growth in public sector infrastructure. The government has built at least 20 outpatient centers plus five general hospitals. All these bring dynamism to the country and the whole segment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main priorities for the next five years for the Banco Nacional de Panamá?<br></h4><p>Our strategy has been focused mainly on the agricultural sector. Banco Nacional is the financial arm that the main producers can use to promote their products, especially those that belong to the basic food basket. Besides that, Banco Nacional wants to be the main financer for rural housing because Panama needs to provide 140,000 homes for medium- and low-income families. Our third goal is that we want to make Banco Nacional an institution that has a strong position in terms of technology, especially in payment systems. Banco Nacional is working right now to develop modern technologies, including biotechnology, to allow the government to reach the people directly. We are in the best position to do that since we changed our core system back in 2012.</p><h4>What are the specific measures that you intend to take to increase production and to boost the agricultural sector?</h4><p>We need to send a message that the main producers in Panama can use their land to get new sources of production. What this means is if someone wants to take production to the next level, Banco Nacional, in agreement with the government, is able to provide finance at 0% if it is a new project. This scheme is not for refinancing or buying new land; it is only for new projects. We are offering this financing from 2013 until 2016 and calling for all the major producers in the countryside to take advantage of this 0% interest rate, which is most favorable for them. However, we have to bear in mind that Banco Nacional is not a development bank and we have to follow the relevant policies and rules because we are supervised by the same Superintendency as the rest of the banks. The main goal is to increase production because currently Panama relies on imports. For example, we are dairy producers, but we need 35,000 more cows to satisfy the demand for milk in the country. Previously, we were able to meet the demand; however, the agricultural sector has been decreasing over the years because we have focused more on the service sector. We need to catch up with the agricultural sector. We need to produce in agreement with GDP. Currently, agriculture only represents around 3% of GDP, whereas it used to be 9% only 15 years ago. We need to reverse that trend.</p><h4>What is the role of the international banking sector in attracting foreign investment to the country?</h4><p>When we achieved the $100 billion mark, I got a call from a journalist about it and I told him that in 1983 the banking sector achieved $52 billion in assets, which at the time was a big thing. At that point there were more than 100 banks from around the world in Panama. Then there was a financial crisis, banks started leaving Panama, and the total assets started decreasing. We had to wait until after the invasion in 1989 to get the system back on track. Now we are facing a trend that whilst Panama has all the resources needed to attract international banks, those banks are leaving the country. Panama has been put on a gray list by the IMF, and that is something we need to address. In the future, we will not be able to attract any other international banks to come here and do business. Our main goal is to get off that gray list and get back on track. We need to tell the international banks that this is a great place to do business, not only locally but also regionally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Panama is the main banking center in Latin America. What are the benefits of investing in the Panamanian banking sector?<br></h4><p>Panama offers various benefits for investors in the financial and banking sector. It is an open, globalized economy, and also a dollarized one. Strategically located geographically, it is hub that connects 68 destinations worldwide, and also has excellent fiber optic connectivity for data exchange. The International Banking Center (IBC) has a 40-year history, having been established in 1970. It boasts a skilled and trained banking and finance workforce. From here it is a simple matter to serve clients and financial institutions throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and the northern part of South America.</p><h4>Both the Superintendency and the Banking Association are trying to attract new investors and members to the IBC. How many banks are members?</h4><p>There are 91 licensed banks within the IBC. Of those 91 banks, 13 are representative offices that allow banks and financial institutions to promote and conduct business from an office in Panama, although they are not allowed to provide banking services in Panama. We also hold an international banking license, which allows banks to take their services to clients beyond Panama, to take deposits from abroad, and to extend loans to other countries. Just 28 of our members are so licensed. The remaining 50 hold a general license, which allows banks to operate in the local market and abroad, so they can perform local and international business at all times. We try to attract new members by promoting the advantages of using Panama as a base from which to perform banking and financial operations throughout Latin America, as well as the local market. Ideally, we would like to attract at least three important financial institutions to Panama by the end of 2014.</p><h4>The assets of the IBC grew by 7.6% YoY in June of 2014. How would you evaluate the performance of the IBC in 2013, and of the overall economy?</h4><p>The growth of the IBC has been impressive, and remains so in 2014, with a rising growth trend in evidence. Assets saw an increase of 7.6% in June 2014, and we evaluate the international and general licensed banks together. Internal credit to the private sector grew 8.7% compared to the same period in 2013. All indicators point to continued solid growth and efficiency, and the banks have strong rates of capital adequacy, making for a healthy environment. Meanwhile, the broader economy is also continuing to grow in 2014, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years.</p><h4>What challenges do the 91 IBC members face this year?</h4><p>Regulation poses a challenge. Capital adequacy and liquidity requirements mean that banks have to invest more capital, which stiffens competition. Furthermore, transparency, anti-money laundering initiatives, and anti-terrorism financing laws require improvements and changes to the legal framework, which  will also place a burden on financial institutions. Banking is the most regulated and supervised sector in Panama, and this environment needs to be expanded to other sectors as well. Panama has an important task in terms of improving the transparency of the sector, and we are advancing in that direction.</p><h4>The country has signed 19 double taxation agreements. What are your predictions for the next OECD review of the country?</h4><p>We still have to get past phase II of that review, and have to consider changes to our legal framework accordingly. Last year we passed a law for the immobilization of better shares, but the timing was not right for the law to come into effect. This is one issue that the country needs to address, and the plan is to modify the law some time in the second half of this year. We have to move forward and keep making improvements to meet OECD requirements as well as Financial Action Task Force requirements for money laundering and terrorism financing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have UniBank's major milestones been since its creation three years ago?<br></h4><p>In our three years of operation, UniBank has exceeded $400 million in assets, achieved an excellent position in the Panamanian market, and become well-known in corporate, consumer, and private banking. We have increased our share of the sector thanks to healthy, sustainable growth. We are one of Panama's boutique banks, and our aim is to become the most important player in this segment. Moreover, UniBank has managed to achieve sound levels of liquidity, delinquency, and capital adequacy, which are significantly higher than the average levels in the sector.</p><h4>What is the philosophy behind the creation of the bank?</h4><p>Our strategy is not based on extensively growing our branches. Instead, we use a customer-targeted strategy, where we work to find out which products our customers need, and make those products available in a quick and competitive way. We intend to keep being particularly active in the business of corporate and private banking. Our philosophy is to support our customers in adding value to, and growing their businesses, and thereby obtain and keep their trust. As part of Panama's financial system, UniBank has to make equity flows generate value for our customers, and continue to offer financial solutions that contribute to that growth. Since our inception, we have taken a responsible role regarding the poorest communities in our country and we have promoted social development as part of our strategy and management style.</p><h4>Given that 86% of UniBank's business is located in Panama City, and 14% in Colón, how are you promoting your bank's international dimensions?</h4><p>We live in a globalized world, and to develop a fully integrated business, it is necessary for UniBank to diversify its markets and risks, and take up business opportunities where a competitive advantage exists for the company. The bank has executives with extensive experience in international business. Further, as part of our strategic plan, we are looking into opening representation offices in order to have a presence in some emerging countries. We are currently evaluating different options in terms of countries based on their economic performance, growth opportunities, political and monetary stability, and banking regulations.</p><h4>How would you describe your financial performance in 2013 and your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>In 2013, we became the Panamanian bank with the largest percentage growth in terms of assets, deposits, and results, and we were ranked second in terms of loans. As at year-end 2013, UniBank had $393.5 million in assets, which compared to 2012 represents an increase of 30%, and a net income of $1.08 million. We are particularly pleased with our regulatory liquidity levels of 61%, and our capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 20.82%. In fact, 2013 was an exceptional year in terms of percentage growth in income and turnover, way above the average for other financial entities. Within our 2014 strategic plan, important highlights include the acquisition of 50% of a brokerage business, the issuance of commercial marketable securities for $50 million, which have been successfully placed at six months and one year, and also the future opening of a representative office.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the conclusions of the latest OECD review on Panama?</h4><p>We still have to improve some aspects of our sector, mainly related to the rapid implementation of the detention or removal of bearer shares. Apart from that, the Panamanian banking sector has some challenges to face in the future. The main one is to maintain its competitiveness, and it needs to constantly innovate, as well. Panama's banking sector also has to develop a more approachable and culturally integrated approach to its customers, as there is a marked difference here compared to our international banking counterparts. Of course, we have to adapt and prepare for the new Basel III regulations, as well as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) ones, and maintain high standards in our compliance policies and customer knowledge, generally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you establish an office in Panama, and what are the main services you offer clients here?<br></h4><p>We set up an office in Panama one year ago to be closer to the local client base. Panama is, and has historically been, a regional hub for financial services in the region. It has strong regulations and legislation for the financial services industry. In addition, there are many qualified people here that we get to work with. All these factors make Panama attractive for us. We have two licenses: a representative office license and an advisory office license. These enable us to provide advisory services to clients regarding investments.</p><h4>What makes you different from other international banks operating in Panama?</h4><p>What sets us apart from other wealth managers in Panama is that our owners are also our managers. In any publicly listed bank, the owners are the shareholders while the managers are just managers. The CEOs do not own the bank they manage. Our owners are heavily involved in all the strategic decisions the bank makes. This allows us to take a wider perspective and a longer-term view, which means we are always looking ahead to the next generation. Our clients value this independence. We have been around for more than 200 years, and we want to be in business for another 200 years. This view impacts every level of our organization, in terms of what we want to offer our clients. Everything we do is with a long-term view in mind. People like what we provide and appreciate the stability. That's an important difference for both our clients and our staff. Besides that, our business just focuses on wealth management for private and institutional clients. We don't do commercial banking or investment banking, so we minimize the potential of conflicts of interest that result from being involved in such businesses.</p><h4>What is the significance of family businesses in Latin America, and what are you doing to attract them as clients?</h4><p>Lombard Odier is a family business, so we strongly relate to family businesses in Panama and Latin America. Among many important organizations is the Family Business Network, which our firm is a member of and which meets once a year with all the national chapters. The organization is all about families exchanging experiences, and providing a platform for them to interact. We have extensive experience in this field, having funded the IMD-Lombard Odier Global Family Business Award since 1996 as well.</p><h4>What strategies are you providing clients in order to help them preserve their wealth?</h4><p>We manage portfolios based first and foremost on our clients' appetite for risk. They have the whole world in which to invest, so we offer them recommendations on cash, bonds, equities, structured products, and commodities so that they can invest in a whole range of products, depending on the macroeconomic environment. We then manage their portfolios with the fundamental conviction that we must first conserve wealth. The families we work with are concerned about passing their wealth to future generations. The safety of our clients' wealth is our primary concern.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the banking sector in Panama?</h4><p>Real estate could be an issue here, as in many markets. There was 29% growth in construction over 2013. Much of the growth was not achieved by Panamanians, but by money invested by foreigners. A lot of the growth depended on factors that Panamanians did not directly control. Depending on, for example, the political situation in Venezuela, those living in Panama might move back there. We hear that the construction sector will slow down in 2015, as well. If there is a slowdown, traditional banks may be exposed to the risks involved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has your growth strategy been since commencing operations in 1995?<br></h4><p>We began in 1995, shortly after the Noriega era, hence at a time of skepticism toward Panama in terms of investment. We decided to build a terminal on a former US base with an investment of $150 million, and to date have invested $650 million with plans to invest a further $250 million. When we arrived in Panama there was a total shipping volume of 100,000 TEUs, while in 2013 the level was at almost 7 million TEUs. As pioneers, we ourselves moved 2 million TEUs, and we became the first company to establish the hub concept in Panama.</p><h4>How does Manzanillo International Terminal (MIT) contribute to national development?</h4><p>When we set up in Panama, the unemployment rate in Colón was very high. Moreover, many did not believe that local labor could manage an efficient port. Therefore, we not only trained our people well, but actually created careers for them. Some of them have been with us for 18 years. MIT has created 1,200 direct jobs, and 90% of the workforce is from the Colón area. We also contribute by generating the economy surrounding the terminal. Apart from these 1,200 direct employees we also employee around 300 security guards and 500 individuals from other unions in Colón.</p><h4>MIT is affiliated with Carrix Inc., whose main division, SSA Marine, is based in Colón. What is the importance of Panama for Carrix Inc. and what are its expansion plans?</h4><p>Our company is based in Seattle, Washington, but our international branch was established in Panama. We did so before anyone else started to look into Panama because of its regulatory advantages. And from here we supervise our operations in Vietnam, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Panama, and Costa Rica. We have been able to grow from here and today have three operations in Colombia.</p><h4>What was the financial performance of MIT in 2013 and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>In 2013 there was a slight decrease in volume based on prices in neighboring countries like Venezuela, and some restrictions in Colombia. We are looking to other markets in order to resolve this issue. However, after growing by rates of 15%-20% every year, such a reduction is not significant in a business like ours. What Panama has to do is not only look at the traditional markets like Venezuela and Colombia, but also other growth markets such as Mexico, Ecuador, or Chile.</p><h4>According to the Panama Canal Authority, the expansion is going to create around 30,000 jobs related to the logistics industry. What is your assessment of this estimate?</h4><p>Ports are not a job-generating industry, though auxiliary industry and services involve a substantial need for logistics. The problem is that Panama today does not need to create jobs, as the available jobs outnumber the people available. We foresee more jobs being generated in the logistics supply chain, for which we need to train our people. Everyone needs to be clear about the fact that no economy can sustain this current pace of growth. We would prefer to see growth of 4%-5% over the coming years in order to avoid an inflationary environment, which Panama normally does not experience.</p><h4>How would you assess Panama's port infrastructure and the government's efforts to improve its capabilities?</h4><p>We probably have some of the best maritime infrastructure in the world. That is not our problem. Our problem, rather, is how to best connect that infrastructure. We need to be more dynamic in terms of the utilization of e-commerce, and we need to improve customs procedures through the use of electronic document transfers. The next step for us in Panama is to be able to move cargo between air, rail, ports, and trucks, electronically.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-rum-diaries]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has your growth strategy been over the past five years?<br></h4><p>About 10 years ago we started to explore the international market more seriously, and most of our growth during the last few years has actually come from exports. We control approximately 90% of the domestic spirits market, so the only real option is to look beyond Panama to continue growing. We now export our leading product, Ron Abuelo, to 36 countries. Fortunately for us, the aged rum market is growing internationally, and there is an increasing interest in premium aged rums all over the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations in terms of production for 2015?</h4><p>In the international market, we expect double-digit growth over the next five years. For the local market, it will mainly be organic growth due to the important market share we already have, but with some interesting growth in a few specific niches.</p><h4>What is the importance of Ron Abuelo for Panamanians?</h4><p>For many years, Panama was a market mainly of “seco" the national drink produced from sugar cane juice. Seco is for Panamanians what tequila is for Mexicans, or pisco for Peruvians. Rum always had some market share, but the impressive growth of Abuelo transformed the industry. For us it is vital to have a strong brand here, as Panama is today a great showcase to the entire world. Those visitors who try Abuelo and love it become ambassadors of Panama, and of Ron Abuelo, once they return home. Panamanians are particularly proud of our products.</p><h4>What makes Ron Abuelo so successful?</h4><p>The quality of our rum has a lot to do with our success. We have spent a good amount of our advertising and promotional budget just inviting people to try Abuelo, and discover everything that the brand offers. With “Añejo", the first product we introduced, we were able to produce a relatively light rum, but with much character. You can drink it neat, on the rocks, with water, or you can also make cocktails with it. It is a truly versatile product.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that Panama's exports are currently facing?</h4><p>Panama is mainly an exporter of services, with less emphasis on consumer goods. But the country has the potential to export much more than it does today. The country's geographical location is ideal, allowing for the shipping of goods from both oceans; our airport has also become an important hub for the Americas. There are generally competitive freight rates available from here. One of our main export markets for Ron Abuelo is Chile, whose main export market is the US. We ship our rum to Chile in containers that usually arrive empty from the US. For exports to become a more important part of our economy, the country in general needs to work on developing an export culture, which will take time, resources, and serious dedication. Hopefully the recently elected government will promote this effort.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Panama 4.0]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[panama-40]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The previous government invested more than $500 million in technology modernization projects for the country. What are your main priorities for the next five years?<br></h4><p>Our priority is to advance the efforts that Panama has been making to become more competitive by further modernizing government, measuring ourselves against key indices and adopting the best international practices. The main objective of this modernization is to provide an open government, serve our Panamanian citizens and tourists, and to connect society as a whole. The informal and marginalized population needs to be incorporated into our growing economy. The more people and key sectors we have participating in the economy, the faster we can achieve higher levels of economic sophistication, and increase the GDP. We will be supporting the key export sectors like logistics, tourism, and services, while strengthening agriculture, among others. We view ICT as being a pillar to provide better quality education, healthcare, and government services. There is a nationwide commitment in terms of increasing government transparency, and eliminating bureaucratic impediments. That is where technology and the reengineering of our institutions in line with better governance standards comes in, recognizing that this is an ongoing process. During the next five years, we will be building upon our pre-existing experience with new initiatives. The concept of the National Authority for Government Innovation started three administrations ago, and we are in the process of deciding exactly what deliverables will this new version of “Panama 4.0" will bring before 2019.</p><h4>What is the current share of the ICT sector within Panama's GDP?</h4><p>The current share is probably less than 8% if you measure by the participation of companies in the ICT sector. This statistic spurred the government to invest more than $500 million in ICT. The ICT sector drives growth, and props up development and higher levels of sophistication in finance, education, the environment, and healthcare, and social services. AIG works across the board to support all of the e-government and modernizing initiatives. We will make better use of government mailing and cloud computing, as well as increase electronic transactions and payments. AIG will also expand its geographic resources. With e-commerce, we are taking special precautions to deal with new issues regarding cybercrime and identity theft. The new government has a commitment toward more efficient and agile services for citizens. We will be assuring procedures for government entities to follow criteria oriented toward creating the conditions for a level playing field in purchasing ICT products and services, so that investors are certain of their long-term prospects here. Panama has instituted a legal framework that, by putting it into action, will make online government documents and processes just as valid as those done on paper. That will be one of our key thrusts for this administration. All of the major components are in place for execution in the near term. AIG's mandate allows it to execute projects that transcend multiple entities, and thus take advantage of economies of scale and effective citizen services. We can also support individual entities in their specific digital agenda, and have the capacity to influence better nationwide e-government initiatives. Another facet of this transformation is the creation of a Technology Observatory, in order to assess the government's level of ICT readiness. This will help us develop a technological roadmap for our desired future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-dot-to-dot]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the importance of opening in Panama for Digicel and what has the growth strategy been in the country?<br></h4><p>The importance for Digicel was in terms of our Central American strategy. We are currently in El Salvador and Panama, we are in 32 countries around the world, with a heavy presence in the Caribbean. We also have a strong Pan-Caribbean-Pacific-Central American presence at the moment. We are actually coming up on our sixth birthday in October 2014. When we came into the market, as the third player, we did it with aggressive pricing strategies and acquisition strategies, which is not unusual for Digicel; we typically come in and go heavily after winning market share. We were successful in that, and in a short time we gained well over a 20% market share in Panama. In a market with four players, that was an excellent result for such a short period of time. The initial strategy was to win a solid piece of market share, bring customers onboard, and continue to work on that formula. If you step back and look at the six years we have been here, over the last two years in particular, there has been significant growth in data and ICT, and we have built and developed an ICT team in Panama to take advantage of this new trend. The most significant growth for Digicel Panama over the past few years has been data growth, data subscribers on our network, smartphone users, and data revenue. It has been absolutely critical in terms of growing revenues.</p><h4>What was the importance of the mobile number portability (MNP) measure implemented by the government in 2011 for Digicel?</h4><p>MNP has been a benefit to mobile users more than anything, since they are able to retain their telephone number and they can implement the plans that best meet their needs. For operators, the reality is that MNP has not had much impact if we compare the amount of ported numbers that are made monthly, in the case of Digicel are more than 300 lines per month (between pre-paid and post-paid corporate), versus the amount of new lines that are activated monthly that are approximately 80,000.</p><h4>Recent research indicated that Digicel has the fastest data speed in Panama. How do you evaluate the penetration of 4G services in Panama?</h4><p>If you look at our capital investment into Panama, a large part of it has been improving our 4G network. The actual coverage is important, but equally, too, is the speed. We have spent tens of millions of dollars on improving our 4G network, and Digicel was offering customers the most consistent coverage and speed. The way that survey was conducted was by taking a number of locations across Panama and different times during the day&lt;, our peak hour is late in the evening. This was an interesting study and for us, it told us what we already knew. For example, year on year, our 4G subscribers have grown by 78%, which is massive growth. Our smartphone users in Panama have grown by over 40%. People are becoming very app-savvy, they have a huge demand for data now. It is not just the number of people using our 4G services; it is the amount of data they are using, that has really risen as well. At Digicel, across our 32 markets, our Panamanian consumers are among the highest data users and are tech savvy and keen to have the latest services and apps. We initially launched 4G in 2012-2013 following an investment of over $40 million. It is very important to understand that from a telecoms point of view, there is a capital requirement in terms of upgrading the towers. Here in Panama, we have over 900 sites across the country, it is a large landmass you have to cover from the regions to the cities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the relevance of Capital Financiero, in terms of economic and political influence, in the development of the country?<br></h4><p>We are a business journal in a country in which business plays a vital role. People who come to Panama like to talk about what happens in the economy and opportunities for investment. Capital Financiero gives the complete summary of the country in business and finance. We are the go-to source to find out what is happening in the country. We publish information regarding the most important issues in development, what the government is doing to help business grow, and how we can continue on the path of development that we have been on during the past decade.</p><h4>How have you seen the readership evolve since you entered the company in 2003?</h4><p>Readers are changing as we now have more young people interested in reading our paper. They want to know what they can do to improve their position in this new economy. Part of our readership use social media. This is a new game; these people want to know what is happening as soon as possible. We are the only paper in the country that gives more than just facts. We offer a combination of news and analysis. This is not easy to find in other papers, which is why we are the first choice for young people who are entering the business world.</p><h4>How do you assess the freedom of press in Panama, especially compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>I think that Capital Financiero is not in the same position as other newspapers in the country. We work with data and facts, and this is different from newspapers that are more focused on opinions. I have worked with other newspapers and have never encountered any problems. We work with data from official institutions such as the Contralorí­a General de la República and the Ministry of Finance, or business organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, think tanks, and international organizations, so we do not have any problems as our sources are publicly available.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the free trade agreements (FTAs) that have been signed with Europe and the US?</h4><p>Panama's economy is based around the sea, the original canal, and agriculture. We signed an FTA with the US because it is Panama's main trading partner. We export around 45% to 50% of our products to the US. The other 40% goes to Europe, and the rest goes to the other countries of Latin America and Asia. The truth is that we have a special relationship with the US, as the Canal is a route that accounts for 5% of global trade. With the expansion of the Canal, we will increase this traffic to 8% or 10%. This shows how a small country can make a difference if it invests its money in a global product like this. The most important thing for Panama is to open markets. We must not forget that of the 3.4 million people in this country, some 1.2 million are farmers, and they need to grow at the same time as the cities and free trade zones. They do not have the same opportunities, so we need to change this. There should be more investment in the research and development of new products to add more value to our products. We export with no value-added, and this is a significant problem because we export at the same price as other countries. In this country the focus is always on logistics, finance, and how to acquire more external investment. This is why FTAs are so important for us. They give us the opportunity for these other sectors of the country to access larger markets for their products. At the moment, the future of Panama is the Canal. However, tourism, mining, energy, international insurance, and real estate are also important.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the main focus of your growth strategy in order to keep La Estrella and El Siglo relevant in the modern marketplace?<br></h4><p>We're not just the oldest newspaper in Panama, but are one of the three oldest newspapers in Latin America. At the same time, we're the most read newspaper in Panama and the “youngest" newspaper as well, be it in print form or in new alternative forms, such as online. Today, we're among the three biggest newspapers in the country, and we have about 300 people working with us. We've always tried to understand and address the way Panamanians want to read news, especially these days when time has become a rare commodity. So in short, our strength has been our constant effort to help understand what the readers want and to provide that.</p><h4>How has the newspaper contributed to the social, cultural, political, and economic development of Panama?</h4><p>We've been around since 1849. Since that time, Panamanians have followed what's happening in their country and in the world through our newspaper. In the past, the Panama Star was also available as far afield as California. So the newspaper also had an international presence. That shows how important this small country has been for the international community since the 19th century. Throughout our 165 years of existence, La Estrella has always been committed first and foremost to promoting and raising awareness of the fact that Panama is an independent country. We have also always been committed to Panamanian sovereignty over the Panama Canal. Looking at other examples, in sports everyone remembered the front page when Roberto “Hands of Stone" Duran beat Sugar Ray Leonard in the US, and it read “Roberto Cumplio!" (Roberto Did It!). So a whole nation shared in a special moment of unity through our front page, and that's just one example. We have been a driver in the political, economic and social development of the country.</p><h4>What are the main differences between El Siglo and La Estrella in terms of editorial content, readership, and formats?</h4><p>La Estrella targets a middle to upper class readership, whereas El Siglo targets the middle class to the base of the pyramid. We have the same commitment in both newspapers. The approach is different, but the news content is the same.</p><h4>What role will the growing use of technology play in news media?</h4><p>Newspapers are definitely changing; there's more of a shift online, and this is the case the world over. Newspapers are also becoming more like magazines. However, I think people still like to pay money to sit down and hold a newspaper in their hands and finger through those pages while drinking their coffee. There's a tactile pleasure in that. That being said, we want to incorporate all the new media and news delivering technologies that are available, and we deliver the news through multiple platforms. But we also have a very strong commitment to who we are, who we have been, and the basic concept of the newspaper.</p><h4>In which platforms will you be investing more in the coming years?</h4><p>Right now we're working on redesigning the newspaper and webpage, working on new apps for both La Estrella de Panamá and El Siglo, and utilizing more social media. I don't think other local newspapers are doing this and in these staggering dimensions. Also, we have projects for new strategic alliances, and we aim to develop this multiplatform, multimedia network.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the University of Panama contribute to Panamanian society?<br></h4><p>Our institution is the most prestigious university in the country. Apart from our central campus, we have nine regional centers, three extensions, and 25 annexes, giving us a national presence. We are widely present in areas where there is a high incidence of extreme poverty, as well as in areas of home to indigenous populations, which also tend to be more disadvantaged. Our objective is to help these people become part of the economy. In terms of curricular strengths, our leading degrees are Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, Agronomy, Law, and Engineering, which is an area we are particularly focused on today.</p><h4>How is the university contributing to national development?</h4><p>We continue to make diverse contributions. We develop drugs, cosmetics, and food quality controls. We also have several systems to control air quality, atomic emissions, and seismology through our Institute of Geoscience. We operate the largest dentistry center in the country with the latest advanced technologies, in addition to a veterinary hospital. Additionally, we are implementing a photovoltaic project with a Spanish company that will enable us to generate 40 MW of power. Our current consumption averages at 35 MW, and the surplus 5 MW will be sold to the market, with half of the revenue going to the university. We will be paying 15 cents per kW instead of the 20 cents we are paying today. This will result in an annual saving of $2.7 million, which represents 25% of our current consumption. Another important project is the network of Innovation Centers we are creating in different regions. These are technological centers of innovation and entrepreneurship, and our objective is to provide every local community with the necessary technical resources to launch the projects they need. We are pursuing comprehensive interaction between the university and the community.</p><h4>How many foreign students does the University of Panama have and how are your exchange programs evolving?</h4><p>The figures for 2014 have shown a strong increase on the previous academic year. We have a total of 250 agreements, which have allowed scientists mobility, academic exchange initiatives, and the development of an international network. In addition, we have our international degrees. This large number of agreements has been remarkably beneficial for us. For example, we have become licensed, in alliance with the University of Granada, for vaccination against the tórsalo, a type of fly, which causes terrible damage to animals. We have also instituted an expanded system of collaboration between the private sector and the university. These agreements allow students to develop internships in Panamanian firms, with students being evaluated and graded by these companies.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the higher education system in Panama?</h4><p>In my opinion, the government has not paid sufficient attention to education in Panama in recent years as the economy is essentially based on services, and politicians give more importance to industry, the banking system, or the flagship registry industry. The academic component of the national economy therefore appears to be a less attractive item on the political agenda. People complain about the level of higher education, but this is not the fault of the institutions themselves. Educational programs are not correctly implemented because governments unfortunately devote less attention to them. This is why we always hear about improvements and progress in education yet never appear to be free of financial woes. Private companies complain that as institutions we fail to prepare students to the level required by a competitive economy. And yet, despite the limitations we have to face, we remain well positioned in comparison to other countries in the region. And at the local level our academic offering is considerable when compared with other Panamanian universities, as we develop degrees such as physics or philosophy, where we have more teachers than students.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Club Unión is one of the foremost social centers in Panama. What are the criteria for entry to the establishment?<br></h4><p>The club is a meeting point for the leading figures of Panamanian business society. We have a rigid membership procedure that requires screening by the Admission Board. Every year we vote people onto our Admissions Committee of 32 members, which identifies potential new members. A candidate member requires a group of referees to submit their application to the Admissions Committee, and should six out of those 32 oppose the application, it is rejected. Successful candidates then pay a $100,000 membership fee, and purchase an ownership share, currently of around $3,200. Members' children over the age of 18 are also presented to the committee as potential members in their own right, and from the ages of 21 to 30 they may incrementally pay their membership until becoming a full member on their 30th birthday.</p><h4>Are foreign citizens allowed to become members?</h4><p>There is no restriction that says you have to be a Panamanian to be a member. The only requirement is that the group that presents you as a candidate is well-known and respected by members. Usually, members of the committee like to spend around a month and a half with a potential member to get to know them. Every year we have between two and five new members in general. For example, a number of ambassadors have partial membership, although being a temporary member entitles them to use all the club's facilities.</p><h4>What are the main services that the club offers?</h4><p>Our “Second Home" as we call the Club Unión contains extensive sports facilities for members and their families, including a full gymnasium, plus tennis, volleyball, basketball courts, and a swimming pool. In terms of entertainment, there is a discotheque, three different restaurants, and a poolside snack bar providing informal dining. We have a sports bar that is a casual family venue, and there is also a formal dining room. The club has its' own unisex beauty salon. Six dedicated halls are available for special events such as wedding, birthday, cultural, and corporate functions. We have a bar and three terraces for casual get-togethers, happy hours, and dances with live music.</p><h4>Can a non-member spend a day at the club?</h4><p>Yes, once a month they can attend if they are friends of a member and they can have access to most of our facilities. If you are a member of a club in another country, and they have a reciprocity agreement with us, then you are entitled to up to 30 days use of our facilities in Panama.</p><h4>What are Club Unión's priorities for future investment?</h4><p>We have invested in a new building out of the need for a larger parking facility. Currently, our location in the center of a residential neighborhood makes for parking problems when we stage a major party or celebration. The new building has seven floors, with five given over to parking. The front of the building has two terraces, a gym, a discotheque, unisex beauty salon, a future spa, a lounge, and a sports bar, while the top floor has three tennis courts.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Panamanian economy over 2014 and 2015?</h4><p>The local economy appears to be robust, and the Canal expansion should be providing full service in 2016, and will boost revenues generated from abroad. The new government is also proceeding with the development of two new metro lines, the second and the third, which will ease congestion and facilitate commuting. The government is also set to invest heavily in water-related infrastructure to the benefit of the community. Panama is now basically a port on two oceans. In my opinion, if we can consolidate goods from South and Central America and repack and ship them down the Canal, we could generate considerable business. The Canal serves 144 different routes and reaches about 1,700 ports and 160 countries worldwide. If we take advantage of this potential we can develop the nation into a dynamic logistics hub.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Inversiones 3000 is developing the logistics center of Dos Caminos in Panama. What is the current status of this project?<br></h4><p>At the moment, we are over 50% of the first construction phase, which will be completed by the end of 2014. We are located at a strategic point near Tocumen International Airport, the main airport in Panama City, which has both touristic and cargo facilities. This area is already undergoing significant development, like the airport expansion, new highways, and expansion of the city to the east side. Dos Caminos means “Two Ways." We chose this name because we are in the middle of the crossroads between the Corredor Norte and Corredor Sur, the two main highways in Panama, and this is a perfect location for any type of business, not only for the local market, but also for the connection to international markets. The extension of Corredor Norte will be finished by the end of 2014, meaning that we will be at the central point for all logistics. From here, you can go to Colón Free Trade Zone and Balboa Port, and we are only 2 kilometers away from the main cargo airport. Besides the location, we are providing our customers with other features in this new logistics center, such as wider streets so they can move and work more comfortably, and galvanized polyurethane panels in all warehouses, which improves the temperature inside the working area.</p><h4>Tocumen International Airport is going to increase its ability to handle passengers from 5 million to 20 million. What is going to be the impact of this expansion on your project?</h4><p>The passengers airport expansion will indirectly benefit, because it will bring more tourists to see this great country, and the smart ones will see all the opportunities that it has to offer and probably invest here, causing the country to keep growing its economy and industries. This means that more people will require warehouse spaces to house their operations. The expansion is also focused on the cargo section of the airport, so it will generate growth in all the businesses in this area, mainly for export or for processing. This will be the same case for the Panama Canal expansion. If you have a business from both air cargo and maritime cargo, you will be able to handle it perfectly from here. We are just in the middle of everything, because we are close to the airport and we are able to reach Balboa Port in 20 minutes.</p><h4>There was a growth of 29% in the construction sector over 2013. Is Panama likely to see a construction bubble in the medium term?</h4><p>This growth is due to the Panama Canal expansion, and the huge infrastructure projects that the government is developing around it. There is a growing middle class that generates local demand. Also, there are a lot of people coming to Panama. Not only are they investing, but, also they coming live and setting up companies in the country, which obviously creates more demand. Typically, people who come to Panama have a good economic standing. They have money to invest, rent a good apartment, start a business, and recirculate their money into the economy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the challenges that this sector is going to face in the coming years?</h4><p>There are some laws that protect local workers from foreign labor, which is not good for Panama, because it leaves limited room for acquiring new knowledge and competing with others for improvement, especially in the construction sector. Local workers know that if they get fired, they can easily find work elsewhere, because there is a lot of demand for them. You need some competition in a country to evolve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[innovate-to-prosper]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has your growth strategy been since the company's establishment in Panama in 1996?<br></h4><p>In fact, ABB had established relations with Panama even prior to 1996 through our parent companies, Brown Boveri and Asea. In Panama, ABB was founded in 1996, because at that time we identified it as the most dynamic economy in the region. We had a couple of important projects, the first of which was the Panama Canal Transmission Line crossing, one of the largest projects of the day. After that, with this being a famous hub of the Americas thanks to Copa, and fueled by impressive growth, ABB decided to put its regional headquarters in Panama, and we started opening different branches across the region. Today, we have offices all over Central America, in all countries except for Nicaragua and Belize. Regarding the Caribbean, we have offices in the Dominican Republic and, shortly, in Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Both of these offices will be overseen from Panama.</p><h4>What is the importance of Panama for ABB's global activities?</h4><p>Panama is a stepping stone to developing regional business, and as such has strategic interest for us. Although Panama does not have too much heavy process industry as such, e.g. aluminum smelters or steelmakers or even oil producers, the impressive growth that we have seen over the past few years in the infrastructure of the country and as consequence the increasing demand of energy represents for us, providers of both equipment and solutions for power and automation, a tremendous opportunity. But, beyond that fact, through Panama we can reach the rest of the region easily; communications are above the average for Central America and the Caribbean, and Panama also boasts a simple entry procedure for foreign nationals. Panama is a strategic place to be present if we want to be a main actor in the region. With all the expansions the country is undergoing, Panama represents 25% of our operations in Central America and the Caribbean, which is substantial. In this sub-region, we are a company of around $150 million, whereby Panama accounts for around $30 million. And despite being a small South American country, we have registered the greatest growth of the past two or three years, and are keen to sustain this performance. In Panama, we are set to invest in a sub-regional service station selling not just products and solutions, but also services. This mechanism should be in place before the year end.</p><h4>What is the importance of innovation for ABB, and how would you assess the level of innovation in Panama?</h4><p>We have a new strategy from our CEO called the “PIE" approach: Penetration, Innovation, and Expansion. Penetration means doing more with what we already have. Expansion means going to countries or areas that we have not entered before, such as some countries in the Caribbean. But, innovation for us is essential. Every year we invest more than $1.5 billion in R&amp;D, and have over 70 agreements with universities around the world. For us, innovation in countries like Panama means innovation in renewables, such as solar and wind. There has been a recent boost in renewables and solar energy in Central America, and specifically in Panama. Just a year ago, no one was really talking about this, as Chile, but not Central America nor the Caribbean. The cost of energy generation in the region is always high, mainly based on fossil fuels. Hydro is a good resource, but it is wholly contingent upon the right meteorology as we have seen in Panama. Therefore, energy matrix diversification like solar or wind are good options.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[build-up-the-gas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of this cryogenic LNG storage and regasification project for Panama?<br></h4><p>The project allows for the introduction of natural gas as a fuel in Panama, improving the energy matrix of the country. Thus today, it is not just a case of coal, bunker oil, and diesel; there is also gas. The most important impact will be on energy prices. The cost of energy in Panama will go down, as a result of the projected prices for natural gas in the future. We tendered natural gas energy at a price (capacity plus energy) of 13 cents kW/hour, linked to the Henry Hub index. We believe that a supply linked to this index will be highly competitive in the future. This project will have a favorable impact on energy prices, and will change the configuration of the energy market. It was predicted by industry players that this project would not be necessary until after 2023; now, all the actors involved admit that they were wrong in their estimations by several years, given the way demand is behaving in Panama. This estimation error is so huge that the country needs this plant today.</p><h4>What is the potential of this energy for residential and automobile use?</h4><p>All regasification projects are tied to thermal generation projects, so as to guarantee natural gas consumption and make them financially viable. As we have seen in other parts of the world, the evolution of these facilities leads to the development of projects for the supply of natural gas to industries. This goes hand in hand with the construction of small cryogenic storage and regasification plants at ambient temperature, tailor-made to meet specific industrial demands. There is also the potential to supply gas to small towns, housing developments, or buildings, and also to create an entire system to introduce gas-powered mass transit and private vehicles, by building small storage and regasification plants at ambient temperature, all the way up to complex gas pipeline systems. The US, Europe, and also several countries in Latin America are already familiar with and use this source of energy. I am sure that Panama will follow suit. Furthermore, Panama has the political stability needed to make investments of this magnitude, with a dollarized economy and the enormous influence of the country's geographic location, which is a huge advantage for possibly exporting energy to its region of influence.</p><h4>Panama has an Energy Partial Scope Agreement with Trinidad &amp; Tobago to buy natural gas. What is your assessment of these kinds of agreements?</h4><p>Bilateral agreements are generally great. They create the framework for a working relationship between both parties, but projects like ours must be tied to long-term and versatile supply contracts. For that reason, LNG Group Panama negotiated and signed a supply contract with Gunvor Group. Likewise, we think that a plant of this kind and of this size needs companies with enough experience to develop a project of this scope. Accordingly, we selected the Spanish firm Duro Felguera to carry out the EPC side, and we signed a turnkey contract. On the other hand, as the core of energy consumption is electric generation, we chose the company Alstom to design the configuration for this combination of turbines, heat exchangers, and boilers. We also signed an O&amp;M contract with it, and Alstom is now responsible for all operations and maintenance aspects of the plant for the 20 years of validity of the PPA.</p><h4>What is the true potential of the natural gas resources of the country?</h4><p>In the future, many thermal generation companies will consider gas as an alternative source of energy. Our storage and regasification facilities have a capacity that could easily meet the demand for natural gas from a similar project. We also have room to grow, and are convinced that any firm developed from now on will consider the environmental and price advantages of gas generation and choose this fuel as its main source.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your key objectives since your appointment?<br></h4><p>I assumed my position on June 1, 2014, by appointment of President Varela. My first impression was that there was a series of obstacles to advancing the operations of the institution. We have therefore been engaged in a process of restructuring, and I have already requested that the Ministry allocate the necessary resources to complete this task. We are an institution with a long history in the country following our incorporation in 1904, and this year we celebrate our 110th anniversary. One of my challenges is to bring back the faith and love of Panamanians for our institution. We need to work together and unite our efforts with those of the public administration in order to achieve these goals.</p><h4>What measures are you implementing to address the economic and human resources problems the institution currently faces?</h4><p>In terms of financing we are looking to the Ministry of Governance, which has approved our plans, for increased investment in the institution. We currently have 123 post offices, but need to invest in infrastructure so as to provide better and more reliable services to Panamanian citizens. With regard to human resources, we recognize that our staff has been underpaid for many years, and have expressed our concerns about this topic to the President. We have already agreed to revise all contracts for equitable wage adjustments. These two elements are crucial for improving our institutional efficiency.</p><h4>What is the potential for the privatization of Cotel?</h4><p>The current government of Panama is not contemplating such a scenario for the present. It was an initiative entertained by former President Martinelli, who privatized several other public bodies. Given its strategic importance, our goal instead is to modernize the institution within its current domain.</p><h4>What are the institution's key investment plans?</h4><p>The previous administration had an annual budget of $9 million, but the previous management team had already spent around 80% of that budget by May, leaving the new management team with the remainder. We have been notified that the budget will be considerably increased for 2015, so we can push forward our strategies to increase promotion campaigns and invest in infrastructure. In terms of the latter, integration efforts to make sure all of our post offices work within an integrated system are vital. We must also take advantage of the fact that we cover the entire Panamanian territory. We have around 1,000 staff and, as I said before, we also plan to review their contracts and salaries to make sure they feel as valued as they deserve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Roche decide to enter the Panamanian market, and what is the regional importance of the country?<br></h4><p>Roche affiliates were created in our Central American and Caribbean area, in Havana (1955), Nicaragua (1965), and Guatemala (1969). Today, Roche has two main divisions: pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, the latter being the division we run from Panama. The Central America and Caribbean regional offices for the Pharmaceutical division are in Costa Rica. Roche, as a multinational, is constantly seeking new opportunities, and emerging markets are fundamental for the future growth of the Roche Group. As to why we entered this market, it was due to the potential of the region, and of Panama specifically. We relocated the operations for Central America and the Caribbean Diagnostics division here from Guatemala in 2008. Panama has proven to be a hub in terms of communication and logistics, which facilitates our access to our markets. Another aspect is safety. Panama is a secure place to live in compared to other countries in the region. Additionally, you can hire good talent, with different background and nationalities, which also helps to make a sustainable business. Finally, Panama has a stable political environment under the Sede de Empresas Multinacionales law, which has fostered a favorable business environment. We have grown constantly since we commenced operations here. Overall, the main achievements have been the consolidation of strong growth, extending the use of our products and services in this territory to contribute to the improvement of overall healthcare practices. We have over 130 people working for this affiliate, of which 70 are based in Panama. Altogether, we can be more effective by managing the business from here.</p><h4>In terms of diagnostics in Panama, what are the most important products and services you provide?</h4><p>We work mainly in the in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) business, providing routine and specialized testing for any type of IVD diagnosis that may be required to perform in a blood or urine sample, in a tissue biopsy, or in other types of specimens. We provide fully-automated technology and equipment for laboratories with the highest quality of diagnostic tests, covering the different parameters a patient needs in order to decide on the best treatment alternative. Our product portfolio addresses unmet medical needs in a wide variety of clinical areas such as oncology, cardiology, infectious diseases, women's health and pregnancy care, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.</p><h4>How would you describe the financial performance of the region in 2013, and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We have been highly successful in the region, having grown at a double-digit rate in the diagnostics business. We are proud of this achievement in a region where budgets, although increasing, remain tight. That really shows that we are doing a good job in partnering with different countries in improving their access to a better healthcare system. Resources are being allocated adequately to improve the healthcare policies in many countries, and the outlook for 2014 is that we will be able to maintain solid and positive growth. That means we will keep investing here, hiring more people, and developing the business. We view positively the partnerships we have established with both public and private customers in many countries, from which we are providing best-in-class solutions to many hospitals and healthcare services.</p><h4>What differentiates Roche from its competitors in the region?</h4><p>At Roche, we are committed to providing the best quality products and services to our customers addressed at assisting the diagnosis and treatment of unmet medical needs. We always partner with our customers seeking improvements and innovation that can be beneficial for patients. Our key focus in the region is still on providing the best solutions available for all patients, regardless of whether the customer is a public or private institution. Finally, at Roche we are highly committed to conducting ethical business, based on high standards of integrity and respect. Any business we enter absolutely needs to be aligned with the corporate values we live up to. This belief underpins our overall strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Claro entered the Panamanian market in 2009. What were your strategic objectives?<br></h4><p>Claro is a part of the Mexican telecommunications company the América Móvil Group, one of the most significant operators in the world, and the primary provider on this continent. We perceived an opportunity in Panama due to the robust development that the country has undergone in recent years. It was, indeed, a straightforward strategic move, and we have been running operations here since 2009 as the fourth mobile company to set up in the country. We have a different vision of the telecommunications sector at both regional and international levels. When we arrived, there were two other operators that had been working in the country for 10 years, while the third player launched operations in the same year we did. This was the result of a new government policy of liberalization, which had the objective of creating a more balanced market and ensuring comprehensive sector modernization. We set out with the challenge of being more modern in a highly competitive market, resulting from the already  extremely high mobile penetration rate in Panama. This was a risk-laden proposition, but relishing such challenges, our goal has always been to become the market leader, leveraging our innovation and market share. Over the past five years we have been growing steadily, and we have avoided entering the traditional market, perceiving rather, the opportunity of creating a different network in Panama geared towards data. We started with the GSM network, and then switched to UMTS to become the first operator in Central America to provide 4G services, a vital innovation for the country.</p><h4>In 2011, the government introduced mobile number portability (MNP). What was the impact of this measure for Claro in terms of new clients?</h4><p>Portability was the next step taken by the government to allow consumers to choose their operator, basing their decisions on quality of service. From that moment on, we set two targets, first, to gain new clients given the fact that Panama is such a young market, and second, to attract those unsatisfied clients who were not receiving the service they deserved from other operators, but who nonetheless had been tied to a contract for years. The result was that Claro emerged the winner in MNP, which was a true source of pride. Since then, 135,000 mobile users have switched away from their old operator to Claro.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the substantial efforts being made by the Martinelli government to make Panama more technologically efficient?</h4><p>Recognition should be given to the efforts that the government made not only to make Panama a logistics or construction hub, but also to modernize the country. The National Authority for Governmental Innovation played an important role in developing important projects that should be continued by future governments, such as universal internet access. They have given computers to students, which provided many with access to education and information. It was also thanks to the government that MNP was introduced, which has helped operators to continue growing.</p><h4>Which challenges is the sector facing today?</h4><p>More and more multinationals are coming to Panama to establish their hub here, and are demanding a qualified workforce; we need to continue ensuring this can be done. Greater economic development and the several FTAs signed with Colombia or the US make this much more necessary, because if we do not improve availability, companies will have to hire foreign workers, which is not desirable. A more prepared local workforce requires Panama to improve not only higher, but also primary and secondary education. As companies, we also have an important role to play in supporting universities and providing internship programs so that students benefit from hands on experience in the industry. This is one of the most important challenges that the country must meet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind the decision to enter the Panamanian market?<br></h4><p>Panama is not only a hub for logistics, transportation, and communications, but it also could be considered a global leading hub for knowledge and technology sharing. Because of this, Canon has increased the number of activities in Panama to better support business partners in Latin America and Caribbean countries. Our international operation is responsible for the translation of several kinds of documents and interactive media, and for technical support, system support, and service infrastructures. In addition, it carries the development of new businesses to open new markets in solutions related to software, multi-functional printing/scanning devices, large format products, and digital printing technology. It also provides complete regional customer support, ranging from a contact center help desk that uses a variety of communication channels, to a camera and video regional repair facility with the highest factory standards. Our geographical position has contributed to the diversity of activities that operate from our country. Canon Panama this year celebrates 47 years of presence in Panama, and we are the oldest affiliated company in Canon Group globally.</p><p>We have contributed to the development of our country providing employment to more than 226 Panamanian families, and through the sale of our products we have benefited different sectors that use the technology such as in education, health, tourism, architecture, corporate, and others. And, with the solutions that we are offering, we contribute to reduce costs, and increase efficiency and productivity in the business world.</p><h4>What has been the key for Canon's success in Panama?</h4><p>I believe that success lies in our excellent products. However, I believe that the key reason why we hold the number-one slot for some of them, such as copiers and printers, is because of the quality of the service that we provide our customers. Everything that we do is concentrated in customer care. This supports our philosophy; always oriented to customer satisfaction. For example, in the copier business, we are trying to customize service and product alike to specific customer needs.</p><h4>Business Week named Canon one of the best brands in the world? What has this meant in commercial terms?</h4><p>I believe that the recognition is not simply of the quality of the product, but also for our large number of licenses and patents. The company's focus is to understand customers and markets needs. Delivering excellent service, improving efficiency, and increasing productivity; this is something Canon is trying to do with all its products, and it is very important to maintain customer loyalty. Canon continues to take on new challenges, turning today's efforts into tomorrow's growth. Our concentration continually pursues R&amp;D related to the basic technology that will sustain the company's future, the elemental technology that gives our products their competitive edge, and the platform technology shared by Canon's various products.</p><h4>What challenges will the ICT sector face over the coming years?</h4><p>Our economy is based on services. There are many aspects that contribute to be strong as they are our geographical position, the stability of the banking system, the use of the US dollar, and the laws created to attract investors. All of these require us to be on top of all of them. We still need to invest in upgrading all public institutions to increase our competitiveness. We should not only think about improving on the technology side. Together, in the government and in private enterprise, we have to promote major changes in the education sector to meet the demand for talent going into companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In the private sector, he led the growth of a Panamanian company with a long history, which generated thousands of jobs in Panama called Varela Hermanos.

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<p>We begin a new era of our Republic and our democracy. An era of peace, tolerance, consensus, unity, and social justice with a government that will put people first in all of its decisions. I accept the historic responsibility of leading this country, aware of the great challenges that lie ahead: maintaining economic growth with equity, dealing with debt, increasing investment, and fighting for transparency and the implementation of a process of justice and equity recovery, with respect for the rule of law. I pledge in my management to set up an honest, transparent, and efficient government, whose only objective will be to serve society, improve public services, and equitably distribute the wealth and heritage that God has bequeathed to this beautiful country. I wish to make clear that the foreign policy of our government will be based on dialogue, convergence, tolerance, and mediation, in search of the well being of all peoples. As President, I will work tirelessly to ensure that all Panamanians are responsible world citizens and our isthmus is a point of convergence and unity, serving our people and the international community with our extensive transport and logistics infrastructure and Canal, port, airport, and the Colón Free Trade Zone. I seal my commitment to delivering and to assuming this position for the sole purpose of serving our people, the region, and the world. Over the coming years, we will undertake major works, but the greatest legacy to future generations will be a functional democracy where state resources are used only to serve the people. Corruption will not be tolerated in our government.</p><p><span></span>Based on this commitment, from this moment we start the most important aspect: the transformation from politics based on business and patronage to politics based on service and a clear vision for the state. We will encourage foreign investment and tourism development, in search of creating more jobs with higher wages. We will strengthen legal security and respect the commercial diplomacy of countries that promote their businesses, all this based on the highest possible standards of transparency and honesty, in defense of the interests of our country. I will sign a historic decree that will establish the return of price controls to the basic food basket in order to avoid speculation. I am respectful of the free market, but I am opposed to speculation when this affects the food of the people.</p><p>In Colón, we will start a restoration project for this beautiful city so it can again become the jewel of the Caribbean, as it was in the past. In San Miguelito, we will implement a joint task force that will impact more than 300,000 households, giving them basic health and a roof of hope to all those families. Focusing on improving the quality of life, we will give our city an accessible and efficient metropolitan public transport system, building lines two and three of the subway and incorporating the Metro Bus. Hope will return to the neighborhoods. With our “Safe Neighborhoods" Plan, we will transform the city of Colón and begin the transformation of other forgotten neighborhoods with “More Opportunities and Firm Hand." We will build new centers and community facilities to make sport and culture available to our young people, so they can grow healthy and coexist healthy. </p><p>We will invite the over 200 operating gangs in the country to take advantage of an amnesty to surrender their weapons, cut their ties with organized crime, and enter formal life. Over the coming months, more than a thousand Panamanian teachers will depart for training in the English language, so we can commence our bilingual education project. At the same time, we will undertake the nationwide construction of vocational colleges. The Universal Fellowship will be strengthened and the benefits for people over 65 will be increased from 70 to 120, and we will promote an agreement with the Social Security Fund to provide health coverage to these senior citizens. We have been blessed by the Panama Canal, a work in the service of our country and global trade. As President, I will ensure that the expansion of the Canal is culminated successfully, protecting the interests of the Panamanian State. I wish to send a message to all producers in Chiriqui and to our farmers: farm your land and resume production. As President of the country, there is a man in whose veins runs peasant blood who will give them all the support they require, and price and market stability to increase our food production and ensure food security.</p><div class="quote">“From this moment we start the most important aspect: the transformation from politics based on business and patronage to politics based on service and a clear vision for the state. We will encourage foreign investment and tourism development, in search of creating more jobs with higher wages."</div><p>I invite the health and education sectors for immediate dialogue. The unification of medical services can wait no longer. The savings will be split into two, with one half to improve services and the other to increase the salaries of our health workers. With regard to the education sector, dialogue in search of improving education and working conditions is a permanent process. The doors of the presidency will be open to all Panamanians who struggle and work daily for our country. Respect and tolerance will be the basis of our ties with all trade unions and associations in the country.</p><p>Today, a new stage of maturity, respect, and institutional strengthening starts for our country. We aim to protect the lives of all citizens. This is our only mission and from this moment, partisan politics will be once and for all removed from our security agencies. I have appointed qualified officers to direct all our security sectors. With them, and the 15,000 men and women who are part of the public security force, we will work to remove organized crime, drug traffickers, and money launderers from our neighborhoods, our country, and our region in order to protect our citizens and the integrity of our financial and logistic system. I make a call to lay aside any differences and to seek the progress and welfare of our people, the social peace necessary to move forward together as a nation and make way for a new era of peace, and prosperity and equity for all Panamanians and for those who have made this land their new home.</p><p>With great humility, I take the responsibility and commitment to set up an honest and transparent government that will respect the balance by which the Panamanian people voted in the elections, and that will invest the wealth of our country so as to positively impact the quality of life of all Panamanians, without distinction of any kind. For Panama to be a role model of democracy we will always seek the unity of our people and our region, supporting a non-confrontational world where our enemies will be hunger, inequality, and the other problems that affect us.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With over 20 years of experience in the financial sector, what have been your landmark achievements since becoming President of Banistmo in October 2013?<br></h4><p>I would say that our main achievements have been the way customers welcomed us—both brand and bank, from the very first day—and the extremely warm and pleasant welcome our 1,500 partners gave me personally. These two elements combined have enabled us to achieve impressive growth and expansion during this year.</p><h4>After Grupo Bancolombia acquired HSBC's operations in Panama, it decided to rename the bank Banistmo. What were the core reasons behind the decision?</h4><p>Bancolombia's business vision promotes a more human banking model, i.e. banks that admire people and prioritize quality, inclusiveness, and respect. There was no better way to prove, on our arrival to Panama, before the eyes of customers, our respect toward the brand we represent in this country. Banistmo is an old and well-recognized brand in this country, and that is why the company decided to bring it back.</p><h4>Which segments will capitalize on your future growth?</h4><p>Our current strategy has two main pillars; transforming the organizational culture, meaning to make all our partners inclusive in the bank's activity and its development, and achieving a closer level of communication with our clients. Banistmo is a universal bank; we cover all types of clients with comprehensive products and services. Our growth strategy is to strengthen our presence in all segments of the market. Today, Panama offers some interesting opportunities, one being increased banking penetration among people with lower purchasing power, a segment we will grow in, among others.</p><h4>After the purchase, Banistmo became one of the leading institutions in the sector with a market share of 14% in personal and corporate banking. What are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>When taking over in Panama, we are setting a growth goal at the same level of the banking and finance sectors. The country has a growth expectation of around 6% to 7%, whereas the industry will be around the 10% mark. We expect to be in line with this growth. During the first half of 2014, we have achieved great results, consolidating our presence in key segments with key products. For example, we have seen a positive and promising rise in the demand for mortgages, a clear representation of the growth of the construction sector and the increase in Panamanians' purchasing power. We have also experienced positive growth in other segments such as corporate banking, and expect the same for the end of 2014.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the banking and finance sector in Panama?</h4><p>This sector has experienced positive and dynamic growth, positioning Panama as a regional finance and banking hub. There is a strong presence of multinationals in the sector. There is also a strong presence of Colombian banks, reinforcing the idea of a regional hub. Panama is a logistics and banking hub, and this regional leadership opens many opportunities for Panamanian banks to expand operations to other neighboring and traditional markets. The positive and dynamic trends we have experienced in the past few years will only become more relevant in the near future.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the upcoming OECD review of Panama?</h4><p>Panama has achieved much from a financial perspective. For example, it has signed around 19 double taxation agreements, increasing efforts to bring international standards into the finance and banking sector. One of the main challenges now is to continue adapting our industry to global standards in regulatory terms. The upcoming review will contribute to better identifying our challenges and necessary tasks. This will only help us to become stronger and will strengthen our regional leadership.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major milestones for Bladex since you joined the institution?<br></h4><p>I joined Bladex in 2004 as the Chief Commercial Officer. At that time Bladex was a bank to other banks with no corporate clients. The major milestone was the transformation of Bladex into a leading corporate bank in Latin America. This transformation was not achieved overnight as we needed to develop new products and services, besides increasing our client base. I feel very pleased that today we have a portfolio that is primarily comprised of companies from big corporations to SMEs. The total exposure to the segment has increased from zero in 2004 to 62% in 2014, and the number of clients from 160 to 500 clients.</p><h4>Bladex was founded to finance international trade. Why was the bank established in Panama?</h4><p>The reason for establishing the bank in Panama was really quite simple: first, the idea came from an illustrious Panamanian, Nicolas Ardito Barletta, former President of the country, and an important supporter of making Panama a regional finance center; second, Panama's privileged geography and its vocation for foreign trade because of the Panama Canal and the Free Zone of Colón, and third, because Panama was a successful dollarized economy, and the new bank needed to have the US dollar as its functional currency.</p><h4>What are Bladex's main strengths?</h4><p>Bladex's strengths are undoubtedly its knowledge of Latin America, and its strong and unique capital base, which combines shareholders, the central banks of the region, and the investors on the New York Stock Exchange. This powerful combination brings discipline and strong corporate governance standards, and a focus on efficiency and increasing results. Another important strength of Bladex is its credit rating. Bladex was the first Latin American bank to receive an investment grade rating, in 1992. Currently, we are rated “BBB" by S&amp;P and Moody's, and “BBB+" by Fitch. Another key feature of our organization is the “preferred creditor status" recognized by the central banks in Latin America. It means that, if there is a debt crisis in any given country in the region our exposure to that particular country will not be subject to foreign exchange controls. Thus, if the borrower has the funds to service the debt, the payment can be made without having to get approval from the respective central bank. Therefore, Bladex is a unique bank with a clear mandate to focus on the region, rather than individual countries, identifying ways to support the regional expansion of the companies and to foster intraregional trade within Latin America.</p><h4>Which country is the most important to Bladex's activities, and what are your plans for future growth?</h4><p>In terms of the composition of our portfolio, the largest exposure is to Brazil, which makes sense as the country is the largest economy in the region. When I joined the bank in 2004 our exposure to Brazil was 45%. Today, that exposure has dropped to 28% because of the diversification we implemented in our lending activity to other countries throughout Latin America. The second largest exposure is to Central America and Panama, which reached 25% of the total portfolio. We are forecasting a growth of 10% to 13%, in 2014. This projection is based on the underlying growth of the economies in Latin America, which on average are expected to post a GDP growth of 3% in 2014. Normally, the trade flows grow a multiple of 3x to 4x the GDP growth, hence our projections for 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company provides a wide range of services in both its personal and business lines. What are your most in-demand products and how has your portfolio evolved over the last decade?<br></h4><p>We cover property, casualty, bonding, auto, life, and health. We are active in every line of business, and that's why we rank among the top four in every line of business in Panama among 33 companies. We view each line as a profit center, and believe that each plays its own role in the economy. We therefore make sure that every line of business has what it takes to be aggressive in the market, while at the same time being profitable. The largest line of business in Panama has traditionally been auto, which is the case for us, too. However, our health portfolio has, over the past eight years, gone from being our fourth line of business to the second biggest as of last year, just behind auto. We also decided to join forces with Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which is an umbrella association of independent insurance companies, and created what is called the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Panama. All our health products are now marketed under the name of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Panama. This has given us great public acceptance, not only because Internacional de Seguros is behind it, but also because Internacional de Seguros Blue Cross and Blue Shield cardholders can enter any of the million health service providers in the US and be treated as a local patient, be it in a hospital, clinic, or at a doctor's surgery. So wherever you are in the US, the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield take care of everything, after which we reimburse the local Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Panama is a country with a very close relationship with the US, and many Panamanians travel there regularly.</p><h4>How important are reinsurance services for your business activities?</h4><p>This is a vital part of our business. We're continuously taking risk from all our insurers. So in order for us to survive in the long term, especially where natural disasters are concerned, we cannot retain all the risk. In the event of a massive earthquake or flood, for example, the cost would be prohibitive. Therefore, property insurance companies opt for reinsurance when it comes to catastrophic losses. Our company is big enough to retain our normal day-to-day coverage without the need for reinsurance. We have a $140 million capital base that provides us with enough financial strength to cover our losses. Yet large losses as a result of natural disasters require reinsurance. That's what gives us the stability to be able to survive as a business and take on massive claims, as we had to in Colón in 2013.</p><h4>How would you describe your financial performance in 2013, and what are your expectations for next year?</h4><p>Our performance in 2013 was extraordinary, as we broke records not only in sales, but also in profits. We were the first and only company in Central America to write over $200 million worth of direct premiums, and we've been the number one in the Panamanian insurance sector for the past five years, excepting 2013.</p><h4>You have been at the helm of the company since 2005. What have been your most memorable achievements over the past decade?</h4><p>We went from being the third largest insurance company in the market to becoming the market leaders. That is the main accomplishment and speaks for itself. That being said, we owe much of that to our excellent team of brokers. Over 95% of sales in Panama are done through brokers. We provide them with all the tools they need, investing much time, effort, and technology, and providing them with the greatest accessibility of any company, with 24/7 web, and increasingly, smartphone access.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the evolution of the mining sector been in Panama, especially regarding foreign investment?<br></h4><p>Foreign investment in the mining sector has grown considerably over the last four years. Firstly, we have the start of operations of Petaquilla Gold, a small- to medium-sized gold mine that became the main exporter of the country in only its second year of operations, with gold appearing as the main good being exported from Panama over 2011 and 2012. Right now, First Quantum Minerals is investing $6.4 billion building the Cobre Panama copper project, a world-class mining project that is expected to enter production in late 2017. For certain geological reasons, it has been found that Panama is a small place where world-class mine deposits have developed on its sub-surface, Cobre Panama and Cerro Colorado copper deposits being the ones to have evaluated known reserves. These two have been already discovered, but no systematic efforts have been conducted all around the country, leaving the majority of its territorial extension unexplored. The Cobre Panama Project is slated to produce around 300,000-350,000 tons of copper per year, which means that Panama will become around the ninth largest copper producer in the world. The value of metal exports will then represent around $2 billion per year, an income similar to that produced by the Panama Canal, for a country with a population of 3.5 million people.</p><h4>How many jobs will Minera Panamá create with this project?</h4><p>During the peak of construction, it will employ between 6,000 and 8,000 persons, and during operation it will employ about 2,500 people and create many more indirect jobs. When the Panama Canal widening project will approach its conclusion, most of those employed on its construction will become skilled candidates for work on the Cobre Panama mine. It will help the economy to keep growing at the pace it has shown over the past seven years. This means that mining will be an important part of the Panamanian economy over the next few years; however, in order to do that the best way possible, some deep changes will need to be performed regarding the national mining legal framework and institutional hierarchy. Today's laws and governmental institutions have severe technical, environmental, and social weakness, lacking the modern approach of responsible mining. It means the actual Mining Code does not include aspects such as mine closures, community involvement, environmental management, and several other aspects. It is a matter of urgency to start building all these capacities so the government can adequately rule the sector, given it will be as important as the producer of about 10% of country's GDP.</p><h4>How is the mining sector perceived by Panamanians?</h4><p>We have many NGOs spreading a lot of misinformation around the country, showing people the way mining was done 50 years ago or even facts that have no bearing on reality. However, after having an operating mine with another being constructed, people have started to realize that mining activity is not a synonymous with apocalyptic disasters, but an opportunity for the country to get not only economic benefits, but also important environmental and social opportunities that will not come any other way for many rural areas.</p><h4>What other challenges will the mining sector face in the coming years?</h4><p>A big participative effort is needed that includes government, the mining sector, and all stake holders, giving their best efforts to produce a modern legal framework and to build institutional capacities that will allow the economic, social, and environmental benefits to become a real fact to the communities involved and for the whole country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you looked to adjust your operations in the Panamanian market?<br></h4><p>AutoStar has been in Panama since July 2012. In 2010, we started with due diligence and market research in Panama, flying in on a weekly basis to get an idea of the operations here. Our growth in Panama has been extremely good because the brand is in very high demand. In terms of the Mercedes-Benz brand, we are working hard every day to improve our service, which is the most important part of our business. The most important aspects include taking care of the client, making sure you have the right parts in stock, and maintaining a training program for our technicians. In this business, you need to have a lot of capital. You have infrastructure that you need to pay for, and then you need to have a lot of stock because clients do not like to wait for their cars. The finances also need to be in order as factories are paid up front. When a car arrives in Panama, it is already paid for, and we then sell it two or more months later.</p><h4>What models are particularly exciting for you in this market?</h4><p>Mercedes-Benz has changed a lot, and you can now see many new products, including the new generation compact cars (NGCC), namely the A Class, CLA Class, and GLA Class. These models are helping us to attack a segment of clients that we couldn't before. In 2013, Mercedes-Benz was number one in the US after BMW and Audi, and that is because of the new-generation cars. We expect that 20% of our sales are going to be in this area. The Panamanian market, however, prefers SUVs, and 70% of our sales are SUVs.</p><h4>You have a presence in five countries. What are your future plans for expansion?</h4><p>We started expanding 23 years ago when we came to Peru. And in 10 years we want to be in Ecuador, Colombia, and Guatemala.</p><h4>What was your financial performance here in Panama for 2013? And what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>Last year we sold about $45 million worth of products, and we are expecting to sell $65 million this year. We need to have sales of 900 units across the whole range, which includes Mercedes-Benz, the Chrysler brands, including Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and Freightliner trucks from Daimler.</p><h4>What other investments will you make this year?</h4><p>We are investing around $2 million to give our head office a facelift. We will then be investing $5 million in new showrooms and our principal workshop for Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler in the Santa Maria business district. This will afford us the largest workshop in the luxury car segment in Panama. With this kind of investment, we send a strong message to our clients that they can trust us as partners.</p><h4>The luxury car sector grew by 19% in 2013 in Panama. What's behind that?</h4><p>I think Panama offers what no other countries in the region do; political stability, logistics facilities, attractive financial options, and a government and private sector that invest heavily. Many international companies are arriving and bringing in managers from other markets. Those managers need cars, so they are responsible for a lot of this growth. But another reason is that the upper-middle class is also growing in Panama. That kind of growth leads to an expansion of the luxury segment. Panama has low taxes compared to the region, making it an attractive place. Also, financing from banks is very aggressive, and people like cars. It is now cheaper to get a car here. Indeed, cars in Panama are cheaper than in the other markets we operate in. The tax rate on cars in Costa Rica is 65%, whereas it is just 25% in Panama.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Copa Airlines' strategy over the last decade?<br></h4><p>We have followed the same strategy for over 20 years, which involves building a hub in Panama for intra-American connectivity. Our business model is very straightforward in a simple and effective manner. Over the last five years we have accelerated the airline's capacity growth, transitioning from four to six connecting banks at Tocumen Airport, the “Hub of the Americas," in Panama. We have also added close to 20 destinations in that same five-year period.</p><h4>Copa offers service to 67 destinations in 30 countries. Which routes are the most important for your business activity?</h4><p>By July 2014, we will be flying to 67 destinations in 30 countries, certainly the most complete and convenient connecting hub in Latin America. We have a very well balanced network; therefore, I could not say that one market is more important than another. South America is, of course, the largest region that we serve through our hub in Panama. We connect most major cities in South America with Central and North America as well as the Caribbean.</p><h4>How does Copa contribute to the economic development of Panama?</h4><p>We have over 6,800 employees in Panama and around 8,700 worldwide. We really believe that we contribute in a significant way to every country we serve, since today's world is driven by connectivity and, especially, air connectivity. In regards to Panama, we are a major contributor to the country's GDP, second only to the Panama Canal. Our direct and indirect contribution to Panama's GDP is around 4%. Besides that, due to our hub, Panama is the most connected country in Latin America relative to its GDP. This unique connectivity is one of the main reasons why Panama has become a major business hub, tourism destination, and home for many multinational companies that have established their regional offices here.</p><h4>How would you describe Copa's financial performance over 2013, and what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We had a very strong year in 2013; we grew our capacity by 14%. Our revenues also grew by 16%. We met or exceeded the market and analysts' expectations. For 2014, we expect to have another strong year, with capacity growth of 10%.</p><h4>How important is the concept of social responsibility for Copa, and what are the most successful achievements in this field?</h4><p>Social responsibility is an integral part of Copa's yearly corporate objectives. It starts with our own employees; therefore, we dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to make Copa Airlines the best place to work. We have a number of programs to help in the training and advancement of our employees. We also offer scholarships for their children. Maybe the most successful program to align our workforce with the strategy and growth of the company is our profit sharing program, which we have consistently paid for over a decade. Our social responsibility programs also work with the communities we serve and look to protect the environment. One example is our 3Rs program: recycle, reduce, and reuse. As well, we are founding members of United Way in Panama. Copa Airlines included, in its CSR strategy, actions to mitigate climate change with the aim of reducing the carbon footprint. Therefore, during 2012 and 2013, Copa accomplished a reduction of over 12,200 tons of CO2. By 2014, the goal is to achieve a further reduction of over 4,800 tons of CO2.</p><h4>What is the potential for Panama to become a world hub for aviation?</h4><p>The country has been attracting a number of European airlines that have either started new services or increased their frequencies to Panama. Those airlines benefit from Panama's unique position as the best located and most connected hub in Latin America. We expect Panama to continue growing as the premier gateway to our region and this should eventually mean more services from Europe and other parts of the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[what-do-you-need]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the reason behind the rebranding of the company in 2005?<br></h4><p>In 2005, we changed our name from Waked Internacional to Grupo Wisa in order to give uniformity to the business activities of the company, and to project a solid and reputable brand name. Waked is a common surname in Lebanon and there are many companies under that name; hence, people tended to think that all Waked companies had something to do with us.</p><h4>What is the main activity Grupo Wisa engages in at the moment?</h4><p>We have a diverse business portfolio, and our main activity is perfumes and fragrances. Newspapers are another one of our main activities; we own the newspapers El Siglo and also La Estrella, the oldest paper in the country, and among the oldest ones in Latin America. They are two of the main newspapers in Panama, and we have high expectations for the future of these titles.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Soho project for Grupo Wisa?</h4><p>This is a project that was started some six years ago by a Spanish entrepreneur, who subsequently faced some economic difficulties in making the project a reality. I ended up acquiring firstly 50% of the shares and later on a greater percentage of them. Today, the Soho project is the main commercial investment project in the country after the Canal. The project has been able to move forward thanks to the support of local banks, especially Bancolombia and Banistmo. We are talking about two office towers and one Ritz Carlton Hotel tower. In addition, 120 stores will be constructed featuring famous brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, Prada, Valentino, Burberry, Fendi, Rolex, Mercurio, Carolina Herrera, YSL, Bvlgari, Bottega Veneta, Jimmy Choo, Ralph Lauren, and many others. We already have all these contracts signed, and I believe we will open the doors by the end of 2014. To date, we are talking about an investment of some $360 million, including constructing underground parking for over 3,000 vehicles. This project has had international expertise in its design and construction. One of the towers will be named after Banistmo bank.</p><h4>How has the company expanded its international profile in the last decade?</h4><p>We have operations in almost all Central American and some South American markets. Our main future focus will be on the Southern Cone. For example, we opened the first Burberry store in Chile. I also want to enter Brazil, despite the legal and tax difficulties this represents.</p><h4>What role does the Colón Free Trade Zone in Panama play in the group's activities?</h4><p>Initially, the zone was one of the reasons why we moved to Panama; today, it is a logistics center for us from where we bring European products and redistribute them among our subsidiaries. It is not a business center, rather it is a logistics hub. This is due to the fact that over the years we have ended up assuming the entire distribution chain for our business activities, prior to that we used to work more with intermediaries. Despite the increase in operating costs, we knew this was the way to succeed, and time has proved this right.</p><h4>What is the significance of Fundacion La Riviera for Panamanian society?</h4><p>The foundation is a personal project based on the idea that I have always believed as a businessperson that you have to give back as much as you can from what you achieve. I am extremely thankful for the work done by the management board of the foundation. My daughters have also been an essential part in the development of the foundation. The main goals of Fundacion La Riviera are education, healthcare, child welfare, and the alleviation of poverty. My future plan foresees the professionalization of the foundation in terms of having its own headquarters, better facilities, and more resources. For example, we want a space where we can set up a community center to provide training, food and care for low-income families.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the general financial strategy planned by the Ministry for the next five years to maintain the sustainable and solid growth of Panama's economy?<br></h4><p>A document known as the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework provides estimates on economic performance. The government is aware that, in a market economy, state intervention aims best to ensure the stability of public finance, debt sustainability, and the implementation of policies that support private-sector decisions in accordance with national growth objectives, social inclusion, and a strong society. To achieve these objectives, we are hiring a high-level consulting firm to set the road-map for the government over the next five years. This work is called the Government Strategic Plan (PEG), where we will bring together structural and long-term analyses to develop best practices and policies.</p><h4>What are the advantages of investing in the Panamanian banking sector, and what is the role of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in attracting foreign investment to the International Banking Center?</h4><p>Given the economic structure of the country, the Banking Center is an essential pillar in national policy. The strong momentum in the expansion of aggregate demand is largely due to the Banking Center funding provided to economic agents in the country. Investing in Panama presents the financial sector with important advantages, among which are the absence of exchange rate concerns, and the integration of banking with other segments of the financial services segment, which are currently expanding, and to which we are devoting our attention in order to support their sustained development. These financial services include business insurance, reinsurance, and bonds, among others such as a reasonable tax structure, inter-industry links developed with other international sectors within the service industry, and the governmental commitment to ensure conditions of social harmony. If we analyze the composition of FDI, we can see that 28% of the $4.65 billion that came in 2013 was reinvestments and the investment earnings of the banks located in Panama.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing the financial sector at present, and what kind of regulatory improvements are being made?</h4><p>The financial sector here faces the impact of problems in developed financial markets that have yet to be resolved. In addition, we do not have the same regulatory pressures that developed countries put on their financial systems. The concerns related to these regulations on the flow of activities, in terms of additional, explicit, and implicit costs, and their impact on the rest of the world are widely known. Panama has been included on certain gray lists for presenting some weaknesses in our economic systems as compared to the standards that the OECD and FATF promote. In this regard, Panama is aware that its leading role in regional business, its international financial community membership, and its integration into the global trade and finance markets are highly sensitive issues when it comes to these perceptions. As long as the country does its best to improve perceptions of our systems, which is something we are already doing, we are confident that the economic ratings our systems have received should not have an impact in the medium to long term.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the finance sector in the medium term, and for economic growth over the coming 12 months?</h4><p>The IMF expects Panama to grow by 7.2% in 2014, and 6.9% for 2015 according to the World Economic Forum, although those forecasts are likely to be revised downward given global uncertainty, especially resulting from the recalibration of the Chinese economy and its impact on the commodity-exporting countries of the region and international geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Russia. In this regard, our growth expectations are in the order of 6.5%, based on our budget estimates. Locally, the financial sector will continue its upward trend in view of the expectations of the Latin American region in the country. In fact, in March 2014 the local national banking system's loan portfolio increased by 9.4%. However, there are complications in the industrial portfolio and the FTA, and this has reduced the commercial and industrial loan portfolio.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[shore-leave]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which countries do you have a large presence?<br></h4><p>We have operations in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, and we are going to start in Guatemala in 2014. The business is mainly focused on Central and South America and Venezuela. We also have a business partner in Colombia, and we are trying to develop our business in the Dominican Republic. We also manage one of the main marine lubricant and oil companies, Castrol, and are its representative for all of Central America.</p><h4>How does Meyer's Group contribute to the development of the country?</h4><p>Actually, we started with two tugs and now we have five or six. We did this because there is new technology coming in from Damen, a major shipbuilding company, which offers the ASD range of tug ships. In this way, a new tug can make money more easily than the previous tugs. Usually in the market you see some old tugs and old technology, but with this new technology you can make more money in a shorter period of time. It has many advantages, and is better than the older tugs being used in Panama. In terms of job creation, more than the 95% of our employees are Panamanian, and we have more than 300-400 employees in the country.</p><h4>How will the completion of the Panama Canal expansion impact your operations?</h4><p>Our experts are expecting about 7%-10% in growth in our operations and business. The only difference in the import and export sector in Panama will be the size of the vessels. That is the only difference; however, marine operations will increase. It is conservative to say 7% growth is expected, but on the whole, some are predicting about 10%. We are expecting about 7% growth in Meyer's Group. We are rolling out two new tugs in August, and they will arrive by the beginning of October 2014. For the beginning of 2015, we have three more coming for the business plan that we are developing in the new ports—one on the Pacific side and one on the Atlantic. They are making space on the dock, and we are also bringing in one more tug for this.</p><h4>How would you describe Panama's port infrastructure?</h4><p>I can say that the infrastructure is still developing. However, the development has been more important on the Colón side than on the Pacific side. On the Pacific side, we still have the same terminals, and there is another project similar to a service terminal. However, in Colón, the infrastructure is amazing. All the terminals are expanding right now. I think Colón is more developed because it is more developed in the Caribbean than it is in the Pacific. We started with the terminal of Patsa in January 2014, and now there is Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk coming to this terminal also. But there is only one terminal, though expansion plans exist for a second one. There is a great difference between the two ends of the Canal in terms of facilities.</p><h4>How would you assess the competition in the maritime sector?</h4><p>I think that our competition in Panama consists mostly of larger companies. We are a small company, a family company, but we compete with big companies, like Virtual Logistics. To be honest, the market in Panama is healthy enough for everybody. If you take all the concessions that Panama is giving, there are things that started 20 years ago that have still not finished yet. And Virtual Logistics has most of these concessions. If you remove those concessions from the equation, then Meyer's is the top company in Panama for concessions. However, we started from zero in Panama, and it is difficult to fight with big companies. Small fish don't try to eat big ones, but we are still trying to fight this massive competition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was Hutchison's impetus for entering the Panamanian market?<br></h4><p>The Panama Canal is a prime tool that the shipping industry has to its advantage. The connectivity that it provides for the trans-Pacific and trans-Atlantic trades, connecting the east and west coast of the US, as well as the east and west coast of South and Central America, is a tremendous asset. Most of the world was experiencing port privatization 17 years ago. Hutchison Ports Holding (HPH), the largest container operator in the world, saw the opportunity to invest in Panama since the government was undergoing the privatization process of a port concession, which represented an opportunity to develop container terminals at both ends of the canal. Today, HPH Panama is considered the most important port operator in the country. With operations on both ends of the canal, a major initiative for the company is to further assist in this connectivity in order to develop a more efficient manner for crossing the canal. This, in turn, will reinforce the process to logistically make Panama the best network in the world.</p><h4>Panama Ports Company has operations on both sides of the canal, in the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal. Which is the most important factor for the company's activities?</h4><p>Our operations in Panama, at the Port of Balboa and the Port of Cristóbal, are both equally important for us. We envision a system that utilizes diverse modes of transportation, such as barges, trucks, and rail to provide a high-value service structure to fulfill our client's needs. The Hutchison portfolio is solid with an extensive history in Asia, where some of the largest ports are located. The company operates 52 ports in over 26 countries and strategic cities such as Rotterdam, Felixstowe, and Barcelona; nonetheless, Panama has two of the most important ports for the group.</p><h4>What is your future plan for expansion?</h4><p>We are currently re-engineering our container operations, which represent a solid business with room for further development. We will therefore have greater capacities and new licensing ideas, similar to what we have implemented in other countries, such as automation; between the two ports we handle about 3.5 million TEUs per year, but have the capacity to reach a total of 6.5 million TEUs per year. We are also focusing greater efforts in areas such as automobiles, general cargo, agricultural grain, and minerals. We have considerable capacity available in the Atlantic, an area that has not been fully developed, and are currently working on a master plan to do so.</p><h4>What are the key routes for your operations?</h4><p>The trans-Pacific route is the most important, connecting Asia to the west and east coast of South America. On the other side, there is the trans-Atlantic route from Europe to the east coast of North and South America. A smaller portion is destined for the Caribbean and the west coast of South America.</p><h4>Panama is now signing numerous free trade agreements (FTAs) like the one signed with Mexico in April, which will make it possible for Panama to participate in the Pacific Alliance. What impact would this union have on your business activities?</h4><p>For Panama, it will undoubtedly be beneficial, although for us it will have a limited benefit. This alliance is designed to increase and foster international trade. For our ports, the majority of business involves transshipments, with only 5% of local cargo going through Panama. Global trade is much more important for our business, where China plays an important role.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the Panama Canal expansion at your company?</h4><p>It will have a major impact because of the increased container (trade) volume. Although our ports already have the capacity to handle vessels of up to 15,000 TEUs, it is probable that a good amount of these vessels, which nowadays aren't able to pass through the canal, will eventually be able to do so.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important projects for the company in recent years?<br></h4><p>Miramar has always been one of our favorite projects. It is a very emblematic location in the center of the bay on Balboa Avenue. The marina and hotel, being part of the condominium complex, has always been a unique scheme. It was ahead of its time 15 years ago, and still today it is one of the prime residential areas in Panama. President Varela himself lives there. For the future, I envisage the Westin and the Intercontinental in Playa Bonita also becoming important projects for us. Gamboa is also a unique project that we always like to refer to at the center of the Panama Canal. It is not our largest project, but certainly one of the more special ones.</p><h4>What is the situation of the Town Center project?</h4><p>The Town Center in Costa del Este is currently at the foundation stage. We are expecting to open by July 2017, and that includes not only the retail area (which is crucial), but also the clinics and hospital as well as the multi-use offices. It is going to be radically different from anything else on offer in Panama and, in fact, in Latin America. We are in that project with the architectural firm RTKL, which is well known worldwide for such multi-use facility projects. For us it is going to be a highly emblematic project—very complete. It is part of our commitment to the area of Costa del Este, where most of our projects are located.</p><h4>How would you describe the state of the real estate sector in Panama and its key trends?</h4><p>There is a great flexibility in Panama in terms of offering solutions for hotels, apartments, and office space. There are plenty of options in office space and hotels and apartments to house employees, and a great capacity in Panama's private sector to produce solutions. What's more there is a clear trend towards green certification. Most of the office buildings today feature environmental elements such as special air-conditioning systems, double-glaze windows, and so on. International companies are going to demand certain features in terms of energy savings and light safety. Those international standards cannot be ignored if one is to build a successful project. We like to differentiate our projects from the competition in terms of their location, quality, and available amenities.</p><h4>What drove the 29% growth of the construction sector last year?</h4><p>Certainly, a lot of it had to do with the culmination of public projects running up to the elections. I think that is going to free up some of the human capital that we require to bring projects forward. It's something to embrace when you need to increase wages to obtain better quality personnel. Panama is a relatively small economy, and we have certain restrictions regarding the importation of labor. You can basically only use local labor for construction. This raises the general economic level of our workers, which is positive. People used to wonder whether Panama would become the Dubai of Latin America, but we didn't think so. What you see in fact is the individual economic decisions of many people. Dubai brings labor in from India and Pakistan and the cost of values compared to the value of properties tends to be in the 5% to 8% range. In Panama, our cost of labor is about 30% of the value of the property, which gives us a good social foundation. The benefits are being distributed to the members of Panamanian society. Construction is one of the activities that has the highest economic contribution. Everything is basically done domestically, which will prove to be crucial going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have the landmark achievements of the company been since it was incorporated in 2009?<br></h4><p>The company was established five years ago when my partner and I, following years of working in one of the largest real estate companies in the country, decided to enter the Panamanian real estate market with our own company and focus on the business and commercial segments of the sector. We have over 14 years of experience in the real estate market as advisors, and have developed a team of expert advisors to offer the best opportunities for business. In this context, today 70% of the Panamanian commerce and business that want to expand their activities comes to us for real estate advice. The way we work is as follows; we meet our clients, we listen to their needs and requirements, and we search for what they need in terms of real estate properties. We also provide intermediation services to land owners who want to sell their land. In terms of future plans, we aim to enter the appraisals and administration of commercial properties segment to further complement our business and do it comprehensively.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of your company?</h4><p>We provide technical and expert advice to all the companies looking for real estate properties. This is based on our years of experience in this sector. For example, we also carry profitability studies to assess the potential return on investment. The personalized services we offer clients are among the core strengths of our company.</p><h4>How many properties does the company currently manage, and which are the main ones you engage with?</h4><p>At the moment, we have over 9,000 properties in our portfolio, including new constructions and second-hand properties. We have access to all the new construction projects being developed in Panama, due to long-standing ties with the main developers. We also have access to the inventories of foreclosed properties of the major banks and also represent several investment groups focused on real estate development, which maintain a current portfolio of commercial properties for lease only. Our main activities are to search and identify properties with potential for housing and commercial development, in addition to studying the growth plans of businesses to identify and propose new and potential sectors.</p><h4>What opportunities, in your opinion, does Panama offer to real estate investors?</h4><p>Panama sits in a strategic location and can serve as a logistics base, so we should be developing our logistics and transport infrastructure. The country has a lot to offer in terms of entertainment infrastructure. The real estate sector also offers opportunities aplenty in the housing segment, especially for the middle and lower income social segments.</p><h4>How would you assess the economic performance of the company over the past year, and what are your near-term expectations?</h4><p>We have experienced positive growth trends since the first day of operations; the annual average of the past four years is above 10%. This year we will not reach double-digit growth, but will be close to it.</p><h4>Which key factors contributed to the 7% growth in demand for commercial offices in Panama over the past year?</h4><p>One of the main factors has been the expansion of the Panama Canal. Demand for such properties has been far above 7%; however, we reached a point where we should be wary of the number of commercial offices already available in the market, as we may be seeing the beginnings of unwelcome oversupply.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing the Panamanian real estate sector over the next five years?</h4><p>The expansion of the Panama Canal has attracted many foreign investors, and I believe the main challenge the country faces involves sustaining FDI levels, as this could ultimately compensate for a potential decline of local investment in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have bilateral ties between Panama and Guatemala developed in recent years?<br></h4><p>The ties between both countries are deep, strong, and dynamic, and over the past few years, they have only improved—the level of interaction has positively increased. However, I would also like to highlight ties between both countries within the Central American Integration Systema (SICA). Panama has grown at a rapid pace over the past few years, and it would be exceptional if we could spread such a trend to Central America through the SICA.</p><h4>Since both countries recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to boost trade, what are the sectors with the greatest potential to deepen relations?</h4><p>Tourism is one of the sectors that sees a kind of monopolized trade relationship between both countries; however, I see an interesting potential in infrastructure projects and energy (including renewable energies), as well as many others. These will be the first steps to build even deeper and stronger trade ties between Panama and Guatemala. Let me add that there are already ongoing projects in these fields that have the participation of companies from Panama.</p><h4>To what extent has the marked decline in violence in Guatemala City impacted cooperation between both countries?</h4><p>Over the past two years, Guatemala City has seen a 37% decline in homicide rates, coinciding with my tenure as President. We have already held fruitful meetings with Panama to boost the transfer of technology, intelligence, and communications that will ensure agility in tackling issues such as transnational crime. Over the past two years, we have strengthened ties between both countries in this field to make sure that current information is immediately at hand to tackle these problems.</p><h4>How do you see bilateral ties evolving over the next few years of your term?</h4><p>Bilateral ties between Panama and Guatemala were already excellent before I took over the presidential office, and I truly expect them to remain positive over the years to come. We have grown closer over the years, and our common ties have reached people and communities from both countries.</p><h4>What conclusions did you draw from the World Economic Forum on Latin America hosted in Panama City?</h4><p>First of all, I would like to congratulate the President of Panama and its people for the milestone achievement of bringing such an internationally high-profile forum to our region. The event has set a precedent for future regional development, having placed Central America in the spotlight of international attention. Guatemala hopes to organize an equally high-profile event within the coming years. The World Economic Forum provided us and certain other nations with the opportunity to showcase regional developments and invite foreign investors to consider our countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of the recent slowdown, what is your outlook for 2015 and beyond in terms of mineral prices?</h4><p>Having been in the industry for the past 35 years I have seen prices rise and fall, which is quite normal. This is the essence of this industry, which does not control prices because an ounce of gold or copper produced in Peru, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Chile, or the US is sold at the same price in the open market. What we can control are our costs. Costs have to do with the competitiveness of the country and of the company, and in that respect, we are positioned at the low end of the gold, copper, and silver producers, so what matters here is to be a low-cost producer, which is precisely what Buenaventura offers to the market. Investment and prices may decline, but what matters is the long term is cost, and demand continues to grow.</p><h4>Regarding Buenaventura's stock price, JP Morgan recently declared Buenaventura stock overweight. What was your reaction to this?</h4><p>Analysts sometimes treat us well, and sometimes less so, although our operations are consistent regardless. However, the share price of Buenaventura has been over-penalized because of falling metal prices and the performance of emerging markets. Probably, were we based in Canada or the US we would not have been penalized as severely. We are, however, classified as an emerging market company, and emerging markets have not been doing too well.</p><div class="quote">“Peru is currently producing 1.2 million tons of copper per annum."</div><h4>Could you summarize the outlook for copper in 2015 in Peru?</h4><p>Peru is currently producing 1.2 million tons of copper per annum. With the expansion of Cerro Verde and the construction of Las Bambas and Constancia, within two years, we will be producing 2.5 million tons, which means more than a doubling of production. This still lags far behind Chile, which produces 5 million tons of copper.</p><h4>There has been much talk about infrastructure investment this year and much will be implemented in 2015, while the new mineral port has also been opened by Trafigura and others. How do those developments affect you?</h4><p>Peru still lacks infrastructure, and from a geographical standpoint it is difficult when you have a low-population coastal area and the high Andes. Then there is the Amazon jungle to contend with. In order to generate the necessary infrastructure to connect the country, you need economic activity that justifies it. Mining is part of this justification, and obviously Peru had been doing well to improve its infrastructure with roads, electricity, and communications, although the country still has a long way to go. In the case of the port specifically, through our subsidiary, Sociedad Minera El Brocal, we are also part of this process, and it is set to become an important facility that will reduce the costs of shipping, while the vessels themselves will arrive and depart faster than at present, all of which vitally reduces costs.</p><h4>In 2014 the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published a study on mining and hydrocarbon projects across the world entitled “Conflict translates environmental and social risk into business costs." It found that businesses often misjudged the inherent political risks of large projects. Buenaventura has had related problems with Yanacocha and Conga. How would you judge the political risk of Peruvian projects?</h4><p>A country like Peru, which is regarded as a star, generates expectations. The rural population naturally has expectations of sharing in the benefits of national growth rates. The problem is how to deal with those expectations, especially when they have to do with the distribution of wealth. The mining sector, as part of the private sector, generates wealth, taxes, and production, and the resulting wealth and taxes have to be redistributed by the authorities. The problem in countries like Peru is that the state is absent in certain rural areas and mining companies have to assume its role, which is almost impossible. That generates conflict, which we have to address. Expectations need to be met through additional infrastructure, and by providing opportunities, services, education, and healthcare. In the case of the Conga gold and copper mining project in Cajamarca Region of Northern Peru, matters were compounded by the political campaign, and certain politicians, the president among them, argued that Conga was not feasible. Yet following his election, he came out in support of Conga. These are ongoing political issues, and we are always working with communities, stakeholders, and the state to make our projects positive for those involved.</p><h4>For the next three years, how do you plan to increase production during a time of falling mineral prices, and how do you plan to keep costs low in that environment?</h4><p>Many believe that the mining industry develops in times of high prices, and that is indeed part of the story, although overall mining essentially develops with political and economic stability. Mining develops when there is security for the people, and when there is infrastructure. Peru is on the right track, and we are improving infrastructure. The fact is that Peru has signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with two-thirds of total global GDP; 55 nations worldwide, and we have an investment grade rating, and are part of the Pacific Alliance, which makes us part of a group of successful companies in Latin America. Meanwhile, we have finalized all sea border disputes with Chile, which means that Peru is stable, economically and politically. In the case of Buenaventura, we have a pipeline project and expect to continue related developments. In fact we recently bought 51% of the Chucapaca project from Goldfields at a cost of $81 million, which is a vast amount for Buenaventura. We were formerly 49% stakeholders, but today hold a 100% stake. Meanwhile, we plan to develop Chucapaca, and are dealing with social issues related to the purchase of the surface land, which we need for the development of the project. We will most likely bring this into production by 2017.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar currently finds itself in the middle of an Arab world in flux. What are the pillars of the country's foreign policy that aim to restore order in the region?</h4><p>Qatar is a stable, progressive country in a complex and often misunderstood region. Because of this stability, we have been able to develop effective relationships in the Middle East that allow us to facilitate conflict resolution and open doors for our allies that would otherwise be closed. Qatar's foreign policy is conducted in accordance with an integral strategic plan developed by the leadership of the country, known as the Qatar National Vision 2030, and this outlines the framework through which Qatar will further solidify its diplomatic position regionally and internationally. At the center of Qatar's foreign policy is the belief that international peace and security can be achieved only through dialogue based on principles of equality, compliance with international law, respect for human rights, and protecting human dignity—especially during times of crisis. It is with these guiding principles that we approach the stability of our region; by achieving peace and security for the Middle East, we will help pave the way to achieving a more stable world. Qatar has become a powerful and effective mediator among our allies and in the Middle East. This is a role that we believe represents an open door to peace, because of our country's stability, and our commitment to foster a dialogue among all parties in order to find peaceful solutions and avoid conflict.</p><h4>What is the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in paving the way for Qatar as a country investing in opportunities abroad?</h4><p>Qatar's global fund represents a long-term investment strategy and we have substantial interests in emerging markets as well as in Europe. In addition, foreign aid is a central component of Qatar's foreign policy strategy. The State of Qatar believes that economic development and social inclusion is the safest and most reliable path to peace and stability. Qatar's foreign aid contribution is now nearing the $1 billion mark annually, spread across 100-plus countries. On a relative basis, it is worth mentioning that Qatar actually spends more on international assistance. The State of Qatar is a generous development partner, but we have also proved to be a dependable ally to developed nations in times of crisis. What comes to mind here is the case of post-tsunami Japan, a country whose trust and friendship we really value. Year in and year out, Qatar provides critical support and development in post-conflict countries, helping them build the institutions most needed for a peaceful and prosperous future. Doing so falls both under the strategic interest and our moral obligation to build a better, safer world for all our children.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar is a stable, progressive country in a complex and often misunderstood region."</div><h4>Over recent years Qatar has strengthened its ties with the countries on the Latin American continent. In which fields do you see opportunities for mutually beneficial resources?</h4><p>The Middle East and Latin America are two emerging regions that are opening up to the world and we are keen on enhancing our relationships with Latin American countries. This is part of a wider geopolitical shift worldwide. As we maintain closer relationships with Latin American countries we can work together to promote economic development and solidarity among our nations. This year, we were proud to launch “Qatar-Brazil," a joint cultural program to build bridges and open communication between our two nations and serve our shared goals and common interests.</p><h4>Qatar has rapidly grown to a position of international importance. What is the long-term vision for the country when considering its position in the region and the world?</h4><p>In the words of the Emir, His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani; “We do not live on the sideline of life, and we do not drift without a destination; we are a people with a vision." The long-term vision for further enhancing our position in the region and in the world is focused on engagement for the purpose of promoting peace and prosperity in the Middle East and the global community. Qatar will stand firm and fulfill its shared responsibility to regional peace and stability where needed. Qatar has always been, and will continue to be, an engaged participant in the formal multilateral and regional forums, whether it is the United Nations, the Arab League, or the Gulf Cooperation Council. We recognize the need for, and the value of, these cooperative and rules-based institutions. Qatar will always aim to be a constructive party in these organizations and support the crucial initiatives they promote.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back, what were the most important decisions taken by the Ministry of Transport over the last year?</h4><p>Since the formation of the Ministry of Transport and the issuance of Emiri Decree No. 31 of 2014, which details our responsibilities, the Ministry has progressed on two major work streams. The first one is the developing of the internal organization and the building of our capacity. Secondly, the Ministry has facilitated the delivery of ongoing major state transport projects, such as the opening of Hamad International Airport, the completion of the new port project's quay wall, and the implementation of a public bus improvement action plan that includes the introduction of the West Bay bus service to promote a public transport culture. The Ministry has also initiated a program to develop a multi-agency resilience plan for transportation under the national resilience program in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and to ensure the safety and security of the nation's air, marine, rail, and land transport sectors in the future.</p><h4>Improvements in transportation facilities are essential for a country to reach its full potential. What is your vision for providing the State of Qatar with the needed transportation facilities?</h4><p>The vision of our Ministry is aligned with Qatar's National Vision 2030, and we are working to further integrate the strategic goals of various transportation modes to this vision. As the purpose of the Ministry's formation is to integrate the comprehensive transportation system of the country, our focus is to achieve an integrated multimodal transportation system that complements economic growth and improves people's quality of life by bringing in world-class and state-of-the-art transportation systems and infrastructure. Ideally, we would see public and sustainable transport modes being the preferred modal choice among residents and tourists.</p><div class="quote">“Qatar faces a high demand for construction materials to complete key infrastructure projects in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup."</div><h4>The first phase of Qatar's new port is due to be completed in 2016. What will be the impact of this new facility on the local economy?</h4><p>Qatar faces a high demand for construction materials to complete key infrastructure projects in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The port will play a significant role in ensuring these material needs are met. The new port will provide increased throughput with a capacity for 2 million TEUs per year, eventually increasing to over 6 million. This will then be supported by transshipment links by rail, sea, and road to the GCC region. The establishment of an economic zone adjacent to the new port will facilitate manufacturing industries and position the nation to increase its non-oil and gas exports. The Ministry is also working with stakeholders to increase tourism through international cruise ship visits to Doha.</p><h4>Once completed, Qatar's rail network will be connected with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as part of the GCC Railway. What is the importance of this project to the future of the GCC region?</h4><p>Today, we live in a globally connected world, where ease of accessibility has a major impact on the economic development of countries. The GCC Railway will be a major socio-economic milestone in the history of the GCC, which will further strengthen our long-stranding brotherly relations. To keep up with Qatar's growing population and economy, we require reinforced transportation systems that continue to link industries to markets and people to services.</p><h4>In which specific elements of the future development of Qatar's transportation network are you inviting international companies to contribute?</h4><p>The Ministry encourages local companies to participate, though its megaprojects require the involvement of many international players. The Ministry also welcomes all world-class service and product providers that can deliver on high standards of quality, health and safety standards, innovation, and sustainability.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At the end of 2014, the cruise ship MSC Divina arrived in Cartagena. What is the strategic importance of the Port of Cartagena?</h4><p>This was the 46th cruise ship to have visited Cartagena in the past four months. The cruise season here begins in September and ends in May. And as to its importance, Cartagena is perhaps the foremost tourist city in Colombia. We, as well as the government, are trying to make the city one of the prime destinations in the Caribbean for MICE tourists. We are competing with many cities with great beaches, but our downtown district is our unique strong point. Concerning this specific point of interest, we are building hotels and resorts to open more fully ourselves to the world. Colombia has been in a difficult position in recent years, but Cartagena has always been an oasis. And now that the rest of the country is opening up, the pace has intensified. We want to be one of the main ports visited by cruise lines. Our goal is to welcome 1 million cruise ship visitors. Thus far, we have had 450,000, so we are essentially halfway there, and have no doubt that we'll make it. I myself went with the mayor, the captain of the port, and a representative of Procolombia to greet the ship. It's the biggest vessel to have docked here to date, and we always make a special effort to give a warm welcome.</p><h4>How is Cartagena's Chamber of Commerce helping to support female entrepreneurs?</h4><p>Of 120 people working at the Chamber of Commerce, around 60% are women. Before I assumed the role, three women had led the chamber, and we are working to increase the number of female entrepreneurs. A meeting recently celebrated the history of female entrepreneurs and vocally supported would-be entrepreneurs. Today, six ministers are women. We are always working to increase opportunities for women and, for example, one of our present lines of work is called “business hubs," an idea we adopted from Brazil. It is an associative method to help people who work in restaurants, hotels, and textiles or fashion, whereby we ensure that they share their load to speed up the growth of their business. For example, we help to connect those people involved in fashion with those in the hotel business, benefiting both sides.</p><h4>What problems is Cartagena facing in terms of commercial security, and what solutions is the CCC proposing?</h4><p>I would recount two major steps that we have taken in terms of commercial security. About two and a half years ago, we began to think that we were not as competitive as other parts of the country. We were in the lower reaches of Colombia's competitive index, and we began to work on that. We decided to create an agency to promote investment in Cartagena, and approached the mayor and the National Business Association of Colombia (ANDI). This marked the beginning of the group Invest in Cartagena. In 2014, we moved from the bottom spot to sixth place in the index ranking. The World Bank awarded us a blue plaque as the most reformed chamber of commerce in the country. We are investor friendly and pay special attention, not only international investors, but also those within Colombia keen to relocate their companies close to the port in Cartagena. Colombia has signed numerous free trade agreements (FTAs), and Cartagena has benefited a lot from them. We boast the most significant port in the country; 80% of container freight moves through Cartagena. We, therefore, encourage Colombian entrepreneurs to relocate to within close proximity of the port. We are also looking for the port to make changes in light of the fact that we are only 80 miles from the Panama Canal. That Canal is expensive, and we are looking to the government pressing ahead with the plan to open a channel into the Bay of Cartagena. We are also hoping to open an alternative channel on the other side of the bay, enabling us to become a feeder port. Not all ports will allow such wide ships, so we want to be a part of that opportunity. The Chamber of Commerce is providing technical support for the Canal del Dique, which will improve communications between the Magdalena River and the Bay of Cartagena. We would then be able to transport freight within Colombia by barge through the Canal del Dique. This is an example of a project designed to make Cartagena more appealing to investors.</p><div class="quote">“We are opening doors wherever we can."</div><h4>What specific sectors are you trying to support by attracting investors?</h4><p>In the two years of Invest in Cartagena, we have appealed to specific clusters. The first is the petrochemical industry; we have a large refinery set to start operations next year. We have already attracted companies here in the plastics business, such as Grupo Fenix. The second cluster is tourism. We support hotels, and over the past five years, we have added more than 16,000 new hotel rooms in Cartagena. We have welcomed high-end hotel chains such as Holiday Inn, InterContinental, Hilton, and Sheraton. Recently we received the international president of Viceroy, which is going to build Colombia's first six-star hotel. Four Seasons is also coming to Cartagena. We are also trying to ensure that Cartagena becomes a cultural hub of the Caribbean. We now have Art Cartagena, which brought with it many artistic and cultural programs. In January of 2015 we will also host our ninth classical musical festival. There is also the Biennial de Arte, mirroring those of New York and Sao Paolo, and for two months, the city was entirely given over to art. We also host the Hay Festival, and our cultural section promotes all of these events. While Cartagena is the main touristic city of Colombia, we had lacked an Expo center, and so a year ago, in association with the office of the major, we decided to identify a potential location. IDOM provided a study with different locations in three areas of the city and we have selected one. We hope to open the center within two and a half years. It will cover an area of 20 hectares, located north of the city in a free trade zone. We are currently holding a competition for the design project, which we hope to approve by June 2015.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Cartagena's trade relations and what role will the Chamber of Commerce play in this?</h4><p>We are opening doors wherever we can, and especially with our trade partners. We are also signing agreements with other chambers of commerce. For example, in 2014, we signed more than 10 agreements with other chambers, such as Madrid, Barcelona, Mexico City, and the US, to usher in investors. We are the owners of the World Trade Center of Cartagena de Indias, and collaborate with over similar organizations worldwide, attending events, attracting investment, and sending our members abroad to fact find, recently sending a mission to Korea. A leaning toward innovation is key to such activities. Our members can confirm that over the past three years, we have increased our services and budgets by over 153%. Meanwhile, the number of entrepreneurs in the Chamber of Commerce has increased by over 54%. This gives you a good idea of how our economy is moving, and how Cartagena has the second or third-lowest rate of unemployment in the country. The entrepreneurial future of Cartagena is healthy and will continue to improve. Some months ago, we launched a think tank within the Chamber of Commerce including people from a diversity of sectors. We sat down with the regional representatives in congress as well as members of the city council, as we all have to work together. This is what I mean by innovation; we are getting everyone at the same table to help us construct a better future for the city.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Santo Domingo is the country's primary economic engine, and the city with the lowest unemployment rate, as well as the lowest level of poverty and disease in the entire country. What is the contribution of its business community to the overall development of the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The city of Santo Domingo is the key economic center of the Dominican Republic. Currently in our country, there are around 950,000 companies, of which more than 600,000 were registered in the city of Santo Domingo; this means that more than 60% of the formal enterprises of our country are currently operating here. The largest trading houses as well as the largest financial centers in the country are located in the city of Santo Domingo. This is the reason why the business community of this city produces the most significant contributions to the development of the entire Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How significant is the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production (CCPSD) within the Dominican Republic's economy?</h4><p>The CCPSD maintains a strong influence in strengthening and promoting the economic activities within the city of Santo Domingo, but with an important impact on the entire economy. Some examples of important contributions throughout the history to the economy of the Dominican Republic, carried out in order to boost and promote the business sector, include: managing the construction of irrigation infrastructure, highways and roads with the government; engaging in a continuous search for alternatives that encouraged the commercial industry; and creating other agencies and institutions that support the strengthening of the various stakeholders and sectors of commercial interest. Some of these stakeholders include: The National Council of Private Businesses (CONEP), The Association of Industrialists of the Dominican Republic (AIRD), The Stock Market of the Dominican Republic, The University Action Pro Education and Culture (APEC), the Council of Conciliation and Arbitration, among many others.</p><div class="quote">“The behavior of trade, and in particular exports, is obviously influenced by the conditions of foreign demand."</div><h4>Currently, 97% of the Dominican Republic's enterprises are MSMEs, which generate more than 2 million jobs and account for 30% of the country's GDP. How does the Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production support the MSME sector?</h4><p>According to the FondoMicro 2013 survey, there were 791,236 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in total. These companies employ a total of 2.2 million people, which represents 46.2 % of the economically active population of the country and 54.4 % of the total employment in the economy. The CCPSD has undertaken several initiatives to support the business development of SMES, such as managing and promoting the participation of entrepreneurs to international trade fairs and trade missions, providing courses and workshops, promoting discussions that enable the commercial sector to keep up with market reality, offering business consulting services, and fostering new business opportunities for the business sector of the country, particularly for SMEs.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of exports and companies applying for membership in 2014?</h4><p>The behavior of trade, and in particular exports, is obviously influenced by the conditions of foreign demand, which is to say changes in trade patterns have to be linked with the environment in foreign trade. The success or failure in some sectors will depend on the conditions of change in international market. For the year 2014, it is projected that Dominican exports of mining products will be reactivated with operations in ferronickel, gross gold, and copper, and can reach between $2 billion and $2.5 billion. We must also emphasize the weight of the Haitian market, which represents more than $1.3 billion. Exports of medical products and electrical devices are also significant and could represent an estimated $1.2 billion in both categories. On the same note, agricultural and agro-industrial production contribute and will continue to make great contributions to Dominican exports. The major international clients for Dominican exports are the US (56% of exports), Haiti (14%), the EU (7%), China (5%), Guatemala (2%), the Netherlands (1.7%), Honduras (1.6 %), and South Korea (1.3%). These countries represent about 85% of Dominican exports and we understand that this scenario will not endure significant changes at the end of this year. With regards to the membership of companies in the CCPSD, it is important to point out that for the end of 2014, those companies registered and incorporated in the city of Santo Domingo exceed 8,500 new ventures.</p><h4>The Chamber has recently signed an agreement with the Chamber of Qatar. What are the main highlights of this partnership and how will Dominican companies benefit from it?</h4><p>We can identify and highlight two major points of relevance of this macro agreement signed between the parties, which are to promote the development and diversification of trade and economic cooperation to benefit entrepreneurs in both countries, and to facilitate, according to the laws of each country, actions that promote trade and economic cooperation. With the signing of this agreement the CCPSD seeks to identify new opportunities for the Dominican business sector with export potential and engage in the joint promotion of activities that foster the creation of businesses, promoting the exchange of information concerning the conditions of production, incentives, and facilities of doing business between both countries and exchange information of an economic and legislative nature. We will also participate at fairs and exhibitions both in Qatar and in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>What other achievements has the Chamber registered in 2014 and what are its main objectives for 2015?</h4><p>2014 has been a year of great transformations, in which we have achieved important goals for the sake of encouraging the production and the development of business, not only in the city of Santo Domingo, but also throughout the Dominican Republic. To point out some of our main achievements: We celebrated the event "Doing Business with Florida," which was primarily to increase the business relationships between the Dominican Republic and the State of Florida. The CCPSD signed several agreements and letters of collaboration; one example is the agreement with the State of Qatar, as well as with the Chambers of Portugal, with the objective of connecting even more Dominican entrepreneurs with businessmen at a global level. We also signed a letter of collaboration with the Trade Facilitation Office of Canada (TFO). We supported trade missions and delegations, namely Dominican companies abroad and foreign visitors to the Dominican Republic, such as the China-Taiwan Mission. We offered solutions to disputes; in this current year, we have further strengthened the Dispute Resolution Center (CRC). We welcomed the Latin American Conference on Arbitration, with the participation of more than 145 people from all parts of the world. Recently, we completed the training session for judges of the Dispute Resolution Center, which seeks to increase the number of judges available for business cases. Moreover, there were more than 13 training sessions aimed at the development and improvement of SMEs. We provided consulting services to more than 20 international companies willing to invest and to do business with the Dominican Republic. We also managed the integration of seven chambers of commerce in the use of the one-stop shop system for the registration of a company. For 2015, we are destined and focused on continuing to promote trade and production through the different mechanisms we operate. We intend to have a greater representation in the national and international media, to disseminate the conditions and opportunities that can be used to enhance businesses around the country and in international markets. We have planned events and projects, in addition to continuously supporting the local and international entrepreneurs that decide to set up or do business in, or with, the Dominican Republic. We want to increase support for SMEs, which should further drive broader economic development. We will also develop other initiatives that enable us to fulfill the role that by law we have been mandated with.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the overall business environment in the Dominican Republic and where in particular can new reforms be implemented to facilitate economic growth?</h4><p>The business climate in the Dominican Republic today presents great opportunities for the development of business projects, as well as major challenges to overcome, providing our country with resources that are essential attractions for the successful performance of businesses. We have a stable economic and political system, which is evident through the substantial economic progress we have achieved in recent years, as well as the reflection of the growth of our economy annually. We have a regulatory system that clarifies the situation of businesses and avoids international disputes. We have five trade agreements in place that allow us to reduce and, in some cases eliminate, the tariff barriers imposed by many countries. Our telecommunications system facilitates seamless communication between Dominican businesses and international markets, and we enjoy excellent natural conditions and geographic positioning. We also have a corporate body capable of managing large businesses and partnerships that foster wider integration of foreign businessmen in the Dominican economy. In short, there are many factors that show the favorable environment for doing business in the Dominican Republic. However, as mentioned earlier, there are challenges requiring structural reforms, among which we can identify the national electricity system, where a model is required enabling a cost of electricity more conducive to business and trade. The good news is that the government has convened a process, by decree 389-14, whereby all social and institutional players in the electricity sector discuss, draft, and sign a national pact for the reform of the electricity sector. This process is intended to reach out to a large national consensus on a new model for the generation, transmission, distribution, and marketing of electric energy, which would allow citizens to have a quality energy service at a lower cost, be more stable, and that would not represent a tax burden for the government. We must also overcome the national and international monopolies and oligopolies in force concerning transportation of cargo. We should also seek to reorient credit toward the productive sectors, to balance private consumption with industrial production, commerce, and the offer of services. We should also support, with consistent and realistic public measures, the formalization and expansion of SMEs, and the establishment of a specific tax regime for that economic component. We also need a comprehensive reform of the Labor Code. Meanwhile, we should also achieve an efficient monetary policy that allows a precise assessment of the Dominican currency against international currencies. Furthermore, we should finalize the restructuring of national representations abroad through embassies and consular corps, to best advocate the national brand and products abroad. Finally, we should adopt the draft Law on Customs, and modify the law to facilitate profit reinvestment in the innovation of the industrial park and adjust the legal frameworks of the national industry and of the free zones. These reforms are not to be worked on solely by the State, as it would not be possible for our country to reap available benefits and opportunities without the significant contributions and full integration of the private sector.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[new-ways]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can companies entering Turkey expect from GP Trust, your own marketing and financial advisory company?</h4><p>I have accumulated extensive knowledge in finance, which I find quite interesting because, after working for years at financial institutions, you get an overall picture of the Turkish economy and you can analyze companies and sectors with a critical eye because you have to assume a certain risk. Therefore, I believe these companies can benefit from this accumulated knowledge and hopefully I can give them advice in the right direction. The size of the companies my team and I have been advising are relatively small in scale and they want to move into Turkey with baby steps to begin with. There is a market research element and the aim is then to try to find them Turkish partners here that they would like to do business with.</p><h4>How do you assess the current level of education in Turkey in creating global entrepreneurs?</h4><p>That was one thing during my social responsibility years that I spent a lot of time on. Unfortunately, I believe the Turkish education system is not sufficient at preparing young people to become the sort of entrepreneurs that we want in today's world. I say this because, since I graduated, the system hasn't changed and has become archaic. I would like to see young people develop their creative thinking and place a lot of importance to innovation. Members of the private sector would like to tailor those youngsters to their needs but, unfortunately, the academic world and the business world are too far apart from one another. We always say we should look at European countries, such as Germany and Austria, for examples. The vocational school system is a good one, but it is still not sufficient enough to educate youngsters to become the type of entrepreneurs we would like to see. The practice and on-the-job-training is of utmost importance and skilled workers are what we need. In order to bring in the culture, we have tried to implement several things. One program that we started involved entrepreneurship competitions in schools to motivate people to come up with new ideas and to sell those ideas. We went to several universities in Anatolia to talk to them about how they don't have to be a salary-based employee after graduation. One good thing is that for the last 10 years we have been talking about entrepreneurship and the lack of education on this matter and, today, institutions are beginning to become aware of the issue. I believe Turkey has come a long way in that respect. The government is also thinking about it, and a lot of institutions are addressing it. İÅžKUR came up with several programs giving tax incentives to those corporates employing young people graduated from vocational schools. Borsa Istanbul (BIST) is setting up new markets and arrangements to bring entrepreneurs and investors together. And so things are moving forward and this is a very good development.</p><div class="quote">“There are 12 million women who are not part of the economy, which is an important issue."</div><h4>What can be done at the moment to increase the role of women in business and develop their entrepreneurial skills?</h4><p>There are 12 million women who are not part of the economy, which is an important issue. There is a lot of responsibility placed on women to get married and have babies. However, I believe entrepreneurship for women is extremely important for this country. A model needs to be found that can support those that are hungry to start their own businesses in a financial way. There are currently certain institutions that provide microcredits, and there is a lot of promise; however, it is not sufficient. This is one area in Turkey that we should really focus on; bringing these women into the economy somehow and developing them as small entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What can be done to help SMEs become MNEs?</h4><p>SMEs are the backbone of the economy and they require the right structure to adapt to a more global platform. This can involve new innovations and R&amp;D. I also act as the Chairwoman for strategic network of a Venture Capital/Private Equity fund advised by European Investment Fund- EIF. We specifically target SMEs in the Istanbul Venture Capital Initiative (iVCi) fund. This is a fund that is structured by the European Investment Fund (EIF), the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization of Turkey (KOSGEB), the Technology Development Foundation of Turkey (TTGV), and quite a few others. Those are the three major institutions, though, and they put ‚¬160 million into this fund. The idea is to support technologically innovative SMEs to grow their businesses.</p><h4>In terms of business, how do you assess the importance of Turkey for Europe?</h4><p>It is of the utmost importance. Europe bore the brunt of a major portion of the global crisis in 2008. But, Europe still remains Turkey's major trading partner. In that regard, Europe is very important for Turkey and Turkey is important for Europe. Europe is a very important trade partner, but because of the slowdown in business, due to the global crisis, Turkey looked for alternative markets, which successfully helped it make up for a portion of the loss of trade with Europe. There are also solid examples of Turkish firms investing in Europe. Yıldız Holding recently invested in United Biscuits to the tune of $3.2 billion. Such a large investment makes Yıldız Holding one of the top biscuit makers in the whole world. Turkish investors are now investing in several major European brands, which shows that Turkey has come a long way. We used to look at how many investors were coming to Turkey, but we are now looking at Turkish brands investing abroad. The recent BBVA merger with Garanti Bank also shows that Turkey is at a true investment crossroads. All of this shows that Turkey is an important player globally, and these examples show that Turkey and Europe are very much acting together.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[scaling-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NFT began in Saudi Arabia in 1987 and moved to Abu Dhabi in 1994. What made you decide to set up here?</h4><p>We were doing a lot of business between Saudi and the Emirates. I moved to Saudi Arabia originally to see why everyone was going there to buy equipment. Today it is totally the opposite: Saudis come to Dubai and Abu Dhabi and buy from here. Currently, we ship a large amount of our equipment from here to Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, I decided to move our activities and headquarters from Saudi Arabia to the UAE because the facilities here make doing business much more efficient. Our parent company and head office are in Abu Dhabi. We have the port nearby and clearing a container takes just a few hours, whereas in Saudi Arabia it takes around 15 days, and sometimes three weeks with regulations and inspections. We started our company with 20 cranes and it was successful. Then we added another 20 cranes, then another 100. Today we have close to 1,400 cranes in operation all over the globe. Looking at the media and market situation I believe that we are the number one in our field, not only in the Emirates, but worldwide.</p><h4>Some 25 years ago, the main market for cranes in the Middle East was for used European cranes and it was based on sales rather than rentals. What made you start to get into the rental part of the business?</h4><p>When you have any type of recession or slow momentum in business activities, people are not keen to invest their money. That is where rentals come in. The rental business has developed worldwide over the past 20 years. No one is buying assets today. As a dealer for the French company Potain (now Manitowoc after being bought by American interests), we realized that people do not want to buy cranes because of market instability. The shift into the rental market was a good move for us. We are very active in Saudi Arabia as well as in the entire GCC area, in the crane rental business, and have completed the largest project in the world by number of tower cranes at Princess Nora University, where we had around 150 of our cranes on one job site. This is the model we want to continue with, and it is not a matter of renting one crane or two; we think about what equipment and services we can provide for mega projects from logistics to operations. Recently we have started a new job on the third Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul. This is a huge enterprise. We won this important job, providing exceptional cranes with a 45 ton lifting capacity at a 320-meter height for 29 months. We always like a challenge and we like new ideas, and we invest in long-term business to build up complete confidence with our customers.</p><div class="quote">“The plan is to diversify our network and our equipment and eventually to launch an IPO in the future."</div><h4>Where do you see the most activity in the markets in which you operate?</h4><p>With our company based in the UAE, 2006 to 2008 were the best years for us. But from 2009 until today it's Saudi Arabia. Qatar is starting up now because of a few infrastructure projects, such as bridges, metros, and the stadium. We have no borders when it comes to business. Recently we rented some cranes in Uzbekistan and in Azerbaijan and for the A Stadium in Lyon, France as well as the viaduct in Spain. Locally, we have 45 cranes operating at a nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi. We are negotiating a project in Egypt and in Africa, plus some in Mozambique, Réunion, and the Seychelles. We are also working on the Expo 2017 in Kazakhstan. In total, we are currently operating in 32 countries and our plan is to be in more countries in 2015, moving our business model from the UAE to the world.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about the projects happening locally?</h4><p>NFT supplies cranes to the Louvre Museum project on Saadiyat Island; we have around 14 to 15 cranes on that site. We also have some important projects in downtown Dubai and a lot of prospects on other projects leading up to Expo 2020, where we are still waiting for the tenders to come out, plus the new airport, and also some military projects.</p><h4>How does your extensive network give you an edge in your business?</h4><p>When we supplied cranes to build the new ADNOC headquarters in Abu Dhabi, which was 400 meters high with a major lifting capacity, we were the only company that could supply the full turnkey job at that scale at the time. We bought three special brand new luffing jib cranes and five special hoists for the project, and after we finished we moved our equipment to Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong. This is the beauty of our business when you have a big market network.  You finish a project and you move the same equipment to another place and country. If I have an enquiry from the Far East or Europe I can send the equipment there. We can load one crane per day. In Europe they need three or four days to load one crane. The key to success in our business is knowing how to move the equipment quickly and correctly.</p><h4>What are some developments in construction project efficiency?</h4><p>Nobody today likes to use old-fashioned equipment. We use a high-speed hoisting winch when we have high-rise equipment, such as for building the 450-meter towers at Marina 101 in Dubai and also the tower in central market in Abu Dhabi. You cannot work at that scale with a traditional crane. You have to go for a high-speed winch and big lifting capacity, with less manpower. This means we have to keep investing in new technology and new assets. We have an engineering department in charge of any special application cranes plus marketing, and we are in daily contact with the manufacturer to share ideas. We work with them to build new cranes to suit the new requirements in the market. We have a technical department that develops the ideas and everything in-house, and then we share that with our manufacturing supplier to come up with the best lifting solutions for any project.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for investors coming here to the UAE interested in the construction market?</h4><p>First of all, the beauty of this country is the facilities. There are also no visa issues. In other countries, you face serious visa problems, especially in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, so you cannot move people easily. Here we have enough people and manpower to answer any technical issues. The infrastructure of the country here is well ahead of any other country. If we bring a crane from Europe or anywhere else, we are able to clear it through the port on the same day. Plus, we do not need to pay a double tax if we decide to move the same cargo within GCC countries. This helps us to be very competitive in the market and in the region.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook and how are you investing for the future?</h4><p>We continue to invest in people and in cranes. We also want to diversify geographically and open new markets, finding the best opportunity for business. Myanmar is a new area with significant potential—I have a team working on that—in addition to Indonesia and Malaysia as well. The plan is to diversify our network and our equipment and eventually to launch an IPO in the future. We have set up a three-year timeline to achieve this.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[liquid-assets]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Liquid was established in 2011. What has been the company's performance since its inception?<br></h4><p>Our performance has been very good, despite market competition. We have grown annual our turnover about five times from inception in 2011, and we are focusing higher turnovers in the coming years.</p><h4>What have been the main drivers of the company's rapid growth?</h4><p>There are a number of factors, but I think the main one is that we brought in new dimensions to the provision of communication capacity. The stability of our network, redundancy, and dedicated workforce coupled with efficient delivery of services are the main drivers.</p><h4>The plan was to build 2,500 kilometers of backbone network. At what stage is this project right now?</h4><p>So far in Zambia we have rolled out 683 kilometers of backbone fiber, and then in the Copperbelt we have about 520 kilometers of Optical Ground Wire (OPGW), through Copperbelt Energy Corporation the other joint venture Company with Liquid Telecom. Now we are in the process of rolling out another 560 kilometers to bring the total in excess of 1,700 kilometers on our Zambian network. Besides the backbone fiber, we have also installed 2,400 kilometers of last-mile fiber to provide access network to the Zambian business institutions and we are already in the process of rolling out additional kilometers of access network fiber through the implementation of a fiber to the home (FTTH) project, through which we will provide GPON services to the mass market through our resellers.</p><h4>And how has this network improved the efficiency of businesses in Zambia?</h4><p>Fiber optics and the internet have changed people's lives, especially in Africa. A few decades ago it was not easy to communicate with our families and friends living in villages, but now through the built communication networks we are able to communicate with relatives in far-flung areas where communications were previously unimaginable. But behind the scene is the high capacity that comes from the fiber network that provides mobile backhaul to base stations and other business nodes. As CEC Liquid Telecom, when we started we only had one fiber cable connecting to the marine cable through Chirundu, and obviously it was a challenge to provide a stable service, especially when the route to the south was affected. It meant disrupting services for longer periods. Nevertheless, since 2011 we have rolled out multiple cables to the south through Kariba Dam and Victoria Falls, which are the other two links through Zimbabwe. We have grown our network to the north through third-party fiber networks.</p><h4>What role does Zambia represent in your global portfolio, because of its location it is key gateway for South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, DRC, Kenya, and Tanzania?</h4><p>Zambia is strategically located by virtue of its central location in sub-Saharan Africa; it has the potential to become what we can call a nerve center of communication for the region. As a company, we look at providing the infrastructure that actually makes Zambia the heart of regional communications. Zambia is already surrounded by eight neighboring countries, and if you look at the region, there is no other country with as many neighbors, and therefore it is strategically located to provide that kind of connectivity.</p><h4>The long-haul optical networks require an amplifier every 100 kilometers, but in Africa sometimes the distance between cities is greater than 400 kilometers. How are you coping with this issue?</h4><p>Of course that is a challenge, and anyone who is rolling out infrastructure in Africa has to be aware of this challenge. However, there are mechanisms to overcome this challenge. For example, we can use solar power to power up the repeaters. Where we have amplification stations along the route grid power become a constraint, solar energy performs the task.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role is the government playing in improving the infrastructure in the country to keep up with Zambia's exceptional growth over the last few years?</h4><p>In order to have proper and sustainable growth, we have looked at various infrastructure projects. We believe that transport is crucial for growth, because without it there will be no sustainable growth. The government has ensured that we execute some of the important projects that will become the economy's backbone in the future. One such project that we came up with was to ensure that the movement of goods and services is improved. To do this, we thought we should improve connectivity in the country, and also connect the country to the outside. We are taught that being landlocked is a disadvantage; however, we are trying to use that position to our advantage by trying to become a land-linked nation, establishing Zambia as a hub for Central and Southern Africa. We believe our position is strategic, because if people want to go to Malawi they have to cross our airspace or our land. The Link Zambia 8000 project will create about 8,023 kilometers of roads across the country. If these are constructed, it will translate into at least three major roads per province. Some will be constructed, while others will be rehabilitated. We want to look at the major roads, and see which will be helpful to us in connecting our country. The roads will link province to province, so that one will not have to pass through the capital every time. There is another project we call the Pave Zambia 2000. Instead of just looking at upgrading the road network, we are also looking at what we can do in the rural and residential areas of the country. Instead of us doing the terminus project, we use pavers. We use small bricks and then connect them to pavers. I have ordered some machinery in every province so that we can do 2,000 kilometers of paved road. We are also looking at improving the feeder road availability in the country, so that goods and services will be able to move more easily. If you look at the opposition, it is more expensive to do business in Zambia than in our neighboring countries. Because of the transit time of containers, transporting one here costs about three times what it would cost in Tanzania. We are looking at how to improve this connectivity. We are also going to create one-stop border posts to improve transit time. In addition, we want to see how best to utilize the bodies of water to which we have access. We are first looking at roads, and then we will go to the water to see how navigable the rivers are. The Kafue River is one of the longest rivers in Zambia, and we are considering developing it for transportation. We are also looking at trains as the cheapest way of transporting bulk and heavy goods. Finally, we have looked at opening up canal areas through dredging.</p><h4>What plans does your Ministry have to improve air transport?</h4><p>We operated our own national carrier for about 20 years, and it belonged to the government; however, we closed it to allow the private sector in. We want it to come back. It would be government owned, but we would privatize the logistics behind it. The government should sell shares to the private sector, so we can carry the flag but the private sector can run it, with a lot of shares owned by Zambians. This goes hand-in-hand with the goal of the government making Lusaka a hub for air travel. We have a major project at Kenneth Kaunda International Airport to revamp the facilities, which is worth almost $5 million. We have improved the international airport in Livingstone, and it is 97% complete. We will revamp all of the international airports, as we want to transform Zambia from being a mining country to being a tourist destination. I worked all of my life in the mines, but I believe that we need to transform the country from being overly reliant on that sector.</p><h4>What steps is the government taking to improve the Tazara railway?</h4><p>Tazara is a gift from the People's Republic of China. It came and partnered with Zambia at a time when our first republican president was in power in the 1970s. It funded the Tazara railway, which runs for about 1,008 kilometers. We transport most of our goods on it; however, there have been challenges in operating it. In order to make it more efficient, we need shareholders to look at the best that can be done. Both management and the board have been looking at ways to revamp the network. We want efficiency in all things to reduce losses, and to ensure that transit times are reduced. In business, the longer the goods stay in the system, the more expensive they are. We want to improve the rate of turnover. Fast movement means one day going to electric trains. But for that, we need investment in the energy sector, and to develop our hydroelectricity potential and capitalize on our natural resources.</p><h4>In your role as Minister of Communications, what is the government doing to improve the telecommunications infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>Since our country is a full 750,619 square kilometers in area, network coverage is a challenging area. We have decided to encourage investment, and aim to raise 169 communications towers. That project should be finished by the end of October 2014. Mobile phones today are not just for communication, as there is mobile money and internet to be considered. We are trying to change as a country. We are coming up with an e-government project which will aim to ease communication. We will develop e-learning, e-medicine, and e-buying. We are also trying to improve facilities and ensuring that we set up a databank where everyone can be taught how to enter their data into this system. This way they can just punch in an ID number at the hospital and their data will be there.</p><h4>Where do you see the transport and communications sector within a decade?</h4><p>When it comes to communications and IT, there will be no sustainable development unless we utilize technology, science, and innovation. This is important for any developing country. We need to do away with paper, and we need a paperless parliament. We need to ensure that we use the current technologies to improve the country, and for that we need to embrace IT. That is why it will be easy for us to achieve what we want. The transport sector is also key to sustainable development. We aim for the availability of a better transportation network that is cost effective and easy to operate, as the traffic situation at present is terrible. We want to complete ring roads around Lusaka within the next two years, and are also working on a commuter train. It will cut down on transit time and people will not need to drive vehicles.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Proflight currently stand in terms of fleet and passenger numbers?<br></h4><p>We are currently operating eight aircraft. Our largest is the Jetstream 41, which has 29 seats and we operate three of these aircraft. We have four Jetstream 3200s, which have 18 seats, and one 12-seater Cessna Grand Caravan that we use specifically for places you cannot reach with other aircraft, such as locations with dirt runways. In 2013, we carried 135,000 passengers, and we expect to do about 145,000 or thereabouts in 2014. We serve both the tourist and business sectors. When we started, our routes were primarily tourism-related, flying people to national parks. Today our backbone is business travel, particularly in the mining sector.</p><h4>What drove this shift from tourism to business travel?</h4><p>The challenge of the Zambian tourist industry is its seasonality. For example, in 2013 on our Mfuwe route we carried 80 passengers on our worst week and 850 on our best. That is a massive cycle and this is a capital-intensive industry; our machines need to work all-year round. Hence we started to look to the Copperbelt, although it was difficult to break into that market. Fortunately, a lot of growth has happened there in the last 10 years. We started out with a small nine-seater, and we have seen significant growth since then, especially on the Solwezi route thanks to rapid development in the mining sector there.</p><h4>What made it hard to break into the Copperbelt routes?</h4><p>There were two incumbent operators on that route. Zambian Airways had been around for quite a long time and was fairly entrenched, and then there was a smaller company called Airwaves. Businesspeople generally find reliability to be the most important factor; they tend to be less price sensitive than leisure travelers. They want to know that their plane will arrive and take off on time. During this first phrase when you are proving this, you are not carrying enough people and are probably losing money.</p><h4>In terms of passenger numbers, what are your most popular routes?</h4><p>Ndola in the Copperbelt would be around 60,000, so almost half. Last year was a good year for Livingston due to its hosting of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) meeting. I believe it saw around 50,000 passengers. The remaining share is made up of our service to the provincial capitals such as Mansa, Kasama, Chipata, and Solwezi.</p><h4>You recently signed an interline agreement with Emirates Airlines. How does this fit within your growth strategy?</h4><p>The strategy is to give us a competitive advantage. We have been fortunate to have a three-year period without any competitors in the domestic market. It is a tiny market, but it has been positive for us to have this time to consolidate our position. Nevertheless, because it is a small market we have to serve it with relatively small aircraft, because businesspeople like frequency; we need to have two to three flights a day. So with that comes some inefficiency because your seat costs are considerably higher than with a larger aircraft. We look at this interline as a way to build some loyalty, and any new entrant will have to get to that stage. We currently have agreements with Kenya Airways, Emirates Airlines, and Ethiopian Airlines. The idea is that a customer would prefer to buy one ticket rather than two, hence one of our strategies is to enter into alliances with all the major carriers in the region. We don't have an agreement with South African Airways, although we have had some discussions with them. We also don't have an agreement for code share; we understand this takes time. Most of the big airlines will not go into a code share unless you are fully compliant with International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The profit after taxes of Lafarge Zambia has doubled from 2010 to 2013. What has been behind your growth story?</h4><p>What has happened is that essentially, we have been able to increase production. We have increased production by over 50%. We had an entirely new cement plant commissioned in 2008, and we've kept improving the performance of that plant since then. As well, we have another plant in the Copperbelt near the DRC border. It's an older plant, but we have been able to improve the reliability and the performance there, and that has really enabled us to bring more cement to the market and follow the demand for cement, which is strong.</p><h4>What is most influencing the demand for cement in Zambia?</h4><p>Clearly, the road projects have been a key driver of growth in the last few years. A country like Zambia needs to upgrade its level of infrastructure because its potential to grow is very much linked to the logistical connections with all the neighboring countries, and there are many of them, which means many opportunities to export. Infrastructure is absolutely key. Road building is going on at a very quick pace. In the coming years, rail will also become a very important segment. You've got the infrastructure, which in the last two years has probably been the fastest pace-setter in the economy. You also have a high growth rate in the commercial sector. There are many new shopping centers popping up around Lusaka. There was a real lack of them before. It's not just Lusaka. You see the same in Ndola and other cities. Those cities are transforming themselves. This is all encouraging and very much in line with our ambitions to build better cities.</p><h4>How much of your production do you export abroad?</h4><p>We are currently exporting, on average over the last four years, around 20% of our production. We could export more. In the coming years it is quite clear that we will be exporting more to countries like Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and the DRC, which is currently our second-largest market. We've been constrained by our capacity because the domestic market has grown so fast. Our priority had to be to supply the domestic market first. The construction market here in Zambia and in a lot of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa is highly seasonally, so the demand in October is two or three times the level that you would see in January or February. That's really the challenge for a company that doesn't have infinitely scalable production capacity to adapt and follow the market as much as possible and supply the market in all months of the year.</p><h4>One of the characteristics of Lafarge is that it is a very innovative company. How does your plant in Zambia enable you to innovate to supply the market?</h4><p>Innovation is first and foremost a human thing more than an industrial one. There is no innovation without technical skills. We've invested a lot into training new talents and making sure that we have a strong technical and marketing team here in Zambia. We started early on in our history here, which means that today we have a really great pipeline and some of the best talents, to such an extent that we recently inaugurated our concrete lab. There are companies and institutions, like the Road Development Agency (RDA), coming to us to ask for advice or to do testing. It shows that we have gained real credibility and that we have the people in place to push innovation. We have one major strength as an international group, which is that we can leverage innovation that has already worked in other countries. For example, we are pushing new products. We just launched a product for road stabilization called “RoadCem" and a project for interior plasticizers called “WallCrete." That would not have been possible without our central lab. You've got this combination, and obviously we go with innovations that make sense for us. There is a very wide range of possibilities, and we have to choose what is particularly relevant to Zambia.</p><h4>How does Large Zambia fit into the company's overall strategy?</h4><p>Lafarge is present in over 60 countries. Zambia used to be a mid-sized country in the Lafarge portfolio, which was doing well. I think the perspective has changed in the last few years. Zambia and other sub-Saharan countries have become the key focus for the growth of Lafarge, and, therefore, we have changed gears completely. In fact, we are at a crossroads. We have been successful here. We are now the highest market cap on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE), and are now moving to a new dimension to become a hub for the region. We are going to more than double the capacity of our cement plant here. We are going to add a second line, which is going to be larger than the 2008 one. We are also expanding the capacity of our plant in Ndola. The face of Lafarge Zambia in five years is going to be very different than it is today. If you had bought ZMW1,000 of Lafarge shares in 1995, you would today have a portfolio of ZMW375,000, not counting the dividends.</p><h4>The slogan of Lafarge in Zambia is “Building Better Cities." How are you building better, sustainable cities in Zambia?</h4><p>That's very important for us. It really drives the way we are transforming ourselves from a strategic viewpoint, moving from supplying construction materials, to participating in the construction of better cities. That means, in Lusaka, we work with the government and the planning authorities on projects as diverse as landfills and waste collection, because we can burn some of the waste in our kilns and there is a real issue in the collection of domestic waste. We are also working on concrete roads, as opposed to tar roads, which have issues and need to be redone quickly. We work on the entire lifecycle of the road, and we also work on mass affordable housing. There is an issue now that didn't exist a few years ago around land. Many Zambians don't have access to land at all because they don't have the capital. There is a major housing deficit here. It's difficult to put a number on it, but several million houses need to be built so people can live in a decent home. Because the interest rates are so high, if you take out a mortgage here in Zambia your interest rate is 20%-25%. In Europe, these are in the order of 2%-3%. This is a real issue. We have to find a way to reduce the cost of housing. We don't have an influence on the level of interest rates, but we can influence the cost of housing and construction. That is where we are also working with other countries. We have worked in Nigeria on the technical solutions that we can bring. There are examples there of technical solutions that reduce costs and improve the quality of housing from many points of view , including in environmental terms. We have numerous corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. For example, we have a housing program for employees that is giving them the opportunity to have access to a good, solid home that they can keep for their family. This is not a small program. There is a first phase of 450 houses and a second phase of 600 houses, and it's just the pilot for something that can be a lot broader as part of a mass affordable housing program. We also work on micro credit and microfinancing. We have partnerships with several banks and insurance companies to give access to funding to relatively low-level incomes.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Lafarge in Zambia for the medium term?</h4><p>The outlook is positive. The fact that we are investing so heavily bears witness to that. We are very confident that this market will continue to grow, as will the other markets we are serving, like the DRC. We have a young and vibrant population with also a high level of growth. The challenge for us really is to be able to serve this country, to manage this organization in a way that makes the people that live in those cities satisfied. The growth is absolutely incredible. So we really have a role to play there and it is a fantastic opportunity for us to be a part of that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the contribution of the agriculture sector to Zambia's GDP over the past few years?</h4><p>Agriculture in Zambia contributes between 18% and 20% of Zambia's GDP on an annual basis. Our aim right now is to increase that contribution, because traditionally Zambia is predominately a copper mining country. Since independence, copper mining has been our main source of foreign currency revenue. This is against the background that, in Zambia, we have excellent potential to develop agriculture. We have a lot of water, good soil, good climate, and a lot of arable space. We have 752,000 square kilometers of land and a population of over 13 million people. What this translates to is agricultural potential. The tragedy is that we are grossly underutilizing that potential. We are only using about 15% of what we could, meaning that there is huge potential for agriculture that is going untapped. The government has been telling people that we want to shift our dependence away from mining to other sectors so as to push up our economy. One of the sectors we have identified is agriculture, especially given the potential it shows. This is now what we are trying to do as a country, and as a government. We want agriculture to contribute more than its current 18%-20% to GDP. Let agriculture be the sector that will drive the country forward and move the economy ahead. Our vision is to make Zambia the food basket of the southern Africa region and beyond.</p><h4>Only 15% of the land is being used, but 50% is arable. How are you trying to close this gap?</h4><p>Right now, there are two ways we intend to close the gap between what we are currently using of the country's potential and where we should be. Either we can increase our hectarage or increase our productivity. Currently, we are in a hurry to increase our potential. Increasing the hectarage will require a lot of investment to clear land and build infrastructure. Hence, we thought about the quickest way. The answer was to look at productivity. Our productivity in agriculture is on the low side. For example, maize is our main crop. The majority of our farmers, who tend to be small- to medium-scale, achieve production of 2 tons-3 tons per hectare. Those that are doing it properly should be getting around 10 tons a hectare. So, already we realize that if given the same piece of land, we could get more from it initially through improved productivity. We want at least 5 tons per hectare in terms of maize, and it's the same story for other crops. We want to look at the issues of fertilizers, seed, and technology application. There is a lot of research in agriculture now, and we want to tap into the results of that research and transfer it to our farmers through outreach workers. Through them, research results can get to our farmers so that they can increase their yields. We want to see if we can make some form of mechanization available to our farmers so that they can increase their yield and productivity. Finally, we are looking at irrigation as most of our farming is rain-fed. We have one rainy season per year that goes from around November-December to about March-April. We have a lot of water in Zambia. If we could get the right irrigation in place, we could double our output. Through investment we could grow two crops a year, which would make for a significant increase in output. Those are the areas we are looking at in the short term to immediately boost our agricultural output and production. However, in the long term, we are looking at making the vast land we have available for agriculture.</p><h4>How do you think that FDI can help Zambia move up the value chain?</h4><p>That is an important consideration. To add value, you first of all need capital, obviously. You need factories, technology, and people that know how to operate these systems. At present, those skills are not available in Zambia. This is the same in mining, where we are traditional in outlook. Most of our minerals and copper are exported without value adding because of the lack of capital. In farming, in particular, this is where the major opportunity lies for FDI to bring investors in from outside to come and set up facilities and plants, access their networks, and get the crops that we have now stored properly, and then add value. FDI is crucial in this area. In fact, that is the way forward. Obviously, as the government, that is what we are targeting. The potential exists out there, and we are openly inviting investors to come and invest in the area of value adding for agricultural products.</p><h4>What other crops are you most excited about?</h4><p>Rice is at the top of the list. There is currently a push to look for alternatives to maize, because maize is the staple crop. In fact, maize is the number one crop. When you look at the best alternative, rice comes out on top. We have good conditions for sweet potatoes, also, and are looking at cassava, as it grows quite well here. In terms of cash crops, there are basically three: tobacco, cotton, and coffee. Sugar cane is restricted to big industry, but for our people we are looking at tobacco, coffee, and cotton as potential cash crops. On the livestock side, we are encouraging the five main animals: cattle (our main animal, both for beef and for daily use), pigs, goats, sheep, and poultry. We are pushing these five meats to balance the population's diet, and they are doing very well.</p><h4>How will the development of more transport infrastructure help Zambia to become an agricultural exporter?</h4><p>One thing I've learned about agriculture is that it cannot stand on its own. For it to work well, develop, and contribute to GDP, you need to have infrastructure around it, especially roads. You need to have good roads, and that equals transport. If we can get a quality road system and transport to and from the farms, then the first major step is achieved. We are trying very hard to become the food basket for the southern Africa region and beyond, and exports are the way to go. To achieve that, we need rail linkages. There is an excellent rail system coming up now, and through its optimal use we can reach our ports. We have a few high-value crops like flowers, but those can be exported to Europe or North America via plane. That is where the airports fit into the picture. Without transport, forget agriculture. It's a hugely important issue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your revenues are up 16% in YoY terms. what have  been the main drivers of this growth?</h4><p>The key drivers have been strong economic fundamentals coupled with our technical expertise in sugar cane growing and sugar production, optimisation of factory throughput and sugar recoveries, continuous improvement initiatives across our business, effective market penetration strategies in both the domestic and export markets, investment in employees training, talent management and welfare and adherence to the Company's high safety and environmental management standards which ensures sustainability of our operations. Our vision is to be a diversified world-class, market leading business that contributes to economic growth and the prosperity of its shareholders, employees and communities.</p><h4>What strategies do you follow in order to achieve a sustainable growth?</h4><p>The company's strategic plan focuses on diversification through value addition to its sugar products as key to its continued sustainability. We also believe that the long term sustainability of our business depends on our being a good corporate citizen, operating in a responsible, accountable and transparent manner. Furthermore, the management of our costs through embedding a continuous improvement culture and programs across all our operations and activities is key to achieving sustainable growth.</p><h4>Around 90% of the energy that Illovo, a major shareholder in Zambia Sugar, uses to grow the crop is renewable. Is that the same for Zambia Sugar?</h4><p>Zambia Sugar is focused on adding value to every stick of cane. Sugar cane offers excellent opportunities and competitive advantages for the production of renewable energy sources compared to other agricultural crops.  The major element of the energy consumed within our operation is sourced from renewable resources. As a by product of sugar production, bagasse is used to fire our boilers for steam and power generation.</p><h4>What differentiates Zambia Sugar products from its competition?</h4><p>Zambia Sugar adheres to stringent and detailed standards with regard to its production processes and is thus able to produce quality sugar and downstream products that satisfy customer requirements in the domestic and export markets. Marketed under the well established Whitespoon brand, Zambia Sugar through its effective marketing and distribution strategies supports the nation by ensuring sugar is available country wide thus contributing positively to society. The company also prides itself on its focused customer service, reliability of supply and continuous investment in enhancing value in the supply chain. Furthermore our standards and practices in terms of health and safety are exemplary.</p><h4>What percentage of your products are consumed locally versus exported?</h4><p>The domestic market accounts for about 41% of total sales volumes while the export markets namely the EU and the Region accounts for the balance 59%.</p><h4>The government is improving the quality of the Railway system and adding more capacity, how will this impact your business?</h4><p>Improvements in road and rail infrastructure will have a positive impact on our business as this will enable the company to distribute its products more cost effectively.</p><h4>What is your outlook on Zambia Sugar in the next five to ten years?</h4><p>Zambia Sugar has been investing in operations, and positioning the company for sustained growth. Between 2007 and 2009, we made significant investments in expanding both agriculture and factory operations, doubling the capacity from around 200 000 tons of sugar to the current installed capacity of 440 000 tons. The process of optimising operations is ongoing and record sugar production of 404 000 was achieved in 2012. The focus in the coming years is to improve reliability and throughput of the factory, diversify our revenue base and ensure sustainability of our business. To this effect Zambia Sugar will be embarking on a second phase of the Nakambala expansion project from 2015. This second expansion phase will include the construction of a Refinery to meet the growing industrial sugar demand in both the domestic and export market and a distillery for potable and fuel Ethanol production.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Great Pyramid]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-great-pyramid]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of University Teaching Hospital (UTH) for Zambia's healthcare system?<br></h4><p>This is the biggest hospital in Zambia, with a 1,837 bed capacity and a staff complement of 3,126. It's a national welfare hospital, the target of which is to serve the entire country. Basically, the design of this hospital is at the top of the pyramid, meaning that patients are referred to it from other neighboring hospitals, district hospitals, provincial hospitals, and all the way down to the health post. All these facilities refer patients to this hospital for challenging complications that may afflict our citizens.</p><h4>What are the main challenges you face in running such a big institution?</h4><p>The size of the hospital means that people with challenging conditions have to come here, so public expectations are enormously high. Those with very complicated conditions, when they get a reference to this hospital, see hope that they are coming for treatment here. That means that among our challenges is that this is the last stop for patients coming from all corners of this country. Furthermore, the population of Lusaka alone has expanded over the years, with the immigration of people from rural to urban areas. This has seen the population of Lusaka expand rapidly in the past decades. This rapid expansion has actually overtaken the size of the hospital's expansion, which means the hospitals have the same number of beds even though the population of Lusaka has grown so rapidly. In order to cope with this challenge, we run our operating theatres 24 hours a day for emergencies. We perform on average close to 66 planned operations a day, and 65 to 70 deliveries over a 24-hour period in the maternity program. UTH is a very busy institution.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to fight HIV in Zambia?</h4><p>We are in a part of Africa that is still afflicted by communicable diseases including malaria, TB, and HIV. In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a fair share of HIV cases, and Zambia has not been spared. However, I am happy to say that our partners, including the Ministry of Health, have put in measures to try to minimize the impact. You can see that the epidemic has stabilized, meaning that we are not getting worse with regards to transmission rates. We've made a lot of progress in controlling malaria in Zambia, and I think that it is on an international platform standing to showcase how much our antimalarial drive has been successful. And we are very hopeful that in the coming years we can stand in international forums and show how much similar progress we have made in the fight against HIV. We are very thankful to numerous global funds and foreign aid agencies. We receive substantial funding and support from foreign aid agencies, and in collaboration with our Ministry of Health we get enormous support, which has made this treatment free of charge to our patients.</p><h4>What is the status of your efforts to fight malaria?</h4><p>Malaria until recently was the biggest public health concern, even before we started to think about HIV the way we do today, we look at two decades back. As we are born and growing up we just had to get infected with malaria, and that way was good because we obtained immunity that way. It was so common that it was the biggest killer at the time, and it was the most dreaded disease. Many lives were lost to malaria before these treatment programs were improved—a lot of our people succumbed to malaria. Not to mean that it has been completely eradicated, as we believe that it will be around for a few more years to come. It is an eradicable disease, and we are hoping that in the coming years we should be able to completely eradicate it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[someone-to-count-on]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have you taken to become one of the leading business schools in Zambia?<br></h4><p>The Zambia Centre for Accountancy Studies (ZCAS) was set up in 1989 under an Act of Parliament under the Ministry of Finance. Initially, it was created to provide training in accountancy because Zambia did not have a training institution for accountants. There was some low-level training; however, ZCAS was the first to offer a full professional accounting qualification. Before that anyone who wanted to obtain a professional accounting qualification needed to go to the UK. That was prohibatively expensive. Therefore, a group of accountants who had qualified began to lobby for the setting up of an educational institution in Zambia that would be more or less at the same level of quality and learning experience as those in the UK. This led to the creation of ZCAS with quality benchmarked at the level of that obtaining in the UK. We have grown from providing just professional training into academic programs, degree programs, and Master's level qualifications. We offer three accounting programs: ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), ZICA (Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants), and CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants). What makes ZCAS unique is that, although it was set up by state legislation and ought to be financed by the state, it has never received grant funding. ZCAS is a self-financing institution.</p><h4>Is ZICA the most popular program?</h4><p>Yes, countrywide there are about 15,000 students following the local qualification. At ZCAS we tend to attract more ACCA students as about 60% of the accountancy students are pursuing ACCA. The number of ZICA and CIMA students is almost equal; it fluctuates a bit from year to year. ZICA is the local accountancy qualification.</p><h4>What differentiates you from other institutions in terms of education?</h4><p>ZCAS wants to be considered a premium institution. It is trying to offer quality education pretty much as you would find if you went to the UK, for example. Our fees give you the idea that what you are going to get is quality. We are accredited by CIMA as a quality partner, and ZCAS is the only Gold-accredited institution with ZICA in Zambia. Further, ZCAS is one of six Platinum-approved learner partners with ACCA in Africa and the only one in Zambia. These accreditations arise from the high examination pass rates that ZCAS has achieved over the years. ZCAS students perform exceptionally well and consistently attain prize winner positions both locally and internationally.</p><h4>Has the growth of the finance sector attracted more students into this field?</h4><p>Indeed, that is one of the reasons for introducing a banking and finance program, to meet the demand. The program offers a number of courses and provides a certificate or a diploma. However, people who work full-time cannot attend the classes full time during the week. They want to hold onto their jobs and would rather come in the evenings. We have such an option, and we encourage people to use it.</p><h4>Do you offer graduate degree programs?</h4><p>Graduate programs are still a very small segment of our training, and we have only just started introducing them. We only have three graduate programs at the moment. These are an MBA, and an MA, both in international business, with the University of Greenwich, and a Master's of Science in information systems management also, in collaboration with the University of Greenwich. We do not have Master's programs in other business areas, as we are still developing those. The bulk of our students are either following our professional programs or the undergraduate programs.</p><h4>Which of your programs is the largest in terms of student numbers? And which has most potential for growth?</h4><p>At the moment it is accountancy, because we have three different programs. This accounts for 46% of the students. However, the number of students taking different courses is higher than the number of accountancy students. Roughly, about 54% would be non-accounting students as follows: 14% on degree programs and 40% on non-degree programs. Empirical evidence suggests that academic programs have the greatest potential for grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Winning Hearts And Mines]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[winning-hearts-and-mines]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role that the Chamber of Mines (CoM) has played since its establishment in 2000?</h4><p>We are there to balance the interests of the mining sector with the developmental needs of the government. We advocate in terms of policy, and make submissions to the government. In terms of the country's foreign exchange earnings, about 70% comes from the mining sector. We play a central role in terms of the economic development of this country. We are also managing the general perception of the public as to the contribution of the mining sector. That is a huge issue we are currently dealing with.</p><h4>What strategies do you follow to change that perception?</h4><p>We utilize education to get the public to understand what the sector is all about. People need to understand that it takes a long time for a mine to become profitable. We are trying to take people through the whole life cycle of a mine. Investors can drill and find nothing after they have spent millions of dollars. When an investor comes in, it is not a guarantee that they will make money. Mining is a seriously risky business. As the CoM is leading those discussions, the public is beginning to understand what the mining sector is about. We are trying to improve our data management, so we are revising our website so it can be a repository for mining sector information.</p><h4>What challenges do you face in terms of educating the population about the sector?</h4><p>Perception is a major challenge. There is a general perception that we are not open, and we are now having discussions with the general public through various forums. We are working together with the Ministry of Mines and the Zambia Revenue Authority to compile a template for production figures. That will be a good source of production data for all the minerals, so that there are no discrepancies in the figures/numbers reported.</p><h4>Since the late 1990s production in the mining sector has tripled. What have been the factors behind this growth?</h4><p>There is huge mineral potential in this country and policies at that time were conducive to investment. The government in the 1990s had entered into development agreements with various companies to provide incentives for investment. These development agreements are no longer in force. We now have the mines regulated by the Mines and Minerals Development Act, which has put policies in place that are conducive to investment. We are seeing now that the investment that came in the last decade or so has come to fruition. Within the coming decade we are looking to produce 1.5 million tons of copper per annum. In order to achieve that, there has to be continued stability in the policy environment.</p><h4>How has mining supported the growth of the Zambian economy?</h4><p>Growth in the mining sector has increased employment, and in the same way, reduced poverty. There are supporting industries that have developed because of the mining sector, so trading has increased. Infrastructure has improved. We have a lot of locals who are supplying goods and services to the mining sector. Social services such as schools, hospitals, and clinics have been built in mining communities leading to better health and education for the locals.</p><h4>How will the infrastructure that the government is building help the mining industry?</h4><p>Obviously it will help a great deal. The infrastructure was not good 10 to 15 years ago. Good transport infrastructure makes it easier and cheaper to do business. The government has done a great deal in terms of infrastructure development to support the mining sector, and there is a huge drive to increase energy production. The number of substations and power stations that have been opened up by now will hopefully be able to support the sector. We consume almost 50% of the energy that is produced in the country. There is a lot that can be achieved with collaboration between the sector and the government in terms of enhancing the power sector. We project that within the coming five to 10 years copper production should double.</p><h4>What is the CoM's position on the current tax dispute between the mines and the government?</h4><p>We have had several discussions. We have completed research and have noted that this is one of the most highly taxed jurisdictions. According to a study by McKinsey, our effective tax rate is about 45%, which is relatively high. Our corporate taxes are 30%, and we pay a mineral tax of 6%, amongst other taxes. If you look at the last EITI report for Zambia, in 2011 we contributed almost ZMW7 billion in taxes, while the previous year it was ZMW3 billion. Our question is how effectively this revenue is being utilized. It is really not a matter of just increasing taxes, as we must improve the tax collection process first. We also need to become more transparent and accountable in how these revenues are being utilized, to make sure that the money is being invested in local communities. Local communities are saying they are not seeing the developmental benefits. But if you go to Northwestern province now, the most developed area is where the mines are operating, but the towns themselves are in a sorry state. In terms of revenue, we contribute 30%.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for foreign investors willing to enter the mining sector in Zambia?</h4><p>There are great opportunities as there is still about 40% of the country that has not been geologically mapped. The government is aware of how critical the mining industry is for the nation, and recently we have heard more supportive sounds coming from government. The government is acknowledging that for Zambia to attract FDI there has to be policy consistency and stability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>At what stage are your current studies for the forthcoming 330 MW Muchinga power plant and the 100 MW Mulungushi power project?<br></h4><p>Technical feasibility studies for both projects have been completed and final environmental and social impact assessment studies are being completed. All of this should be concluded by year-end. The next stage is concluding the power purchase agreements from offtakers agreeable by lenders. The issues to be addressed will be what sort of power dispatch the market will want and at what price. At LHPC, we feel we ought to be designing and developing projects to accommodate peaking power requirements, since that will be needed in the medium to long term.</p><h4>A new fourth unit of 6 MW capacity was installed in 2012 at Lunsemfwa Station. Are further additions or upgrades for this station in the pipeline?</h4><p>The 6 MW fourth generator at Lunsemfwa Power Station (LPS) optimized the flow and no further upgrades are planned at this station. The 330 MW capacity station being studied will utilize the Mita Hills reservoir currently being used for LPS. Once the 330 MW station is commissioned, existing LPS will be by-passed, and utilized only during exceptionally high rainfall periods.</p><h4>What is the nature of your collaboration with the Rural Electrification Authority (REA), and what major steps is LHPC taking to make sure power supply is boosted in local areas?</h4><p>LHPC is a rural-based generating company, and has been extending electricity supply to schools around its facilities as part of our CSR program. The planned stations will be sited in areas where cooperation with REA will be needed in extending access to electricity. The REA has been made aware of these projects, and final designs will allow for supply to surrounding areas in collaboration with REA. LHPC is also encouraging farming downstream of new power plants as a means of jump starting economic activity that will anchor electricity access.</p><h4>You plan to produce 500 MW by 2020. What do you anticipate being your greatest challenges in achieving this goal, and what are your strategies for mitigating those challenges?</h4><p>It is LHPC's desire to avail the 500 MW planned capacity to the Zambian market as part of our contribution to the Zambia 2030 development vision. The major challenges will be the government's resolve to adjust electricity tariffs to investment and cost reflective levels. As a strategy, LHPC is a member of the Southern African Power Pool, and so would explore the SADC market should the Zambian market remain sluggish. The other challenge will be government's timely definition of water usage strategy priorities, which ensures sustainable hydropower usage.</p><h4>How do you envision national utilities and independent power producers (IPPs) in Africa collaborating to address power deficits on the continent?</h4><p>The urgent priority is full transformation of African national power utilities into full and independent commercial entities with government supplementing efforts to address initial social and economic challenges. Governments should then provide an enabling investment environment for the IPPs. Under those conditions, national utilities and IPPs will be able to collaborate successfully in addressing the power deficits on the continent. For example, IPPs will be able to bring new generation capacity on the market quickly and then use the pre-established transmission backbones to mitigate deficits. Governments with access to concessionary funding will be better placed to invest in new transmission projects.</p><h4>What is Zambia's ideal future energy mix?</h4><p>Zambia sits on a hydropower potential well above the 600 MW usually quoted. Hydropower offers many advantages for base power suited for the extractive industry, which will dominate the Zambian economy. With improving technologies for coal-fired power plants, Zambia will need to embrace coal as an energy source. Solar power technology has become cheaper than it was a decade ago. The ideal energy mix for Zambia will thus be hydropower and coal in the short term. Coal and solar with a hydropower energy component will, in the long term, be the ideal mix, as Zambia moves into the energy resource deficit period.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zamtel's number of mobile subscribers went from less than 100,000 in 2010 to over 1 million in 2013. What have been the main drivers of this success?<br></h4><p>I think it is a combination of factors. There was a measure of investment that had never before taken place in the company. Despite being established in the country for a 100 years, Zamtel was slow off the mark when it came to developments in GSM with other players, such as Airtel and MTN, getting in there first. Zamtel was the third company to come to the party, and I don't think that sufficient investment was made in terms of infrastructure. This is a numbers game, which means you have to have the capacity and the coverage. You need both to win. If you are slow in the market that invariably constrains how many people can come onto your network. Being the third provider to arrive cost us dearly. Having said that, the numbers have grown quite phenomenally over this period to where we are today.</p><h4>How important has innovation been to this growth?</h4><p>It has been quite fundamental, since without technology you cannot compete. For example, we are in the final phase of a rollout of over 400 base stations. All of these are 3G high-capacity base stations and are also LTE-ready. As we roll those out to Lusaka, the Copperbelt, and Livingstone, we will decommission the smaller capacity 3G-only base stations and deploy those in rural areas. That allows us to leapfrog our competitors and have a network that is almost entirely LTE ready.</p><h4>Is this aggressive expansion plan only taking place in the rural areas?</h4><p>No, it is in both rural and urban areas. A number of the sites we have been putting up replace what exists currently in the urban areas with high technology, high capacity LTE-ready cell sites and also fill in any gaps. If you don't have enough sites, you might find you don't have enough coverage. You need to plug all those holes to have a more-or-less continuous or ubiquitous coverage over the whole area. Lusaka should have excellent 3G coverage everywhere, and Kitwe, Ndola, and Livingstone should have seamless coverage. You have got to ensure that those are sound in terms of coverage and capacity. Having done that, if the technology you are deploying is also LTE ready, that allows you to leapfrog and start deploying LTE technology quickly, which in turn means extremely fast data.</p><h4>Zamtel is carrying out huge investment to improve its network. What opportunities do you see for foreign investors in building the telecoms network?</h4><p>That is always there, certainly. Zamtel will have quite a lot of capital expenditure over the next two years. These tenders are normally open to international companies; hence, the opportunities are there for large, medium, and small companies to participate, whether in the supply of equipment or the provision of consultancy services. We certainly need good suppliers from all over the world. We try to get the best technology at the best price. For example, we have equipment from Japan, China, and Europe. It is an open tender process provided you meet the specifications technically and commercially, which is good because it makes it competitive.</p><h4>How would you assess the competition in the telecoms sector in Zambia, and how does Zamtel stand out from its competitors?</h4><p>The competition is fierce and aggressive, and tends to go in phases. For example, when we first launched GSM in Zambia, we had big handsets costing almost $1,000 and the rate was around $1 a minute. That was Phase I. We have now have affordable cell phones that an ordinary person can buy for $10. As you roll out your network, the capacity is there and the coverage is there. The cost of the handset has been brought down to a reasonable level; however, there is no point in having a phone if you cannot afford the tariff to use it. Therefore, Zamtel did something that was quite disruptive in the market and had never been done before—we launched a product called the “Real Mahala," which colloquially means “freebee." This product allowed you to have 90 minutes of on-net calls during the day, and from 10.00 pm to 6.00 am you could talk for free to any Zamtel user. We also had a spinoff of that which gave you a 50% discount on off-net calls. As a result, in July and August 2013, we had an excess of 200,000 subscribers per month. These subscribers were ordinary people who had the $10 handsets, but could not afford the usual talk time rates. Our price was only about 50 cents to talk as much as you wanted, and that really was a game changer. People loved that product.</p><h4>Do Zambians move easily from one mobile operator to another?</h4><p>It is not so much a case of customers changing from one company to another, it is more that they double or triple the number of their SIM cards. Sometimes the penetration levels are a bit skewed because one person might have three SIM cards. They tend to have a primary SIM, then a secondary one. In that regard, I think Zamtel has been quite effective in the marketplace, and we have seen the benefits accrue. Nevertheless, what is important for us is to have good coverage, good capacity, and make the products and services affordable. The next trend that should happen is that now people have affordable handsets, we want data usage—people on the internet. We need smartphones that are affordable. Instead of smartphones costing $500, if that cost together with the cost of the internet came down, it would bring about a second revolution. The first revolution was carried out quite effectively. Now, the second revolution is to make smartphones and data affordable for even schoolchildren in villages. The whole world will open up if we do that.</p><h4>What is the potential for smartphones in Zambia?</h4><p>There is a huge potential. Even when we look at our traffic statistics at the moment and how our data traffic is growing, it is phenomenal. Similar to the Real Mahala for talk time, we had another product that we just stopped running, which was called Yagemuka Mahala. This product gave the customer 1GB of data free everyday if you enrolled in the Real Mahala. The aim was to encourage people who had never used data before to try it for the first time. We ran this for a period of time and it was extremely successful.</p><h4>Mobile money has been a revolution in some African countries, and Zamtel is about to launch its services. What opportunities do you see for mobile money services in Zambia?</h4><p>We are going to launch something in 4Q2014. The hardware has not been delivered yet, and we are still in the final processes of the contract. I think there are many opportunities, for example in Kenya where m-pesa has been a huge success. The number of people who are unbanked in Zambia is huge, too. If those people can be given products that are affordable and easy to use, such as on a simple phone, we can see the unbanked becoming banked much quicker than would normally be the case. That would be the smart way to go. The traditional way of bricks and mortar bank branches in every single place just doesn't make economic sense anymore. This also absolutely helps the national goal of financial inclusion. The farmer in the field can get paid with mobile money without having to travel long distances to the nearest bank and queue up for days.</p><h4>Do you expect internet penetration levels to grow in the next five years?</h4><p>Yes. If you look at the current figures for data growth, it is exponential, at least on our network. It is very high and I expect that to increase. As we roll out fiber to homes and premises, it will make sure that homes and businesses have internet access. For example, we recently commissioned a government-wide area network, which has put all the ministries together and made a closed network for them on fiber optic. We are providing them with a pipe of 200 MB of internet capacity, which is then distributed to all the ministries. That is growing as the government and ministries use the internet more. Also, what is important is the optic submarine cables that we have on the west and east coasts. It's always been a challenge for us to land that, though, because we are inland. It is a challenge to bring that capacity in from the coast to here. It can be quite expensive. If you are on the coast it is okay, but if you have to pass through two or three countries to bring it here, it starts to become expensive. We are hoping that those prices will also be driven down. Generally, internet prices are going down every year, but they need to go down on the cable and on the inland link.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>President Michael Sata's political acumen and rhetorical virtuosity have earned him the affectionate title of “King Cobra" from his supporters, who voted the 74-year-old politician into power in 2011. President Sata is proud of his humble past, and often harkens back to the days when he swept railway platforms at London's Victoria Station, telling one reporter, “I never got any complaints about my work. I want to sweep my country even cleaner than I swept the station." This mindfulness translates into a language that millions of poor Zambians living in poverty can understand, and drives the country's development policies. This same attention to working-class struggles can be seen in the President's efforts to combat high-level corruption that undercuts not only the national interest, but also those of workers in the country's mining and manufacturing industries.<br></p><p>However, the way in which President Sata shifted his policies and rhetoric are a testament to his political acumen, as well as his willingness to refine his agenda to suite national needs. Although President Sata was elected in 2011, he campaigned for the position three times before ultimately succeeding. During these campaigns, he pulled no punches in his criticism of international businesses, such as Chinese mine operators that were accused of exploiting local labor and resources. However, after his election in 2011, President Sata's rhetoric was conciliatory as he warned that as long as local laws were adhered to, there would be no need to point fingers. This transition reflected an evolution from campaigner to leader; wherein, President Sata realized that strong rule of law was a powerful tool in molding corporate behavior in the country. This strategy has paid in spades, as foreign investors continue to place their confidence in Zambia, and regulations are put in place to protect local interests.</p><p>President Sata rose to prominence as part of the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP) under Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, where he served as Governor of Lusaka and later as a UNIP MP. In 2001, President Sata formed the populist Patriotic Front Party (PF) along with Vice-President Dr. Guy Scott. During his three unsuccessful presidential runs, President Sata struck a populist tone, but fortunately did not dampen economic progress. By 2008, President Sata's platform reflected a pragmatic acceptance of the importance of Chinese firms in the country, and instead focused on leveling the playing field and ensuring that Zambians benefited from the developing international trade ties.</p><p>A cornerstone of President Sata's reform polices has been his fight against corruption. Shortly after his election in 2011, President Sata appointed a new Anti-Corruption Commissioner (ACC) Chief. Under Sata, the government reinstated the abuse of office clause in the Anti-Corruption Act. Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee scrutinized the operations of the executive, and followed up on reported irregularities. In education, the ACC undertook preventative measures with both public and private institutions to ensure that corruption prevention was the norm, and to foster transparency in the provisioning of public services. In the judiciary, President Sata replaced a number of ensconced judges while suspending three for misconduct. Other areas subjected to the President's anti-corruption agenda include the Directorate of Public Prosecution, and the Financial Intelligence Unit, where a new board of directors was given an enhanced directive in 2012.</p><p>President Sata has proven his mettle through his willingness to upend legal precedent in order to ensure that Zambians are not disadvantaged. When the president appointed Sebastian Zulu as the Minister of Justice, he was tasked with uncovering shady dealings regarding the 75% sale of the state-owned telecommunications network Zamtel, to LAP Green Network, a highly-publicized and politically charged deal that went down during 2010-2011. Creative accounting by the auditors brought in to work on the deal had found Zamtel to have negative equity, meaning that the company was sold for a fraction of its value. The $257 million sale was ultimately reversed in 2012.</p><p>Educational development is another cornerstone of President Sata's agenda. As of September 2014, the government has completed the construction of 41 of the 84 targeted secondary schools, representing a 49% completion rate, while the remaining 43 schools are well on their way to completion. President Sata has affirmed his commitment to establishing at least one university in each of Zambia's 10 provinces. In order to address a current shortage of student housing, the government is building student housing across the country. So far work has started on 4,160 bed-space student hostels at the University of Zambia, 3,200 student residencies for Copperbelt University, 1,280 for Mulungushi University, and 960 bed spaces at the Evelyn Hone College of Applied Arts and Commerce. With these new facilities to complement the other university improvements, the Sata administration hopes to facilitate quality higher education in the coming years.</p><p>Under President Sata, the government has continued to increase the availability of health staff, health-related infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, and other medical supplies. These have been promoted in line with the administration's prioritization of access to quality health services for all Zambians. Responding to a shortage of healthcare workers, President Sata has raised standards in training institutions while starting construction on new schools. In total, 27 health-training institutions country-wide are under renovation and expansion. Upon completion, these investments will increase healthcare training capacity by 4,500 students, and bring the total to 10,000. In 2011, the government commissioned five new district health hospitals, in Lufwanyama, Chadiza, Chiengi, Nakonde, and Shangombo. By the end of 2014, construction will have started on eight additional district hospitals in Lufwanyama, Chadiza, Chiengi, Nakonde, and Shangombo. President Sata has also directed the Health Ministry to focus on four important, and measurable areas: a reduction in deaths of mothers in pregnancy and child birth; the elimination of malaria; the elimination of mother to child transmission of HIV; and the elimination of shortages of drugs for hospitals and pharmacies.</p><p>In the area of governance and administration, President Sata has prioritized gender equality and childhood development in all state programs. In this regard, President Sata has championed laws that criminalize violence against women, in an effort to tackle escalating domestic violence. Aiding the president, the Zambian First Lady, Dr Christine Mwela Kaseba Sata, has championed this cause, using her experiences as a medical doctor to underpin the urgency of this agenda. The President and First Lady have actively campaigned against rape, defilement, sexual threats, exploitation, humiliation, assault, molestation, incest, and female genital mutilation (FGM), which are some of the sexual offences commonly committed against women and girls in the country. More recently, President Sata has gone after online bullying and sexual threats. From personal conduct to state level policy, President Sata has pursued an enhanced standard of living for Zambians and, if the past is any indication, this will remain a hallmark of his political career.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the government and people of South Africa, I would like to congratulate the Zambian nation on its Golden Jubilee celebration that commemorates 50 years of independence from the UK. Given the deep historical ties between our two countries, this is not only an important celebration for Zambia but also for South Africa and the region as a whole.<br></p><p>Zambia is a nation that played host to all the liberation movements in Southern Africa and generously shared her meager resources to support the cause of freedom and justice.</p><p>Our relations have a strong foundation as scores of South Africans lived in Zambia during the struggle for liberation.</p><p>The Zambians demonstrated their incredible kindness, humanity, resolve and “Ubuntu," to southern Africa as a whole. Many other liberation movements in the region also benefited from Zambian solidarity.</p><p>Zambia was the headquarters of our ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), for over 30 years. Therefore, many of the strategies and tactics that finally freed our country were shaped in Lusaka.</p><p>We now seek to further deepen and enhance these cordial and warm relations.</p><p>Zambia is now one of South Africa's top 10 trading partners on the continent, in so doing surpassing countries, which traditionally used to attract huge investments from our country.</p><p>These investments are no longer concentrated in the traditional so-called “old economy" that is mining, retail and related industries, but we are seeing a great shift to what some call the “new economy"—financial services, information communication technology, agribusiness, leisure, and others.</p><p>Zambia has been able to attract these investments thanks to its conducive regulatory framework and legislative environment, making the country a model for doing business.</p><p>Our countries are duty-bound and determined to champion and play a central and leading role in the regional and continental infrastructure development within the context of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), with particular emphasis on the North-South Corridor that traverses through the Southern African Development Community (SADC), East African Community (EAC), and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).</p><p>This North-South Corridor will, in sync with regional integration efforts, facilitate trade and physical interconnectivity with a high-priority focus in the areas of mining, agriculture, and tourism to the benefit of the peoples and economies of southern African countries.</p><p>In this regard, Zambia's geo-strategic location is central to the success of these initiatives.</p><p>Zambia is an important country to unlock the regional spatial development initiatives and infrastructure projects in the region.</p><p>It is therefore incumbent upon the private sector in both our countries to assist, leverage and benefit from these huge infrastructural development projects.</p><p>Enormous opportunities exist in the downstream development and beneficiation of Africa's vast resources, as well as in the creation of the critical infrastructure in terms of roads, railways, ports and utilities.</p><p>As governments, we can assure that we will do everything possible to create an enabling environment for the private sector investments, ensuring that such investments do not only contribute to economic development, but also create sustainable employment.</p><p>Finally, we are all aware of the vantage point we find ourselves at to pull all efforts to develop our countries, our region and our continent.</p><p>Africa's future beckons!</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The UN, Norway, and Zambia have enjoyed cordial relations since Zambia's independence in 1964. From the beginning Norway provided political and economic support to Zambia as a frontline state in the struggle against apartheid, minority rule, and colonialism in neighboring countries.<br></p><p>Still today, Zambia is among the main partners of Norway's development program, and we would also like to contribute in Zambia's efforts to collect more and correct taxes from its mineral wealth. Both Zambia and Norway are also looking "beyond aid"—to economic trade and investments, especially in hydropower and clean energy.</p><p>Norway continues to be a strong and proud supporter of the UN, both globally and here in Zambia. The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) are our collective promise to the world's most vulnerable on some of the world's most difficult development challenges.</p><p>We are fast approaching the MDG deadline of 2015, and we need bolder policies, and bigger partnerships and resources to ensure an accelerated progress to meet the goals.</p><p>And that's not the end of it; they must shape the “Future We Want" beyond 2015. The Future We Want is an initiative from UN that engages all nations more than ever before in a more inclusive conversation, where the creativity and energies from communities across the world have been heard and felt clearly. We must all ask; what kind of a world do we want for our children, for ourselves, and for the world community? We have to seize the moment and make the changes needed, today.</p><p>So I am very much delighted to know that young Zambians have been pro-actively part of this process of defining the world we want beyond 2015. Development is about people, it is about expanding opportunities and choices. It does not surprise me that Zambia—like many other African nations—has had robust economic growth in the past few years.</p><p>I am also happy to learn that the country has witnessed significant progress toward achieving some of its MDG targets, with 94% of children—both boys and girls—going to primary school. I hope we don't stop there, but that Zambia pushes ahead to ensure these children complete school and go on to receive a high quality secondary education.</p><p>Over 90% of one-year-olds are immunized against measles and close to 80% of the population with advanced HIV infection have access to antiretroviral medicines (ARVs), while the age-old killers like malaria and tuberculosis are being addressed head-on.</p><p>During my visit to Zambia in 2013, I visited the Health Centre and District Hospital in Chongwe, together with the First Lady, Dr. Christine Kaseba. We met and talked with the medical staff and the patients receiving mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), ARV therapy (ART), and tuberculosis care services. One can indeed see the efforts being made to invest in public health services and to improve drugs, testing, counseling, and laboratory services so that more people can access and benefit from these facilities.</p><p>And I am very happy to see the role that the UN Development Programme (UNDP) plays in partnership with you to make this happen.</p><p>In my conversations with the senior leadership of the country, including the Vice-President, Dr. Guy Scott, and a number of ministers, it was clear that they are focused on how to ensure that the impressive economic gains Zambia has made, translates into greater benefits for those more vulnerable. Whether it is for the Zambians still living in extreme poverty; for the two-thirds of children dropping out before completing secondary education; for the young mothers at risk of dying at child birth; or for the young people in search of jobs—it is indeed about putting this country's wealth to work for them.</p><p>The UN has, and will continue to have, an important role in addressing the pressing and complex issues of development —with a high priority given to better governance, a respect for human rights, and strong and resilient institutions at all levels—both globally and locally.</p><p>As a Goodwill Ambassador for the UNDP, it was a privilege to visit the country and to understand better what UNDP and the UN as a whole did there, delivering as one, to contribute with relevance and impact as this country takes great strides forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-ties-that-build]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Firstly, I would like to extend my very best wishes to the people of Zambia on the 50th year of independence. Zambia and Japan have enjoyed a cordial relationship in the last 50 years. The relationship is particularly memorable because Zambia's Independence Day, October 24, 1964, fell on the last day of the Tokyo Olympic Games. Naturally, Japan became one of the countries to first recognize Zambia as an independent state. The two countries have continued to enjoy good diplomatic relationships, accentuated by the visits of four Zambian heads of state between 1980 and June 2013 including HE Michael Chilufya Sata. Japan has reciprocated with equally high-profile visits.<br></p><p>Japan's development cooperation with Zambia started with a training program of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the implementing agency of Japan's official development assistance (ODA), in 1968 followed by six Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV) in 1970. To date, JICA has received more than 3,000 Zambians for its training programs in Japan, and dispatched more than 1,300 volunteers and close to 1,000 experts to Zambia. The total amount of Japan's cooperation with Zambia, including ODA loans and grant aid, is more than $2.1 billion.</p><p>In the last decade, Zambia has been successfully attaining its scenario to attain and sustain economic growth and social development towards a prosperous middle-income nation by the year 2030 under the “Vision 2030." The thrust of our current cooperation in Zambia is under the theme, “Promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth through Economic Diversification," which is in line with the Revised Sixth National Development Plan (2013-2016).</p><p>JICA has been continuing its cooperation with the Zambian government to tackle the country's major challenges as follows: First, quality of products and productivity, second infrastructure necessary for socio-economic activities, and third social services such as health, education, and access to water.</p><h4>(I) IMPROVING PRODUCT QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY:</h4><p>Agriculture and livestock development: One of our remarkable acts of cooperation is in agriculture and livestock development. The School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Zambia, built under grant aid and handed over to Zambia in 1986, has been a partner in our long-term technical cooperation. It emerged as one of the Centers of Excellence in Africa in viral disease diagnosis. Equipped with laboratory facilities, the center enabled the Zambian government to quickly detect the African Swine Fever, which broke out and claimed many pigs in 2013. The quick detection contributed to saving the growing pork industry in the country. Since August 2014, the center has been monitoring the Ebola virus, which recently broke out in the continent. The school has educated more than 300 veterinary doctors, from a meager number of less than 20 at the time of independence.</p><p>Productivity improvement: JICA has already jointly implemented the “Triangle of Hope Project," where investments were promoted through South-South Cooperation in partnership with the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA). We are also supporting capacity development of the newly established KAIZEN Institute of Zambia. To attain better productivity and accelerate investment, the Zambian government and JICA will further strengthen collaboration with their partners such as the private sector including Japanese companies, academic institutions, local governments, and NGOs.</p><h4>(II) DEVELOPING NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE:</h4><p>JICA has also been Zambia's close partner in the transport and energy sector. We have been supporting various road and bridge projects under the Grant Aid Scheme, such as Kafue Bridge, Chirundu Bridge at the border with Zimbabwe, the Great East Road and other city roads in the capital city Lusaka, and city roads in Ndola and Kitwe in Copperbelt province. The construction of the 14.8 kilometer long Lusaka Inner Ring Road (Phase 1), which links Lusaka South Multi Facility Economic Zone (LS MFEZ) to the central business district, is currently underway and will be completed by December 2014. For the energy sector, JICA assisted to formulate a Rural Electrification Master Plan, assisted capacity building in the Rural Electrification Authority, and provided a concessional loan to implement the Increased Access to Electricity Services (IAES) Project of the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO), which will see the upgrading of the electrification capacity in seven provinces of Zambia (Central, Eastern, Luapula, Northern, Northwestern, Southern, and Western).</p><h4>(iii) ACCELERATING SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND STRENGTHENING THE DELIVERY OF BASIC SERVICES:</h4><p>The education sector in Zambia has also been an important factor for JICA's cooperation for a long time. In the last 34 years, JICA dispatched at least 240 volunteer teachers of Science and Mathematics in secondary schools. Since 2005, “Lesson Study" practice has been developed and introduced under a technical cooperation scheme as an effective method of continuing professional development (CPD) for in-service teachers, and is currently being rolled out to all the provinces. JICA, together with other development partners, started to pump a grant of about $10 million to break the “myth" that science cannot be taught in rural areas by combining efforts that include the roll-out of 1,000 mobile science laboratory sets to 200 schools. This action will see a minimum of 400,000 pupils gaining access to practical science education. In addition, we have consistently stood by the Zambian government to provide safe water for the last two decades. For example, under the Grant Aid Scheme, more than 1,900 boreholes were constructed in most parts of the country, effectively reaching out to at least 800,000 people as beneficiaries.</p><h4>TICAD V &amp; COOPERATION AHEAD</h4><p>The Fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD V) took place in Japan in June, 2013. During the TICAD V, the “Yokohama Declaration 2013" was adopted. One of its basic themes is women and youth empowerment. Human resource development and the creation of job opportunities are of importance in JICA activities in Zambia. We started a survey for the African Business Education Initiative for Youth (ABE Initiative) to provide opportunities for Zambians to study in Japanese universities. The government of Japan also announced at the TICAD V that it would assist to boost the growth of Africa through private sector trade and investment. I believe that Zambia will attain its Vision 2030 by utilizing its rich human resources and natural resources.</p><p>We have already implemented the “Triangle of Hope Project," wherein investments were promoted through South-South Cooperation in partnership with the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), and we are currently supporting capacity development at the newly established KAIZEN Institute of Zambia. We at JICA will continue to support the efforts of the Zambian Government to further strengthen collaboration with its partners in the Japanese private sector, academic institutions, local governments, and NGOs.</p><p>As a long-lasting friend to Zambia, JICA will continue to extend its hand of friendship as a key partner in development. We look forward to strengthening technical cooperation, as well as financial cooperation for infrastructure development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-next-50]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the civil service evolved in Zambia since independence?<br></h4><p>Before 1964, we had a small public service, which was obviously colonial and related to the British government. After independence, there was a massive expansion. What must be noted is that until 1991 we were a one-party state, meaning the distinction between the public service and the government was not there. After 1991, it became a great challenge because now you are dealing with party politics. Part of the challenge is to get the public service to become an impartial, merit-based, professional service to move those particular arrangements forward. Where we are now, the current government's view is basically that if we are going to move forward we need to move the whole human resources management. Therefore, human resources management reform is a major reform area in which we are engaged, because the whole competitiveness of this country depends on the public service. Another important and related area is the pay structure. If you want to have the best, you have to pay them well. But if you pay people well, you must also measure that you are getting a return on your investment in terms of value. So the new salary structure must be linked to performance if we are to move the public service forward as a system. Then, the final reform in this is e-governance. We have already started working on the government-wide area network, on the hardware side, but we have also entered into an enterprise agreement with Microsoft so that we use software in a much more intelligent and coordinated way. To give you an example of what I mean, what was happening before is that each of our computers would come with different software, different prices, but we are all using Microsoft. The enterprise agreement we have entered into with Microsoft allows us to have one license for the provision of all the various components in terms of software. In addition to that, it also allows us to use ICT as a tool for transformation. The critical thing is to move away from paper, moving toward electronic which requires new laws, new behavior, and new everything. And that is why, ultimately, our transformation depends on leadership and management. So we are at a very exciting moment.</p><h4>What would you say have been your biggest successes in terms of reform in the three years of the current government?</h4><p>One of the key successes is that at least we have started getting a handle on our pay system. That I can confidently say, although that project is a 10-year project to restructure all the distortions. But you will find that even the language across the entire system is the same. Another success is that I believe we have achieved a consensus on a lot of the areas that were highlighted in the government's reform program, including reform of the public service commission, reform of the way the permanent secretary is appointed, and reform of the way the disciplinary procedures are done. The next stage is a translation into law of these particular elements. The other major reform is pension reform. Our pension system is not well structured in terms of age and benefits. The result is that it creates severe actuarial deficits. It is clear that we will have to move towards a singular institutional legal framework. Also, we have the lowest retirement age in the region at the moment; I think it is about the same age as us, we retire at 55. Our view is to move the retirement age to 65. With all of these things, the change management aspect becomes critical because you are trying to do reforms. It's almost like you are sailing on a ship and building it at the same time. You can't stop programs from operating, you need to pay salaries, you need to provide health services, and you need to provide all these services. But at the same time, you need to do these fundamental reforms. To balance the two is probably the key challenge for the future in my view. However, the key element is ultimately changing the culture of the public service, moving from a culture of entitlement to a culture of performance and entrepreneurship. There is a tension when you run a public service because on the one hand what makes a public service predictable is the rules and procedures, but you also understand that when you just comply to rules and procedures, innovation and creativity become a challenge. Any country where the demands for better quality services is on the increase because of the awareness of the people; you cannot afford to be rigid. But there is some time needed for the system to be predictable, and the rules and procedures must be consistent.</p><h4>What perception would you like investors to have of Zambia in terms of opportunities, and where do you expect growth?</h4><p>For me the areas are first, we have a premium in terms of peace. I think only a few people understand that about Zambia. We are probably some of the friendliest people that you can come across. In terms of where the greatest potential for growth is, agriculture is primary. The reason is very simple: 42% of underground water in this region is here. We also have one million hectares of land for farming blocks. The other growth area that I think one could think about is tourism. Victoria Falls is spectacular, be we have a number of amazing, pristine, and undiscovered wonders. For example, Samfya has incredibly beautiful white sand beaches. Almost no one knows this. With our current level of investment in transport, many of these areas will open up. Energy is another area, especially with the level of expansion in mining and agriculture. Our consumption of fossil fuels is increasing 20% per annum. This is a huge leap, and we are thinking about clean energy solutions, such as solar and biofuel. Our challenge is to develop a cost-reflective pricing system that allows investors to get a return, but also allows the government to expand its generation and transmission capabilities. Another area with growth potential is services. Because of our location, we could easily become a logistics hub for airlines as well as road and rail networks. Lusaka is 2 hours away from a large number of capital cities, and, of course, Zambia shares a boarder with eight countries. That makes us a unique place. Education is also an interesting growth area because we have now allowed private universities and private secondary schools. If you look at our numbers, how many children are moving from primary to secondary school and secondary to university, there is a large gap. And I see this gap as an extraordinary opportunity.</p><h4>What does the Golden Jubilee mean for you and what is your vision for the next 50 years?</h4><p>The first generation of post independence Zambians focused on the aim of getting our political freedom. Since that time we have had a very good system of change from one regime to the other without bloodshed. My view is the next generation just needs to consolidate the democratic gains and focus on socioeconomic development. We must increase our middle class, we must create more wealth, and we must create more jobs. This generation, the one that starts from October 24 and moves forward, will be judged on how well we transform the potential we have been speaking about in the last 50 years into wealth and jobs equality for all.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GDP in Zambia has grown by 7% YoY; however, unemployment has remained at around 15%. What are the main policies of your ministry to address this?<br></h4><p>As you are aware, all around the world the way to address unemployment is to regulate labor relations. We have set up labor market policies to provide an enabling environment where human resources are able to respond to higher levels of productivity. In the first instance, you need to have a working environment where those people are happy. As much as we welcome investment coming in, which is very important, it results in the government having little participation in community activities. Hence, we aim to provide an environment where we make sure we have high levels of productivity. If you produce, then you grow the economy, and growth benefits the majority of the people. For some time now, we have had a situation where GDP has been growing by quite a significant number; nevertheless, this has not been seen to benefit the people who are producing. In this case, we would like informal jobs to grow. In a good number of countries at the moment, particularly in the third world, the informal economy has become the main economy. We need to work on people who are in the informal economy rather than concentrating on those in the formal economy. We are aware of SMEs; however, at the same time many people are working out there on their own. Therefore, it is important as we grow the economy to double the level of the formal economy because it is the formal economy that activates the informal economy. We are also monitoring to ensure that there are such services as workers rights and also access to social security services for people who are working in the informal economy. That has just never been thought of before. The figure is less than 15% in formal employment. We are talking about 600,000 out of 14 million workers. We have a significant number of people who are leaving the education system at the secondary school level, and in some cases who are dropping out at primary school level. If we are not able to provide employment, we are creating more poverty, and we are trying to resolve this as a government.</p><h4>How attractive do you think the current legal framework in the labor market is for international investors?</h4><p>I would say it is quite attractive in the sense that if you look at the background of the President he was at one time a trade union leader. I spent three-quarters of my life in the trade unions myself; however, that does not mean we are running trade unions within the government. We are in government now and therefore we are looking at balancing human capital as well as the investment that is coming in. Our challenge is to make sure there is a balance, that there is a level playing field. And we try as much as possible to be in line with international labor standards. You cannot do anything better than that to attract FDI because FDI is mobile. International standards are the basic minimum and that is what we are delivering. We can say we are competitive in the sense that we are not embarking on putting in labor laws that are outside the norms of international conventions.</p><h4>What industries do you think have greater potential to generate more jobs in Zambia in the coming years?</h4><p>One is agriculture. We have the potential to feed the whole of the continent as well as outside the continent. Zambia's land is highly fertile and the climate is quite favorable, although we have suffered from some of the effects of climate change too. This government is giving top priority to agriculture—for the first time in the history of this country we have produced a sizeable amount of our staple foods. We are putting in measures to make sure we put up numerous storage facilities because it is not good to waste food, it is also costly, and it discourages peasant farmers. I would say that agriculture is one main area we are developing. Also, tourism has huge potential, and after that manufacturing and construction have been the government's major focus.</p><h4>During your time in office you have raised the minimum wage. What impact has that had on the Zambian economy?</h4><p>I think it has motivated Zambian workers, and motivated employees can be more productive. Also, the worker will have more disposable income, which means he will be able to assist all the members of his family, particularly those who are not working, and support his children to go to school. It always goes back to productivity, then with productive jobs we can grow the economy, and then we can create more jobs. In the absence of that we have got a major problem. We believe the minimum wage should be based on that of other countries, and should enable workers to get the basics of life so they can be sustained from the beginning of the month to the end of the month. It does not make sense if what you earn in a month, you have to spend in one or two weeks. I have established minimum wages for different sectors. Those working in the mining sector should have a minimum wage for mining work. It depends on the sector. In the agricultural sector we may even have three types of minimum wage depending on whether you are working in a large agricultural industry or on a small-scale farm.</p><h4>To what degree do you think international investment can fix Zambia's current unemployment rate?</h4><p>The world has become a small village. In some countries they have developed to the extent that they have large institutions operating in what are highly industrialized countries, and now they have got to go out particularly into the developing world. The environment here is conducive. We have a good climate, good natural resources, and particularly in areas such as mining and oil we have serious potential, which is conducive to FDI. Having said that, if they come here and do not create employment, then you start questioning what is happening. As they invest, they grow the economy and then you must employ more people to produce. As a country, you bring up whatever institutions are bringing up growth, whether it be manufacturing, mining, or construction. If it is a highly technical type of investment, two or three people may have to be employed.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Zambian labor market and how do you think it will evolve?</h4><p>I would say that with the current infrastructure development Zambia is conducive to the expansion of the labor market. In addition to the other pieces of legislation we are putting in place, shortly we will be taking a bill to parliament to establish productivity centers under this ministry. Through this we can reactivate the economy and help people see how they can produce better and grow their businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fitch Ratings has just upgraded Zambia's long-term debt outlook to positive, and in 2014 the country has jumped up seven places in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index. To what do you attribute increasing recognition of Zambia's competitiveness?<br></h4><p>Going back to 2004, the government started to engage the World Bank and the IMF in creating a program aimed at competitiveness and creating a more conducive investment climate. Inefficiencies and leakages were identified at the Zambia Investment Centre (ZIC) and the Zambia Export Processing Zones Authority (ZEPZA). However, abolishing those institutions would leave us as the only country in the region without statutory institutions to promote FDI and exports. We decided to propose to the World Bank and the IMF merging all of the promotional agencies into what is now the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA). This included the ZIC, ZEPZA, the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA), the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ), and the Small Enterprises Development Board (SEDB). After that, the government came up with the Private Sector Development Reform Programme (PSDRP), which included 79 action points to improve competitiveness and promote micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises. As soon as that was done, we started to see FDI increasing, not only in mining but also in manufacturing, agriculture, energy, and ICT.</p><h4>Today, which sectors do you think are most ripe for opportunities?</h4><p>I think there is tremendous potential in all sectors of the economy at this moment. Let me highlight agriculture primarily. A hallmark of this government is the concept of farm blocks. We have identified 10 farm blocks in 10 provinces, each one of approximately 100,000 hectares. That means all together, there are one million hectares of fertile land with significant sources of surface and underground water. Zambia holds about 40% of the water resources in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, which includes 15 countries. This spells tremendous potential for agriculture.</p><h4>Given these water resources, what is Zambia's potential to become a net exporter of electricity?</h4><p>Zambia can certainly become a net exporter of energy to the southern power pool. If the new Kafue Gorge project has the potential to produce 750 MW, then the Batoka Gorge Hydroelectric Power station has the potential to deliver 1,600 MW (800 MW on the Zambian side and 800 MW on the Zimbabwean side). In the north of the country there have been a number of large-capacity potential projects identified. If all those sites where developed, we could deliver 6,000 MW using hydroelectricity. In addition, we have the prospective of coal-fired thermal stations. In fact, before the end of 2014 or in early 2015, they will commission a coal-fired power station in my village of Maamba that will produce 300 MW. That will be phase one, and there will be a phase two to produce a similar number of megawatts.</p><h4>Promoting industrialization is one of this Ministry's stated objectives. Where does this process currently stand?</h4><p>This Ministry, in conjunction with other ministries, has created an industrialization and job creation strategy, which has been formally approved by cabinet. Some of the programs within this strategy are already being implemented, and we are seeing new projects, from both the public and private sectors, coming on stream. We are saying that one million jobs need to be created between 2H2014 and 2016. These jobs are not supposed to come from the government, but rather from the real economy, hence the strategy calls for enterprises to be created and for those to be the primary drivers of employment.</p><h4>How would you rate the success of this administration's mission to change Zambia from being landlocked to “land-linked," and what impact is that having on the investment climate?</h4><p>This program is on and moving forward. The government has embarked on an ambitious project known as Link Zambia 8000, which will improve regional interconnectedness. That is not to say we do not already have important linkages in both road and rail. For example, there is both road and rail access into the DRC as well as Tanzania to use the port of Dar es Salaam. There is also road and now rail access to Malawi. There is a rail line from Malawi into the Port of Nacala in Mozambique, and Zambia is committed to putting a link between Chipata, where that line terminates in the Eastern Province of Zambia, and Tazara, the railway that connects Dar es Salaam with the town of Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia's Central Province. By doing so, the rail link between Nacala and Tazara will be complete, which will substantially reduce transport costs. There is also the potential for additional linkages between Eastern Province and Mozambique. We are connected to Namibia by road with a provision to put in a rail link. We are also connected to Zimbabwe both by road and rail. Now a bridge is going to be constructed between Botswana and Zambia. Additionally, we trade by vessel with the countries of the Great Lakes region via Lake Tanganyika. There are now discussions about connecting the Tazara Railway to Mpulungu, the harbor in Northern Province at the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika. And there are attempts to link Zambia to Angola, which will have a huge impact on competitiveness, since the Port of Lobito is geographically the closest one to Zambia. Zambia of course has eight neighbors, and with the right infrastructure those eight countries are all potential markets for us. When you look at the cost composition of products from Zambia, transport costs are the most significant component. Once Zambia reduces transport costs, its competitiveness will increase significantly.</p><h4>What role does regional integration play in your vision of Zambia's future?</h4><p>Zambia is an active member in both the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the SADC. We take regional integration very seriously. Once all of these programs related to regional integration are completed, the market for Zambia will be much larger. Right now, unfortunately, those markets are small because we need to develop our industrial base. Trade in commodities is not that high because we need to develop our capacity to process these goods. For example, if we want to export copper regionally, our neighbors may not have the factories to process copper cathodes into end products. We need to develop manufacturing in order to add value for regional trade and regional markets, hence the importance of the industrialization and job-creation strategy.</p><h4>How are Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZs) contributing to this strategy?</h4><p>They are a vital component of our objectives to facilitate industrialization as well as create jobs. It is assumed that once we provide world-class infrastructure in the MFEZs, we will attract local investors as well as FDI. These zones have world-class roads, communications infrastructure, water and sold-waste management, and electricity. In fact, the electricity is connected through multiple power stations, hence there is no risk of disruption if one substation goes down. These zones are like a mini-city where everything you need is already there, and the standards are higher than the local standards you generally find in the country. We have three operational MFEZs. The first is Chambishi MFEZ, which is being promoted by the Zambia-China Economic &amp; Trade Cooperation Zone (ZCCZ), a local arm of the China Nonferrous Metal Mining Corporation (CNMC). Chambishi has about 28 zone enterprises and employs close to 8,000 people, and they have already started exporting. They have provided a road network, bulk water supply pipeline from the Kafue River, power, and shells for companies to move into and start operations from immediately. They are on target to have another seven enterprises operating there by the end of 2014. The second zone is the Lusaka East MFEZ, also being promoted by ZCCZ. It has four zone enterprises and is strategically located next to the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport. A third zone, the Lusaka South MFEZ, is being promoted by the Zambian government and development works are underway. The first company to locate here, a pharmaceutical company, may commence production by the end of 2014. There are four more companies planning to operate here, and we hope to have around 12 by the end of 2015. Additionally, there are companies that have applied to develop their own multi-facility economic zones, including sites in Lumwana in Northwestern Province, Maamba in Southern Province, and Kalumbila in Northwestern Province. There are also two industrial parks: one in Ndola and one in Lusaka. The latter is operational, although they have started mainly with residential accommodation. This is an example of how such zones open up an area that was previously undeveloped. You are not only attracting companies, but also people who go there to live because there are sections with high-quality accommodation, as well as learning institutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Zambian International Trade &amp; Investment Centre (ZITIC) is unique, in that it sees the private sector taking on the responsibility of investment promotion. Could you tell us how you came up with this concept?<br></h4><p>Between 1972 and 1991 the country had a socialist government, and by 1991 80% of the economy was state controlled. At that time, 80% to 85% of foreign earnings came from one industry—copper mining. Therefore, ours was a state-controlled mono-economy. In 1990, we started lobbying for a change in the constitution that would allow for a liberal economy, and the party that was advocating change won the election in 1991. One of the things that needed to happen at the time was the reengineering of the economy. After the elections in 1991, I was asked to become an advisor to the Vice-President and I left my private business, a manufacturing company, to join the government and become an advisor particularly focused on economic management. In 1993 they sent me to Georgetown University to specialize in Transitional Economics.  As soon as I came back I was transferred to the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, &amp; Industry as Director of Industry. They gave me the responsibility of developing policies that would liberalize the economy. We had to come up with new investment codes, new trade policies, new standardization policies, new small enterprise development policies and all the other policies that go into ensuring such a change. This is how we embarked on the privatization program through the Zambia Privatization Agency. In 1996 I moved to work as Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Minister Without Portfolio who is the current President. Later in 1997, I was moved to the President's Office as Permanent Secretary/Comptroller under President Chiluba. Later when late President Levy Mwanawasa took office, I was called to serve as Special Assistant to the President (Special Duties). Over the years, what I have realized is that the government, by its nature, is structured in such a way that it is not exactly private sector friendly. It is a bureaucracy. They take their time, even if an investor is waiting or in a hurry; they will say, “come tomorrow." An investor does not have all the time in the world, as he may have multiple business interests and commitments; he/she may be catching the next flight to the next destination, hence may not “come tomorrow." I noticed that we had lost numerous investment opportunities because of this. When I left government in 2006, I decided that I had to do something that would help investment. Two years after I left I came up with the idea of setting up a private trade and investment center. This is where we are today with ZITIC. We are here to be a friend to investors. We help them with all the legal requirements, necessary registrations to set up their companies, and also any licensing they might need. They do not even need to be here; as long as we have their mandate we can do everything they want us to do for them.</p><h4>What sectors or types of company do you see the greatest demand from?</h4><p>I think that demand is coming from all sectors, especially from the foreign investors' side. We are also providing another service, which is raising financing for local companies. There is demand on that side as well. In addition to this, we get companies that are trying to enter public sector tenders. We get companies that need representation. There is significant demand from manufacturing companies trying to offer their products in the Zambian market. They come to us to connect with local buyers. It really covers all sectors: agriculture, mining, and health. Recently, we have been contacted by UK interests who want to set up private schools here, people from China that were looking for mining opportunities, and someone who wanted a contract for optic fiber installations. So it is a broad range of demand.</p><h4>What do you feel should be the policy priorities in terms of creating a more conducive investment environment?</h4><p>I would like to see the growth of manufacturing in this country. Before this can happen, we have to see public investments in infrastructure and then attract investment into value-adding industries. The biggest export commodity we produce outside the mining sector is corn. However, the current policy mix is not consistent. For example, we are exporting groundnuts instead of exporting peanut butter, and are happy to export sunflower seeds instead of cooking oil. I do not believe there has been a strong enough policy drive to reengineer the economy in the right direction as regards value-addition. Up to now, 50 years after independence, even our main product, copper, is exported in its raw form without processing. It is incredible that such a sizeable country in terms of landmass, natural resources, and population has such huge unemployment rates. We have sufficient capacity, if we would employ the right technologies, to have a job for every single Zambian. In fact, we should be net importers of labor. At a private level, I do what I believe I should do as a Zambian to expose the country to the importance of value-adding. That is my passion. But I cannot do this on my own. I have to get the rest of the Zambian private sector on board. I have to convince them to invest in knowledge.</p><h4>What domestic economic activities do you feel have the greatest export potential?</h4><p>Number one is value-added agro produce. We have the environment, the land, and the climate. We have everything. All that we need is technology. In my opinion, it is the lowest hanging fruit, and this is why I want to focus on the sector. I do not think that we have to look too far. Secondly, I think that we have excellent tourism potential as long as we can maintain our reputation as a peaceful country, and as long as we can develop the infrastructure to support that sector. The latter is an area that still needs considerable investment. Once again, we have the natural resources. We have the initial force to start with. We have the wildlife. And we have to build on that. All we have to do is to sufficiently invest in order to be able to take advantage of these resources. Thirdly, we have the necessary bodies of water for us to produce enough hydropower to supply the whole region. The entire East African region is suffering serious energy shortages. That is another line of business that we can take advantage of. We also have strong winds and sufficient sunlight. I think that we just need to do a little more, get out there as much as we can and attract investment that would help us take advantage of what we have. I am not disregarding the mining sector. There is potential there, too. This country has not yet been fully explored. I think that we need to streamline our approach to the issue of mining rights and licenses so that we can ensure that serious investors come into the sector. We also have to use these sectors to empower local people. I think that these are some of the sectors that can really help to drive this economy forward—manufacturing, mining, tourism, agriculture, and agro processing.</p><h4>In terms of tourism, what specific investments do you think are needed from both the public and private sector to realize this potential?</h4><p>I think that the first thing that we have to sort out is essentials. Tourism means people going somewhere to see something that you have. We need a system that would bring them here. We have to make an investment in an airline. It is a critical component to the success of our tourism sector. A national airline's impact on an economy is very multifaceted. It is not only on tourism. People do not invest in a country that they do not know. When somebody comes to Zambia as a tourist and they see the business potential in the country, they come back as an investor. However, you have to get them here efficiently and at a competitive price. Secondly, I believe that we have to invest in actual tourism infrastructure—roads, as well as hotels and lodges. We have to understand the terrain and explore what is available. For example, the Samfya area is exceptional, yet it is currently unknown in tourism terms. We have the Victoria Falls, but it only takes an afternoon to see the waterfalls and that's it. A tourist wants to go on a holiday for one or two weeks. So we need to take them to Samfya's beaches, which have the whitest sand in the country and on the continent. However, we do not have the facilities or infrastructure to introduce tourists to this area.</p><h4>Do you think that Samfya is currently an investable destination?</h4><p>Yes it is, and I am passionate about it. I have met with the local authorities, and they have given ZITIC a mandate, in writing, to promote it. I think that there is considerable excitement being built around it. At the moment, I am trying to build interest from within the country so that people can see its potential. Moreover, it is the right time for the outside world to know about it and to invest in it. I think it should be the Sharm Al Sheikh of Zambia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Zambia for Standard Chartered?<br></h4><p>Standard Chartered Bank Group has eight regions in terms of how it manages its geographies. One of those regions is Africa, which has seen a fast track record of development in recent years. Africa's growth rate has been higher than the average of the world for the past three years, thus Africa is receiving greater interest from investors. As a group, we have also seen our business in Africa grow and our African market will continue to offer exciting opportunities. Zambia specifically is one of the African countries where we see advantages and opportunities, and this makes Zambia an attractive market. The economy is growing at 6% to 7% annually, while the banking sector typically grows double the rate of GDP Growth. Zambia is one of the big four markets for the group in Africa</p><h4>Where do you see Standard Chartered within the competition among major banks in Zambia?</h4><p>For the past three or four years, we have continuously been the most profitable bank in Zambia. In the last three years, we have been consecutively voted “Best Bank in Zambia" by Global Finance Magazine, The Financial Times, and The Euromoney Awards for Excellence. In 2014, Euromoney and Global Finance again voted us as the best bank. We have also won several local awards. This demonstrates the fact that we have been profitable. We have won awards for our digital campaigns because we have pioneered innovation in banking in many ways. For example, Standard Chartered was the first to introduce Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) in Zambia as well as International Visa cards. We were the first to introduce check deposit machines, and have been a leader in terms of product launches. Also, we have been instrumental in supporting the economy of Zambia. In 2013, we did a landmark transaction, where we provided financing in the region for $3 billion to the mining sector. Through this transaction, Standard Chartered contributed significantly to Zambia's copper production. We are the oldest bank in the country, and we have acted as a central bank before, and I think that gives us a certain degree of credibility. In the 108 years that we have been operating in Zambia, we have remained through the changing economic environment—we have never threatened to leave this market. Our recruiters also attest to the fact that we continue to trend as the number one employer of choice amongst young people looking for employment. We have become in a sense part of the fabric of this society.</p><h4>What have been your most recent product innovations?</h4><p>Recently, the most critical products have been in the digital sphere. We launched the first solely-digital branches—Electronic Banking Centres (EBCs)—where all services and transactions are digital and online. We introduced check deposit machines recently—another first on the market. In addition to physical infrastructure, we have also introduced specialty products. When interests rates were going up, with our own in-house funding methodology, we were able to launch a mortgage scheme at a competitive interest rate so that more people could own homes. For example, we looked at the income of the family in totality, not just at the individual applying for the loan. It helped many people who otherwise would not have qualified for mortgage. We have also launched offshore wealth management services.</p><h4>How significant are SMEs for your current strategy and for your lending portfolio?</h4><p>SMEs are what we need for evolution in Zambia. They are very important to us. They need capital and capacity building in terms of management and the right markets. We continue to grow our SME lending annually in double-digit terms. We currently work with about 8,000 SMEs. Under our new strategy, we have separated the SME segment into Commercial Class [middle market] and Business Clients [small businesses] since otherwise it can be a broad category, and a medium-sized company has very different needs from a very small company. This segmentation will increase our focus and also help us to spur growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Zambia's role in Stanbic's overall portfolio?<br></h4><p>For the Standard Bank Group, Zambia is obviously an extremely important country for a number of reasons. First, it is one of the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our average growth is above 6%, which is incredibly rapid. It has the potential to grow, and, therefore, it provides immense investment opportunities. Secondly, if you look at Zambia, it has moved from being a low-income to being a middle-income country, which obviously provides opportunities for a growing middle class, and it lets us get into a developing economy. Thirdly, Zambia being landlocked in Southern Africa provides important linkages to all its neighbors. The geographical position and acts as a hub as a result. We have a number of NGOs moving into Zambia as well, which is an interesting development.</p><h4>What sectors in Zambia are you seeing the most growth in?</h4><p>Mining continues to dominate in Zambia with a significant number of investment in the sector. In addition to mining, we are also seeing growth in the agriculture sector. Zambia used to import maize and wheat, but it is now self sustaining in the provision of grain, and we are happy to note that agriculture is increasingly becoming a strong player in the economy. With 50% of the land being arable and not utilized, there is a huge scope to grow this sector. Zambia also has the privilege of having 30% of the fresh water in this region, so there is abundant water resources, conducive weather patterns, and available land to drive growth in agriculture. The telecommunications sector has also undergone massive growth, and we foresee more activity in this sector. I am of the view that telecommunications is important because it provides a strong ICT platform for economic growth. The sector that is currently underrated, but I believe has huge potential is energy, power, and infrastructure. With the abundance of water, there is an opportunity to install a lot of hydro and clean energy sites, and we are happy to note that the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) has been committed to this cause. There is the private sector participation as well, which provides a huge impetus for growth. I see Zambia playing a significant role in energy development in the Sub-Saharan region. With Zambia being in the geographic middle, it has the opportunity to link southern Africa with eastern Africa, and also the Francophone central Africa. I think there is a strong potential for Zambia to become a net exporter of energy in the medium term.</p><h4>Can you talk about your loan portfolio? Who do you lend to?</h4><p>We see ourselves as a universal bank; therefore, we deal with all sectors of the economy, from personal up to corporate. If you look from a segment point of view, we have a portfolio in the personal market, a portfolio that deals with the high-net-worth sector, and we also deal with SMEs and local, regional, and multinational corporates. From an economic sector point of view, we are focusing on resources, such as mining, power and infrastructure, telecoms, and agriculture. By market share, we have the largest agriculture portfolio in Zambia. In mining, I believe we are probably joint-first, if not first. We are the largest bank in terms of assets. With infrastructure development in terms of property we financed the largest shopping mall in Zambia. In power, we just signed a deal with ZESCO to provide finance of around $165 million for an 800-kilometer power line from the south to the northwest part of the country. We were also the sole advisors for Copperbelt Energy Corporation (CEC) on the structuring of $70 million capital raised through a rights offer.</p><h4>What has Stanbic done to make Zambia a more attractive investment destination?</h4><p>Locally, as a bank we have worked in bond issuing with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which was really just to develop the local capital markets as that is important for investors. We also host an African Investors Conference in New York and London, with the last one held in London in June 2014 where we had the opportunity to invite government officials and about 30 investors in private equity funds to talk to other investors in those countries. Such are the platforms that Stanbic Bank provides to promote Zambia's investment opportunities on the global map.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Insuring Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[insuring-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the competitive landscape of the insurance sector, and where is the Zambia State Insurance Corporation (ZSIC) within that landscape?<br></h4><p>At the moment, we are about 23 insurance companies, 13 of which are non-life insurance companies and the rest are life insurance companies, and there are three reinsurance companies. Competition is quite stiff. ZSIC Life had been commanding the lead position until about last year, when it fell into second position in terms of gross income with a market share of about 24%-26%. ZSIC General is in the third position in terms of gross income, but we are working to see if we can regain our top positions, but the others are not sleeping, so it is a battle to compete.</p><h4>How much of your strategy to regain the top position in non-life is centered on capturing existing markets, and how much depends on reaching out to insure the uninsured?</h4><p>In Zambia insurance penetration is very low, at only about 4%-6% of the population. We are all targeting conventional insurance lines and the businesses like motor, fire, engineering, and so on, but we realize that we have to reach out to the unbanked and uninsured, such as micro, SMEs and the rural population. We are looking to see if we can improve on what we are calling micro insurance to provide practical products for low-income groups. But for ourselves, in our effort to gain market position we are trying to compete on all fronts, including the conventional market where we want to become better in terms of how fast we pay our claims and how fairly we pay those claims. At the moment, there are about four top insurance companies: ZSIC Group, Madison Group, Professional Insurance Group, and NICO Insurance.</p><h4>How would you assess the current regulatory framework, and do you see any changes in the near future?</h4><p>The regulator is quite effective and keeps improving every day. For example, there is a draft bill to raise statutory capital for insurance companies. The current required capital is too low, at slightly below an equivalent of  $400,000, which is one reason we've seen so many entrants in the market. It is understood the new bill will raise the requirement to about $3 million. We believe that will strengthen the financial bases of the insurance companies and help them retain more risk.</p><h4>It is predicted that the insurance sector will see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% this year. Which lines are driving this growth?</h4><p>Life is pretty much underpenetrated at the moment, so I think if our marketing and sensitization efforts are sustained; this will be one growth area. I am saying this too because we see more people with sustainable incomes coming into play. On the property and assets side, that too is a major area. For us at ZSIC, we are looking strongly at agribusiness. We have one of the largest agri-insurance units in the market. There is a lot of new equipment on the market and new techniques related to conservation farming and aimed at increasing yields. We've had quite big figures being insured by the commercial farmers on products like wheat—both rain fed and irrigated—as well as soya bean, and tobacco. Right now, there is a big input from the African Development Bank (ADB) in the region known as the “triangle of hope," which is between Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique. In the northern region of Zambia, both the government and the community are trying to support a lot of cattle rearing, so they will be financing the establishment of dipping to prevent disease. People are also planning to grow coffee, and sugar in the wetlands of Zambia. So for me, next to mining, agriculture has the highest potential for our company as well as our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mine-it-so]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The EBITDA of First Quantum Minerals (FQM) in 1H2014 increased by 25% compared to the same period last year despite a lower market price. Could you name the main drivers of this success?</h4><p>Notwithstanding FQM's acquisition of Inmet in 2013 and the increasing price of nickel, both of which will have increased our EBITDA; the key characteristic of FQM is that we are low-cost miners. Of course, our copper sales increased over the period you speak about, but we are also extremely good at seeking out efficiencies, reflected in a reduced C1 cost. Currently, Kansanshi operates in the lower 40-50 cost percentile. This means that, if the price of copper drops, most of the copper operations worldwide would start feeling pressure before Kansanshi does. In the 1990s, the government owned the mines in Zambia and in many other countries, so when the price of copper fell the government persevered with copper production, because the mining industry was the major source of foreign exchange. Now that mines have been privatized, if the price of copper dropped, investors would discontinue high cost operations rather than losing money. As a result, the demand-supply curve would change hopefully pushing the price of copper back up. In 2015, once the smelter at Kansanshi is running and producing sulfuric acid, one of our biggest cost items, will be significantly reduced and FQM will move down to the 25-30 cost percentile. Mines that do run at lower costs than Kansanshi do so, generally, by having by-products as a credit to their costs, and not necessarily by operating more efficiency. Operationally, Kansanshi is one of the most efficient mines in the world, and like Sentinel also includes various cost saving methods, such as trolley assist haulage and in-pit crushing to minimize the use of diesel and reduce costs further.</p><h4>What percentage of the total revenue of FQM is reflected by Zambia?</h4><p>Around 51.8% of the revenues are sourced from the country. Zambia remains hugely important for First Quantum despite our continued diversification; our roots run very deeply in Zambia and will continue to do so. Zambia has been the mainstay of FQM's global mining investments, and I do not see that changing in the near future. Notwithstanding that, in the past two years there has been a lot of diversification of FQM operations around the world. Now we have operations in Turkey, Spain, Finland, Australia, and Mauritania, and projects in Panama, Peru, and Argentina. We are diversifying to other minerals like gold and nickel, but First Quantum remains predominantly a copper mining company.</p><h4>How many metric tons of copper were extracted from the Kansanshi copper mine in 2013?</h4><p>Last year we mined 270,724 tons of copper from Kansanshi. We will expect to see that number increase to 400,000 tons with the S-3 expansion, although this expansion is currently on hold as it is to be approved by the board in the medium to long term. In addition to that, the Sentinel mine will be producing 280,000 to 300,000 tons of copper per annum once fully operational. Our target is set on producing up to 700,000 tons of copper per year from Zambia. Later in this decade, we expect to be among the top-five producers of copper in the world.</p><h4>The Trident Project is one of the major projects for First Quantum in Zambia. Could you explain the relevance of this project to your company and the mining industry in Zambia?</h4><p>Initially, the Trident Project consisted of three resources: Intrepid, Enterprise, and Sentinel—but only Enterprise and Sentinel have been exploited. Sentinel is a pure copper play, and it is exciting for a number of reasons. It is all about scale; the days of high-grade copper discoveries in Zambia are all but gone. The average copper grade at Sentinel is 0.51%, meaning to produce 300,000 tons of copper a year, we will have to move a massive amount of ore. We expect to process up to 55 million tons of rock per annum to obtain those 300,000 tons of copper. Consequently, at Sentinel we will operate one of the largest milling trains in the world. The only equivalent size is in South America.</p><h4>The economy of Zambia has experienced strong growth in recent years. What role is the copper mining industry playing in this growth?</h4><p>While the Zambian copper industry was collapsing prior to privatization in 2000, the Zambian economy was in a poor state. This was clearly visible in looking at the state of the roads, buildings, and other infrastructure, as well as the condition and sparse number of vehicles on the roads. Since privatization and the resulting growth of the mining industry through massive capital injections, conditions in Zambia as a whole have improved dramatically. There can be no doubt that the investment in the copper mines have been the major catalyst for the improvements seen in Zambia. A further direct contribution from the mining industry, and specifically from FQM, is both indirect and direct. Just in terms of jobs, we directly employ nearly 13,000 people in the Kansanshi mine, and 2,000 people will work at Sentinel when it becomes operational. However, at the same time, we are providing many indirect jobs. At the Sentinel mine, we estimate that we will be creating over 10,000 indirect jobs. We understand the desire of the Zambian government to diversify away from pure mining activities, and it is in that context that we are introducing multi-function economic zones, both in our new town developments in Solwezi and in Sentinel.</p><h4>What challenges do you see for the mining industry and how are you coping with them?</h4><p>The most important thing for a global company when they consider what jurisdiction to invest in is stability and consistency, especially in the tax regime. Currently in Zambia, we are seeing changes in the tax structures. Having a jurisdiction in which tax levels are high is one thing. But unpredictable tax structures will inevitably make a country less attractive to global investors. If the government of the Republic of Zambia kept a consistent and stable tax regime, then that would be the strongest signal they could send to international investors that Zambia will remain an interesting and attractive destination for FDI. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is new investment that creates jobs. There is no other viable mechanism or way of creating jobs. Governments don't by themselves create jobs; they can only create an environment that is conducive and attractive for investment, and it is this that then creates jobs—and wealth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Airtel is the largest mobile operator in Africa. What is the importance of Zambia for Airtel?<br></h4><p>Zambia is centrally located, with easy access to eight neighboring markets. Zambia's position increases our market size, and gives us a solid platform for innovation and services, and allows us to expand coverage outside of the country. Areas beyond Zambia's borders with Tanzania, the Congo, Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Malawi provide high returns on coverage. Zambia is also one of the most reliable countries in terms of growth and, more importantly, peace. Peace and a sound economy go hand-in hand. It is possible to invest with confidence in Zambia, because the government's policies are pro-business, and this country is a safe and secure destination for FDI and local investment.</p><h4>Since 2010 you have invested $280 million in developing your network in Zambia? How is this investment paying off?</h4><p>Airtel has a strong following, and we have earned our customers' loyalty. Maintaining this relationship with our customers is at the core of our business strategy. Our recent investments have allowed us to maintain our dominance in the Zambian telecommunications industry.</p><h4>How do you see the development of mobile banking?</h4><p>Airtel Money is the most exciting product that Airtel has introduced in Zambia, and it allows customers to transfer money with their mobile phones. Airtel Money also enhances financial inclusion by allowing banks to extend their reach to the furthest corners of Zambia, where there are fewer branches. We are currently working with the Central Bank to increase the financial inclusion of under-banked Zambians. The internet, is the next frontier.</p><h4>Is this why you recently launched a partnership with Facebook?</h4><p>Our partnership with Facebook is the first of its kind in Africa. Airtel was at the forefront of pioneering the Facebook phone, and we hope to increase engagement with customers over 14, which is the target age for increased engagement with online platforms. By familiarizing customers early on, we expect to create long-term, high-tech customers.</p><h4>What are your future plans for expansion here in Zambia?</h4><p>Before tackling expansion, Airtel needs to pursue consolidation. We need to enhance our network and extend the coverage available to our existing customers. Expansion is necessary for us, but first we should look to consolidate our position in existing markets. Expansion also means covering more rural areas, where we already have a significant number of towers. Our goal is to consolidate and deepen our reach, in order to really deliver the quality that we promise.</p><h4>What differentiates Airtel from the other major players in Zambia?</h4><p>Our footprint makes us unique. We have the largest geographical coverage, meaning that we have access to the largest potential customer base. Because of the scale of our coverage, we provide communication services to rural Zambians, allowing them to integrate into the national economy and society. The government is currently pursuing a policy of universal access, which it is promoting through Airtel because we are everywhere. This year alone we plan to erect close to 200 more towers. Our market is also evolving, and, as we grow, we are making sure that new technological needs are given careful consideration.</p><h4>Airtel Zambia has a huge investment in corporate and social responsibility (CSR). Could you tell us about some of the initiatives you carried out this year?</h4><p>CSR is a key component of our business. This year alone, $900,000 has been allocated to Airtel Rising Stars, a football initiative that focuses on identifying young soccer talent. We do this to show appreciation to our communities. In addition to Airtel Rising Stars, we have focused on improving health and education services in Zambia. All of our programs are aimed at empowering the youth. We incentivize education with the goal of raising disciplined, responsible citizens. Athletic development requires discipline and training, healthy eating and living, and respectful relationships. Airtel means to be a part of this because CSR is critical for continued growth, and molding future leaders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the drivers behind your 400% growth in size of late?<br></h4><p>That growth has occurred over a period of about four years, and represents a marked increase in our turnover. The company was a typical SME business, and a strategic decision was made to partner with Copperbelt Energy Cooperation (CEC). A joint venture (JV) was formed between the original owners of Realtime and Copperbelt Energy Cooperation. Immediately after the formation of the JV, in 2009, equity was pumped into the company by CEC to adopt fiber optic technology for the provision of services. As a result, we pioneered the provision of fiber to the premises (FTTP) in this country. Until then, customer connections were made via wireless links. When we pioneered the provision of fiber cabling, it immediately gave us a competitive advantage over other service providers. As a result, we were able to attract high-end institutional customers, such as the mining houses, the banking sector, and large manufacturing companies. Following the formation of the JV, it was necessary to restructure the company and hire new staff to ensure we were using appropriate skills. The other change was that prior to the formation of the JV, Realtime was mostly providing services to the mass market; however, after the formation of the JV, we focused on a niche market of large institutional customers.</p><h4>How would you assess the market demand for internet solutions?</h4><p>We have reasonable demand for our services, stemming from the fact that the penetration levels are still low and also because Zambia's economy continues to grow at an average of 6%-7%. Further, the government has put in incentives to grow the ICT sector, as it is acknowledged that this is one sector that is going to be responsible for creating efficiencies for business and the economy in general.</p><h4>How would you rate the effectiveness of those incentives so far?</h4><p>It has been an ongoing process, and we continue to engage with government. So far, we have seen the government provide incentives through tax measures. For example, we enjoy concessional rates on the importation of ICT equipment into the country. Initially, the government was only allowing the importation of computers at a concession, but over the years we have seen the government increase the range of ICT equipment that comes into the country at concession rates. Also, in terms of regulation, the government reviewed our license fees downwards in order for the ICT sector to penetrate more markets. Of course, there is more we hope can be done, but over time we have enjoyed the tax incentives offered to the sector.</p><h4>What is your view on the regulatory framework and its development?</h4><p>Our regulator has tried as much as possible to ensure that regulations are provided in an environment that is conducive to the sector, whilst meeting the requirements of the international community. We have seen progressive changes in terms of regulation in the sector. So far, national regulation is in tandem with  international practice. If there are going to be further changes, they will not be extensive. One area where we keep pushing for changes is the further reduction of license fees. In particular, our thinking has been that we are paying quite a bit more compared to others in the region in terms of operating fees, which currently stand at 3% for service providers such as us. That is 3% of the turnover. We hope it could be reduced to as low as 1%, which is as low as other countries around the world.</p><h4>How would you assess the competitive landscape for ICT?</h4><p>In Zambia, we have about 22 registered internet service providers. However, of the 22 that are registered, maybe only about 10 are active. There is intense rivalry in the sector, and at the same time because of the intensity of the competition, it acts as a barrier to entry for new companies. Secondly, the sector requires that you have adequate capital because the technology changes so often. That, too, is a barrier to entry for new entrants and start-ups.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[going-all-the-way]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background to the company?<br></h4><p>I started the business a little over seven years ago. It was built on a passion for creativity that I have always felt. The African education system does not teach entrepreneurship, it teaches you a trade. Growing up I was interested in art, and I could not fit myself honestly into being, for example, a doctor or a pilot. I knew that whatever I did, it would be through art. I was in the UK and when I returned to Zambia I opened this business with zero capital. I bought a camera, got started, and put in the time, effort, and strategy. Then people started buying into the idea. The business started off as a photography agency. I got a few deals with a few clients that bought into it, and the business started growing. It was hard to access finance then because we were seen as a high-risk business with no precedents. Hence I re-injected all the capital back into the company, meaning I could purchase more equipment. From that, the business naturally moved into video production. That made a great transition and we added value by doing it. We started to be hired by a number of agencies to do stuff for campaigns and suchlike. Then we decided to become an advertising and communications agency. As much as we are known for photography, our core business now is in advertising and communications. Photography and video production are just some of the products that we have under our umbrella. We do corporate campaigns, documentaries, television commercials, creative videos, and more. We have seen a huge niche develop in the film industry in this region, and we feel we are well placed. We have enough knowledge and expertise to give it a shot. That is where we are going—we will be making Zambian films for the global market.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the film aspect of your business?</h4><p>I have looked at how the film industry has helped the Nigerian economy transform itself. Looking at Zambia, I always feel fortunate to be here because it has not been exploited as much as possible, and this gives you breathing space as a business. Besides that, I never say we are “landlocked;" we are “land-linked." Being centrally positioned, I feel that it is actually a convergence point for our markets and it is easy for us to get to Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. I believe that because we have not been exploited, this is a chance to get an industry that will be particularly regional and we can come up with a product that is a global product. My approach to it is not to take baby steps, and that is why we have bought Hollywood-standard pro-equipment. We are ambitious, hence we are not thinking of small festivals or short films or gradual growth; we are thinking of coming up with blockbusters. The idea of procuring very expensive equipment is that we do not want our creations or our productions to be judged based on the format. We are comfortable that we will be judged based on our creative output. Besides the personal achievement, being a pioneer in the media industry makes you feel that you are setting a benchmark. This is always a factor in respect to being a businessperson in Africa. When people see a plane, they think there is no way a local person built that plane. However, all it takes is one local person to put something together and that creates a chain reaction. Then people tend to start believing in themselves.</p><h4>How would you assess demand for advertising services in the Zambian market?</h4><p>The demand is slowly changing. Now we have some capacity in Zambia and people have stopped importing a lot of advertising services and are contracting locals. Zambia is a young country to a certain extent, and we are in an education phase. In the past two or three years things have been moving extremely fast with social media helping to drive that pace of change.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Link Zambia 8,000 project improve the efficiency of transport within Zambia?<br></h4><p>During the design of Link Zambia 8,000, we reviewed the road links within the country in terms of connectivity between towns, provinces, and regions. We established that in some cases, we had long winding routes and that we needed to create direct road links between provinces. For example, if you are coming out of Tanzania into Chama, you have to go through Lusaka—a distance of 1,700 kilometers. With the new road link between Chinsali and Chama, you will be able to connect in less than 170 kilometers. In terms of transit time and operating costs for truckers, there will be huge savings. That is the thinking that went into the design and formation of Link Zambia; we looked at the best connectivity between towns and provinces to reduce transit time and the cost of running trucks. Another example is currently if you are going from Lusaka to Kasempa, you go through Solwezi in the Copperbelt. But now the route will go through Mumbwa, reducing the distance by 400 kilometers, which is a good four to five hours reduction in travel time. Link Zambia is intended to facilitate trade within Zambia and across borders.</p><h4>What role does this infrastructure play in transforming Zambia from a landlocked country into a land-linked country?</h4><p>Our role is basically to execute government programs, and this is a government program. We are the executing agents of the government and we implement the program through annual plans. We have a strategic plan that spans from 2012 to 2016; it is a five-year program in which we have outlined which roads we will do and when. Now we are improving our connectivity in Zambia. The other thing we have done recently is establish a vendor rating system. This is a scheme that is intended to rate the performance of both the contractors and the supervisors to insure that they deliver to the standards that we have established. We have set 60% as the minimum benchmark to qualify. If anyone goes below that level, they will not have an opportunity to bid for contracts.</p><h4>What other infrastructure have you developed to connect Zambia to its neighboring countries?</h4><p>For Namibia we have a bridge that was constructed some years ago on the Zambezi River. That was built prior to the establishment of the RDA. We are also doing a link through the DRC going to the northern part of Zambia to Luapula Province; that road is famously called the Pedicle Road. The government of Zambia is constructing that road through many other countries' territories. That link might be completed by mid-2015. It is a shorter link between the Copperbelt and Luapula Province. It will also pass over a bridge that the RDA constructed five years ago, the Mombasa Bridge. We have another project with Zimbabwe and we have constructed some bridges that we are using for trucking goods between the countries. However, they are congested, hence the need to open up new routes.</p><h4>What is the potential for Zambia to become a hub for central transport in the region?</h4><p>Once Link Zambia is fully implemented, Zambia is going to become the natural hub—more like a warehouse or distribution center for goods in the region. We are surrounded by eight countries, meaning we are well-placed to play that critical role. We think that the move that the government has taken to improve our road network will accelerate the attainment of that natural hub. When I was at school, I was taught that being landlocked as a country was a disadvantage for Zambia; it was a negative factor. However, we see it as a great opportunity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the construction industry contribute to the country's rapid growth rate?<br></h4><p>The construction sector has been growing at a rate of about 17.5% on average for the past few years. That clearly shows you that it is a major contribution to the economy if the growth of the construction sector is about 17.5% on average; in 2013 it was in the range of 23%. That translates to about a 1.5%-1.6% contribution to the real GDP of the overall economy. When you talk about the construction sector, you are looking at roads, commercial and housing development, and also construction that is related to mining activity. In the end, you see gigantic growth in the sector.</p><h4>How are the new mines that are starting to be operated contributing to the industry sector in Zambia?</h4><p>When you look at what is going on as the mining sector increases its activities, this translates more into construction activity. For example, when you look at the opening of the Kalumbila mine in North Western Province, it is a completely new establishment in terms of the mine itself and the support infrastructure, including housing to support the mining activities, water, sanitation, and the development of roads in that area. The trend that we have seen in the past few years in terms of the construction sector will continue for the next few years to come. Zambia is a developing country, and many areas are just being opened up and developed. We see that this trend will continue. We may even hit growth of 28% over the next three to four years.</p><h4>Solwezi is one of Africa's boom towns. What opportunities are there for foreign contractors?</h4><p>When you look at Solwezi and the way it was planned, it was a small town and it was not expected that there would be mining activities. With the coming of the mining activities, we plan to construct over 600 housing units. That is just Phase I. Of course, Solwezi is the place to be because it is not only housing, but shopping malls and the airport, which needs to be upgraded so that it can assist mining activities. There is a lot of potential in Solwezi.</p><h4>How is the National Council for Construction (NCC) fostering growth in the construction industry in Zambia?</h4><p>In Zambia, Act No. 13 of 2003 empowers the NCC to register all companies that are participating in the Zambian construction sector. The Act mandates that we should develop the construction industry, not just by rating them, but also by providing training to the contractors and making sure that all the necessary skills are imparted on local contractors. For foreign contractors, we encourage them to come and work with us here, but the main emphasis is that the foreign contractors should work with local contractors so that there is knowledge and skills transfer. Yes, foreign contractors will come when there is a boom, but when construction slows down, the foreign contractors may leave the country. We will still need contractors to maintain the infrastructure, the roads, water systems, the mining facilities, and the buildings. We always encourage foreign contractors to come to the country, especially those with innovations in various construction materials and technics. Zambia has a lot of construction materials that can be developed not just for local use, but probably even for export purposes.</p><h4>How many companies do you have registered at the NCC?</h4><p>We have slightly over 4,000 contractors registered with the NCC, and over 95% of these are Zambian contractors. Most Zambian companies are still small, and can only take on jobs up to around $1.5 million in value. Most of the high-value jobs, in excess of say $2 million-$3 million, are done by only a few companies, and the majority of these are foreign companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of the Bank of Zambia's (BoZ's) recent steps to restore financial stability?<br></h4><p>Information filtering from the markets indicates that the BoZ has managed to bring the financial system to an appreciable level of stability after facing challenges that included a liquidity overhang in early 2014 and exchange rate volatility during most of 1H2014. These issues were compounded by rising inflationary pressures. In light of these challenges, measures had to be taken to tighten monetary policy by raising the statutory reserve ratio from 8% to 14% in March, followed by an increase in the policy rate to 12% in April 2014. At the end of May, the BoZ extended the application of statutory reserve ratios to government and other deposits that were not already subjected to the statutory reserve requirement. This was in addition to raising the penalty rate on the overnight lending facility and limiting banks' access to the facility to once a week. Furthermore, commercial banks' compliance with statutory reserves maintenance was reduced to a daily average frequency from a weekly average. The overall effect of these measures was tighter liquidity conditions and an increase in interest rates, particularly interbank rates. However, these measures also helped to achieve relative stability in the foreign exchange market and moderated inflationary pressures. Following the restoration of this balance, the bank embarked on a process of easing liquidity conditions through open market operations (OMO), a policy that has resulted in the decline of interbank rates to levels consistent with the policy rate.</p><h4>How have supportive interventions helped to diversify Zambia's export base?</h4><p>Supportive interventions by the government in pursuit of diversification in areas such as agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism have been helpful in contributing to the diversification of Zambia's export base. This is reflected in the high growth rates posted by non-traditional export (non-metal) earnings. The non-traditional export earnings have rapidly increased over the last 10 years from $392.2 million in 2003 to $3.4 billion in 2013. However, we need to maintain this growth momentum so that non-traditional export earnings have a bigger share of exports, now at just over one-third, than metal exports earnings.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the greatest opportunity for growth and export potential?</h4><p>There are opportunities for realizing growth and boosting exports in several sectors of the economy. Firstly, Zambia is endowed with large, arable, fertile, virgin land supported by positive weather conditions and 40% of the Southern African Development Community's (SADC) fresh water resources, suitable for the kinds of tropical and sub-tropical crops required for profitable investment in this sector. The potential for floricultural and horticultural products for export is immense. In addition to creating an attractive environment, the government has identified farming blocks, earmarked for large-scale farming, in which the private sector can invest. It is providing feeder roads, communications, power, and irrigation facilities in these regions. Then, there is the huge potential for manufacturing based on agricultural produce as inputs, high-value industrial crops for export, and crop-processing plants such as canning factories and oil processing plants. There is also scope for the development of the beef and dairy industry for local consumption and export. Tourism is the second sector of considerable growth potential and for the generation of foreign exchange. The natural beauty and wealth of wildlife in the country have yet to be fully exploited. There are 19 national parks and 34 game management areas totaling 65,000 square kilometers. In addition, there is considerable room for investment in the hotel industry. Thirdly, the opportunities for further investments in the financial sector still abound to enhance competition and promote efficiency in the delivery of services. Since financing is a key factor for increased economic activity, investment in the expansion of this sector is considered to be a catalyst for economic growth and increased exports. Fourthly, the energy sector in Zambia offers potential, with the capacity to generate hydropower from available water resources. In view of the nation's electricity supply deficit following high growth rates and high regional demand for energy, investment in more electricity generation would spur growth and earn the country more foreign exchange. Construction is also a growing and highly promising sector. As the economy grows, the need for the expansion of infrastructure such as roads, housing, and office accommodation is also increasing, thereby creating investment opportunities for the private sector. For its part, the government has initiated road construction projects such as Link Zambia 8000, Pave Zambia 2000, and the Lusaka 400 kilometers road rehabilitation and construction projects, which are expected to create jobs and open up new areas for investment by the private sector. Transport and communications is yet another key sector. Investment opportunities in transport and communications are also available largely due to the size of the country, where people and goods have to travel long distances to well-established population centers as most of the population is in the rural areas. Last, but not least, although the mining sector is the mainstay of the economy, there is still great potential for its advancement. The country has abundant known mineral deposits, about 6% of the world's known copper reserves, and much of this has yet to be exploited, particularly in the northwestern part of the country. Other opportunities include the exploitation of gold, iron, manganese, zinc, coal, nickel, and gemstones, including emeralds, aquamarine, topaz, opal, and amethyst. Diamond and uranium reserves have also been identified.</p><h4>What steps is BoZ taking to boost financial inclusion in Zambia, and what are your targets in this respect?</h4><p>The financial sector has shown tremendous volume growth over time, with total assets increasing from ZMK4.67 billion in 2002 to ZMK45.98 billion by end-June 2014. Despite making significant improvements in all the areas relating to financial viability, profitability, and competitiveness, there are concerns that banks and non-bank financial institutions have not been able to include vast segments of the population into the fold of basic banking services. The latest FinScope survey in Zambia conducted in 2009 indicated that overall financial inclusion had increased by 3.6%, from 33.7% of adults in 2005 to 37.3% in 2009. The level of financial inclusion is now 42% in urban areas and 34.4% in rural areas. This scenario underscores the importance that the BoZ attaches to increasing financial inclusion, which has been adopted as one of the Bank's key strategic tasks with the objective of raising financial inclusion by 15 percentage points to 50% by 2015. This goal is being pursued through a broad range of coordinated interventions, with a high priority on the following; firstly the promotion of the delivery of banking services outside traditional bank branches through agent banking or branchless banking using additional touch points such as existing retail stores and petrol stations. In this regard, the BoZ has developed a regulatory framework for agency banking to encourage financial institutions to bring banking services to the currently unbanked in all parts of the country. Second, the continued pursuance of the mobile banking and payment system through mobile phones to lessen the cost and address the barrier to financial inclusion brought about by long distances to access points. Zambia is a sparsely populated country with a population of 13 million people across 750,000 square kilometers. Third, the development of a Unified Collateral Registry that will encourage lenders to accept diverse movable property as collateral for credit such as accounts receivable, livestock, equipment, vehicles, and so on, thereby increasing access to finance, especially for SMEs. Fourth, transformation of the existing uniform Know-Your-Customer (KYC) guideline into a simplified Risk-Based Tiered Framework that allows individuals that currently do not have the required formal identification measures to enter the banking system. Fifth, the implementation of the national strategy on financial education for Zambia to empower Zambians with the knowledge, understanding, skills, motivation, and confidence to help them to secure positive financial outcomes. A Financial Education Coordinating Unit was formed and tasked with the implementation of the strategy and developing an index to gauge the depth and breadth of financial services in Zambia. This will enable the Bank to measure the impact of the interventions implemented to increase financial inclusion on a regular basis.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the Zambian economy?</h4><p>After the liberalization and structural adjustment of the economy in the 1990s, the Zambian economy has strong economic pillars that will make growth endure for some time. This will be supported by the infrastructure development program the country is currently undertaking. There are a number of power plants upcoming, rail and road rehabilitation is progressing well, education facilities are being improved, and new ones are under construction, which include new health facilities. There is a broad-based FDI placement and an increasingly diversified export base. These developments make us confident at the Bank that economic prospects for the medium term are bright. Things are generally looking up in the economy and growth will continue to be robust in the short to medium term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[peer-to-peer-cooperation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Since June 2011, the Bank of Zambia (BoZ) and Norges Bank have been engaged in a technical cooperation (TC) program where Norges Bank has been given the opportunity to share practical insights from our own modernization efforts with our colleagues from the BoZ. The program is scheduled to run until September 2015, but evaluations done so far show that the BoZ has already made substantial progress in all program areas. We are impressed with our colleagues' ability to develop new capacity and implement new structures.<br></p><h4>FIVE PILLARS</h4><p><strong>The program focuses on five key areas of development:</strong></p><p>Moving toward an inflation-targeting framework for monetary policy: Building capacity in the various fields necessary for conducting monetary policy within an inflation-targeting framework is clearly the largest single stream of the project. It concerns many aspects of both the formulation and the implementation of monetary policy as well as their prerequisites. Norges Bank has shared insights in the development of macroeconomic models and analytical frameworks, the enhancement of interbank money and foreign exchange markets, deepening of the secondary market in government securities, as well as the enhancement of liquidity forecasting techniques and reporting.</p><p><strong>Financial stability analyses and reporting:</strong></p><p>Systemic financial crises in developed and developing countries around the world have highlighted the need for systematic monitoring of financial system stability as an addition to the supervisory work on financial institution stability. Norges Bank has worked with the BoZ in developing tools for analysis including stress testing, early warning indicators, financial stability indicators, and crisis preparedness.</p><p>Payment system oversight and structural framework enhancement: An efficient and account-based payment system will lower transaction costs and reduce the security challenges that the storage and transport of currency represent. The central bank is the operator of the top-level payment system of the nation where banks settle their internal payments, and monitors stability and efficiency in systems providing payment services to the general public. Norges Bank has worked with the BoZ in developing frameworks and procedures for payment system oversight and provided guidance in introducing a national automatic switch that will facilitate interoperability between the banks offering payment services in Zambia.</p><p><strong>Currency management:</strong></p><p>Zambia is still largely a cash-based economy. Most transactions are settled using cash, and cash also has an important role as a store of value. Therefore, the efficiency related to all aspects of currency operations is important. For the financial industry and the BoZ the costs associated with the logistical system, i.e. procurement, distribution, collection, and destruction, is of great importance. Norges Bank has worked with the BoZ on improving the cost of currency management, including the development of automated currency management systems, and the development of staff capacity in wholesale currency management.</p><p><strong>Organizational review:</strong></p><p>Over the years, Norges Bank has changed its organization considerably to create a lean organization that focuses on core central banking activities. Against this background, Norges Bank has shared insights in organizational review, including planning, budgeting, performance management systems, and webpage development.</p><p>The execution of the TC program is under the supervision and quality control of the IMF, and financed by resources provided by the Norwegian authorities, with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as partner in the program. A long-term resident advisor recruited from Norges Bank coordinates, monitors, and follows up program activities.</p><h4>KEY SUCCESS CRITERIA</h4><p>The distinctive features of this cooperation program are its medium-term outlook and the central bank-to-central bank cooperation that serves as the main vehicle for development and capacity building. We believe they are also key to the program's success so far.</p><p>The road to creating a positive and noticeable impact is much shorter when one central bank cooperates directly with another, sharing both insights and practical solutions for analysis and policy implementation on an expert-to-expert level. It is our considered view that the program is able to achieve most of its objectives in the short to medium term through a delicate balancing act; we divide our energies between the allocation of sufficient time to enable knowledge sharing, transfer, and implementation on one side, and allowing for sufficient time-pressure necessary for steady progress on the other.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year marked a significant growth period for Zambia National Commercial Bank (Zanaco) in terms of number of customers, loan portfolio, and bricks and mortar development. To what do you attribute this performance?<br></h4><p>Our performance in 2013 was marked by a couple of events. Business growth was strong, at approximately 20% across both business lines and, as you rightly pointed out, the number of customers increased. It is an ambition of the group to have a million customers by 2015. We have around 820,000 customers at present, meaning we are on track for achieving that. In 2013, we also completed a major IT upgrade for the bank, which took time and effort, but will generate positive results in the long term. Many of our customers want to bank with us because of their expectations of what we can provide, which creates a few headaches for us in terms of our branch network and distribution platforms. However, this is a good problem to have, because we are dealing with the challenges that this demand creates, but focusing heavily on customer service.</p><h4>Does this level of demand signal branch-network growth?</h4><p>Going forward, we realize that our strategy is not about more bricks and mortar, it is more about trying to develop better distribution channels. We approach this challenge through agents, and we always try to link up with agents that are within walking distance of a branch. This means that even if you cannot get served at a branch because it is too busy, clients can take a short walk to an agent's office and complete simple banking transactions there. They cannot process a loan, but they can do pretty much everything else in terms of transactions. We have improved on our transactional banking facilities through products such as Xapit, which is a mobile banking product that provides basic functionality for sending money to accounts and paying bills. That basically means that you do not need more branches, but you do need to grow the agent network. We will continue to build branches; however, this will likely take two or three more years.</p><h4>How would you assess the maturity of mobile banking in Zambia, and how significant is it for Zanaco?</h4><p>It is generally known that Xapit was the first mobile banking-based application. It took off rapidly and has grown robustly ever since. In terms of penetration, you can still do more, and we have a financial inclusion goal, which means trying to reach out and bank the unbanked. By unbanked I do not mean unbankable; I am referring to the people who should have bank accounts but do not. We are not just taking anyone on board, but it does mean reaching out into rural areas. Urban banking is quite well catered for, as there are 19 registered banks in Zambia, of which four or five control about 80% of the market, and the rest compete over the remainder. If you live in a city or a major town you have pretty good access to banking, which is why our goal is in rural areas.</p><h4>In 2007, Rabobank purchased 49% of Zanaco's shares. What potential does Rabobank see in this purchase, and how does the situation of today compare?</h4><p>In the late 1990s, there was a push from the World Bank to make governments, which they were previously funding, transform their commercial sector and get out of banking and sell off some assets that should be in private hands. When it came into the 2000s, Zambia and other countries started to reassess how they privatized these assets. They started off by selling a 49% offering, meaning the government still wanted to retain 51%. They were looking for partners that made a social offering as well as pushing the development agenda. In particular, they looked favorably on institutions that could positively support the rural sector and farming. Rabobank's international activities were strongly linked to food and agriculture; it looked at countries where there was the potential to do more in the food and agriculture space. When it looked at Africa, it was clear that most of the continent can grow crops; yet, some places can grow more than others and have more suitable climates, better access to water, and more available land. From a food security point of view, to feed a population that is predicted to reach 9 billion by 2050, we basically have to double production. Sub-Saharan Africa has the available land; it is just under utilized. It is arable, and it can be used for agriculture in a productive manner to produce high yields.</p><h4>What would you say has been Zanaco's impact on the agri-food space?</h4><p>It has been significant because it came from virtually nothing when it started in 2007, but it now represents about 25% of our portfolio. We have an advantage partly because of the government shareholding, as we take a long-term perspective when it comes to agriculture. Agriculture is traditionally something that banks accommodate when conditions are good, and avoid during the hard times. We view it as a business of considerable volatility, but equally we think we have a unique knowledge and experience, and we are committed to the long term. Zambia is dominated by around 700 corporate farmers or commercial farmers, typically part of major enterprises from Australia or Europe. The next level is what we call “emerging farmers," which is an interesting sector. After that, there are the small-scale farmers that are still businesses that produce a profit. Some of these need to be better organized, which we do through farmer cooperatives and associations. We access these farmer groups through the Zambia National Farmers Union, which is also a shareholder in Zanaco. We lend to the cooperative/association, which select beneficiary farmers for these loans.</p><h4>What comprises the remaining 75% of your portfolio?</h4><p>The bulk of it comes from two other areas. We deal with many of the flagship companies, but this is still a relatively small market in this country. The other area is personal loans for salaried workers, which is a common product that you see in Africa. It is basically an unsecured advance against a commitment from the salary of the individual. Typically, we enter into schemes with employers and divert a portion of the salary for loan repayment.</p><h4>What is your medium-term vision for the future of Zanaco?</h4><p>We want to continue making profits as we are a publicly listed company and need to recognize our responsibilities to shareholders. The ultimate game is to continue growing the business. The country is not overbanked, despite the high number of banks, although a major part of the population remains unbanked, whereby it appears as though there is no market. I am optimistic about the potential. It is also important to balance our portfolio more to achieve a better spread of our business. I would like to see us continue to grow in agriculture, and to develop more of a balance between the retail and wholesale markets in order to mirror the economy as much as possible. Improving customer service remains the greatest challenge for Zanaco.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-future-is-micro]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Pensions and Insurance Authority (PIA) started its activities in 2005. What have been your main achievements since then?<br></h4><p>The PIA is a regulatory and advisory authority in the pensions and insurance sectors. We have seen growth in terms of premiums written by insurance companies as well as a rise in net assets and premium returns. We have seen the number of players in the market increase as well, both local and foreign. We have also noted some stability in the industry that we think was the result of the various measures that we have put into place. We think that is generally good for the financial sector.</p><h4>What measures or steps have you taken in terms of spurring growth in premiums and net assets?</h4><p>In 2005, we passed the Pension Scheme Regulation Act, and then there was also the Insurance Act. In those acts, you can see that there were certain functions like the requirement to separate life and non-life insurance. It has thus become easier to manage because the fundamentals for a life insurance company are different from those of a non-life company. We have seen similar separations for the pension sector, where you have asset managers and pension administrators. There was a proposal for custodial services as well. In terms of pensions, we have seen new entities coming in, and foreign companies entered the market with new and innovative products that helped to increase the insurance penetration rate. This is better for the customer in the end because there is more competition and the providers have also worked to improve their systems.</p><h4>The growth in the insurance and pension sectors has been at about 3.6% annually since 2006. What have been some of the main drivers for this growth?</h4><p>One of the main drivers for this growth has been the micro-insurance sector. In the past, there were few people who were really benefitting from the insurance sector, but now we are trying to broaden that by having a number of insurance participants in the financial sector. We have seen a number of participants offering micro-insurance products to various people such as farmers, and we think that is positive because we want people to get into the habit of using the financial sector.</p><h4>What strategies do you use to allow these microfinance companies to work and acquire clients?</h4><p>We are working with the other two financial regulators; those are the Bank of Zambia and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Through the government, we have what we call the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), where we are trying to develop the sector together. Each regulator will focus on its own area of expertise, but now we have a central unit that will deal with educating people on how to use the services that are available. It has been quite helpful because we go out as a team and pay visits, and also when there are trade fairs and shows. Financial inclusion is the idea; we would even like to bring it into the school curriculum.</p><h4>How has technology spurred penetration of the insurance sector over the recent years?</h4><p>Mobile phone companies are playing a major role with mobile money and related products. Imagine all of the subscribers being insured; that would have a really serious impact. These innovations came late in 2013 and early in 2014, and we think that it will start to take off. We would like to see 4%-5%growth, and we expect it to grow to over 5% in the future.</p><h4>You pointed to micro insurance as one of the key sectors that has driven the growth in the insurance industry; what others do you see?</h4><p>Construction has contributed in a way, but it could have been much higher. With the participation of foreign companies, it was lower than it could have been. Micro-insurance, construction, and agriculture are the main industries that have propelled the insurance sector, especially micro-insurance because it focuses on agriculture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SABMiller has about 200 brands, and operates in 15 African countries. Within that big picture, where does Zambia fit in and how important is it?<br></h4><p>Zambia fits into the African stable, as one of the top four or five focus countries for Africa, because of the opportunities for growth that we have seen that the Zambian economy presents. Zambia fits in the same perspective as Tanzania, Mozambique, and Nigeria, so Zambia is in there as one of the key markets for SABMiller in Africa.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in consumption?</h4><p>I think the underlying thing is that Zambia is still fundamentally underdeveloped. I am sure you read the statistics; about 60% of people are living below the poverty line. So, we still see affordability as a key issue in terms of being relevant to Zambian consumers. However, in that area, Zambian consumers are like all other consumers; they are looking for choice, so even in the area of affordable beverages, there is quite a bit of competition and fragmentation, and that is why you see spirits being reasonably strong. We are not talking about premium spirits, but more mainstream and cheap spirits, especially at the lower end where affordability is key. However, we are seeing the impact of a growing middle class. As the economy grows, you see this emergence, and you can see that the middle class is growing quite strongly just from residential construction in areas like Lusaka. So we are obviously seeing a preference for more premium products, with which one can differentiate. We are trying to make sure that we stay relevant to this consumer with the global brands that we have here, such as Miller Genuine Draft and Peroni. Also, we have re-launched Mosi Gold, and we are really excited about the initial reactions to that.</p><h4>How do you source your raw materials, and how do you see that sector advancing?</h4><p>Agriculture is central to our strategy going forward. In fact, we have a new global sustainable development vision that we launched a few months ago called “Prosper." We are looking to articulate agriculture there as one of the key imperatives that underpin the success of our business going forward. For example, supporting productivity in brewing crops also improves productivity in agriculture generally. For five seasons now we have had a program where we source all of our barley locally in Zambia. We started this as a pilot program five seasons ago, and we were actually quite blown away by the success we had. The barley grain is very successful in Zambia and it is a commercial undertaking because of the nature of the crop. It is a winter crop, and it requires irrigation and is quite technical, a bit like wheat. We achieve incredible yields here; our best farmers achieve yields of over 10.5 tons per hectare, which is actually quite staggering. The other area we have been involved in agriculture is the sorghum that we use for our Eagle Lager. We have not had a direct relationship with the growers in the same way as we have with the barley growers, but it is an area where we continue to progress and we have been trying to work out the kinks in the technical area. There is another one that I have not mentioned and that is our relationship with Zambia Sugar for its input into our soft drinks. Of course, there is maize, which you can over look because it is such a widely available crop in Zambia. However, maize is obviously the main ingredient of our opaque beer, Chibuku.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your performance in the last five years and how has the car industry in Zambia evolved?</h4><p>Zambia's new vehicle industry has been growing at a slow pace over the past five years from 3,500 units a year to about 4,500 in 2013. The 2014 forecast is 4,700 units. Economists have a highly optimistic growth outlook of about a 20%, which should take the total market size to 6,500 units by 2017. Nevertheless, compared to the second-hand imported vehicles market, it is still a relatively small amount—there were about 40,000 grey imports in 2013. General Motors South Africa (GMSA) has supported us in introducing the Chevrolet Brand for Africa in 2010, allowing us to participate in the passenger segment through providing off-road ready SUVs and reasonably priced saloon cars. In 2013, we were market leaders in the saloon new vehicle sales segment, which is a big achievement as the majority of used vehicle imports are in fact passenger saloon vehicles.</p><h4>To what do you owe your growth?</h4><p>Although many of the new vehicle sales are owed to government purchases, we have seen a growth in purchases from private consumers and businesses. Also, thanks to a number of macro-economic developments taking place in the country, a growing middle class, and the introduction of vehicle finance by commercial banks and other financial lenders as well as a reduction in interest rates, our market share doubled in 2013. Coupled with a rigorous marketing campaign with the support of GMSA through advertising in a variety of media outlets, including social media, we partner with organizations such as the Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) and the American Chamber of Commerce, which have successfully helped in promoting the Chevrolet and Isuzu Brands. In addition, throughout the year, we sponsor a number of events with the aim of bringing families together, such as the Urban Circus. Most importantly, Action Auto's commitment to providing customer service of the highest standard through following the GM Difference Standards have also helped in creating a number of life-long customers. A significant percentage of our sales are generated from word-of-mouth endorsements and the enthusiasm of our existing customers, some of whom own four or five generations of the Isuzu KB.</p><h4>Which of your products has the biggest demand?</h4><p>The Isuzu KB pickup has been and still remains our biggest brand in terms of sales volume. The Isuzu KB has a legendary and iconic status for its toughness and dependable performance, whilst offering versatility and comfort. It is designed and engineered to deliver each time you are behind the wheel, and most importantly built to endure rough roads and terrain. Although the Chevrolet Brand has grown in popularity, a major factor is price. In Zambia, the duty is less on a utility vehicle like the Isuzu compared to a passenger vehicle. Compounded taxes on utility vehicles are about 46%, and on a saloon car or a station wagon they are 94%. This makes the price difference quite substantial and therefore also contributes to the sales in volume.</p><h4>Second-hand car sales pose a big threat to the new car market in Zambia. What strategies are you following to compete with this industry?</h4><p>Current legislature allows for second-hand vehicles from Japan and the UK to be imported into Zambia aimed at affording the average citizen the opportunity to own a vehicle. Over 40,000 grey units were imported in 2013. Regrettably, a large percentage of these units are ill equipped for African requirements and, in most cases, over 10 years old, and this unfortunately has contributed to an increase in road traffic accidents. Our strategy is to offer vehicles with constantly improving technology made specifically for African weather, terrain, and road conditions. Our after-sales support, service kits, parts and accessories are also restricted to GMSA-sourced vehicles.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Tobacco Board play in Zambia's agricultural sector?<br></h4><p>The Tobacco Board of Zambia (TBZ) is a statutory organ of the government. It is the organization that protects and promotes the tobacco industry on behalf of the government. It oversees the whole tobacco supply, including production, marketing, processing, and manufacturing. TBZ is involved in the regulation of the industry and there are many players growing the crop. We have tobacco merchants, who sponsor the production of tobacco by the small-scale and commercial farmers.</p><h4>What types of tobacco are currently grown in Zambia?</h4><p>Zambia produces three main types of tobacco, namely Virginia Flue Cured, Burley, and Dark Fire Cured tobacco. The main one is Virginia flue-cured, which makes up about 70% of production, about 29% is Burley, and about 1% is Dark Cured Tobacco. Zambia has very good climatic condition and suitable soils for tobacco.</p><h4>What growth has the production of Zambian tobacco experienced in the recent years and what are your main markets?</h4><p>We are seeing a strong growth in production. For example, 10 years ago, Zambia produced about 30 million kilograms of all types of tobacco annually. In 2013 Zambia produced about 41 million kilograms. That volume continues to rise, and in 2014 we are expecting to produce about 45 million kilograms; 99% of Zambian produced tobacco is exported. Our main markets are in Asia, with the largest buyer being China, followed by Europe, with Russia and Belgium leading the list. Zambian tobacco is well known for its high flavor and aroma. With adequate investment, Zambia has the potential to produce over 200,000 tons annually.</p><h4>How do you export the tobacco from Zambia, and how will new transport infrastructure benefit the industry?</h4><p>In Zambia we only have one processing plant, which cannot process all the tobacco, and therefore most of the tobacco is exported in leaf form, mostly by rail or road. If you look at the infrastructure in Zambia at this point, we have the rail line from Chipata to the sea port of Beira in Mozambique. This rail link is operational and it will help us to increase our exports. The new road infrastructure going on in the country will also help to improve the efficiency of transporting tobacco. Apart from the Southern, Central, and Western provinces, we have opened new areas in the northern part of the country in Northern, Luapula, and Muchinga Provinces, and these areas are linked by an all-weather road network that is currently under construction.</p><h4>Where are the main regions where tobacco is cultivated in Zambia?</h4><p>The main regions are the Eastern Province, suitable for Burley, and then we have Central and Southern suitable for Virginia flue Cured, as well as Western Province. Nevertheless, these tobacco-growing areas make up a very small percentage of the total arable land in Zambia. The potential to produce large volumes of tobacco in Zambia is enormous.</p><h4>What is the difference in the quality of tobacco produced in Zambia compared to other African producers?</h4><p>Zambian tobacco is high in quality. It is one of the best not only in Africa, but also the world; especially the Virginia tobacco, which is well known for its aroma and flavor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-mechanics-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the development of Saro Agro Industrial in recent times?<br></h4><p>Our involvement in the agriculture sector is restricted to the supply of equipment for utilization on farms, including preparation equipment, spraying equipment, and irrigation equipment. We do not get involved in the commodities, fertilizers, or anything else of that nature. We have also developed our business in the generating sector, which means that we sell generating sets and the equipment needed for the production of electricity. Thirdly, we have also gone into solar equipment on the same basis. These developments have made us the leading suppliers of equipment to the agricultural sector. And it is not just sales and resales; it is integrated in the sense that we have also got a manufacturing unit and a steel fabrication unit behind our shop. We fabricate products such as trailers, bowsers, and thereafter tankers, including tanks for mines and for the agricultural sector.</p><h4>What is your customer base for products such as solar equipment and generators?</h4><p>For solar products and generators, it is the farmers themselves, usually the small-scale farmers. We supply and service the smallest farm holdings in the villages where they have to use an ordinary plow with ox-driven equipment. We work from that level, up to hand-operated equipment for planting seeds, to harvesting the products, and going up to the level of motorized equipment, such as small 16-horsepower walking tractors, all the way up to huge tractors. The mechanization of Zambia has been advanced and promoted by the government in a significant way, and we can cater to that whole spectrum of farmers.</p><h4>Which products are you seeing the most demand for?</h4><p>We have seen the tractor division and the requirements for tractors steadily increasing, mainly because of the growth in the emerging farmers. They are the indigenous farmers who used to have about four hectares and can now handle 20, or 40, or 100 hectares. Over this period, we have found that these private farmers are getting involved in commercial farming, and that is reflected in the increase in the number of farmers in the country and the area under cultivation. As these farmers start using mechanization and tractors, the production of basic foodstuffs in Zambia is going from maize to soybeans, to cotton, to wheat, and numerous other products. And these products are being grown on a large scale. As for the generator sets, the small ones start at 2 kW and we go up to 1,000 kW. The 2 kW operator is a householder or a villager. They will use that 2 kW generating set to run their television and lights. We sell those units every day. We reach up to the larger generating sets, and the main consumers for these are the farmers and industrial operators. In fact, the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) buys large 500 kW generating sets and the power for certain rural areas is supplied that way.</p><h4>What is your long-term view for Saro Agro?</h4><p>Just five years ago, our turnover was only $10 million, and now it is up to $30 million. You can see the growth rate at which the agricultural industry has been moving. As far as Saro is concerned, we have a branch in Mkushi, which is a large farm block in Zambian terms, and that holds considerable investment potential. And we have a branch in Kitwe that can service the farmers as well as the mining sector. We also supply the water-pumping sector; this is split into two—the mining sector and the farming sector. We have inroads into the mining sector, and the mining sector buys a number of these pumps, as well as tractors, trailers, and bowsers to transport the copper ore from one place to another. Our reach is as far as Solwezi. As far as agriculture is concerned, we crisscross east, west, north, and south Zambia. We have agents and subagents all over the country now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On The Wild Side]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-the-wild-side]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tourism arrivals have grown from 700,000 in 2005 to over 800,000 in 2012. What role has ZAWA played in this increase?</h4><p>First and foremost, ZAWA is the institution that is mandated to manage the national parks and the game management areas. Some 80% of tourism activities in Zambia are mainly wildlife based. ZAWA has played a major role because we provide security and law enforcement in our protected areas, and ensure that annual populations are maintained thanks to our activities.</p><h4>ZAWA is a government-funded organization, but you also collect money from the visitors to the protected areas. How much money does this second cash inflow represent in your budget?</h4><p>We have a monthly grant from the government that is not sufficient, but to sustain our operations the law empowers us to create our own revenue through the collection of park entry fees from people who come into the national parks. The operators in the national parks who organize game drives and safaris pay concession fees and other user fees to ZAWA. These sources of revenue vary and compromise roughly put between 72% and 80% of ZAWA's total budget. That forms the greatest part of our revenue; nevertheless, it is not enough to support our entire operation and the need to have more investments in these areas cannot be over emphasized.</p><h4>What access issues does ZAWA face in terms of encouraging visitors?</h4><p>What we have predominantly lacked is infrastructure in our protected areas. The government has embarked on an ambitious program of improving the infrastructure in the country, and in particular the road network, which will allow tourists to access more difficult areas even during the rainy season, as well as allowing us to be open year round.</p><h4>Of all the transport infrastructure that the government is building, which is most important for ZAWA?</h4><p>The road network is number one. There are national parks that have been undiscovered for a long time that will be connected through roads, and such areas will be open for tourism. And at the same time, we have people who are interested in operating businesses in those national parks. But to do so, we need better roads. If you do not have the access roads, people do not want to invest.</p><h4>The government has recently lifted the ban on safari hunting in Zambia. What impact will this have on ZAWA's revenue?</h4><p>Hunting was not banned in Zambia; it was suspended so that the country could take stock of the wildlife resources it had, and the government has now lifted the suspension. Hunting in Zambia takes place in what we call Game Management Areas (GMAs), and it is strictly forbidden in national parks. We have areas in GMAs that are zoned to allow human settlements and provide hunting blocks for safari and resident hunting to take place in accordance with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) standards. The decision to lift the suspension on safari hunting will increase our revenue, and it will benefit both the local communities and the operators themselves. Where we do not have healthy populations of certain species it will not be possible to hunt them, as they will not be on the quota.</p><h4>Africa's lion population has decreased over the past decade. In this context what steps is ZAWA taking to protect it?</h4><p>In Africa, Zambia has the third largest population of lions according to survey reports. And if I am not mistaken, we also rank third in terms of elephants among the elephant range states. The only time that problem animals are permitted to be hunted is when it is not possible to relocate them to other areas for safety. There are a number of conflicts between humans and lions, especially in Kafue National Park, as we have large populations in that ecosystem.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the competitive landscape like for the auditing firms here in Zambia? Where does ZPMG fit into it?<br></h4><p>In Zambia, we have all of the big four firms operating—KPMG, Deloitte, PWC, and Ernst &amp; Young (EY). We also have a fifth one, Grant Thornton. Then we have a number of other mid-sized firms and a host of smaller, local ones with no international connections, and a few self proprietors. It is quite competitive at the moment. If I look at what has happened over the last two or three years, virtually all of the big four firms have rebranded, recapitalized, or restructured their operations. A visible sign of this is that virtually all of them have moved out of the central business district (CBD), as we did in 2011, when the firm was reconstituted. When you look at the movements amongst the firms, there has been a lot of inward investment from the international networks. Some of the other firms have brought in specialist partners to develop certain service lines, and we have done the same, for example, to grow our advisory business. We brought in an infrastructure specialist from the UK at the senior management level. We have added some forensic specialists and have built up our IT advisory unit. We are doing quite a bit to make sure that we get a good share of the cake. The competition is vibrant and it is a positive climate.</p><h4>What was the impetus for all of the big four to rebrand at about the same time?</h4><p>I would say it dovetailed with the growth in Zambia's economy. Zambia has been recognized as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and it is definitely amongst the top five in Africa. There has been a lot of FDI coming in, and even today we get inquiries all the time from people wanting to come to Africa. There must be something here. That really has been the impetus. The growth in Zambia's economy has made the rest of the world wake up. These four firms have realized that Zambia is the place to be, and if they do not develop their practice now and make the investment, it may be too late in five years time.</p><h4>With so much inward investment, what differentiates KPMG?</h4><p>In past years, we were known mostly as an audit and tax compliance firm; however, we are building up our resources in the advisory and management consulting arena and transactions restructuring space, and we have a fully-fledged forensic unit, because there is a great deal of opportunity here for that kind of specialization. We place a lot of emphasis on the quality of our work. When I look at our strategic objectives, it is people first, then quality, profitability, and growth. As a result, the market perspective changes and you get awards such as Auditor of the Year or Consultant of the Year. It is all about market perception, and that perception has changed for the better. Furthermore, we are a young, vibrant firm. Even our recruitment policies are not necessarily recruiting based on qualifications—we want to see drive, passion, and zeal. When I am evaluating a candidate for recruitment, I want to know if this person is going to be better than me. If not, I will not even bother. I want to bring in someone who is sharper than me, who is going to do better than me. That is how to increase the quality of our existing talent.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your client base?</h4><p>Our existing client base is across all sectors. For example, in financial services there are a number of banks. We service the likes of Standard Bank, which is a subsidiary of Standard Bank of South Africa, Bank ABC, a regional bank in southern Africa, Citibank, which is worldwide, Access Bank, which came out of Nigeria, and Indo-Zambia Bank. Locally, there is the Madison Group of companies that has Madison General Insurance, Madison Life, Madison Asset Management, and Madison Financial Services, which has just listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange. In retail, there is Pick n Pay, a major South African chain, and fashion company Foschini. In oil there is Total, in manufacturing, Ndola Lime, in agriculture, Cargill Cotton, and quite a number of others. It is quite a broad range. In real estate, Real Estate Investment Zambia PLC, which owns a number of prime properties, is a client, as is Knight Frank in the real estate business. It is quite a varied client base. When I look at the proportion of international versus local clients, it is probably about 50:50. About 50% is work referred from other KPMG offices, and then 50% is probably local. When I look at the revenues, about 60% derives from local clients and 40% from referred work.</p><h4>Where do you see the most opportunities in the economy?</h4><p>First of all, it is mining. Whether I like it or not, mining looks to be our main foreign exchange earner for years to come. It might not be the highest contributor to GDP, because agriculture is, but mining is what brings in export earnings and what has more of a ripple effect in terms of the entire economy. The price of copper will affect the exchange rate. Mining will always be up there. There are other areas, like tourism. That really has a great deal of untapped potential because much of Zambia is still virgin bush. A number of tourist spots have not been exploited yet. People know Victoria Falls, but no one knows that we have white sand beaches around the lakes near Samfya, for example. There are many other natural sights in other parts of the country, way off the beaten track. Tourism would be a good investment destination for FDI. Another one would be water. Hydroelectricity generation is just waiting to be tapped. Zambia has something like 40% of the water in southern Africa. We have a lot of rivers, waterfalls, and a number of our rivers run at a gradient. There are a number of power projects underway right now. Provided all these power stations come onboard between now and 2018, the power deficit should be wiped out and Zambia should become a net exporter of power. Also, there is an opportunity for a number of independent power plants. Infrastructure and power represents a major opportunity for businesspeople, but it is obviously long term in nature. Another is road and rail infrastructure. In railways, we recently helped Northwest Rail organize financing to build a railway from Solwezi all the way through to Angola. The agreement has been signed and financial closure is expected sometime soon. All these are great opportunities, and it goes back to helping Zambia become a land-linked country. We have also had a query from someone who wants to build a railway from the Northwest province right down through Namibia to the coast. Infrastructure is a great opportunity. Then again, agriculture will always be there. Over 50% of Zambia's land is arable, but only about 14% is actually under cultivation. Yet so much of Zambia is green, but untilled. Agriculture is a major opportunity. If you look at when Zimbabwe had its problems and a number of its farmers crossed the river from Zimbabwe to Zambia, the tobacco production went up well over 50% over a period of two or three years. That shows there is a tremendous amount of untapped potential in agriculture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was Toyota's performance like in Zambia in 2013?<br></h4><p>We are the market leaders. Around 50% of the new vehicles that are sold in Zambia are made by Toyota. In 2013, we maintained our market share, but unfortunately the market is declining. New vehicle sales are declining because of the huge unregulated influx of second-hand vehicles into the country. That has a negative impact on our business.</p><h4>How are you coping with this situation in order to compete with the second-hand market?</h4><p>The average age at time of import for second-hand vehicles that are coming into our market is in excess of 10 years old. Hence, we have been lobbying the government to regulate the industry. At the moment, you can buy a car of any age, in any condition, and bring it into Zambia. There is no regulation of this whatsoever. This is why there are many accidents on our roads. A considerable number of them can be attributed to old vehicles that are not maintained properly; they are run in poor condition, overloaded with people, and have worn tires and other substandard parts.</p><h4>What kind of change in the regulations would you like to see to have a more competitive market?</h4><p>We need an age limit on second-hand imported vehicles. For example, setting a five to six year age limit for imported second-hand cars, as our neighbors do, would be enough. If the industry was regulated, Zambia could have its own second-hand car industry, and we would look at trade-ins. We would be able to give our customers a choice by importing vehicles under five years of age. I think regulating the industry and putting an age limit on vehicles will not only help our country to develop, but will also create business opportunities for Zambians. We would ensure that whatever we bring in and sell, whether on operational lease or second hand, will have a warranty. Toyota Zambia employs 230 people, and we have to spend a lot of money on training and equipment to provide a world-class service to our customers. We are also responsible for corporate social responsibility (CSR) within the country, and we hope Zambia develops a supportive government for its people. However, if the situation remains unregulated, my concern is that we will not have the money to spend on CSR, and we will not be able to support the government by providing jobs.</p><h4>How many second-hand vehicles are sold a month in Zambia, and how many cars does Toyota sell a year in Zambia?</h4><p>Around 5,000 second-hand vehicles are sold monthly in Zambia; in comparison, total new vehicle sales are around 4,500 units annually. Toyota estimates the total vehicle park in Zambia to be around about 500,000 units.</p><h4>How will the new roads benefit your business?</h4><p>Obviously, the roads will make our business important, although it can also have a downside. One of our top-selling vehicles is the Hilux, a pickup truck. That model accounts for probably around 70% of our sales. Once the government has fixed all the roads, people will not need pickups. We saw this happen in Angola. In Angola, we had a 44%-45% market share. Once the roads were fixed, Toyota's market share dropped to 30%. We have the emergence of sedans now, and we have ensured we have a range of those vehicles available for the customers to choose from.</p><h4>Are you planning to sell new vehicles in Zambia now that the road network is being improved?</h4><p>I see a move not to a sedan type of vehicle, but rather to sport utility vehicles (SUVs), of which we will ensure we have a full range available. We already have the Toyota RAV, but will have to make sure we have enough production within that range of vehicles. We are now working in combination with the manufacturers and speaking to our principals to inform them about this trend.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Real Estate Investments Zambia (REIZ) evolve from a cooperative to a leading real estate investment company?<br></h4><p>We have quite an interesting history, which goes back to the 1920s, which is old for this part of the world. The origins of this company were as a cooperative mainly for commercial farmers to consolidate their farming activities and by using the railway for the delivery of crops from around Zambia to Lusaka. Like many cooperatives over the years, it changed its look several times. It retained its position as a cooperative until 1981, when a limited liability company was formed called Farmers House, to which all of the real estate of the cooperative was transferred. The cooperative owners became shareholders of the new company on a one-for-one share basis. From that time on, the company was solely a real estate investment vehicle.</p><h4>How has REIZ addressed the challenges of available capital?</h4><p>For many years, high borrowing rates for the kwacha made property development unaffordable. So when we joined the capital markets, it helped us deal with the challenges of available capital. We have been highly active in the capital markets since then, and we were recognized at the 20th anniversary of the LuSE as the company that has issued the most instruments on the exchange. In 1999, we issued the first LuSE-listed corporate bond and raised $1 million. That corporate bond was convertible, and it actually was converted into equity by all the bondholders. In 2000, we raised $1.98 million via a preference share right issue, which was priced at an 8% coupon and paid in the US dollar. We used both of these instruments to develop our Central Park project. This development on Cairo Road demonstrated a commitment to, and an upgrade of, our assets. Still, one of our development criteria is if we cannot finish a project, we do not start it. In 2003, we raised Zambia's first bank loan of $2.6 million specifically to develop the LuSE building. This was the first ever property development loan in this country secured on the asset itself. It was difficult to get that loan, but it established us as developers who deliver. The next interesting instrument was the issue of a $10 million rights issue for the development of the Celtel/Zain/Airtel Head Office. Through those previous instruments we were able to encourage institutional investment in the company. As a result our list of major shareholders includes almost every major institution in the country, from the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA), Saturnia Regna Pension Trust Fund through the Bank of Zambia pension fund, the Kwacha Pension Trust Fund.</p><h4>What is your current balance between commercial and retail properties?</h4><p>In terms of the assets, Arcades mall is about 45%. Actual retail is a little higher than that, meaning we are about 50:50 between retail and commercial properties. The area we do not have and that is in its nascent stages in Zambia generally is in industrial property. Even in the Western world, if you were a major brewer or bank  you owned your own brewery or head office. Increasingly, a brewery will not own its own brewery, but a property investment company will own it, as long as the brewer can control the production of beer. So that is changing worldwide, where slowly companies do not necessarily own their own fixed assets. The banking sector is interesting, especially following the “sub-prime" crash, where banks are increasingly being assessed on return on capital employed. If you are sitting in, and own half of Wall Street, that capital is locked up and you are not getting a return on that capital. Increasingly banks are di-vesting in property assets releasing that capital to focus on their core business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-turkish-twist]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently called for a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Turkey and Zambia. How can Turkey help African countries realize their potential in the agricultural sector?<br></h4><p>A strategy document for Africa was published on March 26, 2010 with a view to developing a comprehensive strategy to develop political and economic relations with African countries to which Turkey attaches great importance in terms of foreign policy. Within the framework of the strategy, our Ministry sits on a committee under the coordination of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that looks to ensure active cooperation between the relevant ministries, public institutions, and organizations to fulfill the goals defined during the Turkey-Africa Cooperation Summit. In order to establish a legal basis for cooperation possibilities, Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meetings between our country and Zambia will be organized in the near future. Furthermore, Agricultural Steering Committee meetings are also planned. Many African countries suffer from food insecurity, but it will be possible to assist small-scale enterprises and family enterprises once cooperation is enhanced.</p><h4>What investment opportunities exist for Turkish firms in the agriculture sector in Zambia?</h4><p>During the bilateral meeting at our Ministry held within the scope of the visit of Zambian Ambassador HE Miriam Kaseba Mulenga to our country on February 4, 2013, Ambassador Mulenga stated that the government welcomes investments in the country and that all investors will be protected. Zambia has great potential in terms of agricultural investment. Priority areas for Zambia are fertilizers and seeds, with sufficient capacity for the production of the former. Natural resources in Zambia have the quality to support agriculture. The country has rich phosphate reserves, and ammonium nitrate is also found in abundance.</p><h4>How will strengthening agricultural cooperation between Zambia and Turkey serve for the intensification of economic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Turkey's African initiative is of crucial importance to our Ministry. Our government is also putting great emphasis on this policy. Further steps must be taken in the fields of cooperation in trade and agriculture between the two countries. Mutual investment opportunities shall increase through further cooperation. An increase in concrete cooperation opportunities shall contribute to market share and new export opportunities in our general economic relations and shall mutually facilitate trade, especially in agricultural products with high export potential.</p><h4>Turkey is aiming for agricultural exports worth $40 billion a year by 2023. How will that be achieved?</h4><p>In 2002, total agricultural foreign trade was worth over $8 billion and increased by 331% over the last 11 years, reaching some $34 billion in 2013. Moreover, while in 2002 total exports of agricultural products were worth $4 billion, this figure has increased by 343% in the last 11 years and thus rose to $17.7 billion in 2013. A foreign trade surplus of $6 billion was generated in 2013. Since 2002, our country, a major exporter of foodstuffs, has been generating a foreign trade surplus on a regular basis. Turkey's success in exporting both processed and primary agricultural products has been increasing exponentially, and this further contributes to our exports of industrial goods by providing input for industrial products, thus reducing the current account deficit (CAD). Reaching over $40 billion in agricultural product exports is one of the 2023 objectives, and this objective will be achieved via safe food that is in compliance with EU standards as EU legislation has largely been adopted. Today, efficient and effective measures for the control and eradication of plant and animal diseases are taken and food safety is ensured. Turkish goods take their place both in EU markets and on tables across the world. As we have also experienced in the exports of dairy products, the fact that we are in EU markets increases out reliability in the world and thus increases the number of products we export and the number of countries to which we export—Turkey's agricultural goods were exported to 197 countries in 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you play in the educational sector in Zambia?<br></h4><p>We started out in 2007, and have been supplementing the government in providing tertiary education at an undergraduate and graduate level. The results have been good because we have brought on board some programs that had never been offered in the country. We have introduced some programs in public health at the degree level, which is the primary qualification, and have moved on to introduce a Master's degree in public health.</p><h4>What other programs have you brought to Zambia?</h4><p>We offer a degree in insurance and pension management. This is in light of the fact that the insurance and pensions sector is growing, but there has been no higher education qualification being offered at this level in the country. What you have are professional qualifications that are not Zambian, but UK designed. We needed some programs that were homegrown. What we are trying to do is indigenize skills that are based on the resources we have in the country and also match these skills with the environment and the needs of our society. We offer about 21 undergraduate degrees, some of which are also offered by that other universities, while others are unique to our institution. Our approach is to train our graduates to look for alternative solutions to common as well as emerging problems. We want them to be practical. In view of this, we have introduced a certificate in innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><h4>How do you see the new and growing industries influencing Zambians to go for these kinds of degrees?</h4><p>The problem is that the agricultural sector and other sectors are not growing at a rate we would want them to grow, mainly because in some areas we do not have the appropriate skills to manage the sector. Even when you talk about the new industries, they've been there for a long time. What needs to be done now is to actually go back to the drawing board as universities and the Ministry of Education, starting from the primary schools and continuing to university level. Other tertiary institutions also need to look at our curricula and the way things are done. Yes, the students are there, but you need to back them up with a stronger understanding of business. The business and training we need to do should be related to the environment we are in and the natural resources we have as a country.</p><h4>What sector do you feel has the most potential to create employment?</h4><p>Agriculture has the potential to create more jobs. Ours is a landlocked country, but it is land-linked to so many others. We experience a good rainfall pattern, so prospects are good for the sector. But at present we are not utilizing that. It is a great opportunity that will create employment at a high rate. Even the copper business cannot create more employment beyond mining because we are not refining and making products with our raw materials. Our graduates would not understand the next link in the copper value chain. We are not training our engineers to be business minded nor to think how they can create wealth from these natural resources.</p><h4>What is the comparative advantage of being a Zambian graduate?</h4><p>A Zambia-trained worker is a well-trained worker, and any Zambian graduate working abroad can justify their education and training. We have supplied neighboring countries with people to teach in schools and at universities. There were already many Zambians working abroad as doctors and engineers on the strength of our quality national education provision. What we need to do now is to enhance our ICT capacity and improve on infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Panama signed two agreements in 2012 to boost cooperation in the areas of energy and trade. What is your assessment on the relations between both countries?</h4><p>For us, it is energy, and for Panama, which is developing quickly, energy is vital. Recently, a Trinidadian state-owned company called National Petroleum (NP) signed an agreement with a Panamanian company for the distribution of lubricant products. There is also the Energy Partial Scope Agreement that we had before this came as a result of our first agreement for the NP Energy Corporation. There are several other projects from companies that were in need of LPG, because at the time it was advised that there is a third party that was purchasing the LPG and then selling it, which implied very high costs. We looked for ways in which Panama could buy directly from our national gas company, allowing it to buy directly from our producers instead of from a third party, which would help lower costs We were not able to implement that fully because we had contracts with other buyers, some of which will expire in June 2014.</p><h4>What are the main areas of importance for Trinidad &amp; Tobago in Panama, and what is your outlook over the medium term for these relations?</h4><p>For us, the Partial Scope Agreement picked up a lot of agricultural production. Importing food from an area closer to Trinidad and Tobago would be beneficial financially because the costs would be lower for an already elevated food import rate. Another area of keen interest is tourism. We have two kinds of tourism: Trinidad is more business-oriented, while Tobago is still the idyllic island that it was many years ago. Therefore, you can experience the sand, sea, and sun when you come to our nation, while on business. Trinidad is the center for business while Tobago is the place to relax by the sea under the sun. We are also looking for investments in the ICT, maritime, and creative industries sectors, which includes film making, fashion, and music. Our music is some of the most diverse, because our people come from all over the world. It is such a diverse society and music has been influenced by the Spanish, Colombians, Indians, and Africans, with influences from all continents. I think our country has the most public holidays, which is due to the melting pot of religions, creeds and races represented all in one place. Trinidad and Tobago does not have a permanent mission or diplomatic representation in Panama. It is something that we are considering. President Martinelli was vocal in advocating that we establish an office here. Currently, our embassy in Costa Rica is accredited for Panama; however, it is far away. We have an excellent ambassador and she has been promoting Trinidad-Panama trade because of our position in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). I was the Chair of CARICOM until December 2013, and I think that there is tremendous benefit for Panama in liaising with this group of 14 nations, which are still part of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), which includes many Central, Latin, and South American countries. I think Trinidad &amp; Tobago has not had much interaction with Latin and South America. Since Martinelli became President and I took office, I have been working more closely with this part of the world. I do believe in South-South cooperation given the proximity.</p><div class="quote">“President Martinelli was vocal in advocating that we establish an office here."</div><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the new Nacala International Airport infrastructure?</h4><p>The project cost was around $250 million. It had to be expanded as there were many adjustments made throughout the project, although the initial estimate was around $130-150 million. There were some substantial changes to the project; for example, while the initial scheme envisaged a rehabilitation of the existing railway, we had to build an entirely new one, which required massive investment. Also, we had to expand the facilities to make it a future hub. The inauguration took place on the December 13, 2014.</p><h4>What is your strategy regarding air transport agreements and MoUs to bring traffic into the airport?</h4><p>We are in talks to partner with certain huge brands. In handling, we will have one of the largest operations in the world and are considering three handling companies. In Maputo, we have the Mozambique Handling Services company (MHS) and are tendering to sell a 51% stake in the it as we want to bring in a strategic partner in order to ensure that we deliver international-standard service. Another strategic partnership will be made with a catering company. Today, the catering company is owned by the airport and Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique, but we have companies interested in a joint venture. We are also considering bringing in an airport operator to partner us in managing the airport as soon as there is a clear strategy and capacity to attract more airlines. We want a dedicated airport operator with a huge capacity to mobilize airlines to Nacala. Currently, we have secured almost 90% of personnel already trained to operate Nacala International Airport. Our company is 100% Mozambican with all Mozambican employees highly trained to international standards.</p><h4>From which countries will people be able to fly directly to Nacala?</h4><p>Initially, we have Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique securing domestic flights. We have also already secured South African Airlines flights to Nacala. We are quite certain, too, that Ethiopian Airlines and Kenyan Airways will have flights. Kenyan Airlines is already flying to Nampula and will shift its flights to Nacala, and Ethiopian Airlines is already willing to fly to the north of Mozambique and will be open to flying to Nacala. There needs only to be an update of the bilateral agreement in order for them to fly there. Qatar airlines, TAP, and JAAL will also consider flying to Nacala given that bringing people to Maputo and then traveling two and a half hours to the north is impractical. We also have almost confirmed intentions from Lufthansa, Air France, and Emirates to fly to Mozambique. Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique is entering into a partnership with Air Austral from Reunion because many people from Reunion are also keen to invest in Nacala. The director of ENI Mozambique has shown clear interest in linking Nacala to Milan and Oporto. Also, from Anadarko we have heard that there is a need for flights from Houston to Mozambique. From 2015, there will be a large market linking Asia to Mozambique. Nacala Airport can handle aircraft such as Boeing 747s and 847s, and also Airbus 380s.</p><div class="quote">“Nacala has many natural advantages compared with other hubs."</div><h4>What are the main competitive advantages of Nacala becoming the main hub on the east coast of Africa?</h4><p>Nacala has many natural advantages compared with other hubs. Dar es Salaam is very close to Nairobi. And from Nairobi to Nacala is two hours' flight, while Nacala to Johannesburg takes two and a half hours. Secondly, Nacala is located close to a future significant port on the east coast, which is a good combination for a successful hub. Nacala is closer than Nairobi to Singapore, Australia, and other countries, as Nairobi is inland and Nacala is on the coast. Mozambique stands to surpass the GDP of both Tanzania and Kenya over the next 15 years, which will be reflected in air travel statistics. Nacala is closer to the sea than Johannesburg and Nairobi, meaning more savings on fuel at departure and more luggage being carried on departures from Johannesburg and Nairobi. This region represents 120 million people and is growing at an average rate of 5%, while Tanzania and Kenya are at 7%. So as Africa reaches 2.3 billion people by 2050, the area will have almost doubled. In the short run we still need to grow capacity and connectivity in Nacala, and if we do so capacity will surpass that of Nairobi.</p><h4>How would you assess the expansion of the Pemba airport inaugurated in March?</h4><p>We made a small investment of about $5 million on the runway and terminal to cope with the demand of the next four years, while concluding the plans and construction of the new Pemba Airport. We are at the design and feasibility study phase, and expect to submit proposals for study in 2015.</p><h4>What is your strategy for improving competitiveness among airlines and increasing the number of connections and companies operating in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique is growing rapidly, and over the past 10 years international arrivals have grown from 400,000 to around 2.3 million. The airports along the coast are all focused on tourism. We are making airports viable. The government is working with Linhas Aéreas de Moçambique on expansion capable of offering connectivity. Additionally, the strategy for Nacala is to get people to come to Mozambique and from here fly elsewhere. One strategy is to offer rebates for airport fees and air navigation fees for shorter, or regional, flights. We are offering flights from Nacala to Pemba and Nacala to Nampula, for example, at a 50% rebate. That is one of the strategies to position the airport. But it could as easily be done somewhere else. For example, we are launching a tender for the concession of the three airports: Inhambane, Ponta do Ouro, and Bilene.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Peru is one of South America's top economic performers, but before this decade, it had experienced monitory woes. However, during your tenure the sol has seen stability and growth against the dollar. What role have the Central Bank's policies had in this transformation?</h4><p>We have a highly turbulent monetary history. Back in the 1980s macro policies, both monetary and fiscal, were very poor in Peru. Since 2001, when we adopted an inflation target regime to conduct monetary policy, we became the first country to adopt this regime with negative inflation rates. The credibility in the new regime allowed the Central Bank to adopt a more expansionary monetary policy, without affecting inflationary expectations. The second country to apply inflation targeting under negative inflation was Japan, in 2014. Since introducing inflation targeting, core inflation in Peru has been at 2%, and headline inflation at 2.6%, on average. That is the lowest in Latin America, which is consistent with the fact that we have the lowest inflation target in the region.</p><h4>How is the Bank acting to stimulate growth in the context of lower mineral prices, and what has led you to keep the rate constant over the past two months?</h4><p>Inflation has been high, which is the main reason behind our reluctance to cut rates. Instead, we reduced reserve requirements to enable financial institutions to increase their lending at a faster pace. The Central Bank has adopted an expansionary policy stance since May 2013 when it started cutting reserve requirements. Since that time, we have also cut the policy rate three times up to 3.5%, which implies a real interest rate of less than 1%.</p><div class="quote">“Inflation has been high, which is the main reason behind our reluctance to cut rates."</div><h4>For many emerging economies the rise in the dollar, coupled with a fall in commodities, may come as a shock. How do you plan to insulate Peru from that trend?</h4><p>After 2008, the emerging markets recovered quickly, because China was growing rapidly, particularly in 2009, which pushed commodity prices up. In addition, the Fed extended sub-lines to certain important emerging market economies like Brazil, Mexico, Korea, and Singapore. This allowed them to limit exchange rate pressures, whereby credit resumed flowing to emerging markets. Those conditions are not going to exist this time around, as commodity prices are falling, and the US is set to tighten its monetary policy. Expansionary policies will remain in place in Japan and Europe, which will partially compensate for the impact of the Fed's tightening in emerging market economies. Last year Peru was the only country in the region with a fiscal surplus. Peru saved during good times and now we can use those savings to pursue a more aggressive counter-cyclical fiscal policy. We have a large level of international reserves, so if there is pressure on the currency, we can use a good chunk of those reserves to limit the risks of an abrupt depreciation of the sol, which gives us some leeway. The third important factor is that many important projects, particularly in the mining sector, will enter production in 2015/17, which will nearly double copper production over the next three years.</p><h4>Do you have any thoughts about Peruvian debt markets and on the effects of quantitative easing?</h4><p>We are the emerging economy with the largest participation of non-residents in the domestic-currency government bond market. This participation reached 58% in the past, and nowadays is less than 40%. Besides this reduction, the yields of government bonds have not increased, reflecting the high demand for these bonds of domestic agents. Private Peruvian pension funds that had increased its investments abroad are moving it back to Peru. In the case of corporate bonds, the issuance in emerging markets have increased substantially recently, particularly in the last three years. Last year for example, we accounted for almost a fifth of total bonds issued in South America, Brazil and Chile each one for 31%, and Colombia for the 14% of the total issuance during 2013. Those bonds have typically been issued in dollars at historically low interest rates. They are bullet bonds, typically issued with a maturity of between seven and 10 years, therefore the rollover risk is relatively low. As part of policy to smooth the credit cycle in Peru, during the period of QE, we increased the reserve requirement in dollars, in the case of deposits up to 50%. This policy increases dollar lending rates, particularly for SMEs and households, as corporates have access to international capital markets, and such reserve requirements impact them less.</p><h4>Over 2014 the Peruvian government focused on infrastructure. What can be done to help infrastructural investment or aid this momentum?</h4><p>Our policy rate is currently higher than Mexico's for example, but our long-term interest rates are lower. This is largely because investors forecast inflation remaining lower in Peru than in Mexico. Consequently, Peru has the lowest yields of government bonds in the Americas for long-term domestic currency bonds. The main reason is that investors forecast lower inflation in Peru. Having such competitive rates is one way of helping to finance infrastructure.</p><h4>You mentioned cutting the reserve requirements this year. Is that cut responding to current global pressures and inflation, or will it become part of longer-term policy?</h4><p>In April 2013, more than 20% of deposits in domestic currency were at the Central Bank as reserve requirements, while today the corresponding reserve requirement is down to 9%. As lower reserve requirements increase the amount of loanable funds for banks, the sequence of cuts implemented by the Central Bank is helping the banks to expand loans in domestic currency. In addition, lower reserve requirements contribute to reducing the cost of credit. As a trend, credit to GDP has continued growing in Peru and, in consequence, there has been a dramatic rise in financing access for consumers and small businesses. According to the Economist, Peru has the most developed micro finance system in the world. And if growth accelerates, we may have to adopt a more restrictive monetary policy in order to guarantee low inflation.</p><h4>There should be improved mineral production in 2015, and even though prices are not likely to rise, export volumes will. Coupled with infrastructure investments and a stronger growth rate, what else can you say about conditions for 2015?</h4><p>In terms of infrastructure projects, there exists a large pipeline, such as the second line of the Lima subway, and our biggest gas pipeline yet scheduled for 2015. Additionally, because of political unrest in local and regional government, public investment in the first three quarters has not grown at all. Yet we expect public investment to grow by close to 7% in 2015. In short, all of these factors will help to regain the economic momentum. As far as monetary policy is concerned, in principle, we still have an expansionary bias. However, we are monitoring the economy closely, and if circumstances permit we might change that bias, to avoid inflationary pressures, in case the economic rebound exceeds our expectations.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide a general overview of Motorysa, concerning sales, revenues and business segments to have seen the most growth?</h4><p>The past 12 months have been impressive, as we have more than doubled our sales. Motorysa is the exclusive distributor in Colombia of Mitsubishi—a company which once faced some difficulties, but that has now recovered its brand equity and is bringing out new models. This, combined with our local strategy, has made it possible to recover our market share, although in the Colombian market we are some way off realizing our long-term targets. This success was possible due to several factors, the first being several product launches. Secondly, depreciation of the Japanese yen meant that products could be priced more competitively. Thirdly, we have maintained our dealer network for some years, and in 2014 we made the decision to expand it. Most of our dealers are owned by Motorysa, but we also have a number of external dealers in small- to medium-sized cities, whereby we cover about 95% of the Colombian market. We have a number of subsidiaries such as the Banco Finandina, the Casa Toro dealerships, the John Deere Agricultural Machinery Distribution, Equirent—a rental company—the Hertz franchise, and several other companies in the automotive business, including financing companies like Finanzauto and a number of brokers, all related to the automotive Business. Motorysa concentrates on developing vehicle distribution in the automotive industry. Currently, we are focused on Mitsubishi, but are also developing several Daimler dealerships that will start early in 2015. There are also other brands that we will shortly develop as distributors. The automotive market is growing by around 8% per annum, and our sales are doubling. We expect to end 2014 on growth of 80% and for 2015 expect to grow by a further 50%. I think our strategy for this is well grounded, but we will need to observe developments in the general market. We expect to achieve our target as long as the market grows by 5% in 2015, which, however, is uncertain due to the direction of oil prices and the depreciation of the peso.</p><h4>To what extent do free trade agreements (FTAs) assist your business?</h4><p>We are highly focused on the agreement between Colombia and Japan, which is necessary for our long-term development as a brand. Our current disadvantage is that we only take advantage of our FTAs with the US, and are therefore missing out on wider opportunities. The countries we purchase from lack FTAs with Colombia. We think that Japan and Colombia could complement each other well, but that the size of the Japanese market would probably result in more opportunities for us—the Colombian economy—than for them.</p><h4>Have imports affected the local assembly business?</h4><p>I used to assemble buses in Colombia, and in my opinion, you only take advantage of local assembly by improving freight costs. The economies of scale and costs of assembling a vehicle in Colombia are not competitive. Three major companies used to assemble vehicles here, namely General Motors, Mazda, and Renault. Mazda closed its plant when it decided to import from an FTA in Mexico, and moreover, could not export from Colombia. The same issues affect General Motors and Renault; they are actually huge importers. These are largely political issues; recently, a study conducted by Fedesarrollo concluded that vehicle trade generated significantly greater employment and economic activity than local assembly. However, there are actually few assemblers, and the costs are uncompetitive, with parts not supplied. Logistics costs are also prohibitively high. The need to bring parts from a Colombian port erases any advantage you might have had.</p><div class="quote">“The past 12 months have been impressive, as we have more than doubled our sales."</div><h4>How important is your commercial vehicle segment in Colombia?</h4><p>Commercial vehicles such as trucks and vans once accounted for around 20% of our local sales, but the Colombian truck market has plummeted recently. Most large truck companies face problems because of the process of licensing a truck, whereby to do so another truck has to be scrapped, which is costly. The rules, severally amended, make it difficult to work smoothly. This could be one reason why logistics costs are so high; this in addition to poor infrastructure. The truck market situation is at a low point in Colombia, but I perceive a great medium-term potential in the segment. That is why we have decided to become a Mercedes Benz and Freightliner dealer. We foresee some difficult years ahead, but business seems set to skyrocket at some point given that there is a real need.</p><h4>You introduced the i-MiEV electric car in 2011 as a new and sustainable vehicle, in collaboration with Condensa. How did you do this?</h4><p>In 2011, we signed a collaboration agreement with the aim of testing and developing electric vehicle technology in Colombia. We were pioneers, and it is still idealistic to think of this as a sustainable business. Yet Colombia pursues the clean generation of electricity—70% of electricity generated comes via water or hydroelectric power generators—and Mitsubishi is one of the world leaders in electric vehicles, whereby we undertook a number of local trials. We started smoothly with two units, and brought 30 additional units the following year. Now we want to develop the business at a corporate level. The Colombian government has given some incentives to develop this technology, but not enough by international standards. Moreover, the price of such vehicles remains higher than other cars. We are due to present the Outlander hybrid at the Bogotá Motor Show.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Superintendency of Securities has recently approved EGE Haina's IPO, and EGE Haina's outstanding corporate bonds amount to $140 million. What investments are being funded at this time?</h4><p>EGE Haina is currently the largest private issuer in the Dominican capital markets. Over the course of its lifetime, it has structured $280 million in local bonds, including a new $100 million bond that has recently received approval from the local Securities Exchange Commission (Superintendencia de Valores, SIV). EGE Haina is currently developing the new 50 MW Larimar wind project next to the existing Los Cocos wind farm. The new wind farm will be composed of 15 state-of-the art Vestas V112 wind generators, each with a 3.3 MW capacity. This project is expected to be fully operational by 1Q2016. In addition, we are in the process of building a 1.5 MW solar photovoltaic plant in San Pedro de Macorí­s to be completed in 3Q2015.</p><h4>EGE Haina is the largest power company in the Dominican Republic by installed capacity. Could you talk us through the technologies and fuels being used in the production of energy at your eight generation plants?</h4><p>EGE Haina has a finely balanced mix of generation and technologies in its fleet. Firstly, it has 77 MW of environmentally friendly wind power, from 40 wind turbines located on the southwest coast. In terms of thermal power production, the company operates 450 MW of combined cycle diesel engine generation at its Quisqueya Plant near San Pedro de Macorí­s. The Quisqueya Complex is integrated by Quisqueya 1 and 2, owned by Barrick Pueblo Viejo and EGE Haina, respectively. The engines have complete flex-fuel capability, which means they can run on natural gas, light fuel oil, (LFO/diesel fuel), or heavy fuel oil (HFO). EGE Haina's Sultana del Este Plant has 150 MW of simple cycle diesel engine generation using HFO. Adding to this balanced mix is our Barahona coal plant, which generates 45 MW from a boiler-steam turbine combination. In addition, EGE Haina has a 100 MW simple cycle gas turbine using LFO located at Rio Haina. Rounding off this mix are boiler steam turbine plants located at Puerto Plata, San Pedro de Macorí­s, and Rio Haina, which use HFO as the main fuel. Finally there is the Pedernales Plant, which uses HFO and LFO as its fuels, and is located on the border with Haiti. Although this plant is relatively small in comparison with the other units in EGE Haina's fleet (only 5.1 MWs in diesel engine generation), it is not insignificant for the people of Pedernales, being the only source of power for the town, and operates as an independent grid.</p><h4>What have been the highlights of EGE Haina's performance in 2014?</h4><p>EGE Haina has had an excellent year by all metrics. With the recent addition of Los Cocos 2 (January 2013) and Quisqueya 2 (December 2013), our energy generation has increased from 1,687 GWh in the first 10 months of 2013 to 2,671 GWh in the same period of 2014, on a 58% increase. Year to date, we have posted a record generation of 2,953 GWh, which allows us to provide one-fifth of the KWh consumption of the Dominican Republic. In 2014, the additional generation provided by the Quisqueya complex has reduced the cost of power in the Dominican Republic's wholesale market by approximately 30%, or 5¢/KWh. We also achieved our best heat rate ever at an average of 8,780 BTU/KWh HHV. Similarly, with its wind power production from Los Cocos, EGE Haina has reduced (year to date) emissions by 155,132 tons of CO2 and has saved the country 327,286 barrels of imported fuel. In 2014 we added 1.7 MW of new generation at Pedernales by installing a new Hyundai engine. In terms of health and safety, our performance was excellent, with only two minor lost time incidents for the whole year. With the significant increase in production, one might expect total operating costs to increase as well. Yet to the contrary, through a series of cost-saving measures and the relocation and optimization of resources, total operating costs in the first 10 months of 2014 were only 1.6% higher when compared to the same period of 2013. Most notably, G&amp;A expenses were reduced by 40% in relation to 2013. During 2014 the company concluded the refinancing of a $175 million international bond, which included the issuance of a $100 million bond in the local debt capital market.</p><h4>EGE Haina has been certified a Great Place to Work and ranked number 12 in the Dominican Republic and 17 in the Caribbean. Could you tell us about company's approach to human capital?</h4><p>At EGE Haina we are paying real attention to our people's ideas and development. We believe that individuals are the key element for a successful sustainable business. Besides competitive compensation and benefits, we emphasize training for all employees, teamwork, face-to-face communication, and a value-based culture.</p><div class="quote">“EGE Haina has a finely balanced mix of generation and technologies in its fleet."</div><h4>What challenges is EGE Haina facing with regard to the power sector, and what initiatives have to be taken to improve sector performance and competitiveness?</h4><p>The principle obstacle in the electricity sector remains the poor operational performance of the distribution companies, which is characterized by substantial energy losses resulting from electricity theft by end users. This situation has been exacerbated by the increase in fuel prices over the past five years, which has heavily impacted the distribution companies' financial results and ability to pay for energy purchases from generators, such as EGE Haina. We believe that tackling energy theft in the country should be the first priority to achieving sector competitiveness.</p><h4>As a pioneer and leader in production of renewable energy in the Dominican Republic, could you tell us about your view on the transformation of the national energy sector and your prospects for clean technologies and renewable energy production?</h4><p>Over the past 15 years, the country's energy matrix has gone from being 90% dependent on foreign oil imports, to being a diversified generation portfolio based on water, wind, natural gas, coal, and only 40% oil. Renewable energy is becoming a significant source of power for the Dominican system. In 2016, approximately 20% of the country's electricity will come from renewable energy sources (mainly water and wind). It is our hope that clean energy will continue to grow as a source of power for the Dominican Republic. At EGE Haina we are investing significant resources in wind and solar energy and hope to continue leading renewable generation in the private sector.</p><h4>What is EGE Haina's medium-term growth strategy, and what goals has it set for 2015?</h4><p>We will continue to focus our efforts on sustainably, reducing overall energy production costs, while continuing to invest in renewable energy and improving energy efficiency through wind and solar power investments, and efficient flex-fuel thermal generation.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>If there is one key message I hear from UK companies in Nigeria, it's that there's a real desire to do more there. As our second largest trading partner in the sub-Saharan region, Nigeria is a vital partner for the UK in Africa—and the close relationship between the two countries presents an opportunity to build real shared prosperity. My first overseas visit as a Minister was to Abuja, and I also visited Nigeria as Chair of the British Parliament's All Party Group prior to joining the UK government. It's a partnership that's close to my heart.<br></p><p>One of our key objectives is to broaden the trading relationship, expanding from current areas of strength, such as energy, into new growth sectors. Oil and gas currently accounts for between 70 and 80 per cent of Nigerian Government and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. Expansion into new sectors will strengthen bilateral trade, making the relationship less exposed to fluctuations in the oil price.</p><div class="quote">“The financial sector in particular offers fertile ground for the sharing of UK expertise."</div><p>The financial sector in particular offers fertile ground for the sharing of UK expertise. The UK Government's Emerging Capital Markets Taskforce is working with private sector partners, such as PwC, Standard Chartered, the Law Society and CityUK, to strengthen ties in Nigeria. The Head of the Taskforce, Sir Roger Gifford, was in Lagos in November 2014 to witness the signing of an agreement between the Nigerian and London Stock Exchanges to support African companies seeking dual listings in both locations. The Nigerian Stock Exchange will also need support to reduce its vulnerability to changes in the oil price and to achieve its target of $1 trillion market capitalization by 2016; but add to this insurance, bonds and the potential for the creation of a derivatives market, and the opportunities are significant.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Trade Envoy to Nigeria, David Heath MP, is targeting other key sectors—agriculture, education, energy and retail - and encouraging more big-name UK firms to seize the chance to cater to Nigeria's growing middle class.</p><p>There has been a shift in the way people look at the Nigerian market since the rebasing of GDP earlier this year. We should make the most of the facts: Nigeria is the 23rd largest economy in the world, predicted to be in the top 20 by 2015, and Lagos alone is the 4th biggest economy in Africa.</p><p>There are numerous examples of well-known UK blue-chip companies established in Nigeria - Diageo, Unilever and GSK to name a few—giving the lie to any perception that the risks of doing business in-country are too high. However, continued effort to address the challenges that do exist will bolster this message. Nigeria has made progress in many areas, moving up the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings to number 170. However, we must be realistic: the list totals only 189 countries, and the next closest MINT economy, Indonesia, ranks at 114. Nigeria is the second-lowest ranked country in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Tackling the basics, such as the electricity supply, will go a long way towards improving this. The need for businesses to generate their own power presents a major cost that, for Small and Medium Enterprise, is not easy to absorb. Yet the country's gas stocks offer the opportunity to revolutionize power supply. So maintaining the momentum in reform of the power sector is crucial. Implementation of this reform, with the support of the UK Government and UK business, will allow the Nigerian Government to mitigate risks and attract more investment.</p><p>By 2050, according to some estimates, Nigeria will have the third largest population in the world. To make the most of the opportunities this will bring, it is vital that the country's long term growth is inclusive. Spreading the dividends of diversification is as important as diversification itself. Currently, agriculture accounts for two thirds of employment and almost 27% of GDP, but most workers earn less than $1.25 per day, and the sector has been neglected in recent years. The Nigerian Government is taking action, for example by investing in power and infrastructure.  While the planned Petroleum Industries Bill (PIB) must ensure the country's oil wealth is equitably shared, properly invested and that the sector continues to attract international investors.</p><p>Maintaining this momentum will be key to unlocking Nigeria's growth in the years ahead. The UK stands ready to be Nigeria's partner of choice.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[attention-to-dubai-shoppers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you describe the new shopping mall in the media production zone?<br></h4><p>It is an exciting project for us from a number of perspectives. Firstly, it is our first new mall in Dubai since Mirdif City Centre, which opened its doors about three years ago. This mall is different in being a smaller community scheme; this is a new product for us and one we are very keen to rollout across our entire network. It is our first new investment in Dubai for a number of years, and not what we are traditionally known for. This speaks volumes for what we believe are the opportunities here for the UAE and the broader Middle East as the market evolves and continues to mature. This is an emerging region and ours an emerging economy, where as a whole there is a pronounced growth of an emergent middle class. This social group is starting en masse to enjoy the benefit of their newfound wealth and tend to spend on upgrading homes, cars, and overall lifestyle, with a fondness for retail purchases. As this continues to mature, you then find an increased demand for more convenience retailing, and this is what we think is going to be an exciting development across the whole region for us to exploit.</p><h4>How is your business strategy focusing on the middle class?</h4><p>Our strategy actually has a broad focus. Branding for us is an opportunity to state to the world what we ultimately stand for. Our vision is very simple and succinct: to create great moments for everyone every day, and is a very strong consumer-centric vision. Everything that we do, whatever business we are in, whatever property we open, has to be about the customer. It is bringing forward a promise about how we approach our business, which is consumer-centric. It has to be about what people want. This is what we see people want here in Dubai, and we are responding accordingly.</p><h4>What new projects are you planning for 2014?</h4><p>Across the board, we have strong aspirations to grow in diverse sectors, both with malls and hotels. In the UAE itself, and specifically in Dubai, we have already committed to AED3 billion worth of projects. We are undergoing an extensive expansion, refurbishment, and remerchandising of Mall of the Emirates. We completed Phase I in February of 2014, and are well into Phase II, which will open in March of 2015. The next phase is to add another luxury hotel to the mall to further strengthen its position in the market and improve customer experience. In addition to that, we have expansion plans for Sharjah City Centre. We are also at the advanced stages of planning to expand Ajman City Centre. We have a further site in Sharjah, where we are currently planning to develop another super regional mall. That will be delivered in stages, and we will probably start with a mall of 50,000-60,000 sqm, and over time we expect it to reach 150,000 sqm.</p><h4>Which sector yields the greatest profit and opportunities?</h4><p>Our malls business clams the lion's share. It has been established the longest, and is how set out originally. Our aspiration for the other businesses, however, is to match the growth of our malls arm. We have been growing the overall business over the past 22 years at an average of 46% annually. Of course, that slows down as you get larger, but we are still growing by at least 12%-14% per annum, and we expect this to continue over the next couple of years. Our hotels business has also seen very strong growth, as has tourism. I expect it to remain strong up until 2020, and we are patently benefiting from this. In fact we foresee double-digit growth across our portfolio. We are getting to the point where we cannot accommodate any more people at our hotels. We are running at 95% occupancy across our entire portfolio of 11 hotels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Within the Paris Gallery, what do you do to maintain the standard of quality for products in your portfolio?<br></h4><p>We explore consumer service through various forms of research, but collecting the data for this research is not an easy task. The more information we obtain, the greater the chance of confusion. We try to maintain the friendly, luxurious environments that consumers demand. These demands do not remain consistent and have to be transformed every few years. We work with our designers and business partners to ensure brand positioning and equity is maintained and improved. We work together to ensure that what we have in mind is in line with what consumers are demanding. When these business partners introduce new products or brands for our region, they come to us so that we can introduce their products properly to our consumers.</p><h4>You have 450 international brands in your portfolio. Which brands are you planning to acquire or work with in 2014?</h4><p>Much potential lies in the jewelry and skincare sectors. To put this into perspective, the largest export from Italy to the UAE is jewelry, and the numbers are increasing. Our focus for 2014 will be on the smaller jewelry houses. There is greater potential with these smaller houses for their designs to be more closely aligned with the future wants of consumers and new generations. This is not to say that the larger houses are not aligned with future consumer demand, but smaller houses are dynamic enough to meet the challenge. The essential challenge for these designers lies in finding the right location to exhibit their products. We help them to best exhibit their products, and we have the knowledge it requires to market these products.  The jewelry sector could expand to global importance, like those of perfume, cosmetics, and other luxury products. Worldwide, most SMEs are struggling because these elements are missing. Yet, these obstacles, over time, are overcome. Another challenge is designers not knowing what to design for particular markets. Currently, they tend to produce one product for the entire market, but this trend is changing. What is desired in China is different from India, which is in turn different from the GCC. We have summits every year that allow retailers, distributors, and the houses and creators to get together and talk about what needs to be done. There has always been potential in skincare, and that potential is still growing. The awareness of the customer is increasing for skincare—both for men and women. However, there are not enough products to meet this demand. The difficulty of producing effective skincare products is the main reason for this. Similar to jewelry, there are small businesses, creators, and entrepreneurs in that sector, and we would like to focus on this in 2014.</p><h4>What are your geographic expansion plans?</h4><p>Currently, there are 52 Paris Gallery stores in the Gulf and MENA region. We are hoping to open two showrooms in Muscat and one in Baghdad, and we also have plans for Libya and many other locations. Our plans for Baku are part of the scheme, although we have faced challenges there in terms of logistics. Before the end of 2014, we will have many of those stores opened. We have been approached by many countries. In the UAE, most of our stores are being refurbished. We've opened new stores and have plans to open a few more in 2014. The Paris Gallery store in the Dubai Mall has also undergone a major facelift. We've also given Watch Gallery in the Mall of the Emirates an entirely new look and feel. We inaugurated our store at the Sahara Centre in Sharjah and opened a new store at the Al Ghurair Centre in Dubai.  In Abu Dhabi, we inaugurated a new Aigner fashion boutique.  A new Paris Gallery store is also slated to open in the Bawabat Al Sharq Mall in Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 2007, how is Dubai Maritime City Authority (DMCA) playing a role in the reaffirmation of Dubai's position as a first-class international maritime hub?<br></h4><p>DMCA, the government authority charged with regulating, coordinating, and supervising all aspects of the maritime sector in Dubai, provides a platform of excellence and quality as it develops world-class regulations and guidelines to raise the bar for the maritime industry and boost its infrastructure, operations, and logistics services while encouraging investment opportunities to boost Dubai's competitiveness at the regional and international levels. DMCA has affirmed its commitment to support the Dubai Maritime Vision 2030 plan of creating a vibrant and safe maritime environment in the next two decades, which also seeks to establish Dubai as a leading global maritime hub. Dubai Maritime Vision 2030 is of strategic significance as it underpins efforts to improve the local maritime sector. It also emphasizes how the competitive potentials of Dubai place it among the leading logistics and maritime centers in the MENA region, and in the whole world. Dubai's huge growth opportunities provide a positive outlook for Dubai's maritime sector in the next few years. In line with this, DMCA will continue to take big strides in establishing the global appeal of Dubai's maritime sector and helping realize the ambitious objectives of Vision 2030, which serves as an important guide for achieving a competitive and sustainable maritime economy that meets the highest environmental safety standards. Dubai Maritime Vision 2030 is the result of a meticulous study conducted on behalf of DMCA covering global maritime trends and possible scenarios. It provides a framework for anticipating future outcomes and their implications on the Emirate's maritime sector.</p><h4>Which key characteristics of Dubai's maritime sector attract leading players from across the region and worldwide to invest in Dubai's future growth opportunities?</h4><p>The maritime sector has played an important part in shaping Dubai's rich history in marine navigation and trade through the centuries. It also continues to be an important element as Dubai develops into a leading maritime gateway for traders in Southeast Asia and the west coast of Africa. Dubai's maritime sector still has significant room for growth. In response to the urgent need for an integrated framework to enhance local maritime elements, the Maritime Sector Strategy (MSS) was established by Dubai to capitalize on the Emirate's competitive advantages to raise its prominence in the international maritime landscape per the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai. As a result of the government's continuous support for the maritime sector as a catalyst for economic diversification, Dubai is steadily moving in the direction of establishing itself as one of the world's pioneering maritime centers. The Emirate has achieved so much in terms of ports management, ship maintenance and operation, and overall maritime services. Dubai has deftly leveraged its numerous advantages, such as its strategic location, secure investment environment, integrated maritime regulations, ongoing economic, social, and cultural progress, and business-friendly government support.</p><h4>How do you see the maritime sector playing a role in Dubai's economic diversification?</h4><p>The local maritime sector is one of the major income generators for Dubai, recently accounting for AED14.4 billion, or 4.6% of local GDP. Among the top maritime components contributing to the local economy are maritime operations and engineering, ports and shipping, recreational maritime services, and maritime support services. These have played pivotal roles in creating over 75,000 job opportunities requiring high levels of competence for various industry segments, such as maritime operations and engineering and ports, which account for 51% and 25% of sector employment, respectively. A recent benchmarking study on leadership across the international maritime industry conducted by DMCA reveals that the value-added contributions of Dubai's maritime sector to the local economy are at 4.6% compared to 4.5% in Hong Kong, 7% in Singapore, and 4.8% in Norway. In terms of economic value-added, the sector provided AED14.4 billion ($3.92 billion) in income to Dubai, compared to AED41.1 billion ($11.20 billion) for Hong Kong, AED67.8 billion ($18.47 billion) for Singapore, and AED95.1 billion ($25.9 billion) for Norway. The study also shows how the maritime sector has become a prime source of employment. Dubai's maritime jobs ranked fourth with 75,000 employees. Hong Kong leads the pack with 222,000 employees, followed by Singapore with 167,000 and Norway with 101,000.</p><h4>One of DMCA's pillars is the importance of safety. What steps are being made to ensure safety for both citizens and investors, and what are the biggest challenges you are facing in this regard?</h4><p>As part of the first-of-its-kind maritime sector strategy's initiatives for developing, organizing, and promoting Dubai's maritime industry, DMCA is proceeding with the implementation of its maritime safety programs. The initiatives approved by the Dubai Executive Council's Health and Safety Committee reflect DMCA's commitment to establishing an integrated approach to maritime safety aimed at developing, organizing, and promoting the local maritime industry, and thus promoting maritime development and safety by requiring higher levels of operational performance and advanced, highly-efficient infrastructure capable of ensuring the safety of workers, passengers, and visitors. At DMCA, we believe that establishing a comprehensive strategy and unified guidelines to ensure high levels of maritime safety is instrumental in achieving the ultimate objective of raising the bar in maritime activities and ensuring safe navigation. Our maritime safety strategy comprises a set of regulations, guidelines, and initiatives focusing on the vital areas of marine vessels and cruise ships, marine operations, and passengers. A key contributor to Dubai's World Expo 2020 hosting preparations, the policy's series of unified standards comply with international maritime benchmarks. It serves as a foundation for supporting the national economy by attracting foreign investments to the local maritime sector and developing industry components while promoting Dubai's regional and international maritime competitiveness.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind your recent “Maritime Creativity Lab" initiative, and what output do you expect from such a program?</h4><p>The Maritime Creativity Lab initiative was launched in response to the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, who called for the adoption of the “Government Creativity Lab" experiment as a standardized practice to develop government services and enhance government administrative performance. The Maritime Creativity Lab is based on the latest advanced modes, smart communication networks, and digital technologies such as tablets and smart screens. It is also providing an online portal and a set of mobile applications along with private accounts on social media networks to guarantee a favorable climate for drawing out creative ideas that would help develop a renewed and secure maritime sector in line with the highest standards of sustainability and excellence. Set to start operations in early 2015, the Maritime Creativity Lab provides a smart and interactive platform to boost communication among public and private entities, decision makers, industry experts, and maritime specialists, through face-to-face meetings under the umbrella of DMCA. The Maritime Creativity Lab will include interactive meetings and brainstorming sessions with leading local maritime experts, as well as with regional and international professionals to discuss key subjects related to the improvement of operational efficiency, environmental protection, and strategic planning. It is based on the corporate values of DMCA, which encourage innovation and creativity to establish a vibrant and sustainable industry in order to boost Dubai's comprehensive development march under the directives of our wise leadership.</p><h4>What major investments and future projects are in the pipeline for 2014 and beyond?</h4><p>The local maritime industry remains a key driver of sustainable growth and future comprehensive development and is a major factor in boosting Dubai's competitiveness at the regional and international level. To date, DMCA has started many initiatives, and has more planned. In 2014, we are launching the Dubai Maritime Week, with an added focus on the role of Dubai's Expo 2020 win in boosting regional trade and creating higher demand on maritime logistical aspects. In addition, the week will see the congregation of world maritime leaders in Dubai to discuss the global trends and challenges facing the maritime industry and how Dubai is playing a catalyst role in the region's growth. Also set to go into effect in early 2015, the Maritime Creativity Lab will provide a smart and interactive platform to boost communication among public and private entities, decision makers, industry experts, and maritime specialists, through face-to-face meetings under the umbrella of DMCA. These meetings will be held to discuss major industry topics and emerging challenges on the maritime sector as well as establishing effective strategies to overcome obstacles, thereby positioning Dubai among the top maritime hubs of the world. DMCA will continue to uphold highly effective international maritime regulations and practices to ensure the delivery of first-class services that can tap the economic potential of hosting Expo 2020. The Expo is an economic catalyst that will energize trade in the Emirate in the coming years. The continuous improvement of operational and logistical efficiencies across maritime-related segments is instrumental to optimizing the flow of supply channels across land, sea, and air.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of service to its clients, how does Maersk Line look to be the best in its sector?<br></h4><p>“Our word is our bond" is the motto of our founder, and that is really what we have come to be known for globally. That being said, we are constantly evaluating our operating costs and structure to ensure we operate as efficiently as possible while delivering a top-quality product to our customers. I think one of the reasons we are still doing reasonably well in this region is our focus on reliability, ensuring that our customers get their products delivered to the respective destinations on time.</p><h4>How has the volume of containers through Dubai's ports changed over the last year?</h4><p>The biggest change we are seeing is in imports. Import volumes, mainly into the UAE, have witnessed a surge in the recent past; reflecting growth of 25% for 1H2014 over the same period last year. On the export front, we see steady growth driven mainly by major investments in the petrochemical industries across the countries we operate in. Furthermore, opportunities for growth in the region continue to exist on the back of strong investments in export-driven industries, large infrastructure projects attracting imports, increasing consumer demand, and growth in the tourism industry.</p><h4>How does Maersk Line contribute to sustainability?</h4><p>Sustainability and the economy go hand and hand in our industry as fuel costs make up around 20% of our total costs. The Triple-E vessels are certainly a major investment for us, but we have been involved in various initiatives for a while in order to contribute toward improving the environmental performance of our industry. In 2007, Maersk Line initiated a comprehensive study on 110 vessels, which showed that the engine load can manage to go as low as 10%. This makes it possible for container ships to sail at half speed, thereby reducing not only fuel costs significantly, but also CO2 emissions. More than 100 Maersk Line vessels have utilized super slow steaming since 2007, which is one of the fundamentals for Maersk Line today being approximately 8%-10% lower on CO2 emissions than the industry average.</p><h4>What are some of the maritime industry trends influencing Maersk Line's operations?</h4><p>The industry is finding ways to consolidate. In this regard, Maersk Line has announced a 10-year Vessel Sharing Agreement (VSA) with Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) on the Asia-Europe, Transatlantic and Transpacific routes. The VSA will be referred to as 2M. The VSA will include 185 vessels with an estimated capacity of 2.1 million TEUs, deployed on 21 strings. The overall purpose of the cooperation is to share infrastructure. Maersk Line along with MSC will be able to provide our customers with competitive and reliable container shipping in the East-West trades at attractive prices. To do so we have to be innovative and take out costs, while keeping a product that is the best in class for our customers in terms of coverage, frequency, and reliability. The VSA will improve the efficiency of the Maersk Line and MSC networks through better utilization of vessel capacity and economies of scale. This is expected to start in early 2015.</p><h4>How does the maritime sector here in Dubai compare to some of the other hubs in which you operate worldwide?</h4><p>Dubai as a major transhipment hub has a unique position in the region. This not only offers us the advantage of serving burgeoning markets in the Gulf, but also provides access to a larger local market. In terms of competition, of the 20 largest groups in the world, all the major players are present here. It is a very competitive environment, which I believe will continue to be a key driver in Dubai's success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, you captured nearly 50% of departing passengers as customers, what makes Dubai Duty Free different?<br></h4><p>Unlike most airports, duty free here is owned by the government. The airport is also owned by the government, meaning we get an opportunity when something is happening to have a say in where the retail operations will be placed. We are there right at the beginning, and together we agree on the positioning of the shops. Firstly, we think the location is important. Secondly, the airport is efficient and passenger movement is quick and speedy. We have passengers with us for a long time. Finally, we have an excellent operation. I think we offer value for money and a good range of products. We probably have the best team of staff in the duty-free industry, and spend a higher percentage than any other duty-free operation in the world marketing ourselves. We have many ongoing promotions and a lot of media coverage. The short answer to the question is our marketing, the quality of staff, the value of our product, and our position in the airport.</p><h4>How important are international sporting events for your promotion?</h4><p>I think it is very important, and there was an effort made many years ago to make Dubai the sports capital of the Middle East. And, to a large extent, that has happened. If you take the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championship, it has now been going for 22 years and Roger Federer has won it six times while Venus Williams won her third title in Dubai this year. Roger is a fantastic ambassador for tennis and, in turn, Dubai Duty Free. We promote our tennis a lot; we are a global sponsor of women in tennis through the WTA. According to our researchers, the value each year of the media coverage that our tennis tournaments have generated was in excess of $718 million. Now, if we sat down as an operation and said let us spend $718 million on advertising, you just could not do it. Whilst we run our tournament, perhaps on a break-even basis from a cost point of view, but get back that media coverage in excess of $718 million, then it is a good deal for us. Recently, we had the World Cup Horse Racing here in Dubai, which has the biggest prize fund in the world of $27 million. The media coverage coming back from that is fantastic. The return on investment for an event like that is huge and there are several other events that are similar, such as the Emirates Rugby Sevens.</p><h4>What products are you seeing the most demand for?</h4><p>Our largest single category is perfume and cosmetics; it accounts for in excess of 20% of our business. Then, there are unusual trends here in Dubai, unlike other parts of the world; for example, gold is about 8% or 9% of our business. Alcohol and tobacco are still very important, and in our case alcohol represents around 12% of our business, while cigarettes and tobacco take up 9% or 10%. We have a shop selling sunglasses, and it has a nice space but only represents around 1.5% of our business. We wonder if it is worth having that? But 1.5% of our business is a large figure, so it is of course worth having it. A category that has grown considerably in the duty free industry over the past 10 years is confectionery. In Dubai, for example, we sell 1,000 tons of Toblerone chocolate every year. Many other categories are growing as well, we now have a lot of Chinese travelers coming through. Although they account for just 4% of the traffic through Dubai International Airport, they make up 16% of Dubai Duty Free's business. We have tailored our operation to suit that, and we now have 570 Chinese staff working for us. Meaning we have plenty of Chinese language speakers on the shop floor. We have dual signage on the floor, and we have signs in Mandarin. We recognize important events, such as Chinese New Year in January and we have special displays for that. We have attempted to identify the many products that these people want, we promote them a bit more, and we give them special displays. This has to happen or your business will not continue to grow. Our total sales in 2013 were $1.8 billion, we sold 78 million pieces of merchandise, and we did 26 million transactions on our registers. We have a reputation for being a good company to work for, and we received, without advertising, 81,500 CVs in the entire company in 2013 from people looking for jobs.</p><h4>How do you cultivate a corporate culture to improve staff quality?</h4><p>When we started duty free in 1993, we had 100 staff, and we are now 30 years old and we still have 40 of those original staff working for us. Our staff turnover in Duty Free is just 6.3% annually. Several companies in Dubai have a staff turnover in excess of 30% per year. We introduced a policy many years ago of internal promotion. We have not recruited a single senior person into Dubai Duty Free for 14 years, and all our managers and duty managers, as well as many senior people, are from within our staff. We provide training programs for those that start with us as shop floor sales people, porters, and clerks, who have now become duty managers, supervisors, and senior supervisors. This policy has worked very well for us. We do not terminate or fire staff unless they steal. If someone is under performing, we try to re-train them. We have a dedicated training department within our HR department; we do several hundred training programs every year. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From your personal experience, what are the challenges of being a businesswoman in the UAE?<br></h4><p>It is very challenging to work in hospitality here, whatever your gender. I have never felt at a disadvantage because I am a woman. I have actually worked for two leading local groups here where I've been the first female to come on board as General Manager. Dubai offers many opportunities for people that they may not necessarily have had at home.</p><h4>What is the unique nature of the hotel?</h4><p>BurJuman Arjaan is a very specific establishment; our smallest suites are 70 sqm. We have a trendy feel reflected in our modern furniture and furnishings, and we tend to look after our guests on an individual basis. We have about 40 long-term guests here, as well as individual guests, and we cater to what they specifically look for. From people welcoming you into the hotel to privatized service, we can customize experiences for our guests because our concept is quite boutique. We also have a number of beautiful duplex townhouses and penthouses here for VIP guests. One of our key selling points is that we are in the BurJuman Mall, which is actually being refurbished at the moment. The direct access to the mall we enjoy from the hotel is a key aspect for us and our guests. We offer everything from a personalized shopping service to special guest amenities in the room for Valentine's Day. Each guest can comment on the hotel, and we take all of the comments from our guests extremely seriously and are always following up to see what we can do better so that return or future guests can have an even better stay.</p><h4>Dubai has an average occupancy rate of around 80%. How do your figures compare?</h4><p>We are actually doing better than that, and are at the 93% level to date. The hotel closed with a similar rate of 91% in 2013, so we are already achieving higher occupancies than last year, which can be challenging for an apartment-style hotel. I would say there has been a higher demand in Dubai in general this year, but we are doing exceptionally well and that comes down to us having a very strong reputation in the market, many repeat guests, and a lot of long-stay guests.</p><h4>The hotel has won several awards. How important is that for the staff?</h4><p>It obviously helps us because we have been recognized for our unique identity. We actually even won a continental award as “Luxury Boutique Hotel" in the World Luxury Hotel Awards 2013, which is a greater accolade than our Dubai award. For us, it is all about recognition. Unhappy employees inevitably reflect in customer satisfaction levels. Therefore, we spend a lot of time developing our colleagues to empower them with a greater sense of purpose. This is what we really push for from our hotel and we spent a lot of time on that in 2013. We have also invested in extensive refurbishments to include our restaurant and pool area, while we have also built a brand new gymnasium. At the end of the day, we are particularly proud to see that our efforts merited an award. For a small boutique hotel like ours, it is a big achievement to be seen by our industry peers and our guests as doing a good job. We are really establishing ourselves as a leader in the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the concept behind the creation of the ICT Fund?<br></h4><p>We have a mandate to build a knowledge-based society for the country. The UAE has moved away from being an oil-based economy to a services-based one. In the near future, we foresee that the UAE will become a knowledge-based society. The elements for a knowledge-based society are often a small population and lack of natural resources that an economy could rely on. We took countries like South Korea and Singapore as examples of this as both have small populations and no natural resources, so they emphasized investment in their people, thereby transforming themselves into knowledge-based economies.</p><h4>What is the correlation between the ICT sector and the creation of a knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>We have based our efforts on four pillars; the first is education, and we invest in a number of different projects in the field of education. We also place great importance on our second pillar, R&amp;D, and have many investments there. We have also focused on incubation, which involves moving from a prototype element to commercialization, and then we finally support national projects. When you are in the process of building a knowledge-based society, education is fundamental. We inject capital into the education system through three different mechanisms. One is the provision of full-time scholarships to UAE nationals, for both undergraduate and graduate degrees. We have sent about 100 Emirati engineers to the US with others studying in other countries all over the world. We are also providing full scholarships for 200 students in the UAE. Besides that, we provide funding for educational institutes like universities that have requirements to set up laboratories or equipment related to ICT studies. Students may have ideas that universities may not be able to fund, which is when we step in and help. The three outputs are human capital, infrastructure, and ideas.</p><p>Moving on to the next pillar, which is R&amp;D, we use human capital like engineering students or engineers who put some ideas together from which we get an R&amp;D project. We also have funding for R&amp;D centers that have full-time researchers dedicated to certain specific subjects. After that, the natural transition is to transpire those ideas, prototypes, or patents to spin-offs. We do that through two mechanisms: first, we fund the setting up of incubation centers that can host those start-ups, and we provide funding to set them up across the country.</p><p>The last pillar is national projects. National projects are nation-wide projects in ICT, such as the m-Government or Smart Government initiative. These projects indicate how healthy our educational systems, how effective our R&amp;D efforts are, and how widespread entrepreneurial traits are among Emiratis. Every project has its own pipeline. Every incubating project is studied through its own individual pipeline, and then at the end of the day we have a portfolio of investments.</p><h4>How are you performing in terms of Arabic language and content in the ICT sector?</h4><p>We also have a mandate, from the Prime Minister's office, to fund and support Arabic digital content online. If someone wants to scan a book in Arabic and not all words are recognized, you just need to plug it into the re-capture system and it will be sent to the Arabic website. If two individuals put in the same inputs, it goes back to you as the correct version. Etisalat, Khalifa University, and British Telecom defined the technical challenges and developed this R&amp;D center to enhance Arabic content through professors and students working at Khalifa University. They will be presented with the technical challenges that will be converted to a project, which professors and students will work on, and then the solution goes back to Etisalat and British Telecom. Khalifa University approached us for funding this project for the next five years, which we've agreed on and signed an agreement covering the next five years, providing AED70 million.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE's investments in the aviation sector have underscored three decades of uninterrupted economic growth. What is your outlook for the sector, and what role does aviation play in the UAE's diversification efforts?<br></h4><p>We have been very fortunate to benefit from the vision of our leaders, who continue to place aviation at the center of economic growth, unlike many countries where aviation has been given a more peripheral status. The aviation industry itself generates employment and economic activity within its own value chain, but more than that, commercial aviation also enables the growth of other industry sectors such as tourism, logistics, commerce, and professional services. The connections that aviation creates between cities and markets represent an important infrastructure asset that generates benefits through attracting FDI and talent, enabling business clusters, specialization, and other spill-over impacts on the economy's productive capacity. With this firm foundation in place, the outlook for aviation is extremely promising. Al Maktoum International at Dubai World Central (DWC) is now open to cargo and passenger flights, while at Dubai International, Terminal 2 has been extended, a major runway upgrade is drawing to a close, and when Concourse D is completed, capacity at Dubai International will be ramped up to 90 million passengers a year.</p><h4>In 2013, Emirates moved over 40 million passengers. How is the airline planning to expand in the long term in order to accommodate the growing demand of the industry?</h4><p>In the recently released 2013/2014 financial results, you can see that Emirates carried a record 44.5 million passengers, up 13% on the previous year. The airline continues to grow both fleet-wise and in terms of the destinations we serve. Our 220 aircraft, including 48 of our highly popular A380s, fly to 143 destinations across six continents. By 2020, we expect to be carrying 70 million passengers a year, feeding into an expected 20 million annual visitors to Dubai and supporting the predicted 25 million additional visitors to Dubai for Expo 2020. With all this in mind, we have more than 300 aircraft on order. So, we are very much preparing for the long term, and we will pursue new opportunities around the world as they arise.</p><h4>What global travel trends do you see currently, and how is Emirates responding to them?</h4><p>One of the reasons for Emirates' continued success is its agility in the global marketplace. By aligning operations acutely to demand and industry trends, the airline's growth remains lean. Africa remains a key continent for us. We currently operate to 25 destinations and two more will be added in August, namely Abuja and Kano in Nigeria, further lubricating links with China and the rest of the Far East. In the Americas, our growth is moving up a gear in the US with Chicago becoming our ninth destination in August, while Boston joined the network in March and is already being upgraded from a Boeing 777-200LR to a larger Boeing 300-ER, as of August. Europe has seen many of our route launches in recent years as one of the key commercial regions. </p><p>The latest figures from Dubai International also show Europe performing strongly. In the month of April, Western Europe achieved the highest growth in passenger numbers (+172,223), followed by the Indian subcontinent, particularly Pakistan, where there were double-digit increases out of Karachi and Islamabad. Emirates will increase to six flights daily to Karachi from August. In India, we will launch an A380 service to Mumbai and deploy larger aircraft on Delhi and Hyderabad. Elsewhere in Asia, Emirates' passenger network has extended into Taipei with flights beginning in February 2014. Jakarta, Singapore, and Thailand are amongst the markets where we have also been increasing capacity. As ever, our reach across six continents is backed by millions of dollars of investment in our products and services. Winning the Skytrax “World's Best Airline" award in 2013 does not come from complacency, and we fully realize the reputation we have to live up to. Overall, the world is tentatively recovering from the very tough years following the global financial crisis. Fuel remains an irritatingly high operating cost, and there are ongoing challenges with currency fluctuations. But as our business and brand becomes more global, connecting East and West via Dubai, we also further spread our risk. This has undoubtedly helped in more difficult periods.</p><h4>How is the Emirates Group preparing to be part of the Expo 2020, and what will be the impact of such an event on the Group's operations?</h4><p>The Emirates Group has and continues to play a significant role in Expo 2020. Emirates exists on the basis of connectivity and, in the last financial year, we carried 44.5 million passengers around the world. Emirates will help to bring millions of Expo visitors to Dubai in 2020, supporting the Expo theme “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future." With modern aircraft, such as our flagship A380, and numerous pioneering initiatives, Emirates is a shining example of the progress Expo gatherings have historically showcased. The airline is also representative of the rapid economic and infrastructural journey Dubai has undertaken. Our magnificent A380s are helping to spread the UAE'S Expo achievement globally with all 48 double-deckers dressed with the words “Expo 2020, Dubai UAE, Host City." These are immensely exciting times.</p><h4>What does the inauguration of Al Maktoum International represent for Dubai?</h4><p>Al Maktoum International at DWC in Jebel Ali represents a quantum leap for aviation in Dubai. When completed, we will have an airport offering twice the capacity of London Heathrow within a fully integrated aerotropolis. The airport has already been open to cargo flights since 2010 and passenger flights began in October 2013. Emirates' freighter operations shifted to DWC in mid-2014. The decision on whether Emirates moves its passenger operations to DWC is one for the Dubai government. The important point is that the infrastructure is being created to absorb the demand of Dubai's path to becoming the ultimate global hub.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was your involvement in the Dubai Airshow?<br></h4><p>We have been involved in providing logistics services in the capacity of the official freight forwarder and on-site handling agent since its inception in 1989. We are proud of the fact that Airlink occupies a leadership position in the field of exhibition logistics, and we are confident of facing fresh challenges that will come as part of Dubai's vibrant growth. Our full involvement in these various events is part of our strategy, and we strive to constantly explore innovative ways to give customers faster and better services.</p><h4>What opportunities is Al Maktoum International Airport bringing to your business?</h4><p>It has definitely added value for everybody involved in Dubai, specifically the cargo and passenger businesses. The improvement will be substantial once the airport is fully functional. Today, people can bring in even more air cargo, while passenger volume, too, is increasing. Dubai is growing at the speed of light, and about 20 million visitors are expected for Expo 2020. Dubai International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world, and the need for a second airport has been a central topic over the last years. I believe that Al Maktoum International Airport will help Dubai reach its targets, both in terms of visitors and logistics. As for us, we are a part of Dubai's economy and one of our main beliefs is to continually challenge our business practices and improve them. I see the development of Al Maktoum Airport as an opportunity for us to grow and ensure that all customers are benefiting from the integration of the port, the free zone, and the new airport. As far as our direct initiatives at the airport are concerned, we are thinking of acquiring a plot there to establish our presence. Discussions are in progress with the concerned authorities.</p><h4>Are you planning collaborations with the new airlines that the airport is bringing to Dubai?</h4><p>We are already the GSA for Cargolux, and we are considering other airlines for partnership. However, there must be a perceived need that is being fulfilled by a reliable and reputable carrier that needs representation for us to partner with it. In order to achieve the best results, we carefully select our partners, and I would like to stress our prudent business mindset in this process. We will always make sure we choose trustworthy and reputable companies that will not fail in meeting our commitments.</p><h4>In the airline segment, where do you forecast the most growth for your business?</h4><p>Growth will come exclusively from the airline segment. The travel sector is providing us with a solid revenue stream, and the cargo segment is robust. We provide our customers with reliable door-to-door and port-to-port air cargo services. In addition to this, we provide multiple airline options to manufacturers and suppliers, either direct or transshipped, for import and export shipments. The cargo segment is developing well, and I believe this positive trend will continue in the future, and we will be able to capitalize on all the opportunities that will knock at our door.</p><h4>How is Dubai attracting new investors in the logistics sector?</h4><p>The legal framework of Dubai favors foreign investors, and virtually all aspects of it have been ameliorated to be more conducive to commercial activity. This has encouraged others to move to Dubai. There will always be opportunities for investment, and for business to thrive. Dubai is undergoing rapid development and more and more companies are realizing how attractive Dubai can be as a hub for logistics services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind Aston Martin's decision to return to the UAE after a two-year break?<br></h4><p>Aston Martin never actually left the UAE market, and we merely took a break to refocus, reconsolidate, and launch in a manner that would provide a far better customer experience, which required significant investments. If you intend to deliver something exceptional, it demands two or three years of planning and proper implementation. The investment itself requires significant development, all of which takes time. One of the premier Aston Martin showrooms in the world is in Dubai; a flagship showroom we are extremely proud of that is located adjacent to Dubai Mall. We offer a lifestyle car, which demands a careful selection of address. We believe that the way we invested in the UAE sent a strong message. The first outcome of our efforts of the past two years is our showroom facilities, which are second to none. In addition to this we have an after-sales technical center, built with millions of dollars of investment, and one of the largest technical centers in the world. This was a sound investment as the UAE already has an appetite for our product. We have the client base here, but of course that client base deserves the best facilities, which is precisely what we have provided.</p><h4>How are your sales and growth rates performing?</h4><p>Our growth currently exceeds 100% per year, and for 2014, too, we expect between an 80% and 100% increase in sales. We have a clear range of products, from smaller to larger engines, and from a relatively affordable product to a much more exclusive, top-of-the-line model. Aston Martin has launched several truly splendid models globally over the past year. In November 2013 at the Dubai Motor Show, we were able to launch those products in the region for the first time. Over the past 12 months, we have brought up four exclusive products, and by 2015 we will have a further three exclusive products for sale in the region. Our selection process is a combination of being able to pioneer a product in the market, and the availability of the right product choices.</p><h4>Which models are you set to launch, and which are new to the Middle East?</h4><p>Our Flagship model, the Vanquish, is new to the market. Late in 2013, we introduced the V12 Vantage, the fastest Aston Martin ever produced. On top of this we also brought out the convertible Vanquish Volante, new to the region as of December 2013. This year we have a number of new products, including a special-edition Vantage N430 in June. June also sees the introduction of a V8 Vantage range, which is a competitive, sporty car. And in late July we will bring out special editions of our DB9, the legendary James Bond car, in carbon black or pure white.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government has created the Dubai Government Excellence Program (DGEP), in which you have participated by sharing your experience with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA). With which other authorities will the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) share its experience?<br></h4><p>The RTA is sharing its experience in implementing DGEP requirements and criteria with many governmental entities such as DEWA, the Dubai Police, the Dubai Municipality, and Dubai Customs. This is an annual practice that the RTA will continue depending on the requirements of each authority. In addition, RTA holds regular meetings with its strategic partners regarding its external communications plan and a culture of excellence is embedded within these meetings. The RTA also participates in the annual best practices forum, where all government entities present their case. One of the purposes of the DGEP is to share best practices between government entities in order to improve the overall performance of the governmental sector. One of the indicators that shows the effectiveness of the program is the improvement in overall customer satisfaction across all Dubai government entities from 74% in 2007 to 87% by end-2012. That said, there will always be room for improvement across each standard metric and the RTA will continuously ensure that improvements are implemented.</p><h4>A tram system is being developed in Dubai. How will this complement Dubai's underground rail and bus infrastructure?</h4><p>Dubai Tram will be serving some of the city's economic nerve centers, which are at the heart of its tourism trade. The tram services will complement the Dubai Metro Red Line through the direct linking of Phase I of the project with two Metro stations, namely Dubai Marina station and the Jumeirah Lakes Towers station, respectively, to provide the safe and direct transfer of passengers between the two modes of public transport. The public bus services will be integrated with both Dubai Tram and Metro services through either the urban bus lines, or feeder bus routes, which are designed to provide the most seamless travel to remote destinations. According to the planned schedule, Phase I of the Dubai Tram project will be completed with commercial operations to commence in November 2014. The Board of Directors of the RTA endorsed the award of a contract to construct four covered and air-conditioned footbridges for Dubai Tram users—two bridges will also be constructed over Al Safouh Street to serve tram users and residents on both sides of the street, while the other two will link the Tecom zone with the locality on the opposite side of the street, as well as the Dubai Marina Mall, thus providing safety for pedestrians.</p><h4>What other projects are you planning in order to improve customer service in the public transport sphere?</h4><p>Apart from said footbridges, the RTA is planning to integrate the tram route with the nearby Palm Monorail system by constructing a footbridge linking Palm Jumeirah tram station with the Palm Monorail terminal station at the entrance of Jumeirah Palm area. Such a linkage will provide for the convenient integration of the Palm Monorail service with the public transport network within Dubai and help improve overall customer satisfaction among public transport users. The RTA is currently in the process of tendering the Dubai Metro Red Line connection from Sheikh Zayed road to the Expo 2020 site near Al Maktoum International Airport. The planned connection will serve existing and future developments beside the Expo 2020 site along the proposed route. The line is planned to be in service by late 2019. Other planned public transport projects will include the Green Line extension, which will extend the current services of Dubai Metro Green Line to the newly developing suburbs of Lagoon, International City, Silicon Oasis, and Academic City. The total length of this extension is 21 kilometers featuring 11 stations. The extension of the Red Line from the Rashidiya district to the Mirdif area is also a future rail project.</p><h4>The Green Bus is the leading environmental sustainability project launched by the RTA in cooperation with S.S. Lootah and the UNEP. The RTA has in place a strategic plan to broaden the scope of the experiment to span 60 buses over the next three years. How are you applying the plan, and what is your approach to the environment?</h4><p>This is a strategic project of the Public Transport Agency (PTA), to be implemented by the maintenance and services departments, and involving the use of B5 biodiesel on 60 buses starting from 2014 to 2016. To the 11 buses already running on biodiesel, 10 will be added in 2014, and 40 in 2015 and 2016. The RTA has other initiatives to support environmental sustainability, which include setting the air-conditioning temperature inside buses at 24 °C, which has already been implemented on 517 buses. We also have a new initiative, which involves automatic bus engine shut-off after five minutes at a bus stop or station in order to reduce idling time, fuel consumption, and gas emissions, a system that has recently been implemented on 10 buses.</p><h4>The RTA recently held its 45th Customer Council session. What were the conclusions of this event?</h4><p>Customer Council gatherings are always held with the aim of gauging the RTA's customer needs, views, and suggestions to improve the service offering. They also open new horizons and add to the RTA's third strategic “Customers First" strategy, particularly as we provide more than 206 diversified services through multiple channels including our website, and customer service centers, among others. This warranted us to respond to customer feedback in a timely fashion, and to take opinions on board in all our current and future initiatives toward improvement. Constructive suggestions from the public included providing NOL Card vending machines, which the RTA has already installed at certain bus stations, while a study is underway to have them installed in others.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that Expo 2020 will bring to the RTA?</h4><p>The RTA does not consider Expo 2020 to be a challenge, but rather a great opportunity and another significant addition to its excellent record of hosting and managing major international events such as IMF and UITP meetings, among others. In fact, the timing of the announcement that Dubai would host Expo 2020 could not have been better, since the RTA is currently undertaking a project to update strategic and implementation plans related to transportation for Dubai, which will develop integrated transportation projects and policies necessary to cope with the forecast urban and economic growth of the Emirate, including developments and activities relating to Expo 2020. The study is currently in the data-collection and transport-survey stages, which aim to better understand travel behavior within Dubai and between Dubai and the surrounding Emirates. This study aims to produce integrated long-, medium-, and short-term road and public transportation plans for the Emirate of Dubai until the year 2030. In line with this, the RTA is also working on the preparation of a detailed Expo 2020 Transportation Master Plan, which aims at identifying the detailed requirements of the event in terms of the transportation infrastructure, systems, and initiatives needed to serve the Dubai Expo 2020 site during the event and after it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new hospitality projects are you bringing to Dubai in 2014?<br></h4><p>We are set to undertake approximately 5 million square feet of projects in 2014. One-fifth of this will be allocated to the hospitality sector, either for serviced apartments or for the hotel business with four-and five-star hotels offering superior amenities. The main focus at first will be on serviced apartments, which are in high demand ahead of Expo 2020.</p><h4>How is the Atria project developing?</h4><p>The Atria is a project of approximately 725,000 square feet divided into two buildings, with amenities and retail services. Of the two buildings, one is a residential with 219 units of one, two, and three bedrooms, and has already sold out. Conceptualized by UK-based designers, yoo Studio, the hotel apartment tower, which is comprised of 347 units, will feature studios, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments, and three bedroom duplex units across a 30-floor complex. Our strategy is to give added value to our clients, not only with the brand name, but also with the interior design. Our designer is renowned as one of the best in the world.</p><h4>What is your strategy for improving profitability?</h4><p>In 2012, Deyaar turned AED38.6 million in consolidated net profit and, in 2013, we quadrupled that to an AED154.5 million consolidated net profit. We have seen growth in our stock and hope that profits will continue to rise for the next few years at least. Deyaar's strategy is to diversify its capabilities in the real estate sector and, accordingly, has decided to expand its development portfolio beyond commercial and residential properties, with the inclusion of hospitality projects. In line with our new direction, we have allotted up to 1 million square feet for hotel and serviced apartment projects in prime locations in the city in the coming years.</p><h4>Over 2013, Deyaar added around 600 units to its portfolio. How many units are you planning to add in 2014?</h4><p>We are handing over 180 units. We also have previous stock that remains available. In terms of sales, there are about 500 units available in various areas. Also, through our joint ventures, such as Central Park, a mixed-used development located at the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a project with Dubai Properties, we will be adding a further 426, two-thirds of which are already sold.</p><h4>What is your approach to Dubai's regulatory regime in the real estate sector?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Dubai has streamlined its policies in a way that enables long-term, sustained development in the real estate and property sector, which I think is exceptional, considering this is still a nascent market. With all the regulations in place, it is only a matter of ensuring that developers comply with them before they launch their projects. Ideally, a project should be launched only after getting the master plan approved by the authorities, which should also ascertain that the plan is strictly adhered to during the execution stage as well.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the recent increase in construction activity in Dubai?</h4><p>When I drive around the UAE, I see huge growth in the number of projects. The government has been spending heavily, and there are some projects emerging that will impact the industry overall. One major issue is related to labor. Following the crisis, many companies chose to let many laborers go. As these large projects require workers, the market may eventually face a skilled labor issue. This will impact the real estate industry as costs will increase.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai has over 150 private schools with a variety of curricula. How does this very international group influence Dubai and its business community?<br></h4><p>The variety of curricula on offer is a reflection of what Dubai's society is today. It is an organic and evolving landscape. The question is, how does this benefit education? We all know that diversity, if harvested properly, brings the best out of people. When there is diversity in the classroom, the learning experience becomes better. This is where we see a transition occurring. Some of the private school curricula were established some time back by the business community just to cater to the needs of their children. We used to call them community schools. Now you see nationalities that do not have their own schools here integrating into those schools. I think that diversity among students is really giving families the opportunity to educate their children in a different system to what they might have back home. For example, if you are French, there are not a lot of European schools, but there are a lot of international schools, so you get to choose, and this is an opportunity for parents to select a different system for their kids.</p><h4>How do you make sure all these systems follow standards in terms of quality?</h4><p>We use various tools to check on the quality. One is our inspection framework. Over the past seven years, we have developed our inspection criteria, and it has a very universal perspective. While developing the inspection framework, we went around the world to see various systems. We then developed a framework of universal education, which talks about the needs of students, teachers, and administrators. There are also benchmarks around the world, some of them are administered by the OECD and others by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). These are international assessments that take place periodically, every three to five years depending on the assessment. What they do is measure different things at different stages. PIRLS measures reading literacy at Grade 4, TIMSS assesses mathematics and science at Grades 4 and 8, while PISA assesses 15-year-old students. So, for example, if we take British curriculum schools, we can see how schools that follow the British system in Dubai compare with those in the UK.</p><h4>What do you think are the characteristics that will make Dubai an international hub and a place where everyone wants to come to study?</h4><p>What makes things work in Dubai is a strong economy and a diverse business community. That is what everyone is here for, and that is what started Dubai. The strong diverse economic landscape in Dubai is what fuels all the sectors from health to education. Keep in mind that 90% of the population are not UAE nationals. What is enabling Dubai's strong economy is a combination of hard infrastructure like the built environment and soft infrastructure in skills and talent. But of greater importance is the soft infrastructure you have in Dubai, and particularly in areas like safety and happiness. This is what is helping Dubai move forward. Around 89% of students in Dubai are studying in a private school. And when I look at this 89%, of the 158 private schools in total, the vast majority of them are in for-profit schools. When you look at these businesses, what do they care about? Finances are important, but so too is customer satisfaction. It is the whole exchange that is taking place: you get good service, and you pay for it. This dynamic is very interesting, and I think what is positive is the choices people can make.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about your UK investment in Heathrow?<br></h4><p>It is impressive because it is spread over 20 acres and three large warehouses. The capacity is about 250,000 tons, and we are almost full already. This was an investment that was taken during insecurity over airport expansions in the UK, but we saw an opportunity. It was a £75 million commitment, and we have built three warehouses and integrated them with the traffic flow, meaning the trucks just drive up to a gate, just like on a toll road system. Instead of paying to get in, they hand over their documents, get in, and drive straight through. We have eliminated the process of stopping, parking, and waiting. Some of the drivers didn't like that at first, but the owners of the operation do because it is much quicker. That is just one part of what we are doing there. We are handling a number of customers including Air New Zealand and Qantas, and we already operate dedicated facilities for Virgin as well. It is a major investment, welcomed by the local authority, which has been very supportive. Anyone who has seen it has been impressed—it is state-of-the-art. We haven't overcomplicated it. We have employed technology that is proven. Looking at simple things, such as traffic flow, has made a major difference. On the back of that, in the last three years, we have had airlines approach us because they like what we have done and want to work with us, which leads to other opportunities. Importantly, it means that you get people who want to work for you. You start to attract even better people who want to work for you because they like you.</p><h4>Are you thinking of going into other markets?</h4><p>We are always looking, but if the opportunity is easy, then someone would have already done it. It is very fragmented in this part of the world. Dubai is our home, so we should be strong in this region. If we are not strong in this region, then we have missed an opportunity and there is something wrong. However, it is very disjointed, political, and government controlled in many places; therefore, the barriers to entry can be quite substantial. If it were as simple as who is best suited for the business, it would be easy, but there are always things you have to deal with in business. Our ability to grow in this region has been much slower than I would like. We are looking at many things in Africa, where we see great opportunities. These markets come with a higher risk profile, but they also come with better opportunities. The mature markets of Europe are more stable, but the margins are being driven down and commoditized too much.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the deciding factors behind moving your HQ to Dubai?<br></h4><p>For a vast region that extends to areas like Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a need for better accessibility to some of the countries that need our assistance the most. For this reason, Dubai serves as a great hub; it attracts global talent, and a lot of the international corporate level regional decision-making happens in Dubai as well. It is useful to be based where trends can be experienced firsthand. Dubai is a dynamic city, and is a comfortable place to establish a strong base for accessing such a vast region. It is also important to mention that Beirut will remain as the Medtronic headquarters for the MENA region, with the exception of Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It will serve the region from Pakistan to Morocco.</p><h4>What is the importance of this region, and Dubai specifically, for Medtronic's global strategy?</h4><p>Globally, Medtronic is exerting much energy on making sure we are well represented outside of the traditional, mature markets such as the US and Europe. Our CEO, Omar Ishrak, since his commencement at Medtronic, has made sure that this is a pillar in the process we follow to take decisions. Our region, as an emerging global market, is receiving ample attention, which we see as a great opportunity. In turn, Medtronic Global is giving us all of the support necessary to provide better access to our patients in the region, and for the various therapies and technologies we produce. It is a vast region, and, thus, we have created sub-regions within, and we define different sets of strategies for each sub-region. This process may even take on deeper consideration for single account strategies in certain cities. The broadness of such strategies and our commitments will depend on the level of interest we see from our partners in the field, the healthcare providers, the existing penetration levels, the target potential, and the aspirations that these partners have. These sub-regions will be supported by their own separate localized structures.</p><h4>How would you characterize Medtronic's specific strategy for Dubai?</h4><p>The leadership in Dubai wants to establish Dubai as a great city for healthcare delivery, so that it can steadily attract medical tourism. The population of Dubai primarily comprises expatriates who are young. The ease of accessibility in Dubai would make it a good place for medical tourism. Based on the size of the city and the demographics of the population, Dubai has the best chances in the region when it comes to medical tourism.</p><h4>Medtronic has plans to open a Medtronic Academy in Dubai. Can you elaborate on your expectations for this?</h4><p>There are 1.4 billion people and close to 70 countries in this region. Many of these countries do not have the technologies necessary to provide care for patients.  Infrastructure is not the only issue; we also face the skill level of the providers. There is a tremendous need in the region to develop healthcare professionals who can provide complex therapies. These are sophisticated therapies that require extensive training. They usually deal with the most sensitive areas of the body, the heart, the brain, the spine, and the nervous system. Multiple layers of training, education, and programs are necessary to be able to carry out even basic procedures. Some of our programs take two years of training. Dubai is an easily accessible center that can give us the flexibility to work with hospitals or universities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our executive education programs target leaders seeking to enhance their expertise in leadership. Executive education programs offer a diversity of courses and topics. However, leadership is a top priority for us. We focus on empowering leaders and shaping the future through positive energy and positive leadership. That is more relevant to our country and our region. A positive leader is someone who instills motivation and takes advantage of opportunities and strengths to lead people in any entity or organization. Education will serve as the correct nourishment for our future leaders, and it will support them through their careers in any sector they might choose. MBRSG also offers the Master's in Public Administration which is a unique program that qualifies graduates to enhance their individual as well as institutional performance. The program focuses on public policy, governance and best practices.</p><h4>How does the MPA program impact the performance of your graduates in the business world?</h4><p>Most of our MPA students have at least three years of experience in the public or private sector. More than 70% of our students are in the public sector. We work to increase their competencies and advance their skills. We provide them with the possibility to interact with experts in the field and learn about case studies taken from a variety of different scenarios in the UAE and the world. Our final goal is to mold our students so that they will be ready to be leaders in the future.</p><h4>From where do you attract international students?</h4><p>We have international students from both the Arab and Asian regions at the Master's degree level. We are marketing this program in the Arab region in order to attract international students. As for executive education, most of our clients are government entities of the UAE. However, we have started marketing this program in the Arab world. We are now running the Arab Leadership and Excellence Program to bring in senior officials from governments and provide them with executive education. The program will start next November. It is an open enrollment training program that lasts two weeks. The students will learn about best practices. The course also comprises a visit to government facilities. We have received applications from non-Arabic countries, too. For that reason, we are also considering launching the program in English in the future—Dubai is certainly a pleasant place to come for a short training course.</p><h4>What potential does Dubai have for international education businesses?</h4><p>I believe that Dubai is a city with a great environment. It is attracting people to come here whether for study or business. This provides a perfect opportunity for educational businesses.</p><h4>How do you select your guest professors?</h4><p>We have already developed strategic guidelines for developing a global network of teaching personnel. We need to consider not only local, but also global perspectives. We hope to increase the number of international professors in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the profile of the students following the highly popular MBA program of the Manchester Business School (MBS)?<br></h4><p>MBS opened the Middle East Centre in Dubai Knowledge Village in 2006 and was the first top-ranked school to open a physical presence in the region, offering the MBA, the world's most popular business qualification and a pre-requisite for a serious career in international business for many companies. Since we opened our Middle East Centre in Dubai, we have supported over 1,600 MBA students from 85 nationalities. They study for the highly applied graduate, post-experience degree, and the part-time Manchester Global MBA program. The quality of our MBA students is a key feature of the region and around 10% of our students are already educated to the Master's level and 30% are already in c-level roles. Our students are highly committed working professionals who want to progress in their careers, or perhaps compete internationally. We have also seen many students use the MBA program to develop their entrepreneurial skills and launch their own businesses. In addition to current students, we have an alumni community in the Middle East comprising of around 2,000 graduates of our full-time and part-time MBA programs, making for a vibrant professional network. Our new Global Executive MBA program, launched in July 2014, is a more personalized program designed for the most senior executives, who will join the MBS international alumni community of more than 50,000 working professionals.</p><h4>What is Dubai doing in order to cement its status as an educational hub?</h4><p>Dubai has taken many positive steps already to attract and support top-quality education providers. When we wanted to set up our Middle East Centre in 2006, Dubai was the natural choice because of the strength of its “three Ts:" trade, tourism, and transportation. Dubai is very business-friendly and attracts top corporates and business service providers, as well as educated working professionals. Dubai International Academic City is the world's first purpose-built facility for education providers, and now hosts more than 20 international branches of  universities, the largest concentration anywhere in the world. As a partner of Dubai International Academic City and Dubai Knowledge City, this relationship has played a major role in our success and has led to the Middle East Centre becoming the largest and fastest growing center in the MBS international network, even larger than Shanghai and Manchester. There is an appetite and need for quality education providers in Dubai. MBS was the first top-ranked business school to set up here, and received considerable support from Dubai and this support continues; Dubai is not taking its regional hub status for granted and it continues to involve its education partners and reinforce its regional hub status. Our students find everything they need here, from the world-class education that we provide, to high-quality infrastructure, transportation, and air connections. The creation of the Knowledge and Human Development Authority, which works closely with the education cluster, provides the reassurance that only quality education providers will operate here and receive support in the UAE. MBS has triple MBA accreditation and is often cited as a prime example of a successful, high-quality international education provider operating regionally from Dubai, and we are proud to be held up as an example of what is possible. This has also led us to include Dubai as one of the four international host centers of MBS for students on our new Global Executive MBA (GEMBA) program, launched in July 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The ultimate goal of Dubai Industrial City (DI) is to foster the growth of manufacturing in Dubai, as well as of its economy. What has been your strategy in this regard?<br></h4><p>The past few years have been successful for us, where we saw a growth rate of 33% in 2013. The growth has been mainly driven by economic recovery, as well as government measures to support the industrial sector and smart cities. During 2013, we set up four times more warehousing facilities than the year before. We forecast continued growth for the next few years. We will be investing in new infrastructure projects to ensure effective supply and demand dynamics, and focusing on the growth of seven key industrial clusters within DI.</p><h4>Taking into account governmental commitment for the Islamic economy, what are you doing to foster this development?</h4><p>In 2014, we have launched a new dedicated Halal Cluster as a part of Dubai's plan to become the global capital of the Islamic economy. We identified that the halal market for personal consumption products is huge. According to recent reports, Muslim consumers spend over $1 trillion on food and over $26 billion on cosmetics and personal care. This is expected to increase by 50% in the coming five years, to $1.6 trillion and $39 billion, respectively. The MENA region with its high-density Muslim population is very attractive. The food market alone is worth $85 billion in the GCC, and $237 billion in the other MENA regions. The UAE is the 14th largest market in the world with $20 billion. Our Halal Cluster is spread across close to 6.7 million square feet, and caters exclusively to halal FMCG and food products and operates as a logistics hub. With our newly established Halal Cluster, DI becomes a dedicated platform for companies and investors with halal operations in the UAE. Our vision is to provide a highly competitive platform for growth in the manufacturing and logistics sector in the UAE, and to act as a true enabler of Dubai's ambition to become the global capital of the Islamic economy. Our Halal Cluster consists of fully separated industrial block adjacent to fast transportation infrastructure, state-of-the-art labor villages and retail communities and built and ready-to-use warehouses and showrooms.</p><h4>What are the peculiarities of DI when compared to other free zones in the Emirate?</h4><p>First of all, DI is a non-free zone catering to industrial tenants in manufacturing and logistics within the GCC market. Free and non-free zones are often confused. In a free zone, a foreign investor is usually given 100% ownership, and it is mainly occupied by exporting industries. The companies that wish to reside in the DI are treated as an Emirati company. This is intended to help them set up manufacturing facilities to cater to the regional market given the free trade agreement (FTA) signed by the UAE with other GCC states, which gives investors the opportunity to export their products as local products, and benefit from a 5% exportation cost deduction since they will be exempted from customs according to these trade agreements.  Additional benefits include no taxes on personal and corporate income, full repatriation of capital as per federal law, and duty-free imports of machinery, equipment and raw materials for production. We also provide single window facilitation with various government entities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given its rapidly growing population, what is the role of urban planning in Dubai?<br></h4><p>The civic body aims to convert 30,000 buildings to green buildings by 2030, which is about 25% of the 120,000 buildings that we have now. At first, we will select the most energy-consuming buildings, targeting government buildings in the first stage, in order to set an example. We did not forget about the older buildings or those constructed before the mandatory green buildings regulation and specifications were implemented in March 2014. The best approaches on how to convert older buildings using eco-friendly materials on both the inside and outside of a structure will be taken into account. Dubai Municipality also works on a proposal to set up a rating system for buildings, which can be used as a tool for building owners to rate their buildings and, in turn, have a higher rate in the market. The steering committee for the Dubai Urban Plan 2020 has implemented a set of rules to ensure that all new and ongoing projects in the Emirate of Dubai do not affect the government's initiative to achieve a green city.</p><h4>Which new exciting projects are to be completed in the long term and how will they shape Dubai?</h4><p>The Dubai Safari project is under construction in Al Warqa 5, Aweer Road, on an area of 119 hectares. The project includes Arabian, Asian, and African villages to accommodate animals from different continents, in addition to an open safari. The Safari, which covers 22 hectares of the total area, is aimed at establishing the best center for wildlife in the world, providing a variety of environments appropriate to different animals. The Dubai Frame project is an integrated frame that uniquely highlights the attractions of the Emirate as visitors view the scenes and buildings on Sheikh Zayed Road from one side, which symbolize the modern Dubai, while from the other side of the frame visitors can see the landmarks of Deira, Umm Hurair, and Karama, which symbolize the old Dubai. The Frame also includes a museum that tells the story of the development of the city and information on the past and present. The height of the Dubai Frame will be 150 meters, with a width of 100 meters. Another project is Al Fahidi Market, at a cost of AED50.5 million, and over 27,000 sqm, resembles Souq Naif in Deira in terms of its traditional architecture with a combination of ancient and modern culture and trade. The market allocates specific areas for different types of trade activities, such as food, fabrics, toys, handicrafts, traditional products, and gold. The project also aims to promote the small trading activities of the local community, which do not require a large amount of capital and create new job opportunities. The Crocodile Park project aims to house and care for a number of crocodiles and facilitate the best feeding methods, healthcare, as well as reproduction schemes with regard to endangered animals. It will attract tourists from the UAE and foreign countries and serve as an educational center for students. Furthermore, Deira Fish Market is a fully air-conditioned commercial complex that provides the best services. The unique Holy Quran Park is also expected to be completed by September 2015 at an estimated cost of AED26 million. The park is one of the most prestigious projects of the civic body located in the Al Khawaneej area and is specially designed from an Islamic perspective to introduce the miracles of the Quran through a variety of surprises for the visitors. There are many other important ongoing and under-design projects, such as different markets, a number of residential and public parks, public facilities and buildings, architectural and heritage projects, and tourist attractions being implemented by Dubai Municipality that will contribute to achieving its vision of creating an excellent city that provides the essence of success and comfort for sustainable living.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about the new e-service that you've launched to improve your customer service relationship?<br></h4><p>In 2011, we opted for SAP as the company's new ERP platform, having previously been based on the Oracle ERP system. Phase I, in June 2012, involved the implementation in the main company, Dubai Real Estate Corporation (DREC), after which we extended the process to our subsidiaries. The first subsidiary to implement the new ERP system was Dubai Golf, which went online in 1Q2013. From there, we have been building up to the customer service phase where we have introduced certain automated services for our clients. We are going to have an application enabling the customer to access the inventory of our entire real estate portfolio with details of price and availability, and the opportunity to study floor plans. And for upcoming projects, a link will lead them to a video preview revealing all aspects of the product. If they like what they see, they can send a purchase inquiry online directly. Once the inquiry reaches the sales center the customer is called and a viewing arranged, proceeding through to a sale. The second stage of the e-services program will involve the direct online renewal and new lease issuing, removing the need for a physical visit. Everything will be electronic including payment, debited through their credit card rather than a normal PDC check. As well as the ERP system, we have also developed the wasl site for wasl Properties and the Land Department. On the Land Department wasl site, people can view the inventory of industrial land available for lease. They can also review such matters as contracts, areas, and zoning. The Property Management site features a property finder with a description of the products available and all other details. Today, the ERP system has taken that up a level where customers can really interact and make business happen, rather than just passively view details on the wasl site.</p><h4>How is the wasl district heritage project developing?</h4><p>Wasl district is one of the company's flagship projects. We initiated the scheme one-and-a-half years ago, and the entire heritage concept emerged from our first site visit. Al Maktoum Hospital was one of the first local hospitals, but the Dubai authorities decided that the site was no longer suitable due to local traffic congestion. Therefore, it was shut down, and the land transferred to the DREC. We were thinking of developing the site as a residential project, but then discovered that the oldest building on the site was actually the first hospital to have been built in the whole of Dubai sometime in the 1950s, with much history behind it. Being a heritage site, we converted the building into a museum. And because the hospital building was in the middle of the plot, and one story high, we had to design everything around that and to that level. The first phase is a traditional market design, around the museum encouraging people to roam at their leisure. Surrounding that will be the high-rise residential buildings with a hotel component.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the real estate sector overall?</h4><p>I think that Dubai has positioned itself well as a central business hub between Europe and Asia. Having that kind of positioning has led to many growth opportunities for all business sectors in Dubai and the UAE. This has been boosted by Dubai winning the Expo 2020, which will help the economy. I think that today Dubai has the right legislative and tourism platforms, and the right infrastructure to become more of an exhibition hub. It has brought many business groups and companies to this part of the world and is able to cater to all their requirements for doing business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our hometown and the seat of our business will always be Dubai. We have additional projects in Abu Dhabi, Jeddah, Riyadh, Amman, and Doha, and any expansion in the Middle East will mainly be in those cities. We established a company in 2013 in Baghdad, and are probing the market as we know that it is ultimately destined to be one of the largest real estate markets in the Middle East.</p><h4>DAMAC was planning to call some investors to Dubai from different countries. Why are you interested in doing this?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the best areas for second homes, vacation homes, weekend homes, and recreation homes; places that you visit for businesses and relaxation. And many people who have set up business here take an apartment or house, because they visit this city four or five times per year. People from Saudi Arabia are often here on vacation for the weekend, as are many people from India. Dubai is an aspirational destination for so many neighboring cities, offering convenience and opulence, but also safety and security in stark contrast to many regional countries. In addition to this, in 2013 Dubai had 10 million tourists, with 69 million transit passengers arriving at the airport. The target is to convert some of the latter travelers into tourist arrivals. There are many conscious steps that the government is taking to make sure that Dubai remains competitive. If you have an apartment here, for example, but don't frequently use it, you can give it to a hotel company that will rent it for you on an overnight basis as part of its business, which in turn increases the current 80,000 hospitality units in the market. This is why we ventured very heavily into the luxury hotel apartments sector. We now have, in Dubai, over 8,000 hotel apartments under development. And the unique model that we started with hotel apartments is that you buy a hotel apartment from us, and on completion put that unit into the rental pool if you so choose, and we will remove all the stress and manage the property on your behalf.</p><h4>AKOYA by DAMAC is one of DAMAC's flagship projects currently. What are your expectations for this specific project?</h4><p>AKOYA by DAMAC is fast becoming one of the most desirable golf course communities anywhere, with a 4.3 million square foot private park, swimming pools, landscaped gardens, and a state-of-the-art gymnasium included in each of the developments. The 42 million square foot master development is just 10 minutes from Sheikh Zayed Road, set around the Trump International Golf Club, Dubai—the first Trump course to be operated and managed by the Trump Organization in the Middle East and Asia. The community was recently named as the “Best International Golf Development" in the world at the International Property Awards.</p><h4>What will Expo 2020 bring to the real estate and hospitality sector?</h4><p>Expo 2020 is essentially a sentiment booster. We need to be ready for the six-month Expo from a logistics perspective but, once again, it is not a major booster for real estate on its own. The Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) estimates that tourism growth alone necessitates a rise from today's 85,000 room keys to around 145,000 keys by 2020, even without the Expo. The Expo itself will only require an additional 15,000 rooms, which is a modest rise.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>HH Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan met with HE RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, in June 2014 to discuss a strategy to enhance and consolidate ties between the two nations. What have you identified as priority areas for developing bilateral trade and investment between the UAE and Poland?<br></h4><p>During the meeting with HH Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan on June 16, 2014, Foreign Minister RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski stressed that the UAE holds the position as our largest economic partner in the Arab world. In 2013, trade turnover exceeded $860 million, and for 1Q2014 it amounted to over $430 million. Polish exports are dominated by mechanical and electrical equipment, food products, and metal products, while imports are dominated by aluminum and articles of base metal, plastic products, and mechanical and electrical devices. One of our export hits is the Arabian horse. Since 1970, Janów Podlaski holds an annual Arabian horse auction, which attracts traders from all over the world. The fastest Arabian horses appeared on August 25, 2014 at the Warsaw racetrack during the 10 races scheduled as part of the UAE Day. Personally, I would be interested in developing cooperation in the field of tourism. Tourism is very important to the Polish economy; it creates more than 6% of GDP. Tourism is an industry of the 21st Century, which processes the unique climate and landscape of the country, its historical background, and its ethnic, cultural, and political significance for economic benefits. In this regard, we have vast room for cooperation. Tourist trips allow for a better understanding and the bringing together of societies, but are also often the beginning of business contacts and cooperation in the field of industrial cooperation and investment.</p><h4>Both Poland and Dubai are focusing on becoming hubs for medical tourism in their respective regions. What synergies or areas of collaboration do you foresee in regard to the mutual development of medical tourism?</h4><p>Poland is one of Europe's leading directions in the field of medical tourism. It is estimated that each year, just for this purpose, Poland is visited by more than 300,000 foreigners. We specialize in strictly medical treatments, including surgery, plastic surgery, dentistry, rehabilitation, diagnostics, as well as in the delivery of services in the field of spa treatment, relaxation, and detoxification treatment. Poland is known for its centuries-old tradition of spa treatment and rehabilitation, with the use of rich natural resources and physical methods. We also have a large number of spa and wellness clinics. I also know that the UAE specializes in medical tourism, and plans involve receiving 500,000 medical tourists a year by 2020. We are not competitors, and can work together.</p><h4>Dubai is expected to receive 20 million tourists by 2020. What are the peculiarities of Dubai as a touristic destination?</h4><p>To achieve success in foreign tourism, it is crucial to facilitate the organization of trips. Poles are very mobile. In 2013, they participated in nearly 10 million trips abroad. I am very pleased to see that with the start of direct flights between Warsaw and Dubai on February 6, 2013, and with the elimination on March 22, 2014, of the obligation to obtain promises of visa upon arrival in the UAE, the number of Polish tourists traveling to the UAE is significantly increasing. Polish tourists appreciate leisure in good conditions combined with possibilities for satisfying their curiosity. The UAE answers that need. Some of the local investments have no equal in the world. They attract with great resorts, the scale of buildings, as well as with modern technologies. Cleanliness and order draw particular attention.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Jumeirah is regarded as a symbol of leisure and tourism in Dubai and your motto is “Stay Different." What are the core values behind this and how do you apply them?<br></h4><p>Our motto refers to the fact that we recognize that each customer is an individual. We apply this to each of our hotels, since we believe that each hotel must have its own personality. This is manifested in the different architectural style we apply, but the golden thread that we have going through each of our hotels is the Jumeirah culture, which is based on our hallmarks. Our three hallmarks are behavioral standards. The first is that we should always smile and greet the guest before they greet us. As a first response to a guest request, we never say no. The third is that we treat each of our guests and employees with respect and integrity. We have developed this culture over about 17 years and we put forward the idea that each customer is an individual.</p><h4>How do you blend modernity and comfort so well with the signature Arab hospitality of Jumeirah?</h4><p>First of all, you have to undertake beautiful projects and hotels. We are very fortunate that HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum supports the Jumeirah Group here in Dubai with Jumeirah Beach Hotel and Burj Al Arab, which have become icons for the industry and for the city. It is our culture and our service standards that define Jumeirah in addition to our lovely properties, and we have been able to stand out and export this brand overseas. We are now operating in 11 different destinations, with 22 hotels worldwide and at least 15 under development. We have quite a large pipeline, which continues to evolve and develop: we have five hotels under development, three under construction and two more ready to come in China.</p><h4>In light of the new regulations for visas between the UAE and Europe's Schengen zone, how do you see tourism developing as a result?</h4><p>The British and some Europeans already come here anyway without a visa, so from that perspective it does not make much difference. It is, however, important that countries continue to have an enlightened approach to visas to facilitate travel. I work a lot with the World Tourism and Travel Council and the World Economic Forum, whereby we have been trying to lobby and persuade governments over the past years that by adopting a more pragmatic approach to visa entry, they would develop their tourism. Ultimately, there should be a common electronic visa platform across the world, as this would address many security-related matters as well.</p><h4>There has been a lot of talk about the diversification of the economy in Dubai. What role do you think the tourism sector plays, and how will it boost Dubai in the coming years?</h4><p>The tourism sector contributes nearly 10% to global GDP, provides 8.7% of jobs worldwide, and employs 260 million people working within the travel, tourism, and hospitality segments; hence, it is already an extremely important industry. It sometimes does not get the credit it deserves. In Dubai, it has been said that by 2020 we will have created 277,000 additional jobs with 40% being in travel and tourism. Right now, the sector contributes approximately 20% of Dubai's GDP, meaning there is a huge amount of importance attributed to it. Through the leadership of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, it is clearly understood that tourism is an important pillar of Dubai's economy.</p><h4>What will see in terms of investment in the coming years?</h4><p>What we are doing at the moment is developing the fourth phase of the Medina Madinat Jumeirah, which will be a 430-bedroom hotel. It is well laid out with attractive architecture. Its style will be more modern than the rest of Madinat Medina Jumeirah and will be a nice link between the extremely modern Jumeirah Beach Resort Hotel and the tradition of Jumierah Medina and the other three hotels that form the resort. It has a great beach area as well, so we are looking forward to opening that in two years from now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering that Regus operates in over 100 countries around the globe, how did you successfully adapt your business model to the local challenges in the UAE?<br></h4><p>The biggest challenge in the UAE compared to a lot of other countries is the regulatory framework. In Dubai, according to Department of Economic Development (DED) licensing, you have to have a 200-square-foot office, which started from April 2013 and drove out a number of smaller companies that only required a small office. The same thing happened in Abu Dhabi, where the limit went from 13 sqm to 15 sqm. And so we have had to renovate centers, close some places, and lose clients that no longer fitted the model the authorities wanted. In that respect, we simply have to adapt to the ongoing legislative changes when it comes to setting businesses up in business centers.</p><h4>What does Dubai represent for Regus in the bigger picture?</h4><p>If you look at the UAE, we have 12 locations open as of today, and 30 in the Gulf area. We're part of a global unrivaled network and this is a key location both for local companies wanting to grow, but also for international businesses to explore the UAE's business potential. We are also in London, Tokyo, New York, and Paris, and Dubai fits comfortably along with those names.</p><h4>One of Regus' mottos is “flexibility drives profitability." What is the idea behind that?</h4><p>For example, if a client has four employees, but two are always on the go outside the office, we need the flexibility to be able to offer the right solution. It's no use offering an office with 12 desks when there are only ever two people in the office. If you are in a Regus center, you can have an office that holds four and then, if the business grows, you can easily move to a larger office in the same center. That is flexibility. Regus grows with you and provides you with the flexibility to work anywhere. For example, we have centers at airports, shopping malls, and in petrol stations in places such as the UK. That is the trend we see; fewer people will be sitting in offices all the time.</p><h4>What is your position regarding eco-friendly and LEED-certificated offices?</h4><p>This is something that we are now more conscious of when we are looking at centers. We are now designing centers where we have more control of the lighting and the air conditioning. People often leave the air conditioning or lights on, and so it's nice to have more control. In Abu Dhabi, we are currently doing that and I think that we all have a responsibility and we are getting better. I would like to think that with each center we are building we are getting more and more green.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[healthy-wealthy-wise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of primary healthcare in Dubai, and what are the most important issues this institution has tackled?<br></h4><p>Primary Healthcare (PHC) first started with the WHO declaration of the International Conference on PHC held in Almaty in 1978. In Dubai, the first medical clinic was established in 1943 in the Al Ras area; it provided primary health care. In 1952, Al Maktoum Hospital was established. In 1975, the PHC department was established and seven community health centers were built in Dubai to empower the outreach program and provide health services to all. In 1988, another six centers were established. Today, Dubai Health Authority's PHC sector operates 14 health centers and a nursing home for the elderly. It has several specialized services such as the dentistry department, health-related social affairs, community medicine, and preventive healthcare under its wing. Most recently, the PHC sector introduced 24-hour care in family medicine; this service provides 24-hour healthcare and urgent care to the community. These services are currently being provided in the Nad Al Hamar and Al Barsha health centers. This service encourages the community to consider primary healthcare as their first point of contact so that hospital visits are reserved for emergency situations.</p><h4>How do you raise awareness of the need for a healthy lifestyle?</h4><p>Health promotion and awareness comprises a huge division in the PHC sector. Health awareness is a crucial part of the Community Health Unit, providing health education and counseling to the community. With educational and screening programs designed for various community groups such as schools, universities, laborers, and even tourists, the unit helps raise awareness about lifestyle disease and prevention methods. PHC also includes traveler's clinics—these are specialized clinics that provide necessary vaccines and travel education prior to travel. In addition to this, different specialties in the PHC sector offer several health screening packages to the community. This includes screening for chronic diseases or malignancies. The newly established wellness clinic provides health packages that concentrate on screening programs for diseases in risk age groups, providing medical packages to the community.  The wellness clinic will help in the prevention and the early detection of chronic diseases and malignancies to improve post-treatment outcomes.</p><h4>What are the main challenges regarding the implementation of PHC services that are you expecting?</h4><p>There are always challenges in everything we do, whether we are launching a service or educating people. The city is expanding geographically. Every month there is a new project in Dubai, and we have to keep up with the pace of change. We are opening three hospitals and 40 health centers in order to meet this rise in demand. Ensuring the right human resources are available, such as doctors, nurses, and health educators, and providing a high quality of service is another major challenge.</p><h4>How important is preventative medicine?</h4><p>PHC is all about prevention and outreach health programs. Practitioners work alongside epidemiologists to identify and arrest threats to health. We recently worked on the prevention of Corona, a viral infection causing a syndrome called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The Preventive Medicine Unit of the PHC joined forces with officials in the WHO, CDC, the Ministry of Health, and the Health Authority - Abu Dhabi to track, monitor and prevent the spread of the deadly virus. We run many preventive campaigns, such as Tobacco Free Dubai. PHC also ran the STRAP road safety campaign. In fact, we've just entered the Guinness Book of World Records for conducting the largest ever diabetes-screening campaign.</p>]]></richbody0content>

It is very important to extend our support to the events that they participate in. It is also important for us to showcase our activities, as well as by our partners. And our partners are not just partners in a landlord/tenant sense; these are ongoing partnerships in which we work together in all areas and even carry out research projects together. Regarding Islamic finance, we represent the commercial arm of the education sector here in Dubai. Once HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum made the announcement with regard to the future developments in the Islamic economy, we organized a roundtable discussion. It was a huge event at which we brought together decision makers from the academic, government, and industry sectors, and we assisted them in order to have this dialogue to establish how we can work together to fulfill the vision set out by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. We played the role of a facilitator, facilitating discussions and reports that would be read not only by us, but also by the community and the country as a whole. We conducted a study with Deloitte in 2013, covering 11 industry sectors in depth. We surveyed students from 17 countries, including from South Korea all the way to North Africa, and we included Nigeria. The majority of these students travel abroad to pursue their studies, including to the US, and so we wanted to gauge their feedback. What we found was that the UAE is the fourth most sought-after destination after the US, UK, and Canada, which is great. We surpassed Australia and Singapore and even emerging education hubs such as Malaysia.</p><h4>What are the most important findings of the research you have carried out, and where do you see the need for more effort to be put in to achieve HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's vision?</h4><p>We cover all sectors and have identified many skill gaps. And not only that, we look at the challenges faced by the corporate world when it comes to the skills that are demanded by most enterprises. And of course, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum was one of them, along with auditing, management, and consultancy groups. I think that the need for auditing came in the wake of the economic crisis, with all the issues and challenges that were faced, and so with enterprises we started to focus more on audits and risk management. If you had carried out the same survey 10 years ago, the results would have been different.</p><h4>How can improvements be made in the area of vocational training?</h4><p>We work closely with governmental authorities, and they have their own agenda when it comes to vocational education. We work with the National Institute of Vocational Education (NIVE), and with different authorities in this regard, and share ideas. We are also interested in culinary arts, as this is an area that is very important for supporting the tourism and hospitality sector, which is growing rapidly. The sector's contribution to GDP is currently around 14% or 15%, and it is growing, especially in Dubai, where we do not rely on oil and gas money. This is where we look at a typical or conventional type of education. We also look at vocational learning, and Emiratization, which is very important. Right now, around 13,000 Emirati graduates join the market each year, with a ratio of 2:1 in favor of females.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tourism is one of the main sources of revenue in the UAE. How much has it grown over the past few years?<br></h4><p>It is difficult to accurately calculate the revenue generated by the tourism industry; however, we estimate that tourism contributed in the range of AED75 billion toward Dubai's GDP in 2012. Our target for 2020 is to triple this so that the industry is contributing in the range of AED215 billion-AED230 billion.</p><h4>How is Dubai's Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) planning to further boost this sector?</h4><p>The Dubai Vision 2020 includes the headline targets of welcoming 20 million visitors per year and trebling the contribution tourism makes to the economy compared to its contribution in 2012. Reaching our target of welcoming 20 million visitors a year by 2020 requires annual growth of between 7% and 9%. Achieving growth in visitor numbers will come from three areas: maintaining the market share across our existing source markets; achieving growth in a number of markets that we have identified as having high growth potential; and increasing the number of repeat visitors. The 2013 figures—the first annual results since we announced the Vision—show that we have made significant progress with 10.6% growth in visitor numbers YoY and positive growth across all other key indicators, including hotel revenues and visitor spending. There is a very detailed strategy that sets out how we will achieve the Vision 2020 targets and takes into account increased competition leading to more choice for tourists as well as the importance of social media and digital channels affecting the way people research, choose, and plan their holidays.</p><h4>What are some of your key priorities at the DTCM?</h4><p>A key part of our role at DTCM is to ensure people understand Dubai's destination offering and get a sense of what it is really like. A significant part of this is bridging the perception gap and telling a broader story. To give one small example, we recently staged the first Dubai Food Festival as a means of highlighting our impressive gastronomy offer. From Michelin-star chefs to quality street food, we have some of the world's largest brands such as Nobu and Hakkassan to home-grown brands, which are now making waves internationally. Our food offerings can be a major pull factor for tourists, but it is something we have previously undersold. In terms of increasing our destination offering, we will work closely with public-private partnerships (PPPs) to achieve three priority objectives. First, we want to establish Dubai as the leading destination for families, events, and business. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, has stated his desire for the UAE to become the world's number one family destination, and Dubai will lead the way in this regard, continuing to enhance its already strong family offer. To give one example, the GCC provides a number of our top-10 source markets, including Saudi Arabia, which is our number one market. It is well known—and supported by research—that Saudi Arabian visitors to Dubai largely travel in families and like to stay close to shopping malls and entertainment centers. This naturally leads us to consider what accommodation we have to fit these requirements and suggests that we may require more hotel apartments in these locations (hotel apartments providing opportunities for families to stay together). We have already announced a joint initiative with Dubai Municipality with financial incentives for the hotel investment community to develop more hotels in the three- and four-star segment. And as we recognize that in order to achieve the targeted visitor growth, we need to increase our accommodation options across all budget points. We also need to ensure that we continue to increase the choice of attractions, experiences, and events for families.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is CBRE's strategy for 2014?<br></h4><p>It should be an interesting year, as we have been enjoying a pronounced recovery in certain Middle Eastern markets. We are aiming to expand our existing team and add new service lines, and we are actively looking at new locations from which to operate during the rest of the year.</p><h4>In which markets have you witnessed a recovery, and which markets and service lines do you plan to expand?</h4><p>The most active location is Dubai, where we see significant recovery in terms of rental and capital values and the arrival of investors, particularly from the Far East. Whilst the level of corporate real estate activity is not quite at 2007 levels, 2013 was nonetheless a strong year. I expect this level to be surpassed in 2014.</p><h4>Construction is expected to have grown by 9% from 2013 to 2014. What is your forecast for Dubai's real estate sector?</h4><p>The construction sector is likely to enjoy a prosperous period over the next few years, with strong investment in real estate and infrastructural projects from both the private and public sectors. Abu Dhabi and Dubai both have ambitious infrastructural expansion plans proposed and strong business sentiment is stimulating new demand for commercial and residential real estate. Additional events, such as the World Expo and FIFA World Cup, the general growth in population and tourism, and the construction of real estate sectors, are the ingredients for strong medium-term growth.</p><h4>Which of CBRE's products are the most profitable for you?</h4><p>CBRE's Middle East business is extremely well balanced between professional services and transactional services, and we are also lucky enough to have an extremely loyal client base across both these divisions. We see strong growth ahead particularly in respect of our commercial agency teams, our property management business, and our project management business. Our valuation and research teams also continue to be hungry for new professionals. Last year was a great one for us as all departments achieved growth, and I expect 2014 to be even better.</p><h4>What kinds of projects do you undertake with the private sector?</h4><p>Our client base is split evenly between corporate and public sector work. The work that we do for the government entity is a form of consultancy, whereby we inform them on developments happening in the rest of the world. The fact that CBRE has roughly 500 offices around the world means that if there is a requirement to benchmark, for instance, or to look at some successful markets and at how the model would work in the Middle East, we can do this relatively easily. With regard to the private sector, we take time to look at retail and identify opportunities there. Retail is expending broadly and performing well by international standards. A key aspect of our business is looking at how retail businesses can pursue new routes into the market.</p><h4>For 2014, what will be the highlight for your investors in Dubai?</h4><p>We see an increasing number of investors from all over the world targeting Dubai, but this investment capital is partly frustrated by the lack of commercial investment stock available. I hope, therefore, that with Dubai's creation of an inbound investment office there will be a greater number of investment opportunities available to stimulate new capital flows into the Emirates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategy behind the new Dubai Cable Company (Ducab) brand?<br></h4><p>The strategy for new Ducab is really one of leveraging our historical strength in the UAE and the GCC to expand both in terms of geography and new products. We have always been strong in our home territory, and we have offices throughout the GCC. We see an opportunity to grow there, and also to grow further afield. We have a sales office in the UK, and representation in Hong Kong and Australia. We are trying to take our brand—and, of course, we own the BICC brand as well as our own Ducab brand—to as many countries as possible. Our main focus, of course, after the GCC is Africa, the North and West in particular. Where we can we will sell to the other end—to the north, UK, to the south, Hong Kong—where British Standard and BICC may still have some resonance. We are geographically expanding our business in the region through our existing sales offices; therefore, we will beef up those sales offices, but also look for opportunities to expand with manufacturing bases overseas.</p><h4>Ducab works very closely with the government in the safety sector. What have been the latest achievements?</h4><p>Ducab has an initiative that we call Power Over Fire. Around six years ago, we launched a range of fire performance cables under the brand name Flam BICC. This is cable that is designed to last longer in the event of a fire. It is especially important to put on safety and fire alarm circuits within a metro station or high-rise block. We decided to go very high-end market with this. Therefore, we spent a lot of money in the beginning acquiring approvals from a UK agency, which is pretty much the gold standard for fire protection, run by the Loss Prevention Certification Board (LPCB). Certification from the LPCB is required by the civil defense authorities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. As we launched that product, particularly in Dubai and then in Abu Dhabi, their civil defense departments have grown increasingly concerned at the number of fires, particularly in the summer. Originally, six or seven years ago, fires were generally in warehouses, but more recently there have been some really nasty fires in high-rise residential blocks. The whole issue of fire safety and prevention is moving up the agenda. Civil defense obviously wants to increase and improve construction standards, meaning it is happy to work with companies like Ducab. It also wants to improve awareness among the public about fire risk. A campaign we launched in 2013, Power Over Fire, was in conjunction with the civil defense authorities in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi. We had a mobile exhibition on a 40-foot trailer, manned it with both our own people and those from the civil defense, and we parked it in areas around Abu Dhabi. In conjunction with this, we conducted a survey in the local market regarding “flex." Now, “flexibles" are typically white cable used for an extension at home or a water heater or air conditioning. Almost 60% of the cable we found in the market was sub-standard, which generally means it has less copper in it than is needed. A cable that is nominally a certain size but has inadequate amounts of copper in it will get hotter, and the hotter it runs, the more likely it is to burn. Clearly, the civil defense authorities are very worried about this, and so we are working with them and the Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology (ESMA) to educate people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our strategy is to develop a complete range of highly standard infrastructure, and to have it readily available with electricity, roads, water, and IT services. We are offering good prices and promotions while trying to minimize advertisements and publicity costs. We explain to investors about the park's physical proximity to Dubai, the cost, and the location—being humble and helpful so far has given us success.</p><h4>What do you think the local government will do to attract investors?</h4><p>The ruler of Sharjah, HH Sheikh Sultan, is a good man. To him, cultural and humanitarian ideas come ahead of business goals. I believe that the local governments in Sharjah need more training, education, and culture to provide professional business practices. They mostly act like government bureaucrats, but they need to adopt more private sector, businesslike practices through the development of local governments that work professionally to serve their communities.</p><h4>How is your partnership with the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (SHUROOQ)?</h4><p>SHUROOQ is a new player. It has been around for the past three to four years, and this is a sign that Sharjah has moved from the government sector into the private sector. We have around three major government bodies that affect foreign investments in Sharjah. SHUROOQ is one of them. The planning department, the municipality, and the economic development department are the others. The good thing about Sharjah is that all the government departments are located near each other.</p><h4>What are the differences between Emirates Industrial City and other zones in Sharjah and the UAE?</h4><p>These free zones are run by the WTO. The whole world market is opening up. From the licensing point of view, you can have 100% ownership if you set up in a free zone. When it comes to exports to the local market and to the GCC, foreign firms are treated differently, but here they are treated as locals, meaning they can explore the local market and the GCC and enjoy the benefits and advantages of a local kind of company. It is called a free zone, but there are many hidden charges, such as annual or processing fees. There is more flexibility here in this zone compared to the other free zones in terms of the fee structure.</p><h4>Which type of companies do you expect to set up here?</h4><p>We are attracting SMEs, and, of course, we have all kinds of industries and services. We have manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and garages. Due to its geographical proximity to Dubai, people used to move any activities that require space to Sharjah. Sharjah was treated or was used as a backyard for the world economy, in a sense. We had around 18 industrial areas. Poor zoning meant that these industrial areas were sited next to residential zones. Sharjah is now trying to solve all those problems, and this is one of the strategic reasons why Emirates Industrial City was established. We are attracting different industries. Some people are moving here as they have had to relocate due to plans for World Expo 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook on the sector and what are the main drivers of growth?<br></h4><p>In summary, the outlook for the sector continues to remain positive. This is due to a variety of factors including: a history of savvy investment and commercial decisions from the UAE's telecommunications service providers; the continued effective maintenance of, and investment in, telecommunications networks; and the ongoing strengthening of the sector's regulatory framework. These factors will be further buoyed by a positive economic outlook for the UAE and recovering global markets. Broadband has the potential to be a significant driver of growth for the telecommunications sector in the UAE. The UAE has one of the most advanced broadband networks in the world, utilizing the latest technologies that are capable of delivering extremely high-speed services. The challenge is now for telecommunications service providers to secure the growth potential that these networks offer by promoting a compelling set of packages to customers at competitive prices. In particular, if the licensees are successful in encouraging their subscribers to migrate to higher speed broadband services, thus enabling them to benefit from the existence of the UAE's high-speed networks, significant financial gains could be made.</p><h4>What improvements are you planning for 2014?</h4><p>In 2014, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) is placing a strong focus on further strengthening its corporate culture of excellence in order to facilitate the achievement of the vision and mission of the TRA. Within this context, a series of internal projects are underway to optimize the TRA's internal procedures and processes, and to ensure its way of doing things is in line with international best practice. The TRA also intends to place increased emphasis on improving the UAE's rankings in various international ICT indicators. This will force us to consider what measures we should introduce, and what changes are appropriate, in order for the UAE to be considered one of the best in the world in terms of its overall ICT ecosystem. The TRA will also continue to engage with third-party stakeholders throughout the regulatory decision-making process to ensure the views of all affected parties are considered. The TRA recently established the first ever Electronic Federal Network (FedNET) in the UAE. FedNET will provide high-speed connectivity and integration between the various information systems of UAE government departments. The network will connect all federal institutions in a way that raises efficiency and reduces costs. It will also help achieve a faster transition to smart government. Upon official completion of the implementation process, FedNET will provide information technology services within a collaborative and secure environment in order to efficiently meet the needs of the public. FedNET will facilitate the delivery of shared services and cloud services to federal entities. Both types of services will work toward achieving the necessary enablement and integration among services delivered through federal entities' e-government services. The project implementation started in the beginning of 2014 and is expected to be completed over a period of 18 months. FedNET is one of the initiatives falling under the mGovernment (mobile government) transformation roadmap, which focuses on establishing shared resources across various UAE government entities. In addition to FedNET, the project includes additional services including interconnectivity, digital identity, payment channels, cloud services, a trusted service manager, and mobile innovation center. The TRA has coordinated one of the first cross-role, cross-organization mobile technology training programs focused on government services in the world. Over the course of 2H2013, TRA and a team of international mobile technology experts assessed the various levels of readiness across different federal ministries, Emirate agencies, and municipal smart government groups. The findings from those assessment activities resulted in the creation of a flexible and scalable curriculum that will be presented across the UAE. Four role-based courses will be delivered in the program, including: mGov innovation training for managers, a four-day course focused on understanding how to best manage mobile technology complexity and increase the quality of mGov services; enabling IT staff to support mGov services through four days of in-depth technical discussions and hands-on labs to let IT staff experience mobile technologies first hand; and application development essentials for design and strategy over four days of application design experiences to help drive the development of high-quality mGov services.</p><h4>In an interview with Dubai Internet City's CEO, he mentioned that the availability of investors, political stability, access to thousands of international businesses, and a developed ICT society all contribute to making the UAE a compelling destination for entrepreneurship and new start-ups. What's your view on this?</h4><p>I strongly agree with this comment. There is no single factor that determines whether a specific location is attractive for prospective businesses. Instead, a range of factors are considered and the overall desirability of a particular location is determined by the extent to which that location can meet all of the businesses' individual requirements. One of the key areas of focus for the TRA is in ensuring that the delivery of ICT services in the UAE provides a favorable and competitive environment for businesses. This means that it's vital that telecommunications providers in the UAE offer a broad range of high-quality, reliable services at a reasonable cost. It is well known that telecommunications networks in the UAE are highly advanced. Prices are also generally competitive when considered on a regional level, and, indeed, mobile telephony prices are considered low by international standards. Further regulatory measures, such as the proposed introduction of the bitstream access service, a form of infrastructure sharing, will be expected to reduce the price of telecommunications services further in the future. The fundamental idea of the UAE's wise leadership is progress built on a knowledge-based economy. This is endorsed in the UAE Vision 2021, which sets goals for our country in the social, economic, health, educational, and related fields. The UAE Vision 2021 states that, “the UAE will become one of the best places in the world to do business." The UAE's laws, policies, and government services aim to promote businesses and push economic growth while securing the harmony of interests of the parties involved. The UAE's federal eGovernment program and the mobile government initiative aim to achieve this goal. In fact, the results can already be seen in the Ease of Doing Business 2014 report, jointly published by The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. The UAE stood at 23rd amongst 189 countries assessed on the basis of regulations and framework for starting and conducting a business. The UAE government offers several such services through the electronic platform in a timesaving and cost-effective way with a focus on reducing paperwork.</p><h4>Approximately 85% of UAE residents have an internet connection. What does this figure mean for the TRA?</h4><p>The fact that 85% of UAE residents have an internet connection means a number of things. First, it means that the telecommunications providers in the UAE have done a good job in promoting the uptake of internet services. Second, it indicates that the TRA has, to date, offered a sound regulatory framework to facilitate the continued uptake of internet services. The challenge now is to ensure the regulatory framework remains appropriate for the continually changing needs of consumers and internet service providers. Third, it underscores that the time is right for businesses and government entities to invest in providing online services to consumers and residents. Such services have the potential to improve the efficiency of the organizations that provide the services by reducing the need for a consumer/resident facing presence, while the availability of such services can save significant time for users of the relevant service. Fourth, it indicates that businesses may need to alter the methods they use to reach and interact with potential customers. In particular, businesses that fail to provide an online presence may face difficulties in acquiring and retaining customers. Consumer behavior has changed as a result of the emergence of the internet, and so too must the behavior of businesses. In terms of the significance of the ICT sector for Dubai, we know that it's absolutely vital. The TRA recently commissioned an independent study to measure the macroeconomic impact of the telecommunications sector on the UAE's economy. On a conservative basis, it was estimated that, overall, the sector contributed around 8% of total UAE GDP in 2012, equivalent to AED106 billion. This figure includes both the direct impact, consisting of the contribution of the licensed telecommunications service providers and retailers, as well as an indirect impact that includes the productivity gains that accrue in the economy as a result of, for example, the ability of telecommunications services to increase the speed of communication and the diffusion of innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>DP World pioneered the world's largest semi-automated facility in Jebel Ali. What changes will the new terminal bring to your operations?<br></h4><p>Automation, and the new technology that enables it, is the way of the future and will help our customers and the supply chain realize the efficiencies on land that the new megaships generate at sea. It is a giant leap forward in terms of customer service and continues Jebel Ali's industry leadership. It is also in line with Dubai's vision of transforming itself with smart systems using technology. The remote-controlled operations at the new 4 million TEU Container Terminal 3 (T3), set to open in 2014, also fit into a wider safety and environment strategy. With 19 highly sophisticated automated quay cranes and 50 automated rail mounted gantry (ARMG) yard cranes, T3 will be at least 30% more carbon efficient than a conventional terminal operation. Importantly, with the cranes operated from a purpose-built operations building set apart from the quayside using remote control technology. Automation takes people off the quay, helping to prevent accidents. In doing so, it will also transform the workplace at the port, and the work has attracted a team of highly skilled and diverse people, especially Emiratis who will make up the majority of the 50 ARMG crane operations teams, including, for the first time, Emirati women.</p><h4>DP World's facility at Jebel Ali is a flagship for the company. What improvements are you planning for 2014 at this specific facility?</h4><p>Planning for the long term is something DP World has always done and will continue to do. We regularly engage with our partners to enhance our service offering, develop smart processes, and improve infrastructure. Our aim is to increase our customers' competitiveness and improve supply chain efficiency. As mentioned, we are currently constructing the brand new T3, and together with a 1 million TEU expansion we opened in the middle of 2013, Jebel Ali will reach 19 million TEUs by 4Q2014. Significantly, the opening of T3 means we will be able to handle 10 of the largest container vessels afloat simultaneously, the only port in the region able to do so. Looking to the future, with the forthcoming connection of Etihad Rail to Jebel Ali, the port will be part of a multi-modal supply chain that seamlessly links sea, road, rail, and air through the Dubai Logistics Corridor, reinforcing our position as the premier gateway for the region and the entire Middle East. Jebel Ali sets the standard and is the model for our global portfolio of more than 65 marine terminals across six continents, including the new developments we have underway in Europe, Africa, India, and the Middle East. The unrivaled efficiency and connectivity of Jebel Ali, plus the adjacent free zone, home to more than 7,500 companies, continue to drive the economic growth not just of Dubai and the UAE, but of the wider region of some 2 billion people.</p><h4>What are you doing to boost your human resources?</h4><p>I have mentioned some of our investment in technology and in our Jebel Ali facility already, but our dynamic and committed team of 30,000 people worldwide is the driving force of our company, and we constantly investing in them. For example, in 2013, DP World, UAE Region provided its staff with 196,000 training hours. By developing the skills and talents of our employees and providing them with new opportunities to excel, all while encouraging and supporting innovation, we create a work environment that is stimulating and exciting, which in turn translates into outstanding customer service, excellence in operations, and a vibrant, growing company. This goes hand-in-hand with investing in enhancing efficiencies at our terminals through the use of the latest technologies and state-of-the-art, eco-friendly equipment. Jebel Ali Port is a leading electronic transaction facility, with the port community portal, Dubai Trade, providing an online service that gives customers increased productivity and reduces costs and time for the shipment of goods. Currently, Dubai Trade offers more than 750 services around the clock. Other features include gate automation supported by radio frequency identification, container tracking to enable 20,000 truck movements a day, and 3G connectivity to help shipping lines access bay and stowage plan information, thereby reducing the time spent in port.</p><h4>How important is sustainable growth for the countries you are working in?</h4><p>Sustainability is fundamental to our company and integral to everything we do. Our concessions are signed for decades, and we, therefore, invest for the long term and become part of the communities in which operate. Emerging markets are a strong focus for us, and in fact they generate around three-quarters of our business. We have found that efficient ports support economic growth; as trade grows, businesses grow, communities prosper, and individuals gain new opportunities. For every job created inside a well-run port, up to five jobs are created outside it. This contributes to sustainable growth over the long term.</p><h4>How do you work to reduce the environmental impact of port operations?</h4><p>We operate in a range of different environments around the world, and we strive to reduce the environmental impact of our operations through rigorous planning and management. Our focus is on reducing our resource consumption, preventing pollution, conserving biodiversity, and managing emissions to preserve the world we live and operate in. DP World has launched an energy reduction project and campaign as a complementary approach to our CO2 emission reductions, and to promote all-round energy efficiency in our terminals. Energy efficiency not only minimizes our environmental impact, but also that of the global supply chain, of which we are a key component. Measures taken include automation, replacing diesel with electrical machinery, switching to LED lighting, and e-transactions. In 2013, we achieved an 8.7% reduction in our absolute CO2 emissions globally, and we have further challenging targets for coming years.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Hill International manage to successfully navigate the global economic crisis while growing its client portfolio?<br></h4><p>At Hill International, approximately eight years ago, we were fully concentrated on the Middle East. At the time, we foresaw the need to expand and started spreading into other markets as the dangers of a Middle Eastern bubble drew nearer. We expanded into North Africa, Europe, and Asia. Of course, when the bubble burst, we were actually quite well positioned and, in fact, we were not affected. The other issue for our business is that we are a strict project management-construction management (PMCM) company, meaning, unlike our competitors, we have an added advantage. Some of them are contractors and they do project management in this area, while we are strictly a PMCM company and ranked number nine this year in the world according to Engineering News-Record in PMCM, and number one in claims consultancy in the world.</p><h4>What are the differences, in particular between Dubai and the other markets that you are operating in challenge wise?</h4><p>The market is not as formal as it is in the US or Western Europe. It is more like Turkey or Greece. The clients are much more approachable here. Hence, they give you the opportunity to show who you are and what you can do. Then, you slowly gain a reputation and get more and more work. We have many peculiarities that make us unique in the region.</p><h4>How is the growing importance of technology and eco-sustainability influencing your business in Dubai?</h4><p>In terms of management, we are employing technology in a number of ways. One way is through a project control system, which allows you to centralize all project details and share reports with clients. The reports can also be produced in Arabic, which is important in this market. In terms of sustainability, we have LEED-certified architects. In that respect, it's also important to consider the costs involved when developing a LEED-certified building. This is where we come in, to ensure that there are different options and that you do your value engineering to make sure that whatever sustainable systems you are putting in, and whatever LEED certifications you are going after, are good value. We know that the government of Dubai and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum are really pushing for this, and that will put Dubai on the map.</p><h4>What expectations do you have for Expo 2020, and what trends do you see in general?</h4><p>Infrastructure projects are critical to the Emirate, and they will proceed at pace in the run up to the Expo. The government is highly committed, and a lot of projects will be tourism related. There should be a general strategy of what to announce to control the market upwards and downwards and allow it to experience the natural growth of any market. The second aspect is the infrastructure. One of the mistakes of the late 2000s was that infrastructure was always trying to catch up with the buildings, and I think what the government of Dubai has managed to achieve is hugely important and highly commendable. Despite an economic lull, the government actually continued work on infrastructure projects, whether it was roads, power plants, or water. And now, there's even development happening on the metro, light rail, and a tram system. What Dubai has achieved as a service provider, from airports to hotels and transport systems, is unparalleled. However, it all needs to be counter balanced. The rents are going up and it needs to be controlled to a point. Wage increases should match increases in the cost of living.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the challenges and lessons learned from the Twisted Tower in Dubai?<br></h4><p>It was a truly challenging project, but ultimately is situated in one of the prime locations in the city. At that time, we could have opted to construct a regular, tall building and the location alone would have made it a stand-out scheme, but we instead chose to develop something special that would be instantly recognizable and that would distinguish Cayan from other developers. Therefore, we opted to pursue a particularly challenging design. I was advised that the project would cost more while generating the same return, and would additionally be far more difficult to construct. Regardless, we went ahead, and are proud of our decision to do so. We did not get the returns we wanted from the project, but the returns we gained from client satisfaction and public recognition makes us extremely satisfied.</p><h4>What new projects are you planning for 2014?</h4><p>We have more than one project, and we are working on a couple of megaprojects in Saudi Arabia. We will shortly announce one of them, which will comprise a neighborhood of 1 million sqm, and we are glad to have such a location and superb design. In fact, it has already been awarded best mixed development in Saudi Arabia by International Property Awards. Besides that, we are still structuring other deals, and have a few in Dubai. The challenge in Dubai is that after the amazing success of Cayan Tower nothing short of remarkable is possible, and, therefore, we are pushing ourselves to the limit. We have several plots and locations, and will announce one of them before the summer.</p><h4>How are you going to work to maintain your high standards?</h4><p>This is the challenge of maintaining outstanding projects. We have to sustain this success by bringing something different to the market, in other words, a signature building where the design, the location, and the way we are serving the clients must all be in harmony. At the end, that is what our clients expect from us.</p><h4>Are you planning new residential projects in Dubai?</h4><p>We have a number of residential projects and we are currently at the design stage, and will announce them by the end of 2014. In Dubai, we choose not to build the five-star hotels we might normally as they are required to serve alcohol. Here, the commercial sector is still not that attractive as the supply is high, so we are considering a branded residential project.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the luxury real estate sector in Dubai in 2014?</h4><p>The current level of competition generates more interest in luxury projects. This does not just mean design or furniture, but the concept itself, and this is what we are focused on. I believe that there is still room to develop new luxury projects in Dubai. After all, Dubai is not just a GCC or regional city, but an international destination like London, Hong Kong, or Singapore. It has that standard, and newcomers to Dubai are looking for luxury services. On several occasions we have been approached by existing clients keen to hear about our next project. There is clearly still healthy demand for luxury schemes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Challenge & Opportunity]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[challenge-opportunity]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your overall strategy to develop the health sector in the Emirate?<br></h4><p>We have established our strategy based on several important parameters such as geographical access, population growth, and the diversity of health services required. For the health sector, geographical distance and access play a major role. I believe that only a dynamic and flexible strategy can be successful. It should respond to challenges that arise, as well as make use of any opportunity that comes up. This is the basic principle that we employ to meet demand, whether it concerns legislation, establishing a market, or collecting data that will eventually improve customer service. All of the departments within the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) follow this approach. We also use it in dealing with insurance companies and providers of healthcare services.</p><h4>What are the most important challenges that you face in realizing your vision and how do you plan to overcome them?</h4><p>There are quite a few challenges, one of them being human resources (HR), which we need to build up. It takes around one or two years to design an excellent hospital, and then a further three or four years to construct it. Yet, ensuring the right HR balance requires up to eight years. There is a growing demand for services, and the range available in the Middle East today is tremendous. Another contemporary challenge is the use of smart solutions, which requires a re-wiring of organizational culture toward the adoption of more comprehensive solutions that result in precise treatment, a lower number of human errors, and comprehensive data for R&amp;D purposes. But of course, in every challenge lies an opportunity.</p><h4>How do you plan to attract more Emiratis to work in the healthcare sector and retain them?</h4><p>First of all, this is not a matter of salaries as such, but of the working environment itself. If an individual joins us, they feel relevant to what we do, and we continuously try and provide a platform for further training. Within a one-year period a doctor develops more capabilities and skills, receives more training, and has access to R&amp;D facilities. We are creating what we call future health leaders. An institution like ours needs to pay well, but also needs to create a partnership with its HR.</p><h4>Dubai is trying to diversify its economic matrix. How do you foresee the sector playing a role in driving this process?</h4><p>There is an initiative launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, namely medical tourism. This full service encompasses the airlines, airport, transport infrastructure, and shopping. We are upgrading our hospitals to the point where they can be considered hospitality facilities. Our guests come from both the East and West. Dubai offers excellence of health services especially in certain areas, such as cardiology, and we aim to capitalize this through the medical tourism initiative. For instance, the Nabadat initiative provides free surgery for children, Emiratis, and expatriates with congenital heart disease. It was launched in 2007 by the DHA and the HH Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Charity and Humanitarian Establishment. We invite our colleagues from the UK, Sweden, Italy, and other countries to work alongside our specialists. This confirms the truly globalized nature of our business, and that we can help people no matter where they come from.</p><h4>In light of the new law regarding compulsory health insurance in Dubai, what impact do you foresee on the healthcare sector?</h4><p>I believe it will result in a considerable enhancement of services. Compulsory health insurance is an essential component of any efficient healthcare sector. It will facilitate healthy competition amongst healthcare providers, ensure universal access to basic healthcare, and, thus, help create a dynamic health sector. Presently, many cannot afford proper healthcare, and the new regulations guarantee universal access to essential services regardless of their financial circumstances. This legal change will therefore create health security through the provision of insurance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[health-city-drive]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the most important accomplishments for Dubai Healthcare City (DHCC) in 2014?<br></h4><p>DHCC has been driving the concept of a medical city since its foundation in 2002. Sustainability has been at the forefront of our operations, demonstrated by efforts to build medical capacity in the UAE and the region. Our progress year on year echoes this approach. In 2014, we signed several agreements concerning medical education. Our UAE-based partners include Dubai International Academic City (DIAC), the University of Dubai, and Dubai Medical College, and our global partners include City University London, Johnson &amp; Johnson, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Dräger, and Cambridge University Hospitals. We welcomed 20 new businesses to DHCC in 1Q2014 and 2Q2014 with Cochlear Middle East, Doris Duan-Young Autism Centre, and Amsa Renal Care being leading clinical partners. This year also marked our inaugural UAE Clinical Simulation Conference.</p><h4>How is DHCC tackling the challenge of attracting and retaining highly specialized medical personnel?</h4><p>We continue to draw heavily on our track record in regulation. The Centre for Healthcare Planning and Quality (CPQ), an independent regulatory body overseen by the Dubai Healthcare City Authority (DHCA), ensures strong and transparent governance within the DHCC free zone. CPQ is responsible for the regulation and licensing of all healthcare facilities and practitioners within the DHCC. ISQua, a global leader in assessing the standards in healthcare safety and quality, awarded CPQ the second edition of the Outpatient Clinic Quality Standards accreditation, valid from May 2013 to April 2017. The outcome of this strong regulatory environment is 4,000 medical professionals to date who have access to continuing professional development programs at DHCC. We will announce shortly an updated licensing framework to continue to attract global expertise in healthcare as well as in wellbeing services to support DHCC's Phase II expansion, which is dedicated to wellness. We will also announce details on our upcoming teaching hospital project. I cite an article titled “The Emigration of Minds" written by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai: the UAE has joined other emerging economies as a leading destination to attract global talent. Its number one position in attracting human capital knowledge and minds can be used as a model by other countries in the region or around the world. We humbly hope that the DHCC exemplifies this ideology.</p><h4>In your opinion, what steps can be taken to further position Dubai as a preferred medical destination internationally?</h4><p>I take the liberty to use DHCC as an exemplar of medical tourism. Through our operations in healthcare within a robust regulatory framework, a million patients have visited DHCC as of 2013, and an estimated 15% of current patients are medical tourists. Ongoing collaborations with government entities have pushed medical tourism in the Emirate. Medical tourism facilitators too have a role, as evident in the DHCC. In 2014, we signed an agreement with the international non-profit Medical Tourism Association to roll out certification, training, and accreditation programs.</p><h4>DHCC is home to the Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor Medical Simulation Center (KHMSC), a comprehensive training facility in the region. In this context, how is DHCC's performance in medical education?</h4><p>The KHMSC is a significant medical education offering of DHCC's Mohammed Bin Rashid Academic Medical Center (MBR-AMC). Spread over 30,000 square feet, the KHMSC provides medical professionals with hands-on clinical simulation training. Since opening in November 2012, it has trained approximately 1,400 medical professionals. The Center has grown in recognition through the 1st UAE Clinical Simulation Conference, which had approximately 200 healthcare professionals, students, and delegates in attendance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Which segments of your portfolio are you most focusing on in 2014?<br></h4><p>We are now a 100% limited liability company, while maintaining the same ownerships, partnerships, and percentages as before. We have evolved a lot since the 1970s and 1980s, and we have become more professional and more future driven, introducing innovative healthcare endeavors to the GCC market. It's really a proud moment for all of us when we see our annual turnover to be nine digits; and there is no doubt it is all because of the hard work and determination of our 700 plus staff to make life better for all. We have grown a lot since my father, Dr. Hassan Al Moosa, started this organization 45 years ago; while we have come a long way, there is still a long journey for us to go. It would be not wise on my part to say that we would be concentrating only on one particular portfolio this year. We have many departments, and all serve society and create value for all of us. There are always two aspects to how a department performs: monetary value and non-monetary value; we have been successful in striking a balance between both. Today, GulfDrug has clients in both the private sector, represented by non-government organizations, including supermarkets, and the public sector, including municipalities, police departments, and hospitals. Our Medical Consumables and Devices Department has over 25 years of experience and it provides the best aftercare sales, training, and world-class products to clients. The Medical Equipment Department takes care of Imaging, X-ray, Ultrasound, Endoscopy and other medical capital equipment. This department provides extremely complicated and expensive apparatuses and solutions.  Then, there is another vertical under GulfDrug since 2001, which looks after medical projects. GulfDrug has capabilities to handle a project from any stage, be it designing, supplying, and installing or commissioning a hospital or any other such turnkey projects. We focus on hospitals, clinics, day care surgery centers, and mobile hospitals. We are also into implementing health and safety systems along with equipment integration, duly abiding by all the necessary regulations. We have another venture very close to our hearts, for example veterinary healthcare sciences. It is managed by its own independent director; it's into supplying medicines, carrying out specialized surgery, and delivering consumables to places like camel farms and horse studs. So our efforts are going to be comprehensive this year as well, concentrating on all our endeavors and working together to make life better.</p><h4>Are there other independent units?</h4><p>Yes, we have our Medical Service Department as a separate unit under the organization. It was a conscious decision we made due to the constant growth of the portfolio, high install rate, and customer requirements. It has taken over the servicing of equipment by other suppliers as well. Most of our engineers are trained in the US, France, Germany, and the UK. There is a full service set-up within the country, while there are also some agents that do not have the capacity to provide this. For example, GulfDrug services all the endoscopy equipment within the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia, a service, which is a multi-million-dollar set-up. So it's a big market out there, and all this while we have been able to largely cover it.</p><h4>What is your opinion on Dubai becoming a hub for medical tourism?</h4><p>It is achievable, but it depends upon the medical fraternity of Dubai. Medical tourism will not come up till the time our medical services are affordable, accessible, and available to all. By availability and accessibility, I am trying to say that before anything, we need to focus on bringing qualified medical professionals to Dubai, but that is purely a decision of medical professionals, which might depend on their personal preferences or the kinds of opportunities Dubai will offer to them. For example, in Germany, a personal consultant in the medical field earns something around ‚¬3 million annually. These are the top consultants. The second-tier doctors normally serve in the public sector and earn quite a bit less. Thus no matter how noble this profession is, there are better financial opportunities outside Dubai, and people are seeking those options. You need to address the financial needs of a medical professional to a large extent. Thus, the level of commitment is more, and you can compare their services with any medical professional in the US or Europe. Currently, most medical institutions are catching up, both in the government and private sector. The UAE spends a lot of money for its citizens to seek medical treatment abroad for certain specialties, about $1 billion annually, and this money can be better spent locally to upgrade hospitals, bring in experienced doctors, and serve the local population and expatriates, especially when universal healthcare is coming to the country very soon. We are seeing the trend by the government to provide these facilities and services to all the people living in the UAE. I am hopeful that once universal health insurance is established, the government will be able to compete with the private sector and provide better services to locals and expatriates.</p><h4>What is your opinion on changes to the new health insurance law?</h4><p>It's like two sides of a coin; one is economic, while the other is humanitarian. Regarding the latter, the government has made good decisions and the system is on par with, or better than, most developed countries. This is important because the majority of workers in the UAE are not Emiratis. This new law is a great and a courageous step, which even many developed countries do not enforce. While looking at the economic aspect, it is a burden for many companies to purchase health insurance, because a lot of companies have many employees, and are working on very thin margins. Medical insurance takes away anywhere from 1%-5% of their gross profits. This eats away at their bottom lines heavily, thus we may see an increase in pricing in the unregulated services provided to the economy. But all in all, this translates into better health insurance and services in the country, but some more government regulation on the insurance companies will be required. For example, there will be the need for more regulation over the dues owed to medical providers. Today, there is no such law that requires payment to medical providers within a certain period of time or laws that regulate the percentage increase in insurance premiums annually.</p><h4>How do you feel about the government's expressed interest in increasing awareness about preventive healthcare?</h4><p>Preventive healthcare starts at the core of the family; it is a lifestyle issue. Preventive care is particularly important in the UAE because the UAE is mainly a young country. This young population, once it ages, will be a huge financial burden on the healthcare system both in the private and government sectors. The strategy of focusing on preventive medicine is a strong and wise strategy. With some PR, education, and the leadership of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, we can create a healthier population, which means a more productive population. The cost of healthcare will dramatically reduce. Look at Sweden; in the 1960s, the government spent a large amount of money to educate its population on healthy living, including the encouragement of exercise, free time, stress management, and a healthy diet. Sweden has managed to create a population that ages slowly and is extremely healthy. The average life expectancy is above 85 years, and is dramatically increasing. The society is also one of the most productive in Europe, and it works fewer hours than others. However, the UAE is not Sweden yet, and the country needs to find its own way of life that suits the region.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the philosophy behind Expo 2020's motto of “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future?"</h4><p>“Connecting Minds, Creating the Future" represents the very essence of the World Expo, of our generation, and of our nation's aspirations—the powerful spirit of partnership and collaboration that has been the driver of UAE's success in paving new paths for development and innovation. The theme carries a special meaning for Dubai, a historical hub of connectivity for the region and globally. Originally known as Al Wasl, Arabic for “the connection" or “intersection point," Dubai has evolved from a regional trading center into a diverse and progressive economic, social, and environmental leader regionally and globally. We are living in an age where long-term solutions to global problems must be resolved by global best practice sharing. The major 21st Century trends and transformations, such as population growth, urbanization, and new technologies are converging. These trends can be the source of major concerns, but also of exceptional future opportunities. Our greatest responsibility in the coming decade is to develop partnerships that can inspire us to shape a better future.</p><h4>What are the main features that World Expo 2020 in Dubai will introduce in comparison with previous Expos?</h4><p>Every World Expo has unique offerings, and through their theme and subthemes introduce and address timely and relevant global challenges. The Expo 2020 Dubai, the first World Fair in the Middle East, Northern Africa, and Southern Asia, will offer a theme that centers on developing partnerships that can inspire our global insight and ability to shape a better future. Our three subthemes: opportunity, mobility, and sustainability, are our interconnected drivers of progress that can provide the prism through which we can examine, connect, and address the changes we are experiencing today but haven't addressed collectively in previous World Expos. In addition, Expo 2020 is expected to attract 25 million unique visits, 70% of which will be international visits—the first time in World Expo history that international visitors will exceed domestic visitors. Likewise, Expo 2020, which will be open from October 2020 to April 2021, is the first Expo to operate during this seasonal period and will be the first Expo to offer one pavilion per country, encouraging and financially supporting the inclusion of eligible developing and low-income nations to foster inclusive, high-quality participation from around the world.</p><div class="quote">“Expo 2020 Dubai will provide an environment for global entrepreneurs to explore progressive and realistic ideas."</div><h4>What is going to be the impact of Expo 2020 in terms of attracting foreign investment and increasing trade in the region?</h4><p>Expo 2020 Dubai will provide an environment for global entrepreneurs to explore progressive and realistic ideas and build smart and sustainable relationships. The Expo 2020 Dubai theme “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future" represents the very essence of the World Expo. It is a deep commitment to encourage collaboration, partnerships, and innovative paths to address our local, regional, and global challenges—economic, social, and environmental. As the first World Expo in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia (MENASA) region, the Expo theme is both timely and opportune, as we are living in an age where long-term solutions to problems can only be resolved through collective problem solving. For the international business community, which is becoming more connected and interdependent, Expo 2020 Dubai is an opportunity to form partnerships that are key to building emerging markets and communities, and ensuring future generations have the tools to learn and grow.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that the government of Dubai will have to face in the medium term regarding the hosting of Expo 2020?</h4><p>The infrastructural and operational investment required by a nation to host large-scale international events are often offset by their ability to generate widespread and lasting economic value for the local resident community. To this end, Dubai Expo 2020 is focused on achieving a similar objective with net value outweighing the costs incurred in delivering the event, and ultimately creating long-term benefits as part of a well-planned economic legacy. We are working to ensure that the investments made by Dubai and every participant, as well as the revenue from international visitors, will directly contribute to the UAE economy. We are confident this will have a positive effect on the adjacent industries that are linked to the delivery of goods and services needed to meet the rise in demand. We expect that, with the growth across various sectors, there should be a natural spike in jobs created within the local economy, increasing the income levels of the people, and encouraging higher domestic consumption.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the main strengths that Dubai should show to the rest of the world during the Expo 2020 celebrations?</h4><p>Dubai's strength lies in our ability to attract 25 million unique visitors, of which 70% are international, to our city for Expo 2020. These visitors will experience the diversity of our tourism options, the 200 nationalities living and working in Dubai, and understand why Dubai is ranked amongst the world's top ten cities for international visitors. We want to showcase our world-class travel facilities, how our infrastructure is built for connectivity, and how the UAE has leveraged our hotel, hospitality, and airline assets, together with our presence in the worlds of sport, leisure, and tourism, to make Dubai a world-class destination for global travelers—both business and leisure. We want visitors and residents to witness a productive mega-event like Expo 2020 and leave knowing that Dubai is a hub for leaders, thinkers, international events, trade shows, art, culture, and leisure, and that the people and the business community of Dubai represent the world's best in class.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Chamber supporting the development of the business climate here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>AmCham was founded in 1999, although the American business community began meeting several years earlier. Since then, AmCham has become a truly international business association in which businesses from every part of the world, including Kazakhstan, work together on a broad variety of initiatives. It is sometimes assumed that we are an exclusively US business association or that we are a branch of the US government, but this is not the case. We represent the entire spectrum of the investor community, including all sectors and all national affiliations. This is our strength. In recent years, advocacy to reform the business environment has become an AmCham priority, and we have developed a close relationship with the government of Kazakhstan for this purpose. Six years ago, we started meeting directly with the Deputy Prime Minister, providing recommendations on crosscutting policy issues in Kazakhstan's business environment. Then, in 2013, Prime Minister Massimov suggested creating a council for AmCham and its members to meet monthly on issues of our choosing with cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister always attends and chairs these monthly meetings, and we are always encouraged to speak out frankly on all issues. The Council to Improve the Investment Climate is composed of 10 corporate leaders from among AmCham members and 10 ministers and deputy ministers. Depending on the topic for the meeting, we can specify the presence of a minister responsible for this portfolio. For instance, the December council session was devoted to the telecommunications industry, with the CEOs of Kazakhstan's three leading foreign telecoms firms presenting their ideas about the future of telecommunications in Kazakhstan. The Chairman of Kazakhtelecom, along with ministers responsible for industry and technology, attended on the government side, and the Prime Minister spoke at length about the government telecommunications strategy for the year ahead. Prime Minister Massimov has been extremely supportive and we consider ourselves very fortunate to be able to speak directly to him each month. In June, AmCham presented a White Paper, namely the Top Ten Barriers to Foreign Investment, to the Prime Minister, and this became an action plan for the Government. Beginning in July, AmCham has been regularly invited to attend Cabinet meetings to take part in discussions on this top ten items, with ministers assigned to create working groups for each of the ten problem areas. This is a rare honor, and we are very grateful to Prime Minister Massimov for his attentiveness to business and to the AmCham business community.</p><h4>Future economic growth relies on improving the business environment by changing or eliminating policies and regulations that discourage investment. What are the main obstacles and challenges that international companies face in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>AmCham started by focusing on the courts and judicial reform. Kazakhstan still has a way to go in creating a judicial system that can handle investor cases competently and equitably, although there has been improvement with a variety of judicial training programs. The Supreme Court is able to handle complex cases, but the lower courts are less reliable. This is a post-Soviet problem of course, and one that afflicts all of the countries whose judicial systems were once Soviet. It will take time, as it requires a change in mentality. Judges still feel they should automatically side with the government in tax cases, for instance, and this is discouraging to investors. Investors need a stable environment with rules and regulations that do not change constantly. Taxes are constantly in flux, and companies must work hard to keep up with the latest changes. Government priorities also change, and despite much talk of economic diversification, this is not really happening. Visa and work permit regulations also need updating so that companies can bring in senior foreign staff when local staff capacity is insufficient. This past year has been difficult for Kazakhstan with complex external factors affecting the investment climate, including geopolitical crises, notably the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the resulting economic sanctions against Russia, the rapidly declining Russian ruble (the Kazakhstani currency is very sensitive to any change in the ruble), and the sharp decline in the price of oil. The tenge underwent a 20% devaluation in early 2014, and there is expectation of a further devaluation in early 2015. We have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, but all these pressures point to an uncertain year ahead.</p><h4>Kazakhstan is witnessing the rapid development and reshaping of the energy system. Green energy and renewables are a priority for the government. What opportunities are presented for international companies operating in this sector?</h4><p>There are many companies and the government itself is involved in renewable energy projects. The Minister of Environment up until recently was a strong environmental activist who raised a green energy platform to a top government priority. The government adopted Green Energy as a slogan, planning to draw on the private sector to finance projects. However, in September the Environment Ministry was absorbed into the Energy Ministry and the Minister moved to a new position, so this may presage a change in government environmental policy. It will be good if the green economy platform is pursued. It was and is a visionary strategy that could benefit Kazakhstan greatly.</p><h4>Is there room for non-conventional approaches to finance?</h4><p>Yes. For instance, there is an Islamic bank from the Gulf, namely Al Hilal Bank, in Kazakhstan at the invitation of the government. However, time is required to educate the population about Islamic finance and banking, which is still not well understood. The major Western banks that used to provide retail-banking services have exited the market, including HSBC, UnitCredit, and RBS. Now, banking is entirely dominated by local banks, most of which still have a very high proportion of non-performing loans (NPLs) remaining from the 2008 financial crisis. The National Bank of Kazakhstan performs its regulatory functions well, but there are still serious problems requiring resolution. Before non-conventional banking can thrive, conventional banking needs to find a firm footing.</p><h4>What is the objective of AmCham for 2015?</h4><p>To continue to intensify our relationship with the government, because this is how we can improve the investment climate. The best thing we can do for our members and the country is to work at resolving those top ten barriers affecting perceptions of Kazakhstan and restricting foreign investment. Kazakhstan has great economic potential that extends beyond the oil sector. It also benefits from good leadership, but it still needs to work at creating a true market economy, one that is free of government influence. The year ahead will be a test for Kazakhstan to see how it handles and bears up in difficult economic conditions not under its control. I am confident it will show its true mettle and continue along the path it has chosen for itself. AmCham and its members are always ready to provide whatever advice and support is needed.</p><div class="quote">“Kazakhstan has great economic potential that extends beyond the oil sector."</div><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What inspired INDECOPI's establishment?</h4><p>In 1993, the Peruvian constitution was amended, establishing the economic model for the social market economy in which a free market is guaranteed. To do this, the government established, as part of one of its main goals to strengthen institutions, establishing a better framework of guidelines for state action regarding respect for property rights and contracts. These reforms resulted in a significant increase in private investment in our country, making indispensable the existence of an efficient system of promotion and defense of free competition, consumer protection, and protection of intellectual property rights. In this context, the government created the National Institute for the Defense of Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property (INDECOPI), which is an entity key to maintaining respect for the constitutional economic framework of the country. It has several roles, including: facilitating the opening of new businesses by eliminating bureaucratic barriers to market access; protecting loan value by administrating the bankruptcy system; promoting free and fair competition, sanctioning anti-competitive behavior generated in the market; protecting intellectual property in all its forms by protecting the creations of the mind, such as inventions and literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images, and designs and models used in commerce; protecting the consumer; and promoting international trade by removing non-tariff trade barriers and oversight of dumping and subsidies.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to INDECOPI realizing its main activity in such varied fields?</h4><p>In fact, INDECOPI is an institution that is responsible for various matters related to the following topics: (i) competition, (ii) protection of intellectual property, and (iii) consumer protection. INDECOPI has independent and specialized functional bodies that are responsible for the investigation and resolution of cases on matters within their competence. One such body is the Commission for Defense of Free Competition, which deals with the defense and promotion of competition, and the Commission for Consumer Protection, which deals with consumer issues. Additionally, we have offices responsible for matters related to intellectual property. It must not be forgotten that all disciplines at the institution have a common, ultimate goal toward the welfare of consumers and the functioning of the economic model of the social market economy.</p><div class="quote">“An important factor for Peru's position in this ranking has undoubtedly been the performance of INDECOPI."</div><h4>Peru ranked as the second best place to do business in Latin America in the World Bank's 2014 Doing Business Report. What factors in recent improvements in Peru's regional position underpin this ranking?</h4><p>An important factor for Peru's position in this ranking has undoubtedly been the performance of INDECOPI in strengthening the country's institutions through the exercise of its powers. Indeed, our institution has done crucial work in eliminating illegal and/or irrational bureaucratic barriers to market access. In this regard, INDECOPI made an estimate of the costs of barriers unapplied in 2013, concluding that the costs that the complainants' traders would have had to assume if the entity had not declared their complaints would be approximately $44 million, which is more than considerable, confirming the importance of eliminating barriers. Another important factor has been the promotion and defense of competition, which has allowed the Peruvian market to become more dynamic and efficient. Indeed, punishing anti-competitive practices means that there are more operators in the market and, thus, they compete when it comes to investing in the quality of their products and services, which benefits citizens. It is important to note that, between 2006 and 2014, INDECOPI solved a total of 79 cases related to competition. In Peru, the investor has the guarantee that INDECOPI is a strong and active competition agency, the actions of which are technical and independent. That contributes to the country's ranking as the second best place to do business in Latin America.</p><h4>What are INDECOPI's plans for the upcoming years?</h4><p>In recent years, INDECOPI has implemented a series of improvements that have strengthened the capacity of the institution from an administrative perspective. For example, we have opened offices in all regions of the country and have strengthened the capacities of the functional bodies to perform better investigations. This is reflected in the results obtained regarding the elimination of bureaucratic barriers and initiating investigations into anti-competitive conduct. This has also resulted in further competition advocacy and the activation of the leniency program as an important key to detecting cartels. However, we aim to further strengthen our capabilities to better serve businesses and citizens in general. To do this, we plan to implement technological tools to improve internal processes and thus serve users more efficiently and in less time. We are also presenting a series of legislative proposals to strengthen the powers of INDECOPI, including a proposal to improve the defense of the free competition system, which is looking to enhance research capacity and the time it takes to solve cases, as well as improving the bankruptcy system, which is very important for companies to exit the market in an orderly manner. Also, in the field of intellectual property, we are presenting a proposal to strengthen the protection of biodiversity and collective knowledge of indigenous communities, which represent a major source of business. Finally, considering the importance of INDECOPI for the economy, we expect, over the coming years, to propose a series of public policy related to matters that can serve as a roadmap for action via our institution and harmonize the needs and objectives of each of the actors operating in the market: the state, businesses, and citizens in general.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk about General Electric's (GE's) work in Saudi Arabia, and its importance to the company globally?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is a well-established and stable economy. In fact, Saudi Arabia is one of the core markets for GE globally, and this is underlined by our $1 billion investment commitment to the Kingdom. GE's multi-generation plan for the Kingdom is to continue developing manufacturing capability in Saudi Arabia. GE has different solutions that are perfectly in line with the country's needs, whether it is healthcare, aviation, oil and gas, power and water, or even knowledge transfer itself. This is what Saudi Arabia is looking for, and this is where GE can help and provide its services. GE in Saudi Arabia is in the right place. It addresses its solutions through partnership, which is why we decided to invest $1 billion in different sectors to ensure that GE is a true growth partner for Saudi Arabia. Our investments focus on three key areas: innovation and business development, healthcare, and energy. This investment comes in line with the Kingdom's efforts to drive localization, economic diversification, and knowledge transfer. Each one of those areas has its own projects; for example, in 2012 we celebrated the inauguration and launch of several key centers in Saudi including the GE Innovation Center at Dhahran Techno Valley, the all-Women Shared Services Center, GE Manufacturing &amp; Technology Center (GEMTEC) in Dammam, GE Technical Academy in Jubail, and the Healthcare Skills Training Institute at KFMC. We are committed to developing local talent and supply chain capabilities and match it with state-of-the-art facilities and technology. Today, with three offices and six facilities, Saudi Arabia accounts for the largest GE workforce in the Middle East with over 1,600 employees driving the healthcare, transportation, power, oil and gas, water, and aviation businesses.</p><h4>GE recently established the first all-female business-processing center in Saudi Arabia. What is the importance of this milestone, and how does it fit into your strategy for the company here?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is placing high emphasis on creating jobs for its youth and women and we are proud to be supporting female employment opportunities in the Kingdom. The all-female business process services center is a key strategic center and serves as a new business model for the Kingdom by delivering better business outcomes at lower costs. It helps in two ways. Basically, it supports diversity and localization and job creation in Saudi Arabia by creating quality job opportunities along with training for very capable Saudi women. The employees at the center received over 80,000 hours of intensive training in various disciplines. GE established this center as one of its five centers worldwide, meaning it is definitely an important center for us. It focuses on business process outsourcing, meaning HR, accounting, finance, and IT—supporting operations. In due course, it will introduce the entire range of office services, thus strengthening the operational efficiency of its clients. We are outsourcing these kinds of jobs worldwide from different centers. In this region, we are placing this center in Saudi Arabia, which is a strategic initiative. Saudi Aramco and GE are the anchor clients of the center today and we are working with TCS and Aramco in order to promote this center to be one of the key centers worldwide, as well as to help create jobs for Saudi women. The plan is to employ 3,000 Saudi women in the center over the next three years, and we hope to expand that even further in the future. For me, this is a strategic concept that showcases the significance of this region to GE, and Saudi Arabia more specifically. And, at the same time, the center is proof of our commitment to supporting the Kingdom's priorities around human capital development and the creation of employment opportunities for talented Saudi women. The center supports GE's operations in 39 countries including in the Middle East, North Africa &amp; Turkey, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe. They will support the power and water, oil and gas, healthcare, aviation, transportation, and GGO operations of GE.</p><div class="quote">“Saudi Arabia is one of the core markets for GE globally."</div><h4>Can you talk about other ways GE is helping in this regard?</h4><p>At GE Saudi, we help to develop engineers and technicians by developing the technical skills of the local youth to enable them to take on these technical and specialty roles in the industry. To support the creation of technical careers for Saudis, GE is training students at the GE Technical Academy, developed with the support of the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF), GE, and Saudi Technical &amp; Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC). Over 500 Saudi students will be trained at the facility over five years. More than 200 of the students in the first three batches have already joined GE's various businesses in the Kingdom, including the GE Manufacturing Technology Center. We also have leadership and scholarship programs inside and outside the country. GE has invested SAR22 million over three years to provide annual scholarships that will benefit 60 Saudi university students, both male and female. We also partner with different universities in the Kingdom to offer co-op programs and on-the-job training to students. Also, we are running different leadership programs for Saudis, which is a one-two-year investment in employees to develop their leadership and specialty expertise, enabling them to be the future managers and leaders. We have programs in commercial leadership, HR leadership, IT, communications, and operational leadership that last for one to two years. The individual is trained to become a true expert in some of the GE strategic areas, such as commercial, finance, marketing, sales, and engineering, for example. We are also constantly working to promote diversity and hire more Saudi women throughout our offices in Riyadh, Dammam, and Jeddah. We are hiring more females every year. If you compare the number to three or four years ago, it was less than five. Now, we are talking about almost 100 women working at GE Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How are you incorporating more Saudi SMEs in the supply chain?</h4><p>An ideal example of how we build the local SME sector is the operations of our GE Manufacturing Technology Center in Dammam. More than 150 gas turbine parts are being serviced in Saudi Arabia by qualified and trained Saudi suppliers for the center. We are supporting SME growth and ensuring that they are able to become not only local suppliers but global suppliers for GE and the industry. There are many ways you can support the economy. One way is to support Saudi SMEs. We have worked with Aramco and others to run an annual Saudi Suppliers Conference in Dammam where we meet with several SMEs and discuss area of development, opportunities for growth, and how we can support them and enable them to grow. The outcome from that kind of relationship has established more than 290 Saudi suppliers and 140 SMEs for GE in the Kingdom. Several Saudi suppliers are also involved in manufacturing parts for GE's global gas turbine network as well as produce mechanical, fluid, and electrical systems for power plants. Globally, GE can get parts and services from Saudi SME companies in Saudi Arabia. This also supports the economy.</p><h4>Can you talk about the future role of GE's Manufacturing Technology Center (GEMTEC)?</h4><p>GEMTEC is really a key strategic center. The center is a significant investment in the Kingdom and in the manufacturing industry. We have marked the fourth year of operations of GEMTEC, which is today a regional service and manufacturing hub and center of excellence for advanced gas turbines. We have expanded the center significantly since its launch in 2011, and are now gearing up to manufacture the first high-efficiency, heavy-duty gas turbine in the Kingdom by 2016. The best technology that can fit Saudi Arabia's needs can be manufactured at the center. This center is also key because it hires and educates many Saudi engineers. Right now, the center has achieved about 70% nationalization, with several additional job opportunities being created for Saudis. Since its launch, the center has created more than 700 jobs. At the same time, we have utilized this shop to support more than 70 customers in around 30 countries worldwide. It is not in Saudi Arabia for Saudi Arabia; it is in Saudi Arabia for the whole world. In fact, nearly 80% of all parts assembled at the center are for external markets including Europe and the US as well as GE's manufacturing facilities globally. We are hiring the right people, and we are very proud to have female Saudi engineers working in the shop as well. The center will further expand its capabilities to include a first-of-its-kind repair research and development center to support the gas turbines. Our customers, such as Aramco, are monitoring this closely visiting us and giving us the right encouragement and support. We are currently servicing more than 500 gas turbines here, so you can imagine how important this is. This further supports Saudi Arabia's focus on strengthening exports and manufacturing to boost economic growth and competitiveness.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals and priorities in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We will continue to partner in the transformational growth of the economy and to support the Kingdom's goals in promoting the manufacturing sector and economic diversification. This is evidenced by our goal to manufacture the first gas turbine here in the Kingdom at GE Manufacturing Technology Center in Dammam in 2016. We will also continue to advance the $1 billion investment commitment to the Kingdom. We are investing in people, knowledge transfer, and many aspects of the economy. We also plan to continue to make progress in the industries that are well known, such as oil and gas technology, power generation technology, healthcare technology, aviation, and business services. Over the next four-five years, we expect to localize the oil and gas technology further in Saudi Arabia, which can be used as an export base for the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the Ministry's priorities when it comes to diversifying the UAE's energy mix leading up to 2030?</h4><p>Natural gas accounts for almost 100% of our energy currently, but we know that this won't last. We want to increase green energy as a share of the overall electricity sector. We aim, by 2020, to achieve around 30% of electricity generation from emission-free sources, with 25% from nuclear power and the remainder from solar energy. Today, we have three solar projects that are currently in the bidding phase, each at 100 MW. One is in Al Ain, and the other is in Dubai. At the end of 2014, we hope to be at the final investment decision stage to start constructing the largest single-site LNG receiving facility in the region, the Emirates LNG receiving terminal at Fujairah. With a capacity of 9 million tons, it will enable us to deal with future growth in demand. We have received commercial bids, and we are currently evaluating them. The facility will help us to diversify our gas import market by having three different forms: indigenous gas, pipeline gas, and LNG. The fact that gas prices are increasing has made us consider sour gas projects. Electricity demand is growing at around 6% per annum in the UAE, and that requires additional resources every year. The first sour gas project is Al Hosn Gas' Shah field, which will start production in 2015. We are now implementing the second sour project, Bab, which Shell is developing. That will come in 2017. With electricity as the largest consumer of gas, we are working with electricity providers and regulators across the Emirates to establish a unified conservation law to encourage people to consume less. The levels of subsidies paid by the government will triple when the more expensive gas comes into the system. We want to look at this structurally and with a unified approach. We are trying to monitor newly built housing and structures through green initiatives, which force the construction of energy-efficient buildings. However, existing buildings are less efficient. We have launched the first UAE Energy Status Report for 2015 in collaboration with the UN, which puts together all of these initiatives and all of the work that has been done in one easily comprehensible format.</p><h4>What is the Ministry doing to make solar energy more attractive and feasible for the private sector?</h4><p>We are trying to make the tariff attractive and reasonable, while at the same time looking at the costs of generation for solar energy. The PV Solar energy generation cost went as low as $0.12 per kilowatt hour recently. This makes solar much more attractive. The UAE, and the wider region, have the lowest tariffs in the world, and we are going to try to raise them when prices increase. If we reach $0.15-$0.16 per kilowatt hour, that would be reasonable. In Europe, it is around $0.33 per kilowatt/hour. It is not costing us as much as it used to, but people need to preserve energy. People are now living in larger houses with many more amenities. The aim is for a reasonable per capita use of energy.</p><h4>How are you working to bring about change in consumption behavior toward conservation?</h4><p>Talking to, and incentivizing people, is extremely important to us. We have started giving lectures to this effect. I myself have gone to universities for this purpose. We gave a televised lecture at the Majlis of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Chief of the UAE Armed Forces, which was attended by government officials, businessmen, and diplomats, along with about 300-400 other citizens, on the subject of the importance of the conservation of energy. We also allocated several prizes across the different sectors for consumers. We launched the UAE prize for electricity and water conservation achievements offered to housewives, schools, and mosques for reducing energy and water consumption.</p><div class="quote">“Talking to, and incentivizing people, is extremely important to us."</div><h4>In terms of solar energy technology, what role does innovation play alongside public-sector involvement and R&amp;D in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Innovation plays a key role, which is why we have not merely focused on attracting investors but have also emphasized R&amp;D. For example, through the Masdar Institute of Technology we are developing better and more efficient PV cells and working with international companies on new technology. Masdar is one of the leading companies that is wholly owned by the government of Abu Dhabi. It is a major investor in a variety of renewable energies. We are also working directly with the industry by putting seed capital into research projects in companies. Our market is open for this, and has attracted people to work on innovation in this area; however, we do not want to over-subsidize the sector. Incentives and new technology are coming to the market, and I believe that we have an excellent future in solar energy.</p><h4>How does the recent slump in oil prices affect your outlook on production capacity building?</h4><p>When you build capacity, it is for the long term. As a mature investor in and producer of oil, we always look at the long term to continue to being a reliable producer. Upstream energy requires such investments to cater to the shortage that is coming to the market. However, pricing is important, and what led to the development of fracking in the US was pricing. If pricing there does not adjust, investors will leave; you don't produce oil to lose money. I don't see these low prices as the new norm. The current low prices aren't going to affect the major players, such as the UAE, in the long term. The worry is that if the cost of production stays higher than the price for consumers, investors will be scared off. We need them to stay and help us supply the world with what it needs. Imagine what would have happened to prices if shale oil had not been around over the past four years. It has been a huge help to the world to keep prices reasonable and sustainable, at around $100 per barrel. The context is important; this is not the first time we have seen a slump, and in general, 2014 has been a good year for us, with average prices still standing at around $100.</p><h4>How would you assess Abu Dhabi and the UAE's success in Emiratizing the energy sector?</h4><p>There are two issues here: nationalization and attracting the best possible people. We want to have a reasonable level of UAE nationals who are interested in working in this business. ADNOC is close to having 50% Emiratization of its 50,000 staff. This is an excellent number compared to other sectors here. The energy sector is still considered attractive. To make it more attractive to younger generations, ADNOC started programs sponsoring the most talented students from fifth grade up with the Al Waha (ADNOC Oases) program. We also have competitions to entice students and attract them into the nuclear and renewable energy fields as well. Even within the energy sector, there is now competition for human capital. Companies are now going to places such as India and China to look for new recruits. In terms of personnel, there is been a shift in the industry from the West to Asia, South America, and Africa. We have seen this in our company, Mubadala, which works in different countries. We have an aging population in the industry. When present working generations retire, we could have a problem. I believe we need to convince more people to enter the industry, which is currently a challenge. We finally got the approval from the authorities in the Ministry of Energy to start hiring; hence, we are looking to expand by at least 50%-60% to keep up with the challenges.</p><h4>How would you characterize Abu Dhabi's global and regional reputation within the energy landscape?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi is moving from being famous in the oil and gas sector to being internationally recognized across the entire energy sector. At the Ministry of Energy, we have been given the mandate to build our country's energy policy up until 2030. We will be the only country in the region with a long-term, diversified energy policy. We think this will encourage other countries in the region to do the same. We were awarded the World Energy Congress in 2019, an event held every three years that has never been hosted by any country in this region. Istanbul will host it in 2016, and Abu Dhabi will follow after that. We were awarded the congress ahead of Russia and Brazil, which is another demonstration of our infrastructure and the fact that we are spearheading change in the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your commercial office in Dubai help boost bilateral relations between Ecuador and the UAE?<br></h4><p>We firmly believe that UAE is one of the main consolidation and distribution hubs in the world. If Ecuador aims to promote and export its products within the region, Dubai plays a fundamental role. One of the reasons we have seen an increase in trade with the Emirates and the region is due to the fact that we opened a trade office in Dubai. From Dubai we can gain more efficient access to other Gulf countries. From there, we can export goods and services, for example, to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and all states in the Gulf region. We are also able to reach Iran and Iraq, as well as the Caucasus and Central Asia; these regions contain very interesting emerging markets that have traditionally benefited from Ecuadorean goods, such as bananas and roses, during the era of the Soviet Union.</p><h4>What are the economic ties between the UAE and Ecuador? What challenges do you face?</h4><p>One aspect that has to be considered is the fact that Ecuador and countries associated with the GCC are complementary as we offer a different variety of exports. The Gulf region has a food security problem, and the UAE is no exception. Therefore, they are continuously searching for new food providers, and Ecuador has a great capacity for food production and exportation. For example, one region in Ecuador, the Gulf of Guayaquil, has the capacity to produce enough agricultural products to feed all of Latin America. This is because Ecuador has one of the best geographical locations in the world; we are located on the Equator, and we have microclimates due to our significant differences in altitude. You can produce anything you want, from tropical goods to those grown in more temperate climates, such as dairy products and cereals like rice and maize. The potential is enormous. We also know that the UAE is looking to diversify its investments and focus on other parts of the world particularly in light of the global financial crisis, which is why the notion of risk has completely changed. Previously, it was relatively safe to invest in Europe and the US, and countries like ours were seen as a risk for investment. However, Ecuador is now a leading country in government investment for development, and the country has focused this development on three main pillars: physical infrastructure, energy, and telecommunications. There is strong potential for investment in tourism and hotel infrastructure, and Dubai is widely known for being a world leader in these sectors.</p><h4>What can Ecuador offer the UAE, and what can the UAE offer to Ecuador?</h4><p>We want people from the GCC region, particularly the UAE, to develop their businesses in Ecuador, and, thus, we can become the hub for the entire Gulf region in Latin America, particularly in South America. Nowadays, we are able to provide the facilities and incentives to invest and establish enterprises in Ecuador. Through trade agreements that Ecuador currently maintains, tariff-free trade to every country in South America becomes achievable. The government of Dubai through the Department of Economic Development has helped us develop plans for increasing exports to their region. The UAE government also supports the possibility of opening an Ecuadorean consulate in their country. Additionally, the Port of Dubai, Dubai International Airport, and the free trade zones can help our companies distribute their products once they arrive in the region.</p><h4>What type of collaboration does the government share with Emirates Group?</h4><p>In February 2014, we signed a co-share agreement between Emirates and the main Ecuadorean Airline, TAME; a government-funded company with one of the highest growth rates in Latin America at this moment.  We have reached an agreement to work together to move passengers and cargo in specific hub airports, such as New York. We also have direct flights to Sío Paulo, and we are looking at Buenos Aires, Chicago, and Los Angeles in the future. We will sign a general agreement on cooperation in economic and trade matters with the UAE government and are also ready to sign a double-taxation agreement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During the World Food Security Summit, what did Hungary share with the UAE in order to improve the trade relationship?<br></h4><p>There were two main reasons why I went to the UAE last time. First of all, because there is a well-known exhibition called Gulf Foods, and we have a national booth at that fair. I believe there are 16 Hungarian companies represented. These companies from the food industry produce food at home and sell it worldwide. Half of the companies that are here are attending the fair for the second or third time. They have ongoing business here in the region, if not directly in the UAE. The second reason was that we met some governmental organizations or leaders to talk about some actual topics. Hungary is traditionally an agriculturally focused country, producing roughly 35% to 40% more food than we consume. That means we have a lot of food to sell, not only in this region, however, but in countries where there is demand and the financial resources. It was obvious to come here and discuss this. There was also a mutual interest, not only for the UAE but also Saudi Arabia. Recently, Saudi Arabia stopped local crop production because there is not enough water sourced locally, and the UAE has been importing 90% of the food consumed from outside the country. So, why not be part of this business? I think we are close size-wise compared to the country. Also, those products that are exported to the Emirates are partly re-exported. For us, the size of the country and the market here are not limiting factors, because it also partly re-sells the foods it imports. Hungarian farming compared to the local farming sector here is structurally different. We have large-scale farms of an average size of 300 hectares. We have even larger companies producing products that are popular here as well, like poultry or vegetables. These companies have perfect conditions to produce, but some of them do not have enough money to invest in further processing or to refine the production they have. Therefore, I think that it would be of mutual interest to combine these efforts. I have the money and conditions to produce, so why not establish a joint venture or sell part of the shares of my company and give you the possibility to share the profit. We have partners with these companies in the private sector. We work as a supporter at the governmental level to try to bring two partners together to arrange business. We cannot be involved in private business, but the conditions must be fair.</p><h4>How is the new trade office helping boost the relationship between the UAE and Hungary?</h4><p>The main aim in establishing this office was and is to help Hungarian SMEs and even large companies to discover business possibilities in this region. With a few exceptions in Hungary, the average Hungarian company is not an expert in the region. So, a local representative could be of great help for these companies. Hungary has excellent products that could be marketed here, but if we don't know about the demand, we won't know how to bring the parties together. So that is the reason.</p><h4>How is the double-taxation agreement that Hungary signed with the UAE in November 2013 assisting business?</h4><p>It is obvious that as part of the EU, we are not totally independent, fortunately and unfortunately, from EU legislation. However, this helps us make business easier. For business-oriented companies, they don't want to have borders. However, if there is no double taxation, that is already quite an achievement. The only other aspects we have to take into consideration for agriculture are the veterinary agreements. Theoretically, we can already sell, but if there are no agreements without limitations between the countries, then it is still just a potential, and not a real possibility. We still have to work on that and all the objectives should be cleared.</p><h4>What are your forecasts in terms of annual trade between Hungary and the UAE?</h4><p>I know that this potentially will be a neutral trade. Right now, it is only one-sided. There is around ‚¬50,000 imported by Hungary from the Emirates. The only sales are one directional; it comes from Hungary to the Emirates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your Ministry recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the UAE Ministry of Energy. What will this MoU bring to both countries?<br></h4><p>We signed a MoU on bilateral cooperation in the field of energy on the occasion of the state visit of HH Sheik Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi to Korea in February 2014. This MoU seeks to promote the exchange of information, know-how, and manpower in all energy sectors, including nuclear, oil and gas, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). In particular, South Korea and the UAE will work together to train energy professionals with the aim of carrying out concrete cooperation projects in both countries. They will also actively pursue joint business opportunities in third markets such as the Middle East, Africa, and Europe using their skilled labor in the nuclear, oil, and gas fields. The UAE has a geographical advantage as a gateway to neighboring countries in the Middle East and Africa. The Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, which is currently under construction, is the first commercial power plant built in the Middle East outside Iran. This new nuclear plant is expected to serve as a benchmark for future nuclear power plant construction in the region. The skilled labor gained through the construction and operation of the plant will contribute greatly to Korea and the UAE's joint entry into third markets. The two countries will also enhance cooperation between their universities and oil corporations in the oil and gas sectors so that the UAE can obtain more of the manpower it needs, and Korea can secure more energy resources.</p><h4>With a particular focus on Dubai, what is your future economic outlook for the UAE, and how do you envision future relations between Korea and the UAE?</h4><p>Dubai accounts for 30% of the UAE economy and has very sound finances. In particular, real estate prices, which plummeted after the 2008financial crisis, are gradually recovering. Moreover, the UAE, which has the world's sixth largest oil reserves and seventh largest natural gas reserves, is seeing sustained growth in the non-oil industries, such as construction, exports, tourism, and finance. All these factors point to a bright economic outlook for the UAE, including Dubai. Except for 2009, when it was hit by the financial crisis, the UAE has recorded steady growth in exports and imports over the past decade. This is evidence of the UAE government's commitment to maintaining its open trade policy as it seeks to develop into an economic hub for the Middle East. Crude oil accounts for about 37% of the UAE's total exports. Nevertheless, the UAE is diversifying its exports to include jewelry, machinery, and electric and electronic products, showing that the country has a solid industrial base compared to other GCC countries. In particular, the UAE has well-developed and growing non-oil industries, such as manufacturing, construction, tourism, and finance. These industries are likely to lead the growth of the UAE economy in the future. As the third-largest trading partner in the Middle East, the UAE is an important economic cooperation partner for South Korea. Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1980, we have continuously strived to expand our bilateral trade. Korea's winning the bid to build a nuclear power plant in the UAE in 2009 has especially served as a great opportunity to solidify our trade ties. So far, economic missions and product exhibitions have mainly been spearheaded by the private sector with the support of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation (KOTRA), and other investment agencies. In the future, I hope to see more active cooperation between both governments in expanding exchange between SMEs, holding information sharing sessions on investment, and exchanging high-level personnel.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai Chamber strives to help businessmen and enterprises to interact with the Dubai business community. What has been the Chamber's formula to achieve synergy between the international and local business arenas?<br></h4><p>Dubai Chamber's strategic plan focuses on three areas. One of those is providing information and advice to the business community, two is being a voice for the business community, and three is promoting Dubai and the businesses operating here in international markets, which includes our own overseas expansion. Overall, the effect is to help attract global enterprises to the Emirate and assist home-grown talent to expand abroad, which is helping to achieve this great synergy between the international and local business arenas. Meanwhile, we also organize several international-scale events each year that attract participants from across the world to attend. For example, in 2014 we are organizing both our own event, the Africa Global Business Forum, and an external one, the 10th World Islamic Economic Forum, in Dubai in October, which will each attract thousands of international business leaders, heads of state, and policymakers.</p><h4>World Expo 2020 is expected to add $23 billion to the economy, as well as about 277,000 new jobs. In your opinion, what will be the impact of the event, as well as its aftermath, on Dubai's economy?</h4><p>Expo 2020 will be very positive for Dubai's economy. Our Dubai Traders Outlook Survey 2014 revealed that 51% of traders are expecting sales to increase thanks to the event. You are right to say that it is expected to add $23 billion to the economy, which equates to 24.4% of GDP and will be spread over the 2015-2021 period. According to a Merrill Lynch report, this growth equates to an annual 3.5% of GDP, with the bulk likely to materialize around the event itself. In terms of new jobs, I think 277,000 is a conservative figure; however, of that number, 40% are expected to be created in the hotel and restaurant sector, 30% in the construction sector, peaking in 2018-19, and the remaining 30% in tertiary sectors, such as transport and logistics, business services, and retail.</p><h4>You often stress how Dubai is regarded not only as a commercial hub, but also as a window for the greater GCC region. What are the key peculiarities that define Dubai as a world-class business destination?</h4><p>Dubai has many advantages for business, including excellent infrastructure, world-class logistics, and a business climate that is tax-free and supports and protects investors. Dubai has excellent air, land, and sea connectivity, not only to the GCC but to the Middle Eastern, Indian, and African markets. Dubai businesses also benefit from strong government support and new initiatives that are strengthening protection for investors and increasing the ease of doing business.</p><h4></h4><h4>The Chamber's membership has reached about 150,000 members currently. What is the Chamber's strategy in attracting, recruiting, and maintaining stable partnerships with enterprises?</h4><p>We aim to provide services and support that meet the needs of our members and the wider Dubai business community. Whether that is legal support in the form of contract drafting services or mediation and arbitration, or organizing networking and business-matching events and welcoming international delegations, we are keen to put the interests of our members first. Our development strategy includes being an advocate that promotes our members' interests, providing business intelligence like information about markets, investment opportunities, and setting up commercial enterprises here and in our key overseas markets, as well as our international expansion, which is about promoting our city and our members' interests here and abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the DFSA collaborate with the other authorities in Dubai and the UAE to assure its independence?<br></h4><p>Collaboration and independence are fully consistent with each other. By building and maintaining strong relationships and mutual respect with federal and Dubai government colleagues, the DFSA is able to educate, learn from, and work with policy makers and regulators alike. Over the years, the DFSA has been able to cultivate both professional and personal relationships with a number of authorities in the UAE. Those relationships have resulted in mutual respect and effective inter-governmental co-operation. For example, the DFSA works closely with the Anti-Money Laundering and Suspicious Cases Unit of the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) and is represented on the National Anti-Money Laundering Committee. The DFSA and the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) of the UAE conduct joint training seminars, and we participate in joint inspections of firms of mutual interest. Our relationship with the SCA is excellent and continues to be developed between supervisory staff and at different levels of seniority. Quarterly meetings are organized to discuss matters relevant to capital markets and enforcement. In addition to formal meetings, informal meetings are held as well. Recently, the DFSA and the SCA liaised closely to obtain regulatory equivalence from the EU's regulatory authorities for access to the bloc's capital markets. In the past, the DFSA participated on the SCA's taskforce to prepare for the MSCI upgrade to emerging market status. The DFSA also works closely with the UAE Ministry of Finance regarding the OECD Global Forum's review of tax information exchange legislation and processes. We drafted a model memorandum of understanding (MoU) that the Ministry now uses to facilitate information exchange with not only the DIFC, but also the other free zones.</p><h4>The vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum is to transform Dubai into a global hub for the Islamic economy. How is the DFSA contributing to this transformation?</h4><p>The DFSA has always been a strong supporter of the development of Islamic finance in the UAE, by providing a dedicated Islamic financial services regulatory framework. This framework provides an effective and enabling environment for sustainable growth of Islamic finance in the DIFC by facilitating safe and sound operations for firms, addressing risks they may face. We have also published a tailored handbook of all the rules applicable to Islamic finance activities. The DFSA has also been a major contributor to global standard-setting and capacity development in the domain of global Islamic finance, with its robust contribution to the Islamic Financial Services Board as well as participation in various fora to share our expertise and knowledge base. One of the three key pillars of the Islamic economy plan is to position Dubai as a hub for the issuance of sukuk and the provision of other Islamic financial services. The demand for sukuk has been rising strongly and is expected to grow significantly in the next few years, driven by strong economic growth in the Middle East and in Asia. The global demand for sukuk is expected to reach $421 billion by 2017. The DIFC is well placed to play an important role in this respect. For example, the value of sukuk admitted to the official list of securities in the DIFC was at $8.95 billion in July 2014, compared to $6.1 billion in 2013. Between NASDAQ Dubai and the Dubai Financial Market, the value of total sukuk listed (in April 2014) has surpassed $20 billion, making Dubai the third largest sukuk issuance center globally, after Malaysia and London.</p><h4>The DFSA regulates around 440 entities. How does the DFSA combat money laundering?</h4><p>Money laundering is one of the most significant risks to the achievement of the DFSA's objectives. As a consequence, we ensure that our regulatory staff have the skills needed to deal with this complex subject. We have recently updated our regulations in this area, following changes by the Financial Action Task Force. In addition to staying compliant with the requirements of this critical standard-setter, we have benchmarked our supervisory practices against other regulators around the globe to ensure that our people adequately assess the risks and appropriately allocate resources in this field.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the company have in Dubai today?<br></h4><p>As a government-owned entity, ENOC has always focused on being a partner of the Emirate's all-round development through a concerted strategy that also reflects the vision of our leadership. Led by our core values of teamwork, integrity, transparency, respect, and customer focus, we have established our credentials as the energy partner behind every successful journey. Our transformational growth was achieved through our business diversification and geographic expansion, thus creating long-term value for our stakeholders. Today, ENOC's roadmap for growth is to further strengthen our position as a leading regional integrated oil and gas group, highly profitable and socially responsible toward employees, the community and the environment. We will continue to achieve this through initiatives that build on the Government's core developmental strategies. For example, Dubai has always placed an emphasis on diversifying its economy, with the non-oil sector contributing to nearly 95% of its GDP. Similarly, Dubai has shown wise leadership in promoting sustainable development and smart initiatives. ENOC's strategy builds on these directives set by the Government. While we are at the forefront of providing conventional fuel we are also promoting renewable energy sources such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), which is a greener and inexpensive alternative as an automotive fuel. As Dubai prepares to host Expo 2020, under the three key pillars of sustainability, mobility and opportunity, ENOC works to meet the development goals of the Government by accelerating our capital investment program to ensure the efficient execution of critical projects and building infrastructure to support the energy needs of the Emirate.</p><h4>In light of the Government's commitment to eco-friendly policies, what steps are being taken to successfully reduce Dubai's carbon footprint?</h4><p>In addition to recently introducing the ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, Euro 5, which will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, ENOC is a committed partner in Dubai's efforts to promote sustainable development. We have also signed a Technical Services Agreement (TSA) with the Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence (DCCE) to effectively manage the carbon footprint of ENOC's operations and to develop the competencies of ENOC's staff in promoting Clean Development Mechanism projects. The TSA will assist us in developing a carbon footprint calculator and analysis strategy. ENOC's subsidiary EMGAS is currently driving a CNG project in Dubai to complement the UAE Government's strategy of safeguarding a healthy and clean environment and reducing pollution. CNG is set to become the UAE's preferred alternative fuel of choice for government vehicles, and ENOC is working with the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) to introduce CNG in public transport to reduce environmental pollution. One of ENOC's pioneering sustainability initiatives was the opening of the first green service station in the Middle East in Dubai. Among the innovative green initiatives at the station are technological devices to contain petrol fumes released at the pump as well as state-of-the-art systems such as solar-powered lighting, a “waterless" car-washing system, new waste segregation systems, and design upgrades to reduce noise pollution. The culture of sustainability is ingrained internally, too. Across ENOC several green measures have been introduced, such as replacing all systems with ozone-friendly appliances and usage of LED/solar lights. ENOC's headquarter complex achieved a saving of 48% in water use and 7.8% in energy use through these initiatives in 2012 compared to 2010.</p><h4>How is your service portfolio evolving in order to meet the current trends and to face modern challenges in the energy sector?</h4><p>We are continuously enhancing our business processes by leveraging knowledge management and information systems to promote better customer understanding. We deploy state-of-the-art IT systems to drive growth and use superior management information systems for faster decision-making. This is demonstrated by the activation of the Vehicle Identification Pass (ViP), a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)/Vehicle Identification (VID)-based fuel retailing system at ENOC/EPPCO service stations. This complements the self-serve facility provided at the ENOC/EPPCO network from midnight to 6.00 am. Through the new system commercial users and fleet-owners can now refuel on the go without the need to pay in cash or use credit cards. Across our businesses our focus therefore is to enhance customer service standards through advanced technologies while focusing on strengthening our operational efficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits will Palm Utilities bring to Empower and the market?<br></h4><p>Palm Utilities was an established business, but we found that it was not managed properly. Good management is key in any business. Look at the aviation industry, for example. Emirates Airline started in 1985 with a capital of $2 million and two hired aircraft. Today, it has a huge capacity. We plan to do the same, and are confident that we can turn it around. And, over the next few months, we believe we will manage that.</p><h4>You also took on $600 million and spent $500 million on this acquisition. Will you use the remaining $100 million for investment in new projects?</h4><p>We do have projects and a plan. We covered the price of the acquisition, so the remaining money can be spent correcting the business. Empower is building two pontoons in Business Bay that will cost quite a lot of money. We are paying for them from the revenues and investor financing. It will generate cash through its operations. This is a continuous process. We need a certain level of debt in order to grow, whether at a personal or a business level. You do not take that money to spend on something fancy, as you are taking it to develop your business. The minute we stop growing is the minute we start stagnating. If you keep investing, then you are going to increase the size of your business over time.</p><h4>Will this acquisition represent the creation of the largest district cooling service provider company in the world?</h4><p>I am a member of the International District Energy Association (IDEA), the largest and most authenticated body of district energy, based in the US, which has over 1,700 members in 25 countries that deal with district energy issues. The total tonnage register for the next-largest company shows 700,000 tons of air-conditioned distance cooling units. Empower has 1 million air-conditioned distance cooling units, meaning we are the largest by far.</p><h4>What does district cooling bring to Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai is searching for green solutions to reduce the Emirate's carbon footprint and to focus on the push toward clean energy. District cooling is a key part of this process. You never know what will happen in 10 years, but you do know about the next two or three years, and district cooling is a part of that future.</p><h4>What improvements are you arranging in the cooling sector to help the environment?</h4><p>On the environmental front, we have found a solution in using treated sewage water instead of potable water for district cooling. At some of our plants, we recycle the water and put it back into the system. We save a lot on potable water, while at the same time achieve clean and environmentally friendly air conditioning that reduces the city's carbon footprint.</p><h4>To what extent has Empower improved its market share in the UAE and Dubai following the acquisition of Palm Utilities from Istithmar World?</h4><p>After the acquisition, we hold 70% of the market in Dubai alone. In the UAE, we have about 60%. It is important to stabilize the market. So, if we fix prices, then all of the other companies will have to compete with us. We want to set the benchmark and act as the main driver of the industry in the UAE in a way that benefits the government, our investors, and our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[cool-calm-steady]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the concept behind Emirates District Cooling (EMICOOL)?<br></h4><p>When it comes to the cooling system, each building, villa, or apartment used to have its own chiller system located at the top of the building. What we wanted to do was create a sustainable cooling system network that would be cheaper in the long run, and utilize energy and water far more efficiently. The larger the network, the greater the reach, and the more cost effective district cooling systems would become. The benefits are obvious; far lower carbon emissions, a reduction in energy use for the electricity grid network, a more efficient use of water, and less noise are just some of the main advantages of district cooling. We worked at a loss at the beginning because you have to create and build a massive network for a small, connected load, which requires a high initial capex. You have to excavate and then build a system of insulated pipelines that connect each unit and deliver chilled water to each house. Despite the initial losses, firstly you have to build a sustainable plant then excavate to lay down the insulated pipelines.  We knew we would soon make a profit, and that has been the case.</p><h4>What have customers' reactions been to district cooling systems?</h4><p>Honestly, you cannot understand the difference of a district cooling system until you feel it and experience it first hand. With a district cooling system, you don't have dozens of ugly AC units jutting out of a single building, with their pipes dripping water and dangerous gas leakages. AC units also produce a lot of noise, unlike district cooling. Therefore, not only does district cooling work more efficiently overall, but it is greener and more energy efficient, and you don't see or hear it. It is practically invisible.</p><h4>What have been the challenges of marketing and selling district cooling systems?</h4><p>When district cooling systems first came out, the pricing was not transparent, which led to some problems initially. Also, people just didn't know the difference or the benefits that this new system had over conventional AC systems. Therefore, we had to educate them and advertise the advantages of district cooling systems. This isn't just about educating them on district cooling systems either; it is about educating people on the importance of greener, more environmentally friendly systems that are more efficient at utilizing energy and water. To give you some examples, we use solar energy for a significant portion of our power needs, and we use irrigation water instead of potable water for the cooling towers, meaning treated wastewater. We are also the only company that has thermal storage tanks in all its plants. These storage tanks act as a reservoir. We charge them by night, dropping the temperature down to nearly 4°C. Then, during the daytime, we open the valve, releasing it into the pipes and compensating for the heat. We are the only company that has thermal energy at 100% penetration in all plants. Hence, what we are doing is not just in the interest of the consumer, it is something that is in our national interest, especially considering the climate and geography of the UAE. As for the challenges of district cooling on a technical level, the main one is ensuring that the chilled water is distributed to every unit in the network equally and fairly from the main cooling plant. When installing a system, the master developer is our first single point of contact. However, we don't build our model for the master developer, we build it for our customers—the end user. We build it for the homeowner or tenant who will incorporate this system into their lifestyle.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Dubai offer as a location for SKA Group's headquarters?<br></h4><p>First and foremost, Dubai is a great place from which to do business. The banking system and the free zone system are unique and make it very convenient for us to operate our business. The main attraction for us here in Dubai is that, geographically, we are at the center of all our regional operations. We can support our businesses in Iraq, Afghanistan, the UAE, and Africa. Most international companies are located here, meaning many of the people we deal with are also in Dubai. It is a good networking place. Dubai is a fast-growing location. It is safe and secure, and the financial system here is easy to work with. It makes it very attractive to do business. We see a lot of potential in the UAE as well, not only in the other countries we are investing in.</p><h4>What makes SKA so keen on working in challenging environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan?</h4><p>We operate in high-risk environments because we feel that a lot of those environments have the biggest opportunities. In places like Iraq, there are huge opportunities, although the risks are very high. Not every company can work in these kinds of places, but we developed our niche by successfully working in difficult environments since 2005. We can't change anything in politics, but I believe that all the projects we are involved with help to develop the countries that we operate. SKA aims to work as a good corporate citizen, helping to develop business, people and communities, and we are also focused on a lot of charity work and social welfare programs. All of this is positive.</p><h4>How has the partnership with the Iraqi government helped in developing SKA in its overall operations?</h4><p>Over the last decade, we have developed a very positive working relationship with the Ministry of Oil in Iraq. We have developed an excellent relationship in quality control and in doing our business professionally. More recently, we now have supply contracts with the Ministry of Electricity to supply all the power stations with imported gas oil. We are developing a great track record of being able to get the job done. This has been the key to our success in Iraq—developing good relationships with the government of Iraq and its different ministries. Everything in the Middle East is dependent on good relationships; therefore, you have to spend the time on the ground understanding the problems and working with the people if you want to achieve success.</p><h4>What is your strategy to manage risk in your operations?</h4><p>We have a very good saying; knowledge dispels fear. I believe that in order to get the right knowledge and understand the problems, you have to be on the ground. You cannot run a business in Somalia or Iraq or Afghanistan sitting in your office in Dubai. That is why I have to travel all the time; I have to be there to understand what the problems are and manage the risk. I have to make decisions that will affect all of my staff and potentially, I'll need to protect them as well. We take risks, but we don't take unnecessary risks. We don't put our people unnecessarily in harm's way. We are proud of the fact that we have a good safety record.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say are the highlights of your operations as well as your growth strategy in the region?<br></h4><p>American Express Middle East is a joint-venture company. We are the issuer and acquirer of American Express Cards and merchants across the MENA region. American Express has been operating in the region since 1959, and in 1992 American Express Middle East was established as a joint venture company owned by American Express and Mawarid Investment Limited. One of the most important highlights of our operations is that we have been successful in supplying reliable, effective, and rewarding solutions to consumers, corporate clients, and merchants across the region. All of our products and services are characterized by outstanding quality and service, and demonstrate our commitment to delivering positive and enriching experiences to our Cardmembers and partners. Our ability to do this is enhanced by our operation of a spend-centric model, which means our revenues are generated by the spending power of our Cardmembers and the business that we drive to merchants rather than lending and revolving receivables on credit cards.</p><h4>How would you differentiate the market in the UAE compared with the others you are experiencing?</h4><p>The UAE has it all. It has a solid local customer base that spends on various everyday products, luxury goods, and experiences both locally and abroad, and also welcomes millions of visitors every year. It has become a well-respected and well-known destination for business, often serving as a hub for businesses as they open up their operations to serve the rest of the region. One of our objectives is to ensure we prioritize our investments in a selective manner to ensure we invest in markets and segments that deliver business growth, and in this sense the UAE is a key priority market for American Express Middle East. For example, one of the key trends that we see in the GCC region is that consumer spending on goods and experiences is growing, with the UAE spearheading this growth.</p><h4>What is the importance of technology and innovation at American Express Middle East?</h4><p>Technology is at the core of our business. Without technology, our business cannot run. Beyond technology is telecommunications and robust infrastructure. I am pleased to say that over the past few years we have invested significantly in our technology infrastructure with best-in-class technologies, be it hardware, software, or telecommunications. I believe digital is also an important aspect of our business. One of our goals is to maximize the share of American Express card spend online and also improve the online customer experience. For example, to improve the customer experience, our website has been mobile-optimized and we have launched a Facebook page to interact with customers and communicate special offers. We have launched mobile applications, which enable customers to look up their card accounts, pay their bills, check their balances, and put in service requests. Ultimately, convenience is the name of the game.</p><h4>What are you doing to strengthen your position from your point of view in terms of avoiding any possible mistakes in e-security?</h4><p>We offer a number of services that are core to our business. First of all, we educate our customers on the importance of not divulging personal information, and not only their card numbers, but also their personal details, and to ensure their passwords are kept secure. In addition, we have in-house models and sophisticated tools to ensure we anticipate or predict whether a transaction is suspicious or not. Therefore, if we detect through our internal models a suspicious transaction, we actually either cancel that transaction or generate an alert and call the customer for verification. We are also investing in American Express SafeKey®, which adds another layer of security for online transactions by allowing the customer to register and enroll in the service and then for every transaction online, they receive a unique password that would verify that transaction should be processed. Last but not least, we work closely with law enforcement agencies and authorities on combating fraud.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will a partnership with the UAE contribute to help the Cypriot energy sector to achieve its full potential?<br></h4><p>The recent discovery of natural gas reserves within Cyprus' Exclusive Economic Zone has unveiled the potential for Cyprus to become the Eastern Mediterranean's energy hub. This potential in turn can create tremendous prospects for investments and cooperation in the energy sector and auxiliary services, presenting new opportunities for growth in the well-established sectors of legal and financial services as well as the construction sector. Our decision to build an onshore LNG terminal would allow for the transportation and liquefaction of gas produced not only by Cyprus, but also by neighboring countries, thus ensuring the possibility of our region securely exporting gas to the European and Asian markets. From a political perspective, the Cypriot LNG terminal can be a hub for regional cooperation and a vehicle for regional dialogue between the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean.</p><h4>What value-added linkages can Cyprus and the UAE mutually develop?</h4><p>Cyprus is already a well-established and reliable international business hub, with a very attractive operating environment and modern infrastructure. As such, and due to the country's strategic location and EU membership, it can offer the UAE economy value-added linkages that very few countries in the region can match. Cyprus, after all, possesses a very unique blend of advantages—about 50 double tax treaties in force, a favorable and efficient tax regime and transparent legal framework, a highly educated and experienced workforce in the fields of services, logistics and retail, and one of the most competitive corporate tax rates in Europe at 12.5%.</p><h4>Yiorgos Lakkotrypis, Minister of Energy, Commerce, Industry and Tourism of Cyprus, stated the importance of the four agreements recently signed by the two nations to improve bilateral relations in different economic sectors. Which are the highlights of these four agreements?</h4><p>Cyprus and UAE have signed a bilateral agreement for cooperation in the air travel services sector and MoUs on energy, tourism, education, and science. The Agreement on Air Travel Services provides for the granting of rights within the framework of the “fifth freedom" for Emirates Airline to several destinations within Europe. The MoU on Energy provides for the establishment of a general framework of cooperation on energy issues and the creation of favorable conditions with regard to the exchange of technical expertise in offshore operations for the exploitation of hydrocarbons. It also provides for the exchange of technical expertise on issues of energy infrastructure and the distribution of energy. The MoU on Tourism provides for the planning and development of tourism cooperation with the exchange of technical expertise and the mutual promotion of the tourist products of the two countries. Finally, the MoU on Education and Science provides for the exchange of educational missions, granting of scholarships, and cooperation to finalize an agreement on the mutual recognition of academic degrees.</p><h4>What are Cyprus' future plans concerning the opening of avenues of bilateral cooperation in fields such as higher education and scientific research?</h4><p>Cyprus aspires to become an international educational center. For this reason, a national strategy is set in place to promote the international attractiveness of its higher education and scientific research. The government is committed to realizing this noble vision. We consider our Arab neighbors in general, and the UAE in particular, as potential strategic education and scientific research partners. We strongly believe that education is an area of mutual interest and possible cooperation, where we can work together to enrich our human capital, and promote Cyprus and the UAE as centers of academic excellence and innovative scientific research. Cyprus stands ready to pave the way for the signing of a bilateral inter-governmental educational and cultural agreement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of the traditionally strong oil sector in Tatarstan, what emphasis have you put on technological innovation and value-added in the oil and gas sector?<br></h4><p>The oil and gas industry is indeed a traditional sector for Tatarstan; we have been working in the oil and gas sector for 70 years. Around 3.1 billion-3.15 billion tons of oil have been extracted so far. In the 1970s, Tatarstan was the leading oil producer in the Soviet Union. For seven years, we had been extracting over 100 million tons of oil a year. Obviously, oil production dropped to 24 million tons after the breakup of the Soviet Union, but now the production is back up to 32 million tons a year. At present, there is one large oil producing company, Tatneft, and 34 smaller oil-producing companies. Tatneft contributes 80% to the total oil output, while another 34 companies contribute the remainder. We are planning to keep production at this level for the next 20 years. Needless to say, the structure of the deposits makes it more difficult to excavate oil. However, modern technologies (such as hydraulic fracturing and enhanced oil recovery [EOR] techniques) allow us to extract oil. Our companies employ state-of-the-art techniques. As for the long term, deposits will not be exhausted for another 20 years at least. Professionals estimate that Tatarstan possesses between 2 billion and 7 billion tons of bitumen deposits. Modern technologies allow for the extraction of crude oil from bitumen deposits. We have already reached 500 tons of oil a day, but that is only the beginning. Apart from that, we're also considering shale oil, or light tight oil, production. Our scientists are currently estimating the deposits. To date, we are refining about a half of total oil output, and until recently it was about 7 million tons a year. In 2010, we commissioned an oil refining plant. Indeed, we plan to increase oil refining to 70%-75% of production. By developing oil refining and petrochemical production, the share of the petrochemical industry in GRP has increased from 19% to around 36%-37% in about seven years.</p><h4>Tatarstan is well known for its strong industrial development. How do you see technological change influencing Tatarstan's traditional industrial outputs?</h4><p>I would note here that the world is moving in a new direction, where nanotechnologies allow us to create products with new features. Tatarstan is also moving in this direction. We have created a research center in partnership with RUSNANO and are about to start production processes that employ nanotechnologies, a field that has considerable potential. Over the coming years, the number of companies using nanotechnology will clearly raise. Those already in operation are highly competitive. Moreover, nanotechnology is being studied at our universities, and can be applied to create new materials. For example, we have started a production line for composite materials for the aircraft industry, such as from carbon fiber. Innovative products are among our top priorities. There is a new development program for 2013-2016 that implies significant investments (around RUB18 billion-RUB19 billion) into innovative technologies. Following this program, new nano-based production companies will be established. It is estimated that the output of these companies will reach at least RUB50 billion.</p><h4>Do you foresee the opening of further foreign trade offices in the years ahead?</h4><p>It is important to prioritize, and we all need to seek out new markets. We believe that the UAE, and Dubai in particular, is the most innovative location in the Middle East region. We have opened our trade representative there. Until recently, we had considered the UAE as a trading partner, but now we are cooperating in education, healthcare, architecture, urban planning, and SME support, among other areas. I have been traveling to Dubai quite regularly since 1992, and I see impressive changes every year I go there. There is a lot to learn from Dubai. The languages we speak are similar, as we share about 10% of the vocabulary. Therefore, we are interested in developing closer ties with the UAE. To date, the relationships between Tatarstan and the UAE have not been as tight as we would have liked. There are many things to work on, but Dubai's authorities are open, and we would like to make use of such cooperation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the year 2014 so far, in terms of stable growth, and what is your forecast for the rest of the year?<br></h4><p>Dubai's economy grew at 4.6% in real terms in 2013, continuing on its healthy and vigorous growth path since 2012 despite the persistent volatility of the world economy and sluggish growth in some emerging economies. The beginning of 2014 has confirmed the strength and reinvigoration of Dubai's economy, as witnessed by strong performance across varied sectors. One revealing trend is rising international passenger traffic, which in 1Q2014 went up by more than 10% compared to 1Q2013. This will help Dubai's international airport to become the largest airport in the world in terms of passenger numbers, surpassing London Heathrow in 2014. This is corroborated by the more than 10% rise in duty free sales at the same airport. Cross-border goods transportation has also been showing encouraging signs, with port container traffic rising by more than 17% and air cargo by almost 4% YoY in 1Q2014. Domestically, economic activity is intensifying as witnessed by the substantial YoY increase in transportation. Furthermore, construction and real estate, which played a very large role till the global downturn period, have recovered since the beginning of 2013. The volume of real estate transactions has increased in 1Q2014 at the fastest pace since 2009. The latest Dubai Business Survey (1Q2014), conducted by the Department of Economic Development (DED) on a quarterly basis, points to a high degree of business confidence, as reflected in optimistic sales forecasts and hiring and investment intentions over the rest of the year. According to DED's own forecast, GDP will grow approximately at 4.7% in real terms in 2014, which would be a good growth performance, particularly when compared to the prospects for the world economy.</p><h4>SMEs contribute over 40% of Dubai's GDP. Which specific initiatives are being pursued by Dubai DED in order to encourage and assist SMEs in Dubai?</h4><p>While Dubai's development has been based on a very proactive government that has laid the foundations of a modern economy, the driver's seat should belong to the private sector, with SMEs counted on to play a larger role than in the past. Their contribution to economic activity is already significant, accounting for nearly 40% of total GDP, but it is still below the shares recorded in several advanced and emerging countries. We expect them to be more innovative and to raise their productivity and skills in order to meet the challenges of international competitiveness. To help them achieve these goals, the DED has developed a comprehensive program that includes the governance and management, training, and facilitation of access to finance that remains, as elsewhere, a major obstacle to start and grow. An innovative feature of this program is to entice SMEs to compete and emulate each other in seeking the various benefits that DED tailors to their needs. As a result, Dubai SME, which is an agency of DED, has provided consulting and development services to over 1,100 new SMEs in 2013, bringing the total cumulative number of SMEs that have benefited from government support close to 14,000. This support has taken a whole range of actions. Dubai SME helps member companies to bid for and obtain public procurement contracts. It also promotes start-ups and accompanies them in the launching and growth process. In addition, it provides specialized training in the management of specific activities, such as hospitality and retail trade and collaborates with education institutions to stimulate and instill interest in entrepreneurship early on among the youth. Dubai SME has stimulated competition among SMEs through annual contests to select the best-performing companies. It has also launched Dubai SME100, a ranking of the 100 top-performing SMEs, which are screened annually from more than 3,000 participating firms. The selected group benefits from extensive support in terms of finance, improvement of management skills, and facilitation of access to international markets.</p><h4>Dubai is moving toward realizing the Smart City initiative, which will reinvent the way business is conducted. How do you see this initiative boosting the economy in the coming years?</h4><p>Inspired by an enlightened leadership and in line with its aspirations, Dubai has indeed embarked on an ambitious Smart City initiative that will make it a leading city worldwide in terms of efficiency and friendliness of services, both public and private. DED has taken a series of measures to help achieve the initiative. It has introduced smartphone applications (apps) for various trade licensing processes, including the reservation of names, obtaining initial approval and license renewal, as well as receiving the license itself online. In addition, three types of services are provided online to consumers under an initiative called sallety or "my basket;" access to promotional offers from businesses, price information and, more importantly, filing of consumer complaints. Smartphones are also increasingly used in commercial inspections related to consumer protection and compliance with intellectual property regulation. Furthermore, DED is an active member of the network of government departments that allows unified electronic access to several government services. The benefits of the Smart City initiative to Dubai's economy are significant in many respects. First, it will enhance transparency in the provision of government services, as an increasing number of transactions and procedures as well as comprehensive information are easily accessible online. The risk of misinterpretation will be very much reduced as the system is developed further. Secondly, there will be a significant reduction in cost and time to business, which will result in lower transaction costs. Thirdly, as these benefits materialize, Dubai's international competitiveness will be boosted, which will be reflected in an improved position in international rankings such as in the World Bank's Doing Business annual report. Lastly, the initiative will have positive repercussions on the quality of life in the city in general, with smooth interaction between residents, government, and businesses.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the coming World Expo 2020 for the economy and how do you plan on capitalizing from this event?</h4><p>While Dubai is already recognized as an international hub for trade, investment, and transportation, hosting World Expo 2020 will strengthen this position in the eyes of the local business community and potential international investors. It has already sent a strong signal that Dubai has the capability and capacity to organize major undertakings as it has done for almost two decades. This psychological impact should not be overlooked. As for the direct effects, we expect higher public and private investment, especially in event-related infrastructure and other activities in the years preceding and during the Expo, to add at least 0.5-0.6 percentage points to GDP growth, which would also create more than 100,000 new jobs over the 2015-2021 period. As we expect the number of visitors to increase sharply during the event, sectors such as hospitality, restaurants, and retail trade will be major beneficiaries, in addition to transportation and logistics. On top of those significant effects that are expected for the years leading to World Expo 2020 and during the event, there will be a more lasting impact. As visitors and businesses will have a first-hand experience of staying or conducting business in Dubai, the city will get wider publicity and international focus during the six- to seven-month event, which is likely to enhance its attractiveness beyond the exhibition period.</p><h4>The Islamic economy is growing and is set to become one of Dubai's pillars in the coming year. How do you see Islamic finance and the halal segment flourishing in the near future?</h4><p>The vision for Dubai to become a global hub for the Islamic economy takes on a new dimension compared to earlier perceptions of the role of Islamic economics, which was confined mostly to Islamic banking and finance. While Islamic banking as an industry has made great strides in recent years and continues to grow at 10%-15% per annum on average, it remains only one type of activity where the potential for Islamic economics can be harnessed. In developing this new vision, the government is fully aware of the wider scope of Islamic economics and the large benefits that it can bring to the economy beyond its direct contribution to finance. Thus, this vision reflects a new approach to expand and integrate the Islamic economy into overall economic development. In addition to finance, which is by now a traditional and rapidly developing activity, a whole range of manufacturing and logistics activities and products will cater to a large international niche market, in addition to the domestic market. The government has stepped up efforts to strengthen the sharia-compliant regulatory framework, with the design of a detailed system of Islamic standards that can be applied to production, management, and, more comprehensively, governance. Thanks to its outward orientation and capacity for quick adjustment to shifts in demand, Dubai is thus poised to seize these new opportunities in a way that will not only attract new foreign and domestic players, expand economic activity, and accelerate growth, but also enhance its diversification and make it more resilient to specific external shocks. Dubai is not starting from scratch, as Islamic finance already accounts for about 3% of total GDP and roughly for one-quarter of the value-added in the financial sector. This share is expected to increase in the future for several reasons; a major drive by the government, the worldwide expansion of Islamic finance schemes based on sound ethical principles and standards that discourage speculative behavior, and more halal-conscious consumers in the region and throughout the Muslim world. While it is difficult to put numbers on the growth impact of this new ambition, a widely shared view is that it will make a difference to the size as well as the structure of Dubai's economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Push For More]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-push-for-more]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What did you witness last year regarding growth in Dubai?<br></h4><p>We are seeing a clearer view of the economic cycle that has started in Dubai over 2014. The dynamism is different from the last time I talked to TBY. The driver for that is new economic activity taking place across all sectors, and especially the same ones we are into such as services, trade, and logistics. The financial sector, too, is playing a major role, with a good comeback from the management market and the IT sector. We are also seeing the effects of the push the government made last year with the smart city economy, the Islamic economy, and the green economy. All this is complemented by strong results coming from the tourism sector. For 2020, there have been up to 25,000 new rooms announced, the majority focusing on three- and four-star hotels. This is also complementing the idea of where Dubai is shaping itself to be. I think within the global market Dubai has proven its vision strongly, with its aim of being a global player and a global service industry center. It is interesting that this new cycle is preparing the foundations for the aviation industry, which has not been a player here up till now.</p><h4>The realization of the smart city project could change the way people live and do business in the city. What is your take on the matter?</h4><p>A lot of people think that the smart city project is just about IT. However, it is about better living and sustainable living. Indeed, at least 70% is about sustainability. IT is a component of the concept and something that enablers need to get to grips with, but it is also about a wider vision that will complement the residents of Dubai. Also, it will have an effect on both newcomers and visitors alike.</p><h4>Which segment do you think will become the pillar of Dubai's Islamic economy?</h4><p>Islamic finance and halal products are the first that come to mind. However, we are also seeing a development of the tourism sector here because it fits within the new tourism strategy and it is very much needed. There are investors already in the market for halal tourism. The concept of halal is simple, but how you take it to the next level involves the whole cycle of tourism development. For example, where do you put the hotel or the theme park so you take all the marks that the tourism developer wants and still make them profitable? I think this is a working scenario that people can make money out of.</p><h4>Recent surveys show how investors coming to Dubai consider the lifestyle when making a decision. Why is this in your opinion?</h4><p>I think it is about people's demands being higher. They want that more than before. So for an executive to decide on a location, he or she is going to consider comfort. Family will also be a consideration. And I think Dubai provides everything you may need. Rather than being an industrial-based economy, we are a service-based economy, and service-based economies mean that many people will come and live here, and 70% of their income will be pumped back into that economy. For example, we received a Portuguese software company that develops software for football games online, and the company started here one year ago and decided this year that it would move its whole operation to Dubai because the programmers are young and they like the lifestyle here and want to stay.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-job-to-do]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the objective of the new office you opened in Mumbai?<br></h4><p>Within our plan to promote Dubai and trade in general, one of the activities is the opening of overseas trade offices (OTOs), including offices all around the world. Our plan from inception was to establish offices in 18 target markets. We have been successful in three so far: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and India. The Indian office was opened five years ago. It was originally based in New Delhi, but was relocated to Mumbai due to the nature of trade exchange, value, and volume between the UAE and India. India is our primary trading partner and the reverse is also the case, which makes for a mutually beneficial relationship. We believe that the office assists UAE companies in increasing their exports and trade as the first point of contact for both the newcomers and existing groups, which are generally large communities of Indian businesspeople located in the UAE. Our office will provide market and product studies for their products, as well as information on India, the origin markets of imports, and will assist in ascertaining why these products are not being sourced from the UAE. We promote services from Dubai such as IT, healthcare, and education, as well as conventional and Islamic finance. These are the main aspects to the office, in addition to which it also plays venue to regular exhibitions and conferences, and is a general resource for commercial information. Yet its most important role is to invite buyers from India, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt and introduce them to our exporters.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2014 toward opening the remainder of your 15 target markets?</h4><p>We have second-phase targets and are considering Germany as a base to cover Europe, East Africa, and Central Asian countries, such as Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.</p><h4>How do you work with the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) to promote Dubai?</h4><p>DTCM is active in promoting Dubai as a tourism hub along with its various attractions. It started a long time before we did, and has fully established approximately 18 to 20 offices around the world. We have occasionally coordinated with it, which led to the setting up of our Saudi Arabia and Egypt offices. Indeed, our office in Mumbai was also completed with its assistance.</p><h4>What partnerships are you planning for 2014?</h4><p>The Jebel Ali Free Zone, the Dubai Airport Free Zone, and Dubai World Central will hopefully become our partners this year, as their assets could help us meet our objectives. These zones are attracting investment, and we help these companies to grow, find new markets, and connect them with exhibitions and conferences. We will replicate our successes in India. Logistics, warehousing, and forwarding are important elements of promoting and facilitating trade. That is why we coordinate with Emirates SkyCargo, and why we partner with the free zones. When we enter specific countries, we take some of our key partners with us. The last time we went to Kazakhstan we took 30 companies. In Qatar we had 140 companies with us. In some missions, we only take major partners. For example, when we went to South America, we only went with the Jebel Ali Free Zone, Dubai Airport Free Zone, Dubai World Central, and Emirates Airlines.</p><h4>How will the Al Maktoum International Airport impact trade in Dubai?</h4><p>Al Maktoum International Airport will have an important effect on trade as a result of its sheer size. The site will offer strong coordination for the sea-air corridor. The port, free zone, and airport are already connected, so for anyone with a shipment going from sea to air, or vice versa, they only require one item of documentation. The speed of these processes will prove attractive for overseas and domestic businessmen alike, and this area has much potential for increasing the trade out of Dubai as a result. It will be a comprehensive trade cluster, with its Aviation City, Logistics City, and warehousing components.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategy of the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC) in promoting the development of the Islamic economy of Dubai?<br></h4><p>The DIEDC was created to implement HH Sheikh Mohammed's vision to make Dubai the global capital of the Islamic economy. This will be done by implementing a comprehensive strategy that focuses on developing seven key sectors of the Islamic economy. The role of the center itself will be that of a facilitator. We will help our stakeholders, both government and private sector entities, to implement specific projects to accelerate the development of the Islamic economy within Dubai. DIEDC will develop an enabling and empowering environment, including the necessary legislative and regulatory framework, to support the growth of the Islamic economy. The center will also keep track of and promote economic activities that are sharia compliant. The “Dubai: Capital of Islamic Economy" strategy revolves around seven key strategic pillars, in which we will position Dubai to be the global reference and economic engine of Islamic finance, and a trusted name and solutions provider for the halal industry. In addition, we will also work with stakeholders to establish Dubai as a destination of choice for family-friendly tourism, as a pioneer of the Islamic digital economy and the capital of Islamic fashion, arts, and design. The center will also be a global knowledge resource for the Islamic economy, and will aim to position Dubai as a leader in Islamic economy standards and certification as part of its strategy.</p><h4>Considering the different standards and procedures applied in different economic segments, how will you ensure greater normalization of the halal sector?</h4><p>Dialogue is critical as we try to unify standards that already exist. What is missing is consensus. When it comes to the Muslim population and the needs of Muslims, there will always be differences because of the various schools of thought. But what we can promote through Dubai is the adoption of a universally accepted set of common standards or agreements that can be the foundations for locally implemented standards.</p><h4>Focusing more on the general economy, the DIEDC has been conducting research into which segments are to be developed first as far as the Islamic economy is concerned. What were the results of this study?</h4><p>The answer lies in the seven key pillars of the “Dubai: Capital of Islamic Economy" strategy. We have identified several initiatives under each pillar, which in turn would accelerate the development of Islamic economic activities. One example is the opportunity in the takaful industry, specifically in terms of re-takaful, as this sector is under-served globally. Studies show that there are just 19 fully-fledged re-takaful companies, and on a global scale 19 companies is negligible. Therefore, there is an opportunity to create a national champion for re-takaful that is based in Dubai, and one that will provide re-takaful services and close that particular gap.</p><h4>Dubai is pushing toward more diversified growth. What do you think will be the role of the Islamic economy in the next years?</h4><p>If you look at the economic ecosystem for any given country, you are able to observe various sectors that contribute toward the development of national GDP. In Dubai, the Islamic economy will be a key sector that will contribute to the development of our broader economy. We feel the same about other jurisdictions and countries. In the Muslim world, the Islamic economy is a major contributor to the overall economy, and Islamic economic activities are becoming increasingly important in non-Muslim countries, such is the case for example with Islamic finance. Another good example of this can be found in the halal sector in Australia and New Zealand, where most of the slaughterhouses that produce meat are halal certified. The “wholesome" aspect of halal certification addresses quality of life, health, and hygiene, as well as other areas beyond simply compliance with sharia principles. This has caused broader global consumers, and suppliers in turn, to adopt such standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Noor Bank is regarded as an icon in the region in terms of innovation and quality of service. In light of your recent rebranding campaign, what have been your milestones over the past year?<br></h4><p>Noor Bank has now recorded three consecutive years of profitability. As we continue to recover, along with other banks, from the effects of the 2009 financial crash, we see significant growth across all sectors of our business. At the same time, we are delivering increased efficiencies, by innovating our business model, whilst remaining focused on the fundamentals of capital and liquidity management. In the past 12 months, we have launched two new businesses: Noor Trade, which has a focus on the important SME sector, and Noor Home, which will provide home finance for the growing number of residents and overseas buyers wanting to own a home in Dubai. Other similar initiatives are in the pipeline. We also continue to roll out our digital platforms, which are increasingly popular with customers who want the convenience of banking when and where they wish.</p><h4>How is your portfolio evolving and which segments will you be focusing on?</h4><p>Our asset base has grown from AED18 billion to AED25 billion over recent years. Our processes are maturing and our customer base is maturing with us. Our customers have stayed with us for a long time, and our relationship with them is reflected in our strong customer retention rates, our robust growth, increasing profitability, and the diversity of the organization. We have developed a new focus on the SME sector under Noor Trade. We have also introduced Noor Home, and we have plans to launch other segment-specific initiatives in the future.</p><h4>What is your opinion of Dubai becoming a global Islamic finance capital, and how do you see Noor Bank helping Dubai achieve this goal?</h4><p>Dubai is the natural home for the Capital of the Islamic Economy initiative, which is the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai. It is the birthplace of Islamic finance as we know it today. The first Islamic bank was established here. And much of the innovation in Islamic finance is being driven by the country's Islamic banks, including ourselves. But the Islamic economy is not just about finance. It is first and foremost about trade, particularly intra-OIC member state trade, which today is minimal. Dubai is ideally situated to bridge the gap between the Islamic economies of the East and the conventional economies of the West. No other city in the Middle East has the logistics infrastructure and connectivity, by air, sea, and land that Dubai has.</p><h4>From a regulatory point of view, what can be done to further accelerate the development of the Islamic economy?</h4><p>There is still much work to be done. The issue of standards is quite broad and complex. There always have been, and always will be, differences of opinion between sects and between schools of scholars. What is needed is a minimum agreement on what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. The industry needs to drive this and not leave it to the regulators. I have said before that it is the industry's responsibility to challenge the regulators, whoever they may be, with new thinking, new ideas and new products. This is as true at the local and regional level, as it is at the global level.</p><h4>How is your expansion into Turkey developing?</h4><p>We continue to be the largest provider, from the UAE, of multi-currency, Islamic syndication and capital markets solutions to Turkish institutions. In 2013 alone, we successfully executed more than $1.8 billion of Islamic syndications, sukuk, and capital market mandates to various clients in Turkey. We enjoy excellent relationships with Turkey's participation banks and have built up significant expertise in leading and arranging cross-border, multi-currency financing mandates. Turkey is and will continue to be an important international market for us. As the Turkish economy grows and the demand for corporate funding increases, I am confident Noor Bank will expand its footprint in Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the attractiveness of Dubai for dual listings?<br></h4><p>A number of foreign companies view Dubai as a platform to attract FDI because our markets are relatively open and we work globally. It is all about ease of access to the market. Many GCC-based companies want to have a dual listing on our market. This is really the purpose. It is actually driven by a strategy formed in consultation with the companies that chose Dubai Financial Market (DFM) as a secondary platform. Currently, the DFM is the listing venue for 12 foreign companies from the region, and some of them are amongst our most actively traded securities.</p><h4>What other countries are you attracting companies from?</h4><p>We mainly attract firms from this region for the time being as far as DFM is concerned. Our subsidiary, NASDAQ Dubai, was designed as a platform that the wider region would be attracted to.</p><h4>What is the impact of these two organizations?</h4><p>The DFM is mainly focusing on the UAE region and NASDAQ Dubai, which is based in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC), focuses on the wider region. NASDAQ Dubai is our international arm. It caters to the development of the DIFC as a capital market for the wider region and internationally. As the DFM and NASDAQ Dubai are separately governed by two different regulators, potential issuers on Dubai's capital markets have the flexibility of choosing the listing venue that caters to their strategy and preferences when it comes to free float limits, valuations, and so on.</p><h4>What is the net impact of these exchanges?</h4><p>The two exchanges are functioning in harmony within one trading platform and liquidity pool. Both of them have been performing well as far as growth is concerned. With its general index up more than 107% in 2013, the DFM was the second best-performing market globally. The same applies also in terms of velocity and liquidity as the DFM's total trading value jumped 229.1% in 2013 to AED159.9 billion and the daily trading average increased 231.8% to AED642.1 million. It is one of the top markets for liquidity. Meanwhile, the FTSE NASDAQ Dubai UAE 20 index has also performed well, rising 87% in 2013. We are experiencing solid internal performance and growth.</p><h4>What is behind the strength of the banking sector in the UAE?</h4><p>After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, government policy was highly prudent. It took steps in the financial sector, whether it was the federal government or the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) providing sufficient financing and liquidity requirements for banks. The banks already had sufficient capital adequacy ratios and were maintaining them, but with further support from the CBUAE, and the injection of liquidity, the sector is even more secure. Of course, with the revival of the real estate sector, which was a relatively big exposure, the banks have strengthened their balance sheets and asset portfolios. Over the last five years, banks were really prudent in terms of having sufficient provisions for what would have been expected to be bad loans. They have cleaned their balance sheets and that is why you'll see a solid performance from the banking sector, as in 2013. Most of the banks registered growth of anywhere between 20% and 30% in 2013. I expect that with a revival in the real estate sector, enough provisioning, and the support of the government and central bank, the banks will continue to perform well in the post-global crisis era.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which key characteristics of NASDAQ Dubai make it an attractive platform for companies and investors?<br></h4><p>If you look at the global financial markets, you will see international, regional, and local investors. They are all important for a company. Regional and local investors can get to know your brand, they can track your performance and products, and they can physically approach you. On the other hand, there are a number of points in favor of international investors. They bring long-term investment and often a more sophisticated approach to your company. It's healthy if you can attract all investor types. In the Middle East, some companies have gone outside the region for an international listing, and, therefore, missed out on regional and local investors who have in turn been deprived of the opportunity to buy their shares. Other companies have listed in the region and perhaps not gained as much international investment as they hoped for. The unique platform we have created at NASDAQ Dubai provides connectivity to investors everywhere, and we are delighted that potential issuers are increasingly seeing the advantage of this.</p><h4>How do you help companies to make a success of being listed with NASDAQ Dubai?</h4><p>We take an active interest in the companies and work closely with them. The listing journey consists of three important stages: preparation; the act of listing, when trading begins; and then the ongoing relationship. We ensure that a company fully understands in advance how the platform works and encourage it to ensure its governance is in good order and that it is ready to communicate effectively with investors. I believe that we've been very successful in that respect. It often takes companies months to prepare to go public. We make sure that they are not alone. Advisors are with them during the pre-listing phase, and we're by their side throughout the whole listing process. We also work with these companies to ensure that they benefit from our platform for visibility purposes after listing. It is important for companies to be visible, to be seen as credible, and that anyone can access information about them and be able to assess their prospects.</p><h4>What are the key aspects of NASDAQ Dubai's role in Islamic finance?</h4><p>Within Islamic finance, one of the main sectors is sukuk. The UAE has been among the leading countries in terms of sukuk issuances and, when it comes to US dollar-denominated sukuk, we are the main market. Given this credibility and track record, Dubai set a goal to become the global center of sukuk. In the last year and a half, NASDAQ Dubai has attracted $15 billion worth of sukuk, and we are now the world's third-largest exchange for sukuk listings, with total value of more than $18 billion. A major reason for building critical mass in sukuk listings is that we are interested in creating liquidity through our innovative fixed-income trading platform. This is a pilot scheme that allows sukuks and bonds to be traded on-exchange. It is one of only a few markets that gives institutional investors a choice of whether they'd like to trade sukuk conventionally over the counter, or whether they'd like to do it on the exchange. In future, we will consider opening the doors to individual investors as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE insurance market can appear saturated from the outside. How is MetLife approaching the market in view of the competition?<br></h4><p>There are over 60 companies in the sector, making for pronounced competition for such a small market. Yet, given persisting low penetration levels, this still stands out as an emerging market from an insurance standpoint, which in turn means that it has significant potential for continued growth and development. Among those 60 companies, there are some major players of international standing and smaller players that operate in niche segments. Generally speaking, we believe competition is healthy, because it affords the consumer options, and companies need to be on top of their game and offer the kind of service that will prevent customers from opting for the services of rivals. However, there is also something to be said for having strong, well-capitalized companies of a certain size that can continue to innovate. We have been in this market for over 50 years, and we have a long tradition and history here. We have seen this market grow and evolve over the years. We like to think that we've played an important part in that evolution. We have a diversified business, in terms of both products and distribution channels. Those are some of the characteristics that distinguish us from other competitors here in the UAE.</p><h4>There is a new regulation that requires mandatory health insurance for all workers in Dubai. How will this impact your business?</h4><p>The mandatory healthcare reform is a positive development, providing valuable and much-needed coverage for workers here in Dubai. It will be phased in over the next couple of years, but it is hard yet to predict its likely impact on the market and on our own business.</p><h4>Which institutions do you work with closely in UAE?</h4><p>We work with various institutions including the UAE Insurance Authority, Dubai Health Authority (DHA), and the Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD) and engage with the regulators to exchange ideas and best practices based on our experiences. We are also major players in the employee benefits field, providing life and medical insurance coverage to many companies here in the UAE. MetLife also works with employers to determine what some of the most important aspects of the decision will be for them.</p><h4>The UAE Insurance Authority is also working on regulations regarding capital adequacy ratios. What effect will this have on the insurance sector in the UAE?</h4><p>The industry should have well-capitalized and financially strong companies. This will help build trust from a consumer perspective, and we think the regulatory authorities' engagement and involvement in this area will be helpful to the industry. We believe that the local market still has room for growth and development. More structured and developed growth is better for business. To make that happen, we need to gradually increase the level of insurance awareness, and part of that is making sure there is trust in the financial standing of the industry as a whole, and in individual companies. This is definitely a step in the right direction.</p><h4>MetLife also signed an agreement with Citi to establish a distribution plan for 2025. What is your plan for the Middle East in 2015 and beyond?</h4><p>We already had an agreement with Citi to distribute credit-linked products, which was a global agreement of widespread coverage. That agreement was due to expire in 2015; therefore, we have agreed to a 10-year extension to this agreement with Citi, as well as a series of enhancements, especially on the product front. As stated in a January 2014 press release, MetLife and Citi are pioneering the type of partnership required today to ensure that consumer needs are met in a consistent way, and providing enhanced value, products, and services to our clients. Those elements are all present in this agreement, and we are pleased to be able to work with Citi in this area going forward.</p><h4>How do you get the feedback you need from your customers to be able to provide better products and services?</h4><p>Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President, and CEO of MetLife, identified a customer-centric focus as the key to achieving a long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Competitors can copy products and technology, but becoming a truly customer-centric organization takes years to achieve and is difficult to replicate. To achieve this, we have embarked on a major transformation in every aspect of the way we do business starting with the way we design our services and products. Part of the process is listening to what our customers are saying. To do that, we have measures that include what we call a Net Promoter Score, which allows us to survey customers, gaining feedback on how they view our products and services and our engagement with them. We measure that and use it as a baseline, embarking on activities that are intended to improve on that baseline, and then measure again, in a continuing process so as to ensure that we are making progress in different customer touch points. That is one of our major initiatives, not just in the UAE, but also across the world.</p><h4>MetLife Alico is rebranding to become simply MetLife. What is the strategy behind this brand change?</h4><p>One of the ways we run our business is to focus on what we call One MetLife, making sure that there is connectivity across the organization, even in a region as diverse as the Middle East. When MetLife acquired Alico, MetLife understood the value of the Alico brand, and it was important to preserve that value for a period of time at least, which is why we initially branded as MetLife Alico. As MetLife brand awareness has become stronger and more widespread, the aim is to move to a single brand, which is in keeping with the One MetLife approach. This proved highly motivational for our employees and associates, and also helped us to determine how to position ourselves in various markets. We have already moved to the single MetLife brand in many countries across EMEA region, and we are getting ready to implement in other markets like the UAE where we currently have the MetLife Alico brand. This will be a central focus for us in 2014.</p><h4>You already have an agreement for takaful in Malaysia. What is your strategy in that regard in the UAE and the Middle East?</h4><p>The Asia region has recently announced a joint venture in Malaysia that covers both conventional insurance and takaful, in partnership with a leading Malaysian bank. For us here in the Middle East, we continue to look at takaful as a potential opportunity. There are regulatory aspects that one has to take into consideration when assessing this business. We had partnerships in the past with certain local takaful providers bringing expertise, and we provided knowledge on the product and a distribution front. We may well continue with this strategy. Takaful is a developed business in Malaysia, whereas it remains a nascent business here in the Middle East, meaning there is the potential for rapid expansion and growth in the segment.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How well developed is Dubai in terms of corporate governance standards?<br></h4><p>A lot of work has been done on awareness and getting companies to understand what corporate governance is about. It's been important to educate the market that corporate governance is not just a bunch of controls, processes, and audits. It's not a box-ticking exercise, but is good for helping a business become more sustainable and efficient. And so, what we're finding these days is that companies are more focused on the implementation of corporate governance than corporate governance awareness.</p><h4>How are UAE banks applying corporate governance specifically?</h4><p>The focus seems more and more on implementation rather than just awareness. I see a big difference and a major improvement from a few years ago. But we're certainly not where the end goal should be—implementation is not where it ultimately needs to be. I think when it comes to banks, the central bank and the regulators play a very important role. The financial crisis has certainly shown us that in no uncertain terms. The banking sector is absolutely crucial and it's not just about the central banks and the regulators, it's also about how these banks are managed, how they're run, and how corporate governance is applied primarily in the board rooms. We believe that board members of banks play a crucial role and should go through corporate governance training, awareness, and risk workshops.</p><h4>The 2013 Hawkamah Bank Corporate Governance Award was awarded to the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD). What is the significance of the awards?</h4><p>The awards were launched in 2007 and the aim is really to recognize, support, and encourage governance practices in the banking sector. There's an independent jury of international corporate governance banking experts that basically assess each applicant against five areas of corporate governance, which cover commitment to good corporate governance, structure and functioning of the boards, the control environment and processes, disclosure and transparency, and shareholder rights. They conduct one-on-one interviews, encouraging and pushing financial institutions toward better corporate governance. This is leading in a good direction because it is good for the sector and for society.</p><h4>The Hawkamah Institute aims to guide family business owners in instituting good corporate governance. How are family-owned business acquiring this knowledge and improving their corporate governance?</h4><p>The majority of companies in this region are family-owned businesses. There's an interesting statistic that I always remember; 95% of family-owned businesses do not survive to the third generation. That clearly says something and we think that corporate governance and what it introduces is a major tool to help these companies survive. Family businesses are important and they're a bit more complex because of family elements; when you're moving to the next generation, it becomes a little bit more difficult. By the time you're in the third generation, where a lot of these businesses are at now, it becomes even more difficult. You get a mix of three generations and professional non-family members running what today have become conglomerates. Some family groups in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait are huge conglomerates now; it's no longer a one-man shop. We're finding that we're often being asked to provide workshops on corporate governance awareness and the functioning of boardrooms, helping families overcome challenges. The UAE is already on the corporate governance journey and it has come a long way in the last 10 years. It's now more about implementation and making a push in specific sectors, with a special focus on banks. In Malaysia, for example, it became law that every single board member of a bank has to go through corporate governance and director development training.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Dubai Courts improved over the years?<br></h4><p>Since the beginning of 2006, Dubai Courts has moved swiftly in developing various aspects of its internal arrangements, as well as improving the standard of its services. Internally, there was a revision for procedures and structures. They were developed simultaneously with the strategic plan, which lead us to achieve our annual goals and objectives.</p><h4>One of the aims of Dubai Courts is to raise competitiveness in law schools. How are you achieving this?</h4><p>We support the initiatives of law schools by introducing programs that help to bridge theory and practice, as well as introduce the reality of our work here. We staged the first regional judicial court that gives students the opportunity to pit their wits against each other in a mock trial conducted in front of a panel of real judges. This is only one of many programs that we run at Dubai Courts for students of law schools. Additionally, we arrange research competitions for law students to encourage legal research in law departments.</p><h4>Could you name other programs that you have launched, or are participating in?</h4><p>On-the-job training is facilitated and secured for students from all law schools in the UAE according to their demands, and is considered a social responsibility. We always keep these issues in mind and seek to satisfy the needs of law schools.</p><h4>What is Dubai Courts' approach toward social responsibility?</h4><p>An example of this is that the pro bono programs designed in cooperation with advocates and law firms in Dubai. We provide litigants free consultation by our lawyers. We design projects where we list those advocates who volunteer for the program. We coordinate and facilitate the lawyers' advice for the litigants. This attempt was very well received. Also, there are so many other programs associated with the national interests and events in general. In different seasons we have different programs, for example in Ramadan we arrange different events for the community.</p><h4>How consistent is the legal system in supporting businesses in Dubai?</h4><p>We have published our report annually since 2006. The report clearly shows our very high performance in handling cases in terms of speed and accuracy. The most important elements and message to be sent to our business community here in Dubai is the degree of transparency at Dubai Courts. The quality of our services is evidence of the standard of our systems here. We have also, of course, adopted high-end technology, which is rather uncommon internationally. We hosted an international conference in Dubai with judicial personnel from all over the world, attended by practices from around 50 countries. It inspires confidence in our community to have a trusted judicial system in Dubai.</p><h4>What conclusions did you draw from the international conferences?</h4><p>Many lessons, practices, and thoughts were shared and exchanged with the representatives of different countries. We compared our way of operating against those of others, which is always a useful practice. We had the opportunity to see the challenges faced and achievements made by other courts. Meanwhile, we demonstrated the sophistication of our own systems, the latest technology, and the implementation of administrative and improved management systems. For eight years, we have operated an excellence program, which is envied worldwide.</p><h4>What are the main differences between Dubai Courts and the DIFC Courts?</h4><p>We share the same mission for Dubai, and both entities provide judicial services in Dubai within certain jurisdictions determined by administration in Dubai. We work together to ensure that their judgments are enforced in Dubai. We have a broader remit and range of specialties. The DIFC Courts mainly hear commercial and non-criminal cases.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 2013, what have been the major developments in terms of trends and economic developments that you have witnessed?<br></h4><p>Dubai, as you know, has transformed, leaving its difficult years behind. The Expo 2020 win for Dubai is a significant milestone, and this will definitely translate into exponential growth across a wide array of sectors, namely hospitality, tourism, trade, shipping/logistics, and real estate. It was a catalyst for a further bright outlook for the jurisdiction. Attracting international investors has been an integral part of the economic development strategy here. Dubai has created an ideal real estate investment environment, which draws scores of investors worldwide. It is a fantastically strategic location and has a world-class infrastructure and service sector. It has got political and economic stability, an open and free economic system, and its e-commerce on realty is phenomenal.</p><h4>It has been said that SMEs will become the backbone of the economy of the UAE, especially in light of the coming Expo 2020. What is your view about the subject?</h4><p>While optimism runs high across the whole of the economy, it is particularly high among SMEs, as was reflected in the 1Q2014 business survey conducted by the Department of Economic Development. Economic activity in Dubai is on firmer ground now, especially in key sectors such as tourism and aviation. It is also flourishing in real estate, which is really on a swift recovery path. The services and retail sectors are also signaling strong growth, which reaffirms Dubai's reputation as a vibrant economy. Rising confidence among SMEs shows that the combined efforts of the government and the private sector to achieve sustainable economic development are producing the desired outcomes. In any developing jurisdiction, SMEs are the most important component, and Dubai is no different.</p><h4>Which segments of the economy would you say are ripe for investment?</h4><p>Real estate and tourism are at the fore. Once there is  growth, it continues to self-replicate. We have hypermarkets and supermarkets, but we are yet to see a quality discount store. This jurisdiction, along with its neighboring jurisdictions, will provide quality discounts, which will then provide economic benefits as that will allow people to have more funds to spend on other products and services. Efficiency is the key word. And competition is always good.</p><h4>What are your plans for the future, and what roles do you think you will be playing in the development of the economy?</h4><p>There have to be checks and balances, and that is where we come in. Our mission is to help our clients by implementing a professional and individualistic approach. The work ethic at the firm is based on hard work, honesty, and trust. The firm has grown to its current position through organic growth. The success of the firm's growth has always been the importance of our commitment to treating clients as individuals. We may grow in size and stature, but the personal relationship between the principals and our clients remains paramount. Our approach to professional development is that learning and personal improvement are extremely relevant to all our employees. This is another reason why we are sustaining our importance in the community; we put a great deal of effort into educating our colleagues. We are one of the few to have received a Platinum Approved Employer award by the ACCA on training. One of the most important aspects about Merali's is we do not compromise on quality. Business here could have gone to any of the big four, but companies and individuals feel confident working with us. Birds of a feather flock together. That is why we have such a good team.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of the Mag Group?<br></h4><p>The Mag Group got its start in 1978 in the commercial sector, but has expanded to include over 50 companies working across a multitude of segments, including industrial, commercial, services, freight, hospitality, contracting and engineering, and real estate. Today, we have over 2,000 personnel and a presence in almost every country in the world.</p><h4>Mag Group recently entered the Guinness World Records for the largest automated parking facility. Could you elaborate on this project?</h4><p>Our automated parking solutions were developed by one of our group companies, namely Mag Royal Solutions (MRS). It's a system that allows vehicles to be parked and stored without human intervention. It is a sophisticated European and American engineering innovation that helps us overcome hurdles when developing projects. The technique MRS developed also encouraged us to commit to creating the largest automated parking system in the world, and achieving that Guinness World Record was a real motivator. With it, many doors were opened in terms of both local and international projects. The technique is especially useful in older cities that struggle with parking capacity. Deploying smart parking undoubtedly improves mobility, adding a new service that reduces congestion and that driver's bugbear of cruising around for a parking space.</p><h4>Mag Group is planning investment of approximately AED15 billion in the real estate sector in Dubai. What impact will this investment have on the economy, and how is Expo 2020 fitting into your future investment plans?</h4><p>Expo 2020 has helped to shape Mag Group's vision and strategy leading up to the big year. Our agenda is to execute and invest, and we hope to continue contributing to the growth of the economy in Dubai. We'd like to play a part in pushing Dubai further. In terms of projects, we're building a 45-story residential tower in the City of Arabia zone at Dubailand, which is a huge project that will take three years to complete. We're also working on a $50 million lubricant plant at Jebel Ali, which will be complete later in 2014. Meanwhile, we're working on a residential tower at Jumeirah Village, which will be complete in two years. In the short term, we also have plans to take steps in the health sector, and will be opening a clinic that may then be developed into a hospital here in Dubai.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the hospitality segment in the lead up to Expo 2020, when record numbers of guests are expected to descend on the Emirate?</h4><p>The government in Dubai is encouraging the construction of four-star hotels in order to cope with the influx. That is why we are looking for the right locations to develop hotels in the four-star category. The government is providing incentives to develop this segment of the hospitality industry, and we want to take advantage of the facilities on offer.</p><h4>Following the real estate crash, is Dubai's new regulatory framework sufficient to prevent a repeat?</h4><p>We observed the crisis without actually experiencing it thanks to our inherently conservative business strategy and portfolio. Meanwhile, the new regulatory framework appears to be a conservative action plan designed to simply prevent another crash. It certainly is the right policy to build walls that prevent a repeat of the crisis, and will be crucial going forward in curbing the effects of an unorganized sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Haji Saeed Lootah, the founder of Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB), in November 2013 received the EFICA Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in developing the Islamic banking sector. How significant was this for DIB?<br></h4><p>Clearly, this is a huge honor for us and a testament to our belief in DIB and the principles that it was founded on way back in 1975. Established as the first fully-fledged Islamic bank in the world nearly four decades ago, we are globally acknowledged as pioneers in the field of Islamic finance. This award further emphasizes the seriousness and commitment of the industry leaders of the country to this fast growing sector in the financial industry. The awarding of the bank's founder to me reiterates that industry experts have acknowledged the importance of Islamic finance, the contribution of DIB, and the role of the man himself. We are a cornerstone of the UAE economy, and will continue to use our expertise and financial strength to further the development and progress of this great nation.</p><h4>In your opinion, what is the current state of the Islamic finance industry?</h4><p>Islamic finance is now a clearly established and globally acknowledged phenomenon. The progression over the last four decades, since the inception of DIB, has been massive. Many, including Western countries, seriously believe that this sector offers a more plausible alternative to the age-old conventional model of finance. No wonder then that Islamic finance and banking in the UAE has been growing at nearly double the pace of the conventional sector over the last few years. That said, there is still some progress to be made, particularly in the field of innovation around products and offerings. Liquidity management solutions, factoring, and receivables financing including distributor and supplier finance are typical examples of where Islamic finance can play a major role once quality structures are established in these areas. Further tightening of risk management processes and enhancing operational efficiencies will also go a long way in building a long-term and sustainable model. There are roughly 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, which is significant. Meanwhile, the sector boasts assets of around $1.5 trillion. That represents just 1% roughly of the total global market, which means that we have just scratched the tip of the iceberg. However, trend analysis over the past two decades suggests a CAGR of 20%. Now one might argue that the denominator is small, and hence double-digit growth easy to achieve, but clearly there is growth, which is sustainable.</p><h4>DIB has signed a partnership with global human resource consultancy Aon Hewitt. How will this partnership improve your staff?</h4><p>While customers are at the center of everything we do, we also realize that investment in human capital is crucial for any organization, and not just ours. And, clearly, a partnership with Aon Hewitt actually allows us to bring best practices to the forefront within the human resource arena. The aim of this alliance is to not just review staff remuneration and compensation, but also to identify best fit and talent to support DIB's strategic agenda over the medium term.</p><h4>What role has the bank played in the overall development of the economy?</h4><p>DIB has been synonymous with the growth of Dubai and the UAE. As we positioned Islamic finance to be a key component the financial sector in the country, we engaged with the stakeholders across the market, including the government, and using our expertise and heritage, concluded some of the largest and most landmark deals in the history of Islamic finance. Some of these included huge debt capital market transactions around fund raising for infrastructure development, airports, ports and shipping, and airlines and aviation. That said, we have not forgotten the backbone of the UAE economy, which is trade and built around the large SME segment in the country. Contrary to popular belief, the UAE's business world is actually 85% composed of SMEs. We have established comprehensive solutions for this sector, catering specifically to their liquidity management needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Smart Fiscal Planning (SFP) program help the Department of Finance (DOF) to run the government more efficiently, achieve fiscal sustainability, and support the government's economic strategy?<br></h4><p>The SFP program will help to ensure that public expenditure is affordable and sustainable in the medium term and that public resources are allocated efficiently and used more effectively by introducing the best international practices in public finance management reform, adapted to the reality and environment of Dubai. Among the main objectives of the SFP is to ensure that public expenditure is affordable and directed at providing public goods and services and creating investments in infrastructure, with economic, social, and environmental benefits that will add to the economic and social wellbeing of the people. It's also crucial that fiscal resources are used to produce results and benefits as intended by governments. The DOF embarked on the SFP program by leading a transformation of Dubai's fiscal management from an input-based framework, focusing on line-budget items and on monitoring where money has been spent as approved in the budget, transforming the system into a performance-based budget framework whereby the benefits or impacts of public goods produced and services delivered will become determinants of fiscal resource uses.</p><h4>Dubai doubled its real estate transaction fee to 4% in an effort to make speculation harder. What is your outlook now?</h4><p>The first objective of this step was to shore up the real estate market and reduce property speculation to contribute to the stability of the market and limit prices rises. In the future, Dubai will revise the ratio to control real estate prices through benchmarking with other countries on the same matter.</p><h4>The IMF has repeatedly warned that another property bubble may form in Dubai if the authorities are not careful. What new regulations can we expect in the real state sector?</h4><p>The current demand in the Dubai property market is more driven by the improved economy and increased population rather than speculation. RERA and the Dubai Land Department (DLD) have introduced several laws and regulations to provide the necessary standards to supplement the real estate sector. The government, in its effort to control the real estate market, doubled the property registration fee from 2% to 4% with the DLD in October 2013 to control speculation. The Dubai government issued Decree No. 43 of 2013 concerning the percentages for maximum property rent increases that are allowed upon the renewal of tenancy contracts. The decree states that there should not be any rent increase if the rent of the property unit is less than 10% of the average rent of a similar property in the same residential area. In November 2013, the government issued Decree No. 26 of 2013 and gave judicial powers to the Rental Dispute Settlement Centre, which was functioning under Dubai Municipality earlier. This center will be based at DLD and act as the unified committee and judge on all rental lawsuits in the Emirate within a period not exceeding 30 days from the date of referral of a case to them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Western Union has offices in Dubai and in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific?<br></h4><p>In terms of the infrastructure, opportunities, and talent you can hire and recruit to serve your interests as a company, Dubai makes sense for Western Union. A more difficult question to answer would be, “why not Dubai?" Given all that Dubai has to offer, it was tough to choose any other city. I would like to thank Dubai as a city and a leader as it has always given us the opportunity to do business and we have always had its support. I must commend the authorities here on how business friendly it is in Dubai.</p><h4>How do you see the growth of the remittance business in the UAE, and how can your company boost it?</h4><p>You cannot talk about remittances without talking about migration and migration influx. I have lived in Dubai for 14 years and I have seen the city move through so many phases, but always moving forward in terms of population, number of migrants, and variety of ethnicities and communities. It is mindboggling when you look around and you see how many nationalities have been attracted by Dubai to make this their home. All of these people are going to be in need of a money transfer at one point and will be part of the remittance industry. When you think about remittances, you need to think about the people who leave their home countries to come and work to build up the infrastructure and services of a host country while also helping their loved ones back at home. We have seen a lot of migration occurring between Africa and Europe and between South Asia and the US, but what you see in Dubai are migrants who are attracted to the lifestyle that Dubai offers, and the scope is very wide-ranging from blue collar to white collar employees. Most of us are migrants here today and we will have the need to conduct a money transfer at one point in time, whether that means sending money back to your family, your loved ones, or to help a friend. I can tell you that the remittance industry is here to stay and here to grow.</p><h4>What are the new areas that you will be targeting in the region in the coming years?</h4><p>What HH Sheikh Mohammed, the rulers of the UAE, and the rulers of Dubai have begun to do is take everything into the “e" for “electronic," through programs such as e-gate and e-government. The remittance business is moving into the digital space as well. This does not mean that tomorrow we are going to stop sending money in cash, but we are giving customers the opportunity to decide which channels they wish to use. Today, from behind your desk, you can access your bank account, debit a certain amount, and send it through Western Union. In the past you were not able to do that. Suddenly, your bank account is connected to 500,000 Western Union agent locations around the world in 200 different countries and territories—in just minutes. With government initiatives, Dubai as a leader and pioneer is at the forefront of technology. Remittances are no exception. The UAE government is putting effort and investment behind the remittance industry to provide customers with more choice and control. Western Union will be on that train before it even leaves the station.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In recent decades, the UAE has become a recognized leader regionally, and across the wider Middle East. The great progress of our cities is admired worldwide and held as a model for pro-active vision. This year, in particular, has seen the nation take significant steps forward on the path to playing a major role beyond the MENA region, in the global economy and society. In taking a leadership role across several frontiers, the UAE has remained true to its aspirations since the establishment of the Federation by our Founder President, the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The leadership and directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, continue to inspire the nation to look beyond the immediate to paint a canvas of exhilarating possibilities. Needless to say, much of the country's achievement must be attributed to the energy, creativity, courage, and commitment of our people—all of which have propelled us into a new era that will script new pages in our history books, of new beginnings.</p><p>It is the extraordinary and collective efforts of our people that have contributed to Dubai's success in being awarded the Expo 2020 this year by the 168-country members of the Bureau of International Expositions in Paris. Expo 2020 will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the UAE. Our theme for Expo 2020—Connecting Minds, Creating the Future—concisely sums up the UAE's strategic objectives as a country, and our positive contributions to the people of the world. Dubai took another bold step in declaring its intent to shape the Emirate as the “global capital" of Islamic industry, economy, and finance. A date has been set to achieve this intent—three years from now. And, to help translate the aspiration by 2018, the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC) has been created with a mandate to guide partnerships between public and private sector entities engaged in this key domain. Even as we dream big, we remain cautious. We continue to adopt a prudent approach with regards to fiscal policies in our priority to ensure a secure tomorrow for the UAE's people. In our determination to excel today and in our ambition to carry the success of our efforts well into the future, we are aware that we need to empower future generations with the skill, will, and motivation to perform. Guided by this conviction, we are working to build the best functional government and enabling education system befitting a 21st century destination country. As part of this priority, the UAE has announced its participation in the launch of a space expedition to Mars. We are indeed proud that we are the first Arab country to join a select group of eight other countries in the important scientific exploration of interplanetary space. Our unrivaled efforts towards technological advancement resulted in the launch of a two-year Smart Government Initiative earlier this year. The program has been designed to facilitate interaction with government offices through simplified applications on smart phones and tablet devices. Through m-Government, we now reach our people instead of their having to reach us, making their lives easier. With programs going back more than a decade, the UAE is currently ranked number one in the MENA region and second in the world in the Government Usage of ICT Index, released by the World Economic Forum. From being ranked the happiest country in the Arab world and securing 14th place, ahead of the US, Germany, and the UK according to a recent United Nations report to enhancing our record of sustainable initiatives and transparency, the country is today poised on a growth trajectory that is anticipated to attract more distinctions and stun the world. The run-up to the Dubai Expo 2020, and the ambitious strategic plans unveiled by individual emirates, as well as the Federation at large are certain to help the UAE repeat a feat that we have routinely accomplished throughout our illustrious history—to be the best.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of the Howard Johnson International Call Center in 2007?</h4><p>We are the first private call center in Mozambique, and even though we started the company in 2007 our operations began in 2008. At that time we were focusing on the US and British market, because that is where call center business demand was. Some partners invited us to start the business and enter the market. In 2009 we found out that we needed to make adjustments, because language was a problem. Our agents could not meet the expectations of our clients. We were doing inbound and outbound projects at the time. And while our outbound services were going pretty well, our inbound and customer-care lines were a problem, because people called and started asking questions. In response, we decided to close our doors for the rest of 2009 and 2010 and rebuild the business. We started to look at the Mozambique market. In mid-2010 we started to talk to companies here rather than deal with the international market, at least temporarily. That is when we started talking to utility companies and tried to draft cooperative business plans for call centers. We approached businesses that already had in-house call centers. It was a little difficult to convince them that outsourcing was a good idea, because they were concerned about confidentiality. We did consultations with some to build their own in-house call centers, and others gave us small projects. By the end of 2010 we knew we were on the right track and could grow the business. From that point on, we have been increasing the services we offer in outsourcing customer care solutions.</p><h4>What new services are you planning to provide in the future?</h4><p>In 2013 we were nominated for the prize of best SME in Mozambique, an initiative co-organized by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. That was an incentive for us to think about other operations we could undertake. When we had our board meeting in 2013, we drafted ideas for new services. On that list, some services were already in demand by our clients, while others were lacking in the market. One was debt collection. Banks were also an important part of our customer portfolio. We wanted them to outsource their customer care lines. However, most of them refused and asked rather that we help them improve their in-house service because of the sensitivity of their data. These banks then started asking what other services we could provide for them. They wanted us to sell banking services to their clients, such as credit cards, which can be undertaken without giving out sensitive data. Other kinds of financial offerings were house and car loans. Next, the banks wanted debt collection, and the tracking of people who were not paying their loans. We drafted the whole raft of products and services to cover this need. For these services, we tried to work with internationally known companies. They provided the know-how, which we were able to pass on to our customers. In addition to debt collection, we also started a documents management and archiving service. Since we were already doing data processing, our company helped some of our mobile operator customers to process data, such as the registration of SIM cards. When we first rolled out these programs, we were working with paper for 4 million customers, and they now want us to manage all of their papers—about 25 million for one company alone. We decided to develop in this area, because the whole market, even the public sector, needs it. We ended up adding to our portfolio of services: debt collection, documents management and archiving, sms services, and CC equipment supply and installation. We also decided we would create our own products and services for telemarketing. As a result of our efforts, in 2014 we were awarded with the International Star for Quality, a recognition for excellence and success made by the Business Initiative Direction to professionals and business leaders from around the world.</p><h4>How would you describe the profile of your clients?</h4><p>Most of them are large corporations from Mozambique. In 2015-2016 we hope to re-enter the international market. For that we will start with Portuguese-speaking companies and go from there. Our agents are familiar with this market and can control the services from our end. To move to other countries, we will have to do some research and development. Finance, ICT, insurance, and utilities corporations currently make up the bulk of our clientele.</p><h4>How would you describe the environment in Mozambique for start-up companies such as yours?</h4><p>The environment here is good. There is a lot of encouragement from the government, especially for small companies. There are also many large corporations and investments coming into the country right now. Policies are well drafted and there are incentives that make us want to explore new areas of growth. Once you are in the game, however, you start facing some problems, especially where taxes are concerned. Navigating the country's tax code is a challenge. There are two more challenges in the market. One is regarding HR, especially for a business like ours. In short, this part of management is not developed here. If we had assistance from the government, that would help. In our case we had to go abroad to find someone who really understood call centers, to bring in know-how that does not yet exist here. Another challenge is the ICT environment. There are a lot of investments that we need to make, such as new equipment. Our market does not yet offer this, so we have to go abroad.</p><h4>How would assess the outsourcing market in Mozambique?</h4><p>Large companies are starting to understand that they need our services, and how beneficial they are. Others are not there yet. These businesses want us to help them implement call center services in-house. They are really looking for consultancy services. Often, once we start consulting them, these companies realize that outsourcing is a better solution. Our approach is working, and our operations will continue to grow.</p><h4>What is your vision for the company in 10 years?</h4><p>Our plan is to have 5,000 seats. We only have 48 now. In the near future, we will increase to 200, which is our current capacity. We plan to increase to 2,000 in two years, if the market allows, and to 5,000 in 10 years. For our main service, call centers, the plan is to go abroad again. We are also trying to follow best international practices in order to make us competitive abroad. We will start with Portuguese-speaking countries, and concentrate on back-office activities. There is a lot of work to be done with back-office services, which require language expertise.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dominican Republic is one of the fastest growing economies in the region, with a constant GDP growth average of 5.5% over the past 20 years. What is your medium term outlook for the economy and for 2015?</h4><p>The macroeconomic framework developed by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development serves as the economic policy guideline for the short and medium term, and forecasts growth for the 2015-2018 period at around the potential economic growth of the country, namely 5%. This potential growth considers the projected demographic trends of the country, as well as investment growth and productivity similar to that presented over the past decade.</p><h4>One of the sectors enjoying robust growth is tourism. In 2013 the country hosted 4.7 million visitors. Since 1980, the first year that the Central Bank reported tourism statistics, related revenues have risen from barely $172 million to $5 billion in 2013. Which sectors of the Dominican economy, besides tourism, hold the most potential for development?</h4><p>One sector of remarkable growth is mining, which grew by 20% in 1H2014 as compared to 2013. Growth in this sector is mostly a result of the commencement of operations of mining company Barrick Gold. Additionally, this administration has emphasized developing MSMEs, for which were allocated resources and efforts and to formalize and develop the companies of this nature. The government developed a comprehensive plan that covers the promotion of formalization, market access for MSMEs, financial development, business development, and the promotion of entrepreneurship. On the other hand, we have made progress in the agricultural sector because of a series of actions and policies implemented and promoted by the State, through the Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FEDA), with the aim of boosting agricultural production, encouraging and expanding exports of agricultural goods, and increasing food security for the population. Within these measures we can highlight the support for land preparation services and technical assistance to producers, in addition to financial support through increased financing tools and channels, something that is reflected by the disbursements of the Agricultural Bank, which grew by 6.5% in September 2014.</p><h4>How far has the Dominican Republic gone with its National Development Strategy 2010-2030? Which of its goals have been achieved, and what are the main challenges the government is facing in its implementation?</h4><p>In general, two years after the promulgation of the Law on National Development Strategy 2030, we have achieved at least one measure of policy in almost 45% of all proposed lines of action. During the first year, we put great emphasis on preparing regulations to implement the strategy and interagency coordination. Following this, we proceeded to meet the proposed lines of action for which policy measures were adopted to achieve the following objectives. These featured participatory democracy and responsible citizenship, the rule of law, and public safety, health, and universal social security, macroeconomic drivers, competitiveness and innovation, a sector and territory-integrated production structure, and adequate adaptation to climatic change. In general, one of the main challenges facing the National Development Strategy was the continuity of efforts, without pause, to implement policy to achieve the outlined objectives.</p><div class="quote">“One sector of remarkable growth is mining, which grew by 20% in 1H2014."</div><h4>What are the main advantages of the Dominican Republic as an FDI destination, what is the government's strategy to boost its flow, and what would be your message to potential investors seeking opportunities in the Caribbean?</h4><p>Much of the government's strategy to stimulate FDI has been supported in the process of comprehensively institutionalizing the country, and having the required institutions in operation to create a favorable business climate for FDI. Some of the initiatives and goals of the administration are to realize the outlined fiscal consolidation process in pursuit of a substantial reduction in the primary deficit, the implementation of prudent and stable macroeconomic policies that prevent abrupt fluctuations, greater transparency of government operations, a state law reaffirming legal certainty, and pro-competition legislation.</p><h4>What are the main advantages of the free trade agreements (FTAs) signed with the US and EU for the development of the Dominican economy?</h4><p>The advantage of having such FTAs is duty free access to the largest consumer markets with greater purchasing power. Furthermore, these facilities place us on equal terms with Central American countries, with which we would otherwise be at a disadvantage. Furthermore, these treaties provide an environment of greater legal certainty, which is an incentive for investment. Looking ahead, treaties can be beneficial to the extent that domestic producers improve their ability to compete by offering products meeting higher-quality standards demanded by these countries, which would increase exports and employment. In the agricultural sector, for example, there is still room to reap the benefits of these treaties.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The State of Steel]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-state-of-steel]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From 2009 to 2013 the Mexican steel industry enjoyed a period of growth. How did Grupo ABX perform in that period?</h4><p>There has been a strong upward trend from 2010 onward following a poor performance in 2009 due to the crisis. Nevertheless, over the past year and a half, international steel prices have seen a decline in the face of Chinese slowdown, whereby we have seen a recent reduction in margins.</p><h4>Grupo ABX comprises five companies. What role does each play within the overall group?</h4><p>ABX works at the middle and the end of the supply chain providing steel products and services for the construction and industrial sectors. We are organized into 5 divisions: ABINSA, which provides a wide range of steel products to construction, low-end industrial, and distribution customers through its 10 distribution centers in Mexico; AB STEEL, transforms and processes flat steel for automotive and high-end industrial customers at its 2 two plants in Monterrey and Querétaro; MAQUILACERO, which manufactures steel tubes for construction and industrial customers with one plant in Monterrey; TEFLU, which transforms tubes into industrial parts and assemblies for automotive and high-end industrial customers at its two plants in Puebla and Monterrey; and AB TECH, which transforms special steel bars into cold finished bars and parts for industrial customers with two plants in Monterrey and Querétaro. Mexico's construction sector has not been as dynamic as the industrial sector, especially automotive, which has grown significantly. Overall, construction represents about 55% of our business, while the rest is industrial.</p><h4>Mexico's automotive sector is important, and is expected to continue showing excellent growth rates over the coming years. How promising will this be for Group ABX?</h4><p>This emerging trend in Mexico began five years ago with the arrival of new automotive companies including BMW, Honda, Mazda, Audi, and Kia, all of which represent a large market for steel products and services. By then, we had already refocused our strategy and prepared to take advantage of the coming trend. That is why we invested in state-of-the-art facilities in Monterrey, Querétaro, and Puebla and reorganized our operations for the new scenario. Manufacturing and servicing steel products for the construction sector is different than doing so for the automotive sector, and this reality has required us to adapt our organization. We expect to ride the wave and become an important player in this segment.</p><h4>In 2012 you opened a new service center in Queretaro. What role does it play in your domestic portfolio?</h4><p>We have been gravitating toward the automotive industry. Our first state-of-the-art service center was built here in Monterrey in 2007. That was seven years ago, and two years ago we set up in Queretaro, another major plant that for us marked a major investment. From this new hub in Queretaro, we service first-tier companies in the chain for Nissan, Honda, Mazda, and BMW. It is a good location for us as Queretaro is part of the “El Bají­o" region, where growth is much in evidence. On the other hand, from Monterrey we service several first tiers, or automotive and auto parts companies located in the north, which in turn supply GM, Ford, Chrysler, and others. The new Kia plant in Pesquerí­a represents an opportunity for us that we expect to pursue. Another region that will see a sharp impulse from the automotive sector is Puebla and Tlaxcala, where VW is located, while the new Audi plant will shortly commence operations. There we have a plant making tube parts and assemblies for the first tiers. We acquired that plant two years ago and subsequently built a new one here in Monterrey in 2013.</p><h4>How important is the US market for ABX?</h4><p>The US is a key market for our operations. We export our tubing products directly, and are one of the leading exporters of lightweight structural tubing. We export to all the Southern states of the US. We have endorsed a US Department of Commerce (DOC) dumping investigation, and each year we submit information to the DOC so it can check our pricing and make sure we are not applying dumping prices that damage the local US steel tubing industry. Other exports that we work on are virtual or indirect, where we supply local US or foreign companies that transform a product and then re-export it. There are many programs, especially in the automotive segment, in which the entire supply chain makes virtual exports to manufacture auto parts, which are then shipped to the US, Europe, Asia, or elsewhere.</p><div class="quote">“ABX works at the middle and the end of the supply chain."</div><h4>What is your long-term outlook for the steel industry in Mexico?</h4><p>Steel is a cyclical product and, as such, we are subject to changes in the global economy, especially in pricing; we have to beware of that.  Then, I see more regional cooperation in the future, and that eventually the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) region will become much more integrated than it is today. In this manner, we will present a common front against Asia or Europe or other regions. I see a positive short-term outlook for NAFTA. On the other hand, domestically, the new rules for the energy sector will bring substantial investments that are intensive in the use of steel. In this context, I think that eventually internal consumption will have to catch up in terms of better wages and more jobs, which in turn should generate more consumption and local production of goods, houses, buildings, and so on. I see a bright future for Mexico. Of course, it would be much easier if the global economy recovers and had some help from China, for example, because it is such a major player in the global economy, as the world's largest consumer of steel, as well as being the biggest producer.</p><h4>Where do you see Grupo ABX over the coming years?</h4><p>We have made the right moves, and are determined to take advantage of this growth. We have a good organization and well-trained people who can deliver, so I anticipate Grupo ABX being successful over the course of the next decade, and foresee expansion through our strategy of providing more value-added products and services to our clients, not only in Mexico, but also potentially abroad.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[time-for-a-heyday]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you familiarize our readers with ADEX's position in the Peruvian market, and comment on your export-based activities?</h4><p>ADEX is an association of exporters, mostly from non-traditional sectors, and mostly comprised of SMEs. It has a history of 40 years, and one of its characteristics is that it combines entrepreneurial effort with academic endeavor. We are trying to inform the coming generation of Peruvians about foreign trade, and the processes that it entails in the real world of commerce. Not only does the association have the business component, then, but also an academic one, which imparts the values and lessons that will transform the younger generation into tomorrow's entrepreneurs active in Peru's foreign trade drive.</p><h4>What is the relevance of ADEX in the context of Peru's new economic outlook?</h4><p>ADEX has been active in promoting free trade agreements (FTAs) with other markets and also in ensuring the smooth implementation of these treaties. Sometimes countries sign treaties, but then enter into non-tariff areas. We essentially facilitate trade, in which Peru has been highly active. Recently, there was news from the Commerce Ministry that Peru would sign another free trade agreement, this time with Turkey, which should be good news for exporters. Peru is entering new markets and, thus, opening new destinations for its products. We are enthusiastic about this, and are involved in ensuring that these trade agreements work to the advantage of exporters here. For us, that is one side of the coin. The other aspect has to be internal policies, whereby we need to support those policies that add value to production in Peru. Unfortunately, the law in general in Peru is not as comprehensively applied as it should be, which has been a chronic problem with implications not only of an economic, but also a social and political nature.</p><div class="quote">“ADEX is an association of exporters, mostly from non-traditional sectors."</div><h4>What are the most important reforms that you would advocate for the Peruvian economy in order to boost SMEs and the manufacturing sector, which is facing some hardship?</h4><p>In short, the legal system is overly complex, and we need to reduce the requirements and provisions of these laws. In order to properly comply, companies need to hire a lawyer, an accountant, and others that many SMEs can ill afford, whereby they find themselves in the informal economy. This has prevented Peru from developing supply chains internally. Under normal circumstances, a large company would go to an SME to procure raw materials. However, in Peru this is harder to do because the right company is likely to be an informal entity. That breaks the chain of production and, ultimately, few companies are able to comply with the law and become competitive. Peru is, therefore, closing the door on thousands of companies that could be also productive and support economic growth. We think that the government should address this problem more seriously, and pass laws that can help SMEs operate within the boundaries of the law.</p><h4>How does ADEX encourage foreign investment?</h4><p>In general, Peru is highly attractive for foreign investment, which is probably why all the entrepreneurial associations have been accommodating of the government. We keep in mind to remain onside with the government, because excessive pressure can backfire. The truth is that current policies have been in place for almost 20 years, and Peru is truly open to foreign investment. Once you are installed in Peru, and find your niche, it can be highly profitable.</p><h4>How will the export industry develop over the medium term?</h4><p>We are optimistic about Peru, and believe the super-cycle end of high commodity prices to be over, and that it will not swiftly be seen again. This will oblige all parties, from the government to the private sector, to reexamine their economic policy. It is especially important that we start working with those who have been operating in the informal economy. During the good times, there is some reluctance to amend economic policy, as there is little pressure to do so. Yet by the time the problem becomes evident, it is often too late to take corrective action. At that point economic policies that are restrictive or unpopular tend to materialize. Now is the time to make the necessary reforms, because we are at a mid-point in the trajectory on a gradual decline. Let us hope that we can be wise enough to recognize that change is needed, and act on that realization.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Both Nigeria and Cí´te d'Ivoire are founders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). How do you see the development of ECOWAS, and what are the prospects for the future?</h4><p><span></span>I would like to stress that ECOWAS is moving in the right direction. At a meeting in Dakar in 2013, we made some important decisions: First, it was decided that in 2015 there would be a common external tariff for goods that would be implemented by the presidential commission; secondly, the heads of states of ECOWAS wanted to have a single currency by 2020. As you know we have a common currency in the Western African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); we want to link the Francophone countries with other West African nations and create a common currency for ECOWAS. There have been some improvements as far as the question of the security of citizens of member-state countries is concerned. Also, the presidential commission for ECOWAS is discussing with the EU how to forge a common approach on issues related to our cooperation. For many years, we have been discussing this, and we hope that soon the 15 countries will sign a cooperation agreement between ECOWAS and the EU. Apart from that, there are some projects that would reinforce relations between the various countries. For example, we are working on a toll highway to link five countries.</p><h4>What is needed to expedite the process of this major infrastructure project?</h4><p>The feasibility study is underway and needs to be completed, after which we can launch an international tender to build the highway. It will be 1,000 km in length, and run from Lagos to Abidjan and pass through Cotonou, Lomé, and Accra. It is an important project that is expected to cost between $3 billion and $5 billion. The private sector seems to be interested, including the financial sector. I think ECOWAS is the future for our region, because with 15 countries and 300 million inhabitants, it is a powerful political and economic group.</p><div class="quote">“Nigeria is ranked first as a supplier of Cí´te d'Ivoire, even before France."</div><h4>How do you see the future of bilateral trade between Cí´te d'Ivoire and Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria is ranked first as a supplier of Cí´te d'Ivoire, even before France, due to its supply of oil. We have a refinery called Société ivoirienne de raffinage (SIR) in Abidjan with a large capacity. We buy oil from Nigeria, process it, and then either use it domestically, or else resell it to Nigeria and other ECOWAS countries. Hence, trade relations between our two countries are important. Nonetheless, we have to diversify our exports to Nigeria.</p><h4>World Economic Forum (WEF) has been held in West Africa for the first time. What is the importance of this?</h4><p>As the largest economy in Africa, I think that it is a sign of the role of Nigeria in the continent. This could also be beneficial to counties in ECOWAS as Nigeria is a leading member. Cí´te d'Ivoire considers Nigeria to be a major trading partner. Moreover, holding such a prestigious forum here in Nigeria and in West Africa is important for surrounding countries. First, it is easy to travel to Nigeria compared to other parts of Africa, and also it is a sign that both Africa, and West Africa in particular, have a good future. Africa's GDP rose by 5.4%, while the economies of West Africa grew by 6.5% in 2013. We want to build on this lead, and go as far as possible with regard to integration. We want to have an external tariff agreement by 2015, and full synchronization by 2020.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ill-field-this-one]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can you tell us about Total's latest developments in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>At the moment, the Absheron Gas Field is our only operating asset and, in that field, the final investment decision (FID) has not yet been made, which means that we are conducting project definition studies and preparing for future development. Our main activity for 2014 has been preparing the development program to be submitted to SOCAR by mid-2015. We also sold our share in Shah Deniz Gas Field in order to concentrate on our Absheron asset. It is part of the global policy of Total, in terms of asset management; we want to concentrate on assets where we have an industrial role, where we are the operator, or have a significant input in the operations; and, which are more profitable. Based on these criteria, as we had 10% in Shah Deniz, we felt that it was better for us to concentrate our resources and capital on Absheron. We also participate in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline for oil transportation. This is a strategic asset for us as it unlocks some reserves by allowing oil or condensate export. For example, Absheron is a gas field with condensate, and BTC is a good option for exporting the liquid. This is not only for Azerbaijan, as we will eventually export from our production facilities in Kazakhstan through the BTC Pipeline. The fact that the BTC Pipeline is not yet full is an opportunity in oil development in the area.</p><h4>Total has a 40% stake in Absheron and SOCAR also has 40%. How do Total and SOCAR support each other in this relationship?</h4><p>I think SOCAR selected Total for its technical skill in terms of geosciences, our ability to handle megaprojects within budget and on schedule, and our deep-sea technology expertise. The concept that led to the discovery of Absheron was quite innovative. Before Total took the operatorship, a first exploration well was drilled in the area, but this well did not lead to a commercial discovery, although there it evidenced some hydrocarbon traces. Our geologists had to develop a very original scenario to identify another prospect in the area: it was validated by an exploration well drilled in 2011. There are several good operators in terms of technical skills, but I believe we are among the top players in terms of geoscience. We are clearly a pioneer in terms of deep-sea technology in places such as the Gulf of Guinea, where we started oil production in water depths of 1500m in 2001; we have many subsidiaries tackling deep-sea operations. I was personally in charge of Block 17 in Angola, which is one of the more prolific blocks in the Gulf of Guinea. We had four big sea developments that we can really be proud of there. I think that is one of the main drivers from SOCAR. They have good technical capacity and we are sharing our experience to continue deep-sea development. We are progressing very efficiently with SOCAR.</p><div class="quote">“I think SOCAR selected Total for its technical skill in terms of geosciences."</div><h4>What are the major preparations that need to be done in order to reach the objective of starting gas production at Absheron by 2021?</h4><p>We have several axis. One is drilling rig development, as there is a shortage of rigs here. SOCAR realized that some time ago and decided to construct a new rig, which should be available in early 2017. One way to accelerate drilling would be to use this rig because it would avoid having to wait for the second rig, which the construction on is not decided yet. There is another possibility of accelerating the schedule of our project by using the oil and gas processing and petrochemical complex (OGPC) facilities. This option requires some arbitration, as the design will integrate the specificity of the Absheron fluids. We are in close contact with SOCAR and OGPC to progress this option. Last but not least we need to define a solid marketing plan and to reach an economical balance before being in position to submit a robust Development Program and later on to reach the Final Investment Decision.</p><h4>Looking at Total's operations globally, how significant are operations in Azerbaijan in terms of the global strategy?</h4><p>The operation in Azerbaijan is limited for the time being; however, the Absheron prospects are very good. It is a major project with a significant investment. If we succeed in creating a good development plan that will be approved by SOCAR for Absheron, then the logic will be to continue with other phases of Absheron and with other offshore developments. It should be the beginning of a successful story.</p><h4>Oil and gas from Azerbaijan is becoming more important on a global scale. How do you expect this to affect the hydrocarbon sector within Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The first stage of development in Azerbaijan was based on oil. The Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) Field was the basis for this development. I think the focus on gas, which has both political and technical aspects in the southern gas corridor project, is clearly very important in terms of national strategy. It may offer some perspective for gas development, which means more activity for the country, which should contribute to national development.</p><h4>How much do you think Total's presence in Azerbaijan is strengthening ties between France and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We are not involved in gas distribution in France. It, however, appears that having a corridor that allows for the transportation of energy from the Caspian to Europe, including France, is a positive aspect in the relationship. In terms of operations here with Absheron, it is not only a French company working in Azerbaijan. Total-Azerbaijan is an Azerbaijani entity and we are here to work with Azerbaijan to develop the people, to share our technology, and to develop the difficult fields. This is the most important part of the relationship.</p><h4>What are the long-term goals of Total in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The objective is to become an important player in oil and gas operations in Azerbaijan. We have Absheron, and hopefully we will have other opportunities in the future to move in this direction. The goal is to create something sustainable in Azerbaijan. We still have to build some conditions to secure the development of Absheron but we are in a very positive working relationship with SOCAR. I am quite optimistic about our shared success.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon and the region is known to be “the home of agriculture." What do you think makes Lebanon worthy of such a title?<br></h4><p>Historically, “the home of agriculture" was a Lebanese trademark of excellence for many reasons. Among them is the Mediterranean atmosphere it enjoys and four-season weather, which implies diversity in temperature enabling the growth of various agricultural products, such as cold weather products, warm products, Mediterranean products, and desert products, among others. In addition, Lebanon enjoys an environmental richness and a bio-agricultural diversity that enables the growth of fruit crops and other Mediterranean products. The coastal and internal plains, the mountainous and agricultural fields, and the forest areas represent the richness of agricultural products in Lebanon. Add to those the natural reasons, a social-economical belief based on a widely spread idea that “an easy living farmer is as wealthy as a ruler," and Lebanon's situation as a bridge between the West and the Arab world on the Mediterranean facilitated and still facilitates the trade of all agro-industrial products.</p><h4>What are the main products produced in Lebanon for export, and what are the most significant markets?</h4><p>The main products for export are fruits and vegetables. The official figures show that the main markets are the MENA region; France, which imported 456 tons of apples in 2013; Africa, mainly Nigeria and the Congo; and Germany, which imported 596 tons of grapes in 2013. In regard to citrus fruits, again, it is the Arab countries, mainly Saudi Arabia, which imported 21,144 tons in 2013, and then Russia, Australia, France, the UK, and Africa. Concerning potatoes, Lebanon exported 189,339 tons in 2013 to mainly Arab countries, Russia, and Africa. Finally, Lebanon exports olive oil to many countries, including Arab countries, mainly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Spain, Germany, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Latin America, and Africa, where a Lebanese diaspora is present.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to improve the country's infrastructure for agriculture and agro-industry, and what structural investments are being made to create jobs, reverse urban migration?</h4><p>Among the steps that have been taken to improve the agricultural infrastructure we can state: the rehabilitation of agricultural lands; opening agricultural roads; creating artificial mountainous lakes; launching irrigation projects; and reducing the construction percentage in agricultural lands. In addition, steps are being taken to improve and support farmers' capabilities by introducing various laboratories; for example, specialized laboratories to identify the nature of soils and their conformity with product types, laboratories to identify the validity of products, as well as research on seeds and agricultural medicine. The Ministry is trying to introduce more projects in cooperation with international organizations and donor countries to support farmers and improve the sector, help agricultural unions, cooperatives, and farmers groups, and provide them with all the facilities they need to improve the production both in quality and quantity, and reduce the cost of production as well as strengthen the domestic market while respecting the standards and requirements of growth and production. The Ministry of Agriculture introduced more control procedures over livestock, agro-industry firms, seeds, and agricultural medicine, while keeping tight control on refrigeration and conservation warehouses, all for the sake of respecting the chain of production. As for the agro-industry sector, the Ministry is seeking to provide farmers with low prices for raw materials, introducing new control measures on food safety, quality standards, and specifications, assuring long-term loans without interest, and improving marketing procedures. The structural investments are also being concentrated on the support of the agro-industrial sector with the aim of keeping the farmer attached to his land and help him market his products, while the Ministry has activated a support plan for the agricultural cooperatives meaning that the latter would participate in sharing the production costs, not to mention our efforts to encourage the conversion of unused and neglected lands to agricultural lands in order to make use of them agriculturally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key changes in the Lebanese tourism sector since the Riviera Hotel was founded?</h4><p>Beirut has a long history of iconic five-star hotels. We opened in 1956, and at that time the Bristol Hotel and the Saint Georges were already open, followed by the Palm Beach. There was also Le Commodore, and then the Phoenicia arrived on the scene, whereby year after year, Beirut's hotel offering expanded, today numbering 99. Beirut started as a summer destination principally for visitors from other Arab countries. The wealthy citizens of the Arab world arrived to visit the mountains, for their alluring, greener scenery and cooler climate. Some tourists came for Lebanon's archaeological sites, a trend which continued until the 1960s. From Europe, visitors started to arrive from Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Italy, the UK, and France. We began to see a second wave of more independent tourists enjoying tours through Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. Lebanon was always the common denominator in these tours. And following the war, the Riviera was the first hotel to recover, reopening in 1992. The Phoenicia also underwent renovation, and then new hotels like Le Gray and the Four Seasons opened, as well as many small boutique establishments.</p><h4>How do you ensure that expatriates become repeat visitors?</h4><p>Over the years Riviera's loyalty signature was naturally organic thanks to its brand recognition by the international tourists who have built a great reputation for us generation after generation. We have witnessed guests from 40 years ago becoming grandfathers who are now bringing their family members here to remember the nostalgic Riviera. Our personalized service contributes very positively to the expatriate visitors who become repeat guests.</p><h4>How did you alter your yield management in the face of increasing competition in the industry?</h4><p>We personalized our service, for one, by rotating our staff less often, so that they could become familiar with repeat guests, and tend to their individual needs and preferences. We try to understand the wishes and preferences of each individual guest and offer what they like. It is also important not to have too rigid an approach to our rates. Our sector is seasonal, and we work according to whether it is the low, medium, or high season. Our greatest asset at the Riviera is our location, and our beach is a major point of attraction.</p><h4>How do you go about appealing to tourists from Europe?</h4><p>France is a good target market for Lebanon due to the similarities between the French and Lebanese cultures. The French feel at ease here, as French is widely spoken. English is also commonly spoken. An additional advantage for the visitor is the relative ease of communicating in Lebanon. If you go out, be it to a restaurant, bar, nightclub, or concert, Lebanese people initiate communication. They tend not to wait for you to come over and do so. They will then try to assist you, familiarize you with the country, and make you feel at ease. As a natural appeal for tourists Lebanese hospitality is in the blood.</p><h4>How important are international events and conferences for your business?</h4><p>Such events form a crucial element of our business as increased brand awareness ultimately leads to new guest arrivals. Such events account for approximately 25% of our business.</p><h4>What do the next five years hold in store for the Riviera Hotel?</h4><p>We want to maintain our business and preserve the factors both large and small that make us unique. We want repeat guests to feel this continued attention to detail.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[Salim Ramia started his career in 1966 working for the record industry in Lebanon before moving to Dubai from 1975 to 1979 to work in the cinema and film distribution sector. In 1980 he formed a distribution company in Lebanon with a partner, but returned to Dubai in 1986 and in 1989, created a partnership to form Gulf Film. He continued distributing movies until 1992, when the partners opened their first cinema in Dubai, AlNasr, under Salim Ramia Gulf Film. In 2000, he created Grand Cinemas, which had more than 106 screens. He was voted two times, in 2008 and 2009, the most powerful man in the entertainment business in the Middle East. In 2007 Salim Ramia returned again to Lebanon to launch his Grand Cinemas brand, having 32 screens at five locations. In 2011, he decided to sell Gulf Film and moved back to Lebanon, but continued his success story in Jordan and Kuwait where he opened his Grand Cinema chain.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main milestones for your business since its foundation in the UAE?</h4><p>In April 1989, I decided to partner with an Iranian friend living in Dubai and we decided to operate a new company under the name of 2001 Film at that time, then after two years I decided to change the name to Gulf Film. We continued growing the business in film distribution, though it was mainly for the GCC area—UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman plus a few movies for the whole Middle East—until 1992, when we decided to venture into the cinema business. We leased one cinema in Dubai, which was part of the Al Nasr Club, and named it Al Nasr Cinema. We fully refurbished it, and opened it in September 1992 with a movie called Unforgiven featuring Clint Eastwood. The movie won four Oscars, but we lost all our money because no one wanted to see a Western. We continued losing from September to December 1992, until we got the movie The Bodyguard. At that time, Star TV was playing Whitney Houston's songs all day long, which helped us to promote the movie. People really came in great numbers. Going to the cinema in UAE and Dubai in 1992 was not a familiar thing for people; they had the mentality that cinemas in the UAE were for the laboring classes. Patrons came and enjoyed the experience, which later on became a habit and a must for them to do on the weekend. In 1994, we opened Galleria Cinema in the old Hyatt Regency Hotel with two screens, and later we moved to Abu Dhabi with another two screens. We started putting screens in Sharjah, but it was not a big business until 2000, when we opened our first multiplex in Abu Dhabi at the Al Mariah Mall with nine screens, and added a standalone project in Dubai with 12 screens. Then, we continued growing in the UAE until 2005 when we acquired Century Cinemas in the UAE and Jordan. Then we took over another company called Al Massa Cinemas. Within one year, our screen numbers jumped from 60 to 96.</p><h4>How did you develop from there?</h4><p>The last project I opened was at the Festival Centre in Dubai. The number of screens continued growing, whereby we became the leader in the whole of the Middle East in terms of screen numbers, plus controlling the distribution of movies across the Middle East. In the meantime, in 2005-2006, I was contacted by people from the ABC Mall in Beirut, and they wanted me to lease their cinemas. We were ahead of all our other rivals in the region since we were the first to introduce digital systems and 3D as well as IMAX to the Middle East. We took over the cinemas at ABC Mall in Achrafieh, and at the same time in 2005-2006 we entered Jordan with Amman's first 10-screen multiplex.</p><h4>How did it feel to move back to the Lebanese market?</h4><p>I was not welcomed by my competitors, but I believe in competition; it's healthy, it improves both the industry and client service quality. Some people think we had done enough in Dubai, so why should we come to Lebanon? I'm Lebanese, so of course I am interested in the market here. We started here with seven screens and expanded. We now have 32 screens under our Grand Cinemas brand, and I hope our next project will be at the ABC Verdun Mall, which is set for completion in 2018.</p><h4>How large is your market share in the Lebanese market?</h4><p>Grand Cinemas had 45% of the market before the other players came to Beirut, each with their own huge multiplexes of 14 and 15 screens. However, we are still maintaining our lead and presently have around 33% of the market. And if you compare the number of seats we have with the number of seats of our competitors, we are filling more than 30% while they cannot do more than 24%, which means we are still the number one operator in Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the unique attributes of Abou Jaoude &amp; Associates?<br></h4><p>Our uniqueness stems from our structure and our human capital. We were established in 1996, and in 1998 we were pioneers in introducing the Anglo-Saxon structural model of law firms in Lebanon, instead of the family-based firms, which were the standard in the country. We are organized as a civil company that practices law. Our model and the ascendance within the firm relies on meritocracy, where any member has the chance to become a partner, and business ethics are paramount. Because of our structure and image, we are able to attract the best talent. Our lawyers have an in-depth specialization, a sharp understanding of the commercial as well as the legal aspects of clients' businesses, and the ability to tackle any challenge using fast and innovative solutions. The firm is renowned for its added-value in structured finance and unparalleled experience advising on cross-border deals of the first impression in the region.</p><h4>What are the most high-profile mergers and acquisitions you have worked on over the last year?</h4><p>We worked on a merger between Société Générale and the Lebanese-Canadian Bank, which was implemented through the sale of the latter's assets and equity components. This was definitely the largest consolidation of banking operations in the market. We also recently acted on several high-profile acquisitions, including the acquisition of Orange Uganda by Africell, and the acquisition by M1 Group of a stake in GLB Invest, and several other telecoms transactions in Africa. We also work heavily on equity transactions, for instance we did so in relation to Africell Holding. In terms of real estate, we represent not less than 10% to 15% of the real estate development market. One of the biggest ones is BeitMisk.</p><h4>How are you assisting financial institutions to adapt to the new capital market laws?</h4><p>Not only to capital market laws, but they have to comply with several rules and regulations related to disclosure, anti-money laundering, and most importantly corporate governance. Financial institutions have to train themselves to adapt to these new regulations. You have to bear in mind that there is a world pre-2008 and post-2008. Our advice to clients has been corporate governance-driven since 1994, because I believe in the rationale of a transparent world. The substantial increase in our revenues was due to the fact that many unwilling companies had to undergo the switch, upgrade, and apply the latest rules, and the firm already had a track record in advising on governance rules.</p><h4>How are you growing your base of multinational clients?</h4><p>We advise many multinationals and banks, such as Nissan, Deutsche Bank, Emaar, and ZTE Corporation, locally or worldwide. The firm offers businesses in need of legal assistance in any country easy access to global advice by maintaining privileged partnerships with a number of correspondents in various jurisdictions. Based on our attorneys' experience, we are able to advise on various legal systems in different countries.</p><h4>What is your strategy for expanding the company domestically and internationally?</h4><p>In three to five years' time, we will be 100 members with 12 to 15 partners; we will have our own network. I do not have any plans to increase offices or agencies anywhere else in the world, especially not in the MENA region. From our headquarters in Beirut, we advise clients in Lebanon on their ongoing day-to-day business, but we also service international clients on a transaction basis. My vision was to become the best in my market, Lebanon. We have a great way of structuring transactions and that is one of our core added values. Not many law firms specialize in this area. This gives us an edge and the possibility of working on cross-border transactions. The firm's growth and expansion policy revolves around segregation and distribution of risks: maintaining a 15% cap of the firm's total exposure per main practice area or sector, and a 5% cap per client.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the special characteristics of Etoile Hotel?<br></h4><p>Uniquely set in one of Beirut's oldest and most charming districts, the “Place De L'Etoile" of Solidere is rich in history and entertainment. The Etoile Suites Boutique Hotel is only 10 minutes from Beirut International Airport, 2 minutes to Beirut's famous beach fronts, and a few meters to major Beirut areas including businesses, shopping, government buildings, historical mosques and churches, and archaeological sites, with easy access to major mountains and seashore destinations.</p><h4>How do your rooms differ from each other?</h4><p>Each of our 21 spacious private suites and rooms is designed to offer ultimate comfort in a practical refined setting of comfortable elegance with a high standard of service for both business and leisure.</p><h4>What changes in tourism trends have you seen since 2006?</h4><p>The tourism industry in Lebanon has been historically important to the local economy, and remains to this day  a major source of revenue for the country. But unfortunately, since 2006 due to political instability, leisure tourism has been decreasing leaving space for business, medical, and cultural tourism, and it also relies on the large number of Lebanese living abroad who return regularly to the country.</p><h4>Are any of your suites residential?</h4><p>Although we have long-term rentals, they are for approximately two months at most. Some diplomats and Lebanese politicians choose to stay at the Etoile Suites hotel for a couple of months at a time, since the location and services are very convenient for them.</p><h4>By what means are you trying to promote tourism yourself?</h4><p>We are always sending special offers to our clients to encourage them to visit Lebanon.</p><h4>Who is your target market?</h4><p>Arab tourists are our main target. They used to come because they liked the hotel for its  large suites. They all have a nice character. However, since May 2012, we have been dealing a lot with corporates —we moved from tourism to corporate guests since leisure tourism was decreasing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How many subsidiaries does Net Holding currently have? What synergies are you pushing between the companies?<br></h4><p>Our group counts over 12 companies rolled into a legal and statutory structure. We run two independent companies, one engaged in express (Net Express) and the other in logistics (Net Logistics), both subsidiaries of Net Holding. Additionally, Net Holding includes Net Manager, an IT company powering the Group's IT infrastructure and moving into IT solutions development. We are developing innovative software solutions mapped onto the concept of express in a global dimension. Our multi-branch mail distribution, management, and tracking software, which was specifically developed for financial institutions, has been adopted by Bank Audi, a leading bank in Lebanon.</p><h4>How has the business share between your express and logistics services changed over the past year?</h4><p>In the express industry, we experienced growth of 20% in 2013, a good figure considering the geopolitical situation. A number of logistics strategies had to be changed, for example, we used to have a regular truck coming from Dubai to Lebanon called a Time-Definite Trucking Service. Due to the situation in Syria Time-Definite Trucking had to be replaced by active airfreight from Dubai into Lebanon—a substantial transformation in our business model from a logistics point of view. Overall, Net Logistics has shifted to ocean freight for most logistics into and out of the GCC, and this is where we saw considerable TEU growth in exports.</p><h4>Did you see an increase in gross revenues?</h4><p>The company has been growing at a rate of 30% to 35% over the past three years.</p><h4>What do you consider to be your niche in the Lebanese logistics and express delivery sectors?</h4><p>The unique position of Net Holding is that we have our feet in both industries—express, and freight forwarding and logistics. Other companies are either express or freight forwarders. This is where we get our edge, as a single-point solutions provider.</p><h4>Do you anticipate a need to increase your storage capacity?</h4><p>The storage facility that we have in the free zone has not grown, as we are not concentrating on warehousing or 3PL, as other companies are. We are focused on cargo flow in and out of the Levant. In Lebanon, Net Logistics is growing its business on the basis of exports in TEUs, and on imports in the absence of a road network. In Iraq, market development is extremely interesting. The transit business between Lebanon and Iraq is not happening due to the situation in Syria, but many businesses coming into Iraq from Jordan and Turkey are counter balancing that.</p><h4>In what areas do you intend to enhance your logistics services over the coming years?</h4><p>We are getting more involved in the oil and gas sector in Iraq and this has brought additional business to the organization, along with additional expertise.</p><h4>How are you planning ahead for this?</h4><p>We are positioning ourselves with the major IOCs, making sure they become familiar with our capabilities and expertise. We already know that many are interested in exploration in Lebanon.</p><h4>What kind of assistance could Net Holding provide in the reconstruction of Syria?</h4><p>Our infrastructure in Syria has not changed, and we are always ready to service the country. Consumption continues, regardless of the conflict. There are many new flows of humanitarian aid coming into the country that need effective logistics solutions.</p><h4>How do your certifications help your business?</h4><p>Abiding by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is important for us. We are a compliant company and our work and contracts reflect it. This is a prerequisite for working with multinationals looking for suppliers that can provide them with adequate operational transparency, which is what we focus on most. In terms of potential for future oil and gas projects, logistics companies must realize that they will only secure contracts if they are compliant and reliable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to your interest in the boating industry?<br></h4><p>I started my career as a computer engineer in Switzerland. I would often visit Lebanon to visit family, friends, and just enjoy the things I love best in life, including waterskiing, diving, and fishing. Often on my visits many people would seek my advice and opinion when purchasing a boat. I never thought much of it then until a good friend of mine, who owned a service boat company that I used to spend most of my days fishing with, said to me “Why don't we start a boating business? You sell the boats and I'll take care of the service." It sounded like a good idea, and so I took the challenge and went to the Miami Boat Show, where my business in this field all began, becoming a dealer for three brands. The first brands I represented were Regal, Fountain, and Proline. I selected the boats based on their characteristics and the demand in the area at that time. Regal was for pleasure boating, Fountain was for speedboats, and Proline was for fishing. I was determined to have my business grow quickly, so I invested a lot of my time and efforts to accomplish this goal.</p><h4>Was it difficult for you to enter the Lebanese market?</h4><p>To enter any market is a challenge. The difficulty is that there are competitors already established and you are new; however, it was an easy task to accomplish, and we obtained a respectable reputation in this market, as it is my hobby, my life, and my passion. I was well prepared, motivated, and determined—and those are three strong tools that assisted me to succeed instantly. After two years of being operational, I obtained the exclusive dealership for Riva in Lebanon because of the Boat Show in 2000. Then, in 2001 Riva became part of the Ferretti Group, which noticed me and told me that I was the right person for it, hence, becoming the Ferretti Group dealer for Lebanon. By 2007, I covered the territories of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, being the exclusive dealer to selected brands that best suit those markets.</p><h4>How much do your boats cost?</h4><p>The price range of our boats starts from $50,000, going all the way up to the millions. We represent over 12 brands now in order to assure that we have a diversified range of boats that can meet the needs of any client wishing to own a boat.</p><h4>How many units of boats do you sell?</h4><p>The units sold by Sea Pros Yachts don't show in numbers, but rather in volume and value. Sea Pros Yachts has sold the largest CRN yacht ever for over $100 million. We are one of the rare companies worldwide that is able to sell two to three mega yachts per year.</p><h4>How many SEABOBs did you sell in 2013?</h4><p>The SEABOB is a well desired water toy because of its advance technology and top performance. We are selling 60-70 units per year here in Lebanon, each unit ranging between ‚¬9,000 and ‚¬13,000. The recently launched new SEABOB F5 &amp; F5S, weighing only 29 kilograms compared to the 64-kilogram older model, allows any boat owner to own a SEABOB, and has been revolutionary, selling out before the units have been supplied to us.</p><h4>Why did you keep the name as Sea Pros?</h4><p>Sea Pros Yachts is the name that I started with in 1998, and will carry on to be the name as it has taken its place in the industry and has a highly respectable reputation. We are now leaders in this industry because of our passion, determination, and commitment to innovative business developments that enhance customer satisfaction.</p><h4>How important is Lebanon in relation to your international market?</h4><p>Lebanon is a rich country with its resources, being a beautiful country in a prominent location. It is situated perfectly on the map, open to the fruitful Mediterranean Sea, allowing boat owners the freedom to travel to many wonderful coasts, islands, and beaches. Many Kuwaiti, Saudi, and Emirati clients moor here in Lebanon rather than the South of France because of the benefits of the country and the leisure to use the boat eight months in the year rather than two to three months. Apart from the country's benefit to boat owners, Lebanon is also an important market because mega yachts are in demand.</p><h4>What do you think needs to be done to resolve the shortage of moorings?</h4><p>All countries along the coast are facing problems in mooring, and the only solution is to have investors wanting to develop a marina or create a new one. This is one of the dreams I have been pursuing since June 2012; to create a larger, advanced facility for mooring and recreational activities. I am still awaiting the permit for this project that would be a game changer for the boating industry and the economy. Both boating aficionados, along with the government, will benefit from such a project, having tourism and GDP increase with a new innovative facility that will allow those who travel by sea to visit and experience something magical.</p><h4>Is there much construction involved?</h4><p>The land and space available is much larger than any other marina facility in Lebanon. The construction involved will be extensive as there will be a lot of different facilities for members, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, squash courts, the marina itself, and much more. All the drawings and layouts have been sketched and designed; this project is really something worth the wait.</p><h4>What are you expecting for 2014?</h4><p>As always, Sea Pros Yachts every year is focused on moving forward by constantly finding innovative solutions for the boating industry. For 2014, we are hoping to have the consent to commence with our project to grow and establish a better area to serve our clients in both sales and service. With the current infrastructure situation restricting both sales and service, both Sea Pros Yachts and our after-sales sister company, Yachting Services, are finding it difficult to reach potential and accomplish goals. I am hoping to realize this dream of a new marina facility to create a better yachting experience for customers. I believe that once it is operational, we will experience an increase of over 100% just from the first year; it will definitely be a completely different way of boating and a promising project for a better future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Rafik El-Khoury &amp; Partners developed since its establishment in 1967, particularly in terms of the geographical expansion of its operations?<br></h4><p>From the outset, the firm has, on the one hand, been involved in the structural designs of delicate architectural projects where only the full interchange of ideas between architect and engineer could lead to the success of the venture. On the other hand, it has been involved in important engineering and structural designs per se. To satisfy the demands of its clients, the services of the office were extended early on to include architectural and electro-mechanical design, and working drawings. The firm has been closely involved in major projects both in Lebanon and in the Middle East. From the start, we decided to establish branch offices in the UAE (Abu Dhabi in 2006) and Saudi Arabia (Riyadh and Al-Khobar in 2010), to be able to undertake first hand our activities locally.</p><h4>In which main sectors are you involved?</h4><p>Structural design, road and bridge design, infrastructure design, the design of industrial installations and maritime works, preparation of tender documents, and project control and supervision (including cost control and project/construction management) are some of the firm's major fields of activity. The firm has also been extensively involved in structural steel and prefabricated concrete design, and the preparation of fabrication and shop drawings for these industries. Also, to keep up with market developments, the firm has entered into the field of solid waste management. This includes the design and supervision of wastewater treatment plants and sea outfalls, industrial equipment and power station maintenance, and preparation for the privatization of the water and electricity sectors, cultural heritage projects, and environmental work.</p><h4>How did your company build up such a multi-disciplinary portfolio?</h4><p>The firm has over 250 engineers and technical staff and maintains full-time specialists in our main fields of activity. For the more highly technical aspects of work, we maintain close relationships with major international consultants in the various fields of engineering. In certain domains, the firm has long-term arrangements with major international consultants to exchange and second staff. The firm has built-up a multi-disciplinary portfolio, in particular to deal with projects funded by major agencies such as the World Bank, European Investment Bank, Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, Saudi Fund, Kuwait Fund, and the Islamic Development Bank.</p><h4>What are the most significant tenders that you are working toward at the moment?</h4><p>Some of the prominent tenders under preparation at present are, for Lebanon, a water treatment plant, a dam in South Lebanon, and waste water treatment plants in Keserwan. For Saudi Arabia, we have the military airport, a hospital in Riyadh, supervision of a 1,500-villa project in Riyadh, and design work for parts of the Riyadh metro project. We also have a hotel and a mall project in Dubai, along with a high-rise apartment building in the UAE.</p><h4>What are the most significant projects that you are currently working on at the regional level?</h4><p>We are doing detailed design of infrastructure works in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The project covers the construction of roads, tunnels, and overpasses, including utility services and tunnels in the Holy City. We also have the “Mussallah in Mecca" project, which is a 150,000 sqm, 75,000-person mosque built on eight levels. Then, we have an administration building project in Riyadh consisting of office buildings and related utilities, such as a data center, general administration, and conference hall, with a built up area of 40,000 sqm. In the UAE, we are working on the upgrading of an urban road in Ras Al Khaimah. That project includes a dual carriageway with three lanes in each direction, with parallel side road parking, and sidewalks. The upgrade is 9 kilometers long, and includes road and pedestrian bridges. We are also engaged in an interesting project being built on the Littoral Nord site, which is a reclaimed plot of land north of Beirut. Our present involvement there comprises the design and supervision of a business park, a hotel, and a residential building.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies do you have for the AUB Medical Center (AUBMC) moving forward?<br></h4><p>The AUBMC 2020 Vision is a progressive transformational vision for the Medical Center. It is the first of its kind for the Medical Center, AUB in general, and in the region. It will take this entire institution, AUB and AUBMC, to a different level of excellence. This strategy began with Dean Sayegh when he joined AUBMC in July 2009, and set forth the AUBMC 2020 Vision. The focus is on a few clearly stated pillars and objectives, which are truly critical for the healthcare sector in Lebanon. We are setting a trend, and setting a standard about what it is that needs to happen to move forward, not only for Lebanon but also for the region. One of the pillars is to deliver patient-centered care. Regionally, most health care systems operate under the traditional style, whereby the various disciplines (physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, for example) work in silos. We have turned all this around with our multidisciplinary approach to care whereby various members of the treatment work together to deliver the best to our patients. We started with patient satisfaction surveys, and by offering service excellence training to our staff and physicians. We also opened up a Patient Affairs Office. The second pillar is related to the recruitment and retention of staff, which is a major strength for AUB. We added almost 50% to our clinical staff in a matter of one or two years. And almost all of them are trained in the US and were attracted back by our AUBMC 2020 Vision. Hence, many of these people trained in AUB, left to finish their training in the US, and then came back. A third and important pillar of the vision is our focus as an academic institution on teaching and research. We have quite a bit of external funding from outside Lebanon, particularly the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and this is to support a variety of research areas, some of it basic, meaning bench research, but much of it is clinical research.</p><h4>Why do you feel you have found willing institutions and partners in Iraq rather than Saudi Arabia or Qatar?</h4><p>In Iraq, the healthcare sector was almost totally destroyed during the war, the needs were tremendous, and the system could not cope with the demand. Therefore, people started going out of the market to places such as India, Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon. Companies started looking to other countries to help rebuild their services. Many places do not have the comprehensive services we offer. Our Continuous Medical Education (CME) Office works with them and provides training for their staff. People trust us because we are stable, transparent, and have an extensive number of specialties, whereas, in other countries, they might have to go to several hospitals to do that. Here, it is all provided in one place.</p><h4>Do you feel then that it could be harder in other countries to transplant this model?</h4><p>It is a philosophy; however, the problem, in my judgment, is relying on the local population is critical for that model to be sustained. You cannot have a sustainable program with long-term performance when your leadership and a large number of the healthcare providers are going to change every three or four years. This is the challenge in many areas. Now, if you look at Saudi Arabia, it has managed to create stability in staff turnover. Saudi Arabia invested in ensuring people who were Saudi nationals went through the training, went abroad, and then came back.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[optimizing-for-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What made you feel that Khoury Home was a unique investment opportunity?<br></h4><p>Since 2005, I have established the EuroMena private equity funds targeting the Levant and North African countries. Since inception, the EuroMena's strategic objective has been to invest in companies with the potential to become leading regional groups. Our strategy proved to be very successful, as we have played an active role in transforming family-based companies into regional leaders. And our experience showed that international companies are, in general, more attracted to invest in companies with a diversified, regional presence. This has been instrumental in executing several successful exits. Investing in single-market companies is relatively less attractive to international players given the illiquidity of stock markets in the region. Furthermore, there are not many companies in Lebanon that are both regional players and also have the potential for high-ticket investment. In addition, our investment level is relatively high, in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Nevertheless, Khoury Home is one of them. It is a market leader with a track record since early 2000.</p><h4>What has been the one most important message behind the Khoury Home takeover?</h4><p>The main message behind the Khoury Home takeover was to prove our ability in preserving and creating shareholder value. Our fund management team is well equipped to fulfill executive roles when needed. This has made a tremendous difference for the company as it strengthened the management team significantly, and created a great corporate culture. Consequently, we have been experiencing strong financial performance since 2013.</p><h4>What are the main points of the internal restructuring?</h4><p>Khoury Home is by far the market leader, with an 18%-20% share in a very fragmented market. As a comparison, the second largest player in the market has less than half of our turnover. In general, it is easy to open one store to sell electronics in Lebanon. It remains relatively simple to own and manage two or three showrooms. However, it becomes much more complicated when opening more than five big showrooms. Today, any of our main competitors would reach five or six showrooms at most, but would not be able to grow further as they all lack the ability to become an institution. Originally, Khoury Home went from four to 13 showrooms very rapidly. During this period, EuroMena acquired a stake in the company and supported it in its transformation from a family business into an institution. We have been successful in optimizing the footprint from 13 showrooms to 10 showrooms, consolidating the MegaMart brand under the Khoury Home brand, introducing IT system optimization, and streamlining operational processes across all departments. In addition, we were efficient in managing the inventory, which helped us optimize our working capital needs. We are capable of planning early with all our suppliers due to the better understanding of the market's needs. Moreover, we have optimized our advertising spend while using more efficient channels.</p><h4>Is this the model that you will follow when you start expanding regionally?</h4><p>Definitely. Our experience during the past 18 months in restructuring the company has provided us with several best practices across all fronts. For example, providing superior customer experience along with operational excellence such as inventory optimization is now part of the company's DNA. This experience will make it easier to franchise and transform the company into a regional player. Additionally, we have a franchise plan and strong team to support our expansion plan. Also, we are registered with the Lebanese Franchising Association (LFA).</p><h4>How would you evaluate your sales over the last year?</h4><p>The consumer electronics market has been decreasing at a rate of 15% over the last two years. In 2013, our sales went down by 10% compared to 2012, impacted by the closure of some showrooms. However, sales are expected to increase again in 2014 as we are improving our conversion rate. In addition, the loss of sales is compensated for by an increase in gross margins, and a decrease in operating expenses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk about the origins of the company?<br></h4><p>The group started in 1978 with a small store in Hamra. We had always been a small business until 1997-1998, when we acquired one of the largest fashion houses. And we have been growing quite rapidly ever since.</p><h4>What have been the most important milestones for the company in terms of brand acquisition and expansion?</h4><p>I think 1997 would be a turning point. That was when we were introduced to the Spanish fashion houses. The first store we opened was Mango and then Zara. We were lucky in acquiring these brands that were sought after by many consumers in other regions. They provided us with an opportunity to grow and expand in the MENA region.</p><h4>How successful has your diversification into the sporting goods sector been?</h4><p>Decathlon is a well-known brand in Europe. If you look at the region, you will find numerous premium sporting goods, and there are a lot of low-priced sporting goods. Decathlon is actually filling the gap quite well. It fits our DNA, our group, and our business model.</p><h4>How is your company looking to leverage your relationship with Virgin?</h4><p>Virgin is an amazing brand and we first opened in a store in Dubai. We felt that our consumers would benefit from having it in the market to contribute to a wider range of product offering at more competitive prices.</p><h4>Could you tell us about your collaboration with regional property developers?</h4><p>We work with many real estate developers. Majid Al-Futtaim Properties and Abdullah Al-Futtaim are two of the largest property developers in the region. We have had relationships with both of them since the 1990s. It was in 1994-1995 when we started in Deira City Center with Majid Al-Futtaim. And we have strengthened these relationships since by working on many other projects, such as the Mall of the Emirates, Mirdif City Center, Bahrain City Center, Mall of Egypt, and the Dubai Festival City Center. We have opened about 20 plus stores as well as Cairo Festival City with Al-Futtaim Group Real Estate. And we are looking forward to operating more stores in Festival City.</p><h4>How do you look to balance the presence of brands across your malls?</h4><p>It depends on the property itself. If it is a large development, over 100,000 sqm in gross-leasable area (GLA), we like to bring a good anchor tenant into our portfolio, which normally requires about 25,000-30,000 sqm. If you look at the Gulf region, malls are actually places where our customers spend a lot of their leisure time. Malls tend to be the winners in the Gulf region.</p><h4>What kind of trends can you see in the industry?</h4><p>I think consumers are looking for affordable, fast fashion. Recent economic conditions mean that people and companies are trading down. The proliferation of malls in the market is a bit more dispersed. The Souks and Solidere zone are becoming quite important. They are now opening cinemas and entertainment centers, which attracts a lot of traffic.</p><h4>Azadea group has a history of corporate social responsibility projects in Lebanon, what are you currently working on?</h4><p>The environment is the cause that every Lebanese citizen can, potentially, benefit from. Therefore, we established the Azadea Foundation to organize and support environmental projects. Currently, we are renovating the largest park in Beirut, René Mouawad, Sanayeh Garden. I hope that there will be more companies that follow our example, and invest profits back into the country.</p><h4>What are Azadea's plans for the next few years?</h4><p>We are looking at expanding into the shoe segment, and are always looking to add new and interesting fashion brands to our existing portfolio. Also, we are moving more into food and beverage formats. We have just opened our first Eataly store in Dubai. The brand is also in Turkey, Japan, and Italy, and there are some more stores to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When and how was the GZA Group established?<br></h4><p>We have a history of over 35 years, and have now consolidated all operations into the GZA Group, which was originally called Zardman and Renaissance Holding. Renaissance deals with the BeitMisk Project, which concerns Misk Town—a 70,000 sqm residential village with retail services. Zardman, on the other hand, has 104 buildings ongoing, and is managed by my children.</p><h4>What was the total investment in the BeitMisk project?</h4><p>The original investment was around $200 million, and the project will take 10 years. In the beginning, we did not need that much equity. I believe that over the coming one or two years, another wave of consolidation will take place. We have some business today in Erbil, in a significant project with an area of 200,000 sqm. We are also in the process of establishing some work in Africa, which will also be a megaproject.</p><h4>How has the business portfolio developed over the past decade?</h4><p>It was in around 2008 that I fully committed to working in real estate. The first major real estate project we did was the retail center at the entrance to the Presidential Palace of Saint Jean. We also worked on two large telecommunications center buildings. There are many buildings like those that we have worked on, but BeitMisk is on a different scale, and occupies well over 50% of my time.</p><h4>What is the range of properties on offer at BeitMisk, and why do you feel it is such a unique project in Lebanon?</h4><p>The properties go from one bedroom to huge villas. There are 2,000 units altogether, and it can accommodate up to 12,000 people. There are currently 400 families living in the project, and we are starting the downtown for BeitMisk in the latter half of 2014. We have an occupancy rate of 100% for the units already built. Many of the apartments that we are still building have also already been sold. We have connected the infrastructure, such as water, telecommunications, internet, and electricity, and the scheme even uses wastewater to irrigate the green areas. This is giving us an edge over the competition, because we have our own security. We have truly mastered all of the energy-related ins and outs. We have achieved zero pollution, as we use both solar and gas energy. Meanwhile, in our scheme you will never see the wiring, and with the lighting, we use a new advanced system that is energy efficient. It is a masterpiece and unique to the region.</p><h4>How much of the entire project is constructed?</h4><p>Almost one-fifth of the town has been constructed so far, and around 400 of the 2,000 units. The rest of the construction will be determined by market demand. The project land is large enough, meaning that we are not obliged to build all the units simultaneously. We are using less than 20% of the total area, meaning that 80% of the land is given over to gardens and green space. Naturally, the downtown area is pedestrianized, and we have a large club with its facilities spread over a 15,000-sqm area. Still, costs have risen slightly since we began construction, which affects the final selling price. We are now selling at 1.5 to 1.8 times the original price, and it is still rising.</p><h4>How would you assess GZA Group's performance over the last year?</h4><p>We are doing well, but we could be doing better. Emaar, the company that built the highest tower in the world, the Burj Khalifa, is assisting us in almost every aspect. As one of the largest companies in the world it has a great deal of experience, which we are leveraging in terms of our cooperation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you seen Abu Dhabi's financial market develop over the years?</h4><p>Every year Abu Dhabi's financial market expands and develops offering more services and products to an ever increasing audience. In the past, investment funds went out of Abu Dhabi into other markets. With the growth of new financial services companies, like ADS Securities, local and international investors are now opening accounts in Abu Dhabi. Today, across a range of asset classes, we have tens of thousands of clients and we trade billions per day. The Chairman of ADS Securities Mahmood Al Mahmood and I came from the same background; we both grew-up in the financial sector. We started on the trading floor, so we understand the whole investment circle. We also complemented each other's skill sets. He is from the institutional side, and I came more from the entrepreneurial side of the business. However, we have both worked across commodities, FX, equities, and a range of instruments and markets both liquid and illiquid. We recognised that after the global financial crisis that Abu Dhabi would have many advantages over other countries. It is a non-political state with strong capitalization; there is a lot of money here. The technology is well advanced and the Emirate is continually investing in its infrastructure. In terms of the Middle East, it is currently the safest place to build, to grow, to do business, and to bring up your family. There are ups and downs, but you feel that you will succeed when you come to Abu Dhabi. You feel that you personally, as well as your company, will grow and prosper. In addition to the development opportunities the leaders have created in the Emirate, there is also its geographical position. For traders we are perfectly placed so between 7.00 am-11.00 am, the market is here. Asia is closing, and Europe is not yet awake. There is thin liquidity, meaning you can execute any kind of intervention, you can set a price, and lead trading. Between 07:00 am and 11:00 am, Abu Dhabi can bridge trading and flows from Asia to Europe and the UK. The market constantly needs liquidity, and at times when this drops, markets are at risk. When we developed ADS Securities no one thought it would work. Now almost on a daily basis we have global financial service leaders visiting, and doing business, in Abu Dhabi.</p><h4>How have you developed your products and services to meet your customers' needs?</h4><p>The priority, of course, is always the client, as well as our counterparties, the banks, and institutions behind us. We are intermediaries; we are in the middle. We use our experience, expertise, and access to find the best service, investment option, deal, or pricing for our clients. Our clients are from all the global markets; Asia, Europe, and MENA, and we are providing more and more services to all these investors. The response here has been incredibly positive. Investors want an Abu Dhabi financial services company that offers international standards of service, with a local knowledge and approach. To meet the needs of our clients our number one focus is regulation. Regulators don't want a company to come and take the business out of their country. We want to work with these jurisdictions so we have opened offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, and London, and we are regulated by the SFC and FCA. Our second focus is technology—to have our servers next to the banks and our hardware close to the liquidity providers—which ensures our clients have very fast and efficient trading. Then, of course, we look in detail at the service and support we provide to our clients. Clients need to feel that you are concerned about them and have the resources to offer whatever they need. Clients today just want efficient trading. They don't want to be concerned about the strength of the company and whether you have the right capitalisation, or the right people to support their investments. I can confirm that we have a lot of clients today, and it is because the clients feel confident to trade with us and that we are a success.</p><div class="quote">“The priority, of course, is always the client."</div><h4>What does your new ADS London office add to your network?</h4><p>Our office in London will initially be focused on our FX, precious metals, and CFD trading business. This is because London is still responsible for trading 41% of the daily $5.3 trillion currency market, so it is essential that we have a regulated business in the UK. Most of the important liquidity providers, our counter parties, and a number of our largest clients are in the City. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is a respected regulator, and we are very pleased that they have accepted ADS Securities to work alongside some of the most important global financial services companies. Before I could be appointed as Chairman of ADS London, along with James Watson, our Managing Director, we had to go through detailed checks from the FCA to ensure that we met the international standards they work to. Having our London and Hong Kong offices means that we are now regulated in three major markets and act as a genuine bridge from the Far East through the Middle East to Europe and on to North America.</p><h4>How has the response been in regards to bringing online trading to the Middle East?</h4><p>We are the first international online trading company headquartered in the Middle East, and the response has been overwhelming. I look at all the awards we have and I am shocked. Every day we have clients willing to trade with us, and we have had a great response. We are a real success story. And we continue to invest in the services we can provide them, including fixed income (bonds), structured products, wealth management, investment banking, and asset management. They like what ADS Securities provides and they want us to grow. People want to put money in ADS and be managed by ADS, because we have qualified people and we have a hands-on approach.</p><h4>What kinds of new technology are you investing in?</h4><p>We have a new platform out called OREX Optim, which is a platform made for all kinds of traders, from bank traders to professional traders. It is a platform that gives you the ability to manage all your assets. It is an easy platform to use; it is quick and highly sophisticated. The whole objective of this platform was to build on the idea of giving our clients excellent execution and putting them in charge of their trades. From having developed the first platform in the region we are now creating global technology firsts for Abu Dhabi; for example, we have implemented the world's first 40 GB FX Ethernet cards. The 40GB network cards allow each tick from multiple liquidity venues to be processed with dramatically reduced delays during volatile market conditions. This option is only available to ADS Securities clients.</p><h4>What are some challenges you expect going forward?</h4><p>The financial services sector is always the most competitive in the world. It is a very challenging industry that can also produce great rewards and, if you are not very careful, also losses. To be able to compete against the main well-known firms that have been building their reputation and businesses for many years is difficult. But, for the reasons we have discussed, we believe that we have a unique and important offer and will work day and night to make sure that this is delivered to the market. Our challenge is to keep making money so that we can keep investing in our people, our technology, and services for our clients. We want to be the best and will strive to achieve this even when markets are difficult and investors are cautious. Our vision has always been to demonstrate that the independent financial services sector in Abu Dhabi has a role to play alongside other similar sectors in the world's leading financial centers.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for ADS in the long term?</h4><p>The near-term goals are to consolidate what we have initiated, such as continuing growth in our global market, wealth management, asset management, fixed income, and investment banking services. In the long run, we want to position ourselves globally as a counterpart and contributor to the international financial industry. I think that Abu Dhabi can play a major role—become a market-maker and price-producer for the industry—across a large number of markets. With a stable foundation of people, capital, technology, and regulation in a stable and secure country, Abu Dhabi has all the building blocks for success.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your major achievements over the past 10 years?</h4><p>Around 10 years ago we came to Dubai for the Palm Jumeirah, Villas-Garden Homes project. I still remember that when I looked at the master plan of Palm Jumeirah I felt it was like a dream, which really attracted me. By 2007 we had finished 65% villas on the Palm Jumeirah successfully. From there, we started to take large and more complex orders like Sheikh Khalifa Specialist Hospital and the Doha Tower in Qatar, which is considered one of the highest-quality construction projects in the world as the winning project of Best Tall Building Worldwide. And we are also delighted to see our involvement in Abu Dhabi New Airport Project as main contractor in the infrastructure and specialist in the steel structure and mechanical package. So far, we have completed over $4.3 billion in projects across the region and involved in the Viceroy Hotel project, which is our first instance as a developer in the region.</p><h4>What is the primary focus going forward?</h4><p>First of all, our focus is on investment opportunities as the competition is less intense and less risky if we make the right choices. Secondly, we focus on the infrastructure sector such as major highways, railways, and airport projects in the region. Particularly, we have been actively participating in GCC railway projects and major airport projects such as in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. Hopefully we are able to participate in Dubai's Al Maktoum Airport as well. We believe that as China State Construction, with its proven track record of 40 airports around the world, we have a better chance to ensure the quality and timely handing of megaprojects. Especially after 10 years in the Middle East, we have a better understanding and the financial capability to contribute and help the government build first-class infrastructure.</p><div class="quote">“For our company, it is a transition to start investing in the Middle East."</div><h4>What is the importance of your partnership with SKAI Holding?</h4><p>It's certainly a milestone. For our company, it is a transition to start investing in the Middle East, although it is nothing new to us as China State Construction, one of the biggest development and investment companies in the Chinese market. To further diversify our business, it is important to shift our focus more toward development and investment. We take the Viceroy Hotel as the first step and we believe in the partnership with SKAI Holding, where we are managing the development smoothly with great trust and synergy. We are very confident that we are going to deliver the project ahead of schedule and certainly continue the same business model.</p><h4>How important is it to continue that type of partnership on other investment opportunities?</h4><p>The combination and synergy of this joint venture produced very good results. First of all, we are able to fully control the whole supply chain from design development, marketing and sales, project finance, construction, as well as maintenance. We followed through the whole processes with our partner, which generates confidence in the market. Second, to any buyers, they are not just looking at our great combination of local and international experience, but also the financial strengths that we are able to add during development to ensure projects are not affected by any potential financial turmoil. In any development, timely delivery is always a challenge; however, this is something that we are always very confident about. I think this kind of model will bring us more deals in the region.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the construction sector in the lead up to Expo 2020?</h4><p>The Expo 2020 will definitely provide contractors with more opportunities. The government will increase its budget to further complete and improve infrastructure. Compared with the neighboring countries in the GCC, Dubai probably has the best infrastructure. Nevertheless, the population is increasing rapidly. Rapid population growth has created pressure on the existing infrastructure. With the Expo 2020 attracting tens of millions of visitors, infrastructure will become extremely crucial to Dubai. We have noticed that the authorities are also building more theme parks and other leisure facilities. Of course, Expo 2020 itself is a project similar to one we experienced in Shanghai at Expo 2010, where we have built dozen of pavilions for various countries. Also, we believe Expo 2020 will bring positive to the image of Dubai and bring more business opportunities in the hospitality sector. I believe that the tourism and hospitality sectors will be booming in the coming years. With so many interesting destinations, visitors will be coming here more often. Today, Dubai has become a metropolis where people find all kinds of reasons such as business, holidays, shopping, and more to pay a visit. It is clear that visitors tend to stay longer here and spend more. Certainly, Expo 2020 will reinforce our confidence in the hospitality sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the investment climate in Dubai over the next year or two?</h4><p>We will all feel the effect of falling crude oil prices. Concern over its impact on the UAE will always be there, as it is one of the major oil-supplying countries. However, I don't think it will have a major impact on the country's spending. Dubai has not depended on oil for many years. After it further improves its infrastructure and assumes new projects to be built, we will see the market grow. The property market was really booming in 2013 and made Dubai one of the world leading property markets. However, it has stabilized in 2014, which I read as a positive message for long-term, sustainable growth. Consolidation is always required if prices increase too quickly. Generally, it is good to see that Dubai is recovering from the last financial crisis and coming back on the right track. In the coming one to two years, we should see something more positive, especially with the improvement of the business environment in Iran, which I believe will probably bring in more business opportunities to the UAE.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your performance in the last five years and how has the car industry in Zambia evolved?</h4><p>Zambia's new vehicle industry has been growing at a slow pace over the past five years from 3,500 units a year to about 4,500 in 2013. The 2014 forecast is 4,700 units. Economists have a highly optimistic growth outlook of about a 20%, which should take the total market size to 6,500 units by 2017. Nevertheless, compared to the second-hand imported vehicles market, it is still a relatively small amount—there were about 40,000 grey imports in 2013. General Motors South Africa (GMSA) has supported us in introducing the Chevrolet Brand for Africa in 2010, allowing us to participate in the passenger segment through providing off-road ready SUVs and reasonably priced saloon cars. In 2013, we were market leaders in the saloon new vehicle sales segment, which is a big achievement as the majority of used vehicle imports are in fact passenger saloon vehicles.</p><h4>To what do you owe your growth?</h4><p>Although many of the new vehicle sales are owed to government purchases, we have seen a growth in purchases from private consumers and businesses. Also, thanks to a number of macro-economic developments taking place in the country, a growing middle class, and the introduction of vehicle finance by commercial banks and other financial lenders as well as a reduction in interest rates, our market share doubled in 2013. Coupled with a rigorous marketing campaign with the support of GMSA through advertising in a variety of media outlets, including social media, we partner with organizations such as the Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) and the American Chamber of Commerce, which have successfully helped in promoting the Chevrolet and Isuzu Brands. In addition, throughout the year, we sponsor a number of events with the aim of bringing families together, such as the Urban Circus. Most importantly, Action Auto's commitment to providing customer service of the highest standard through following the GM Difference Standards have also helped in creating a number of life-long customers. A significant percentage of our sales are generated from word-of-mouth endorsements and the enthusiasm of our existing customers, some of whom own four or five generations of the Isuzu KB.</p><div class="quote">“Current legislature allows for second-hand vehicles from Japan and the UK to be imported into Zambia."</div><h4>Which of your products has the biggest demand?</h4><p>The Isuzu KB pickup has been and still remains our biggest brand in terms of sales volume. The Isuzu KB has a legendary and iconic status for its toughness and dependable performance, whilst offering versatility and comfort. It is designed and engineered to deliver each time you are behind the wheel, and most importantly built to endure rough roads and terrain. Although the Chevrolet Brand has grown in popularity, a major factor is price. In Zambia, the duty is less on a utility vehicle like the Isuzu compared to a passenger vehicle. Compounded taxes on utility vehicles are about 46%, and on a saloon car or a station wagon they are 94%. This makes the price difference quite substantial and therefore also contributes to the sales in volume.</p><h4>Second-hand car sales pose a big threat to the new car market in Zambia. What strategies are you following to compete with this industry?</h4><p>Current legislature allows for second-hand vehicles from Japan and the UK to be imported into Zambia aimed at affording the average citizen the opportunity to own a vehicle. Over 40,000 grey units were imported in 2013. Regrettably, a large percentage of these units are ill equipped for African requirements and, in most cases, over 10 years old, and this unfortunately has contributed to an increase in road traffic accidents. Our strategy is to offer vehicles with constantly improving technology made specifically for African weather, terrain, and road conditions. Our after-sales support, service kits, parts and accessories are also restricted to GMSA-sourced vehicles.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Banco Popular celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014, highlighting its leading position in the Dominican market. How has the Bank grown since its foundation and what do you consider its landmark achievement?</h4><p>Banco Popular has always worked side by side with Dominicans, contributing and accompanying national growth and development over the past 50 years. Our institution rose from the Asociación para el Desarrollo, Inc. (APEDI), whose management was led by Alejandro E. Grullón E. and a group of accomplished professionals and businessmen from the city of Santiago. These men also created other national development institutions across the economic, regulatory, social, educational and cultural spheres. Banco Popular opened its doors to the public on January 2, 1964. It was inaugurated as the country's first commercial private bank and thus began an outstanding trajectory of contributions in support of economic growth, the democratization of financial services, diversification, and modernization of products and banking services.</p><h4>The banking sector in the Dominican Republic is developing into an intensively competitive market with many well-established local and international players. How does Banco Popular distinguish itself from the competitors and what market segments are you targeting?</h4><p>Throughout Banco Popular's 50 years it has cultivated deeps roots among the Dominican people. It has grown organically with the industry and has established a vast customer base over the years. The institution's services cater to all segments within the industry, from children with a savings account to multinational companies seeking new investments. Over the past decade the country has grown significantly, and with this growth a large number of international capital has found the opportunities to invest in the country. Banco Popular has recognized this change and adapted to the current landscape creating different business segments within its structure. Among many areas in which we have innovated is tourism, where a division is focused solely on catering to the needs of this demanding segment. Institutional Banking is an area catering solely to local and international regulated industries and government entities. Corporate Banking is a division focused on high net-worth clients of more than $5 million in revenue. Investment Banking is the newest division with three years in effect, and is responsible for several projects involving local and international investors. Some of the biggest international projects include M&amp;A, Interest Rate Swap, and the Syndications and Debt Issuance of major multinationals within the tourism and oil industries. Our Subagente Popular network is a pioneering new channel for financial inclusion, allowing hundreds of thousands of Dominicans access to banking services. Currently, we have a network of nearly 300 banking sub-agents throughout the country. Other financial inclusion initiatives have involved work with the nation's main telephone companies, where we have implemented the option of card-free ATM withdrawals, or without a pre-paid virtual account, by means of a mobile phone, which allows thousands of people to have a bank account and withdraw money without a card, and without having to be a customer of the formal financial system. Impulsa Popular is our end-to-end support initiative for the SMS sector, which includes a range of financial products and services, and training programs, discussion forums, and digital tools that promote them, regardless of whether or not they are a client of Banco Popular. The object of this initiative is to strengthen this sector, which is essential for the sustainable development of the Dominican economy. This initiative has been recognized by the Asociación de Industrias de la República Dominicana (AIRD), which is the Dominican Association of Industries. Meanwhile, Pro-Exporta Popular is a groundbreaking proposal to comprehensively support Dominican exporters, especially SMEs that seek an international presence. In addition to the financial tools that assist export, we offer support and advice throughout the whole internationalization process as well as training workshops and educational materials.</p><div class="quote">“Ever since its creation half a century ago, Banco Popular has developed and supported the industry's growth."</div><h4>What is Banco Popular's role in the development of the Dominican tourism industry?</h4><p>Ever since its creation half a century ago, Banco Popular has developed and supported the industry's growth. In fact, for many years our institution was the first and only bank that loaned funds to the Tourism industry. In 2007 we created a groundbreaking area specialized in catering to the specific needs of this thriving industry. In over a decade, Banco Popular has financed over Ps1.4 billion. In 2013 Banco Popular was responsible for over 61% of credits to this sector with a nominal amount of $13.5 million. Last year, the Asociacion de Hoteles y Turismo de la Republica Dominicana (ASONAHORES), the Hotel and Tourism Association in the Dominican Republic, recognized our institution as the Tourism Bank.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2015</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When you accepted the post of Prime Minister for Lebanon's cabinet of national unity in February 2014, what were your priorities for consensus building and structural reform of the Lebanese economy?<br></h4><p>History has shown that Lebanon can only be governed by consensus. We are at our best when all parties rally around a cause or jointly agree on how to address a particular issue or a set of issues. Accordingly, given the divisiveness that characterized the political environment at the time, it seemed imperative to seek a common platform to which all parties could be drawn, which took time. During that period, economic difficulties were becoming more acute, and the impact of the Syrian crisis and regional disturbances were weighing heavier on Lebanon. First and foremost, as is typically the case in Lebanon, it is essential to establish a minimum level of security accompanied by political stability if business activity is to regain momentum, and we have been successful at that despite what took place recently between the Lebanese Armed Forces and terrorists that infiltrated from Syria. Simultaneously, we are trying to trigger growth through a set of policy proposals relating to infrastructure and services. This Cabinet may not have the time to complete major reforms, but it will pave the way and point the decision-making process in the right direction.</p><h4>How successful has your cabinet been in addressing these priorities and building consensus?</h4><p>Success is measured by results, and our government has achieved a lot in a short space of time, especially when such achievements are measured in a relative perspective. By way of illustration, we have implemented an exhaustive security plan that has made a fundamental contribution to overall stability. Another practical example is that we have proceeded with over 40 nominations in key positions in various administrations, a process that had been paralyzed for many years. In addition, we have passed several important decrees that were not only indispensable for the resumption of smooth operational procedures and the elimination of bottlenecks, but also vital for the support of private sector initiatives and investments. We remain, however, constrained from going radically forward because of the vacancy in the Presidency of the Republic and delays in legislative action.</p><h4>How important is the continued formation of Lebanon's cabinet for attracting FDI and for the proper functioning of the private sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>It is a known fact that investment flows are almost perfectly correlated with political stability and economic visibility. What is remarkable is that we have been able to maintain the macro-economic reality and the level of activity we have despite all the unsettling events that surround us. This demonstrates that market confidence in the resilience of Lebanon remains high, and that, as in the past, growth will not fail to bounce back as soon as the political uncertainties start to dissipate.</p><h4>How is Lebanon strengthening its international and regional trade links and working to improve its competitiveness in core sectors of the economy?</h4><p>Much remains to be done in this area. We have left unaddressed for many years major issues relating to helping our main productive sectors become more cost-effective, competitive, and productive while safeguarding our environment. On the trade front, there is need to reinforce the implementation of existing agreements and to conclude many new ones with countries and groups of countries that offer appealing opportunities for our products. What is sure is that we are not sufficiently capitalizing on the Lebanese abroad. The substantial potential they represent constitutes a great asset in enhancing the probability of success for all economic initiatives.</p><h4>In what ways have your attempts to moderate the country politically precluded the strengthening of core sectors of the economy, and particularly the fields of telecommunications, energy, and water?</h4><p>It is true that ensuring political cohesion consumes a lot of energy. Nonetheless, we are examining adequate reform proposals in all the fields you have mentioned. One such solution is public-private partnerships (PPPs), which will allow us to share risks and enhance service quality by bringing in the private sector to do what it does best.</p><h4>What will be the next steps in introducing independent power producer (IPP) schemes in the electricity, telecommunications, and water sectors? How strong are the investment prospects that will be presented by such partnerships?</h4><p>IPP solutions are already available in Lebanon. A national plan organizing the energy sector was approved by the government three years ago, and is gradually being implemented. Other opportunities exist in the water sector, and in tourism infrastructure and facilities, for example. We also expect demand to be boosted when oil and gas companies start to set up their business operating platforms in view of their offshore exploration and production activities. Finally, we expect a lot from revived capital markets that will help in financing domestic companies.</p><h4>Which structural deficiencies in Lebanese politics and the economy have been exacerbated most by the Syrian refugee crisis?</h4><p>Politically, from the onset of the crisis, there has been a polarization around regional issues that have caused a divide. I feel, however, that this is behind us now because of the immediate domestic concerns the government and the body politic is immersed in, and also because of the multiplicity and complexity of the regional events and their consequences on Lebanon. As for the economy, Lebanon has always managed to correct imbalances through a vibrant private sector. In addition, at the public sector level, there is now a high level of consciousness regarding the need for greater fiscal discipline and an amicable framework for foreign investments.</p><h4>How effective has international assistance and aid been in offsetting the negative affects the influx of Syrian refugees has caused to the Lebanese economy?</h4><p>We do not characterize the Syrians who escaped the fighting in their country by coming to Lebanon as “refugees." They are temporarily displaced people that we have welcomed for humanitarian reasons. Having said that, it is obvious that no country can absorb a third of its population in less than 18 months without major economic and social trauma. The needs to keep afloat the Lebanese economy as a result of this influx are massive and have been estimated by the World Bank at $7 billion. No aid package of this magnitude can be put together in months, especially in the difficult times traditional donor countries are living through nowadays. Consequently, an imaginative approach is needed based on the following paradigms: one, this is not a traditional crisis. It is expected to be a protracted affair that will take many shapes and, hence, is going to require adapted, evolving responses. Two, humanitarian aid alone cannot possibly be the answer. What is needed is support for a structural development policy that will inject aid into vital sectors.</p><h4>In a time of great change political and social upheaval in the region, what kind of geopolitical role do you want Lebanon to play?</h4><p>We believe that Lebanon should always remain, no matter the cost, a haven for all those who cherish freedom and those who seek refuge from oppression. It should also continue to be an example of liberalism, and of an open economy. Those elements combined make it truly unique. It is this uniqueness that will allow Lebanon to play a much larger geopolitical role than its size and means may suggest it could.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are a proponent of economic diplomacy. Could you tell us what this entails for Lebanon?<br></h4><p>We are not reinventing the wheel. Economic diplomacy is a well-known concept; however, it was never before present in Lebanon. The country's largest asset, which provides the greatest added value to Lebanon, is the Lebanese diaspora, and yet we are not really benefiting from this asset as much as it is needed. Economic diplomacy will enable us to reach out to this diaspora, in order to deliver Lebanese products to our immigrants, and, thereby, increase Lebanese exports. Also, we want the Lebanese diaspora to become more involved in the Lebanese economy and to invest in their motherland. However, large and influential Lebanese communities in many major economies around the world can help Lebanon and Lebanese producers, exporters, and businessmen gain more of a foothold in those countries, opening up chances for more opportunities, thanks to the large networks of Lebanese immigrants, who are successful industrialists, politicians, and businessmen in the countries where they live.</p><h4>During your recent trip to Brazil you were focusing on efforts to establish a preferential trade agreement between Lebanon and the Mercosur countries. How hopeful are you that this can be accomplished?</h4><p>I am positive because we got the strong approval from Brazil, confirmed by the vice-president and the foreign minister. We have a large lobby there, and we also got approval from other embassies here from Mercosur. We are now looking forward to start negotiations. There are 10 million Lebanese living in those five Mercosur countries, which is three times the population of Lebanon itself. We raise this issue on every official visit to any country with a Lebanese diaspora. Referring to these visits, I don't just meet with foreign ministers, but also other ministers in specific fields such as agriculture, industry, energy, and trade, and others.</p><h4>What measures is Lebanon taking to maintain the sovereignty of its borders, and to what extent is it working with the international community?</h4><p>We have effective coordination with foreign intelligence agencies, especially in terms of finding and preventing terrorist acts. We have patriotic and skilled armed forces with the necessary tools to face the threat of terrorism. Anything we stop here is stopped from reaching Europe, because the forces we need to be vigilant about are not only local but also international organizations. Hence, we need assistance, and we need international cooperation. Terrorism knows no borders, and the meltdown in Syria and Iraq is particularly worrisome. There are over 84 nationalities now in Syria. If we don't deal with the situation properly, those people will go back and create problems in 84 countries.</p><h4>Given the social and political changes throughout the region, what kind of role do you think Lebanon can and should play?</h4><p>Lebanon has a major message simply by virtue of its existence, which is the variety of people from different races, faiths, social habits, and cultures can coexist. Lebanon proves this kind of coexistence is possible and that dialogue is the way to deal with difference, not conflict. Lebanon can become the launching pad for this kind of approach in the region. If Lebanon fails, then there will be a divisive and volatile process that won't just be contained to this region, because Europe will definitely be the second phase of the regional conflict. Once certain forces get a foothold here, they will expand into Europe. We have to stop those movements here while we can; we have to extirpate these terrorist groups here in the Middle East. Lebanon should be encouraged as a haven of stability where there is a great potential for business, such as the oil and gas reserves we have, which could spread stability in Lebanon, not to mention the involved, dynamic population that we have. However, if we don't realize these opportunities and instead head toward a conflict of civilizations, then this will not only threaten the opportunities and investments in Lebanon, but also the whole region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Denmark has a long history trading with Lebanon. What are the pillars of this bilateral trade?<br></h4><p>Over the years, trade between our countries has grown dramatically. In 2013, Danish exports to Lebanon reached a value of almost $150 million. Pharmaceuticals and sea transport services account for 40% of Danish exports to Lebanon. Looking ahead, I see huge potential in the energy market—both conventional and renewable. Lebanon needs to invest in its energy infrastructure and to utilize its conventional as well as renewable energy resources. Denmark has a global brand and cutting-edge technology in this field. A Danish engineering company, BWSC, recently entered the Lebanese market and boosted Danish-Lebanese business cooperation by building two new major power plants worth $350 million. A world-leading Danish windmill producer is now looking to enter the market.</p><h4>What are the key trade trends and potential areas of investment for Danish companies in Lebanon?</h4><p>There are, of course, many interesting investment opportunities in Lebanon. It has an excellent, educated, skilled, and dynamic work force, as well as a good business environment—and the country has consumers interested in the solutions Danish companies can provide. Lebanon also serves as a bridge to the region. Investment in Lebanon is challenging, however, because of the political uncertainty. Still, even now in these uncertain times, investors are entering the market. As indicated by the equity market, there is growing confidence among Lebanese companies about the prospects for consumer demand. Also, the Lebanese economy has previously demonstrated the capacity to bounce back quickly after poor years. Still, Danish companies are looking for more improvements in terms of a more transparent and safe environment for their investments and business contracts.</p><h4>Following Vestas being awarded the first contract to install turbines in Jordan, will it look to execute similar renewable energy projects in Lebanon?</h4><p>I believe Lebanon has a great potential in renewable energy projects. Measurements by Vestas as well as the Wind Atlas of Lebanon from 2011 financed by the UN Development Group and UNDP clearly show this. Vestas has been through the technical prequalification process in Lebanon, and is committed, together with Lebanese stakeholders to develop a wind farm project in the country within a range of 60 MW connected to an existing grid in the Akkar area.</p><h4>Denmark is the per capita highest aid donor in the world. How has this aid been distributed in the case of Lebanon and supporting it against the spillover effects of the Syrian conflict?</h4><p>The Danish government is deeply concerned about the refugee crisis and its impact on neighboring countries, in particular Lebanon. We are aware of the heavy burden the Lebanese people and host communities are shouldering and remain committed to offer our support in the short as well the long term. The Danish government is one of the largest donors providing substantial funding to humanitarian appeals and international humanitarian agencies such as the UNHCR, UNICEF, and UNRWA in Lebanon. To date we have committed more than $119 million in humanitarian assistance to help the victims of the Syrian crisis.</p><h4>How you do you intend to facilitate greater cooperation at the SME level between Lebanese and Danish companies?</h4><p>We need to support SMEs in developing in the right direction and equipping them with tools that enable them to become export-oriented. This is so crucial because SMEs are the soul of our economies. A great deal of effort has been allocated by the Danish Trade Council to support Danish SMEs and explore foreign markets, including Lebanon. In the framework of Denmark's broader engagement with the regional “The Danish-Arab Partnership Program," we have initiated a project allocating substantial funds to support SMEs in the Arab countries. Lebanon is a key partner in this framework.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How effective has the Banque du Liban (BDL) stimulus plan, introduced in November 2013, been in creating growth?<br></h4><p>In 2013, approximately $1.5 billion was injected into the Lebanese economy by BDL, our central bank. This had, of course, a great impact and allowed growth to reach between 1% and 1.5%, despite all various internal and external complications. It is worth mentioning that this $1.5 billion targeted several sectors; however, it was mainly used to prop up the real estate industry. The real estate sector has great potential for the future. We have low rates if you benchmark them with the region and our surroundings. Lebanon offers a great return on investment at that level. My disappointment was in regard to renewables, where, if I recall, 2.6% of the funds available were invested in the sector, while the rest went into real estate. It was not a problem, but a disappointment because I am a strong believer in renewable energy. In 2014, we will inject a further $800 million. Expectations are good, despite everything. We should reach 2.74% growth if everything is positive until the end of 2014. They expect that, with political stability, Lebanon could achieve 4.5% growth over 2014.</p><h4>What do you feel the priorities should be in the Lebanese economy to reduce the deficit?</h4><p>There are three main priorities today. First of all, we have the Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which is like an open wound in the country, costing us directly almost $1.7 billion per year. The second big wound we have is at the energy level, especially electricity, because when I talk energy, I like to talk about electricity, renewables, and water (ERW), but I will strictly talk about electricity. The cost of electricity per year to Lebanon is $2 billion. If you put together the cost of electricity and the cost of the Syrian crisis, they are draining $3 billion plus from the economy annually. The third problem is waste and corruption. Waste is about how we are losing money for nothing. If we just manage these three points, we can manage the entire Lebanese economy in just one year's time. However, we need support on all three levels. On the first level, we have some commitment from the international stage, and we should have a clear plan for the Syrian refugees. On the second point, we should have a clear plan on how to exit from the electricity problem that we have, especially by implementing the public-private partnership (PPP) approach. On the third point, the Lebanese government should do something specifically about the ports and airports, so as to end the waste of money on customs. In essence, we need better customs management. The third one is the easiest, and we should achieve it in a matter of weeks. On the second point, in July 2014 we had a meeting with the privatization council that is tackling the problem of PPPs. We reached several main decisions to achieve better management over this area. This includes electricity, telecommunications, and water, but the main focus would be electricity as the first step. If you can arrange this sector, you can use the funds we are losing for investments, for example on railroads.</p><h4>What would you like to see as the next concrete step in the electricity and telecommunication sectors?</h4><p>The next step would be to tackle the legal aspect, because we don't have anything on that level. If we can tackle the legal aspect first, we can achieve almost 50% of the road map to reach this, mainly on the electricity front. For telecommunications, we still have a sort of duopoly in Lebanon. Also during the council of ministers meeting, we were discussing how to open this sector up to a third-party operator owned by the government, Liban Telecom, and how to implement this to achieve better services and prices, and to reduce the monopoly element in the sector. This is how we can liberate both electricity and telecoms through PPPs. It should be a similar process for both.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of a year has 2014 been for Lebanese tourism?<br></h4><p>In 2010, we had roughly 2.3 million visitors, and in 2013 there were 1.3 million visitors. There was a sharp decline during this government and at the beginning of the crisis in Syria. The country arrived at the end of 2013 in a very uncertain state. Now, in 2014, there are many things happening. The most important is that there is now a political will, though not an agreement, on security. At the same time, there was a regional and international consensus to protect the stability of Lebanon. It was not a political agreement, but it was a truce. The results were amazing, security-wise, and consequently we are seeing potential visitors expressing an interest in coming to Lebanon again.</p><h4>How did you reach out to the Gulf states?</h4><p>We went to the Gulf states and asked them to look at what we were doing, after that the relationship with these countries improved, and the tourists started coming back. The government was formed at the end of February 2014. The tourism figures in January, February, and March 2014 were not good, but since April, they have been rising. In Beirut before Ramadan, the occupancy rate at our major hotels was between 90% and 100%. The Phoenician was at 103%. Before the terrorist attack, June 2014 was a good month. The month of Ramadan is never strong in terms of occupancy, so we were expecting about 50% capacity. Reservations after the month of Ramadan were around 15% higher than in 2013. Planes were so fully booked that Middle East Airlines (MEA) put 40 extra flights on to Riyadh for the season. In addition, the Ministry of Tourism launched a new website in April 2014. We put 60-70 packages on offer because for the previous two years, travel agencies had been exporting tourists. Now, we have some new packages for under $1,000 for one week, with some help from Middle East Airlines (MEA) on better tariffs. Lebanon has some assets that are unique. We go in and create packages for religious tourism, for example. We also have themed travel packages relating to wine, honey, apples, and even silk; alternative tourism is part of our national strategy for 2014. We strive to be modern and dynamic and express the feeling that something new is happening for tourism in Lebanon. This is what we have managed to do, through the website, through our campaign, and with these new packages. We are also trying to energize tourism outside Beirut, even though the tourism infrastructure and assets in Beirut are excellent. Currently we have 60-80 small hotels available, but we think we can bring this up to 200 in the villages.</p><h4>What kind of a role do you feel the Ministry of Tourism has to play in what some commentators have called economic diplomacy, with the Lebanese diaspora and the rest of the world?</h4><p>I think the Tourism Ministry has a role in highlighting our potential. The private sector in Lebanon is dynamic; it sees potential and it acts. Lebanon has to promote itself, which requires both an overarching strategy, and also small strategies for, say, medical tourism and green/ecotourism. Furthermore, other parts of the Middle East don't have the different regions that we can offer in Lebanon. And regional tourism development brings in revenue for the municipalities and regional administrations. You also have clients who are expatriates and it is important to create micro strategies for these segments of the market. For instance, you have a lot of people coming from, say, Tunisia for the nightlife here. We also need to develop a micro strategy for the casinos of Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did AC Holding become a key part of Samsung's entry into the Lebanese market?</h4><p>When CTC was founded in 1979, we used to act as an appliance business and agent for some European brands. A few years later, we acquired the Samsung distribution rights at a time when Samsung was an unknown brand, and founded Samsung Cherfane Tawil &amp; Co. (Samsung CTC). From there, we have evolved throughout the years.</p><h4>How have your product and service lines evolved?</h4><p>After washing machines, Samsung started with microwaves and color televisions. From there, it started expanding into air conditioning units, and then automatic washers and refrigerators. By 2000, we had begun to diversify a little into real estate, and we also had the distribution rights for a few other small brands. From 2002 onward, we focused on diversification and, in the past 10 years, we have evolved drastically. We are now a highly diversified, international group with operations in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the UAE, and Ghana.</p><h4>How have your distribution networks expanded geographically?</h4><p>The consumer electronics business in Lebanon has changed drastically. Previously, it was focused on small players scattered throughout the country, rather than on a few big players with a large chunk of the market. The real maturity in the distribution network happened in the early 2000s. At the time, we had one sales manager handling the majority of consumer electronics products, whereas today we operate under specialized business units.</p><h4>How did you diversify into real estate?</h4><p>It happened by chance. Some of our clients had financial issues, so they offered us some real estate instead of closing on their dues. We formed a company in 1988, called Hadath Real Estate, and managed to grow from there.</p><h4>What were the main reasons behind the development of your training and consultancy wing?</h4><p>The move into training and consultancy under PROSEED was one of our recent expansions, and was aimed at better coordinating the synergies between our different companies, as well as offering these services to other holding companies.</p><h4>What are your diversification plans on the energy efficiency front?</h4><p>We are focusing a lot on renewable energy. We have a sister company called Solec that focuses on that segment, so we have a lot of projects going on and we are working with governments and NGOs. We are working with wind energy, solar energy, and even energy saving through LED lighting.</p><h4>To what extent do you see this market developing in the coming years?</h4><p>In a country like Lebanon, it should develop. We have a serious electricity problem, plus we are a country that gets close to 300 days of sun every year. Although we lost the Beirut River Solar Snake project tender, there are many other projects coming up. Some of our regions like Akkar have good zoning for wind energy. Plus, with the help of the EU and some NGOs, we are seeing a big push by the government and are supported by the banking sector to progress with renewable energy projects. Solec does not only handle government, tender, or corporate business, it also handles the consumer side of the renewables business.</p><h4>What other innovative projects are you developing?</h4><p>We are also present in the mobile applications market. We have a sister company called CodeFish App, which is developing and pushing apps. We developed an app for ANB Mazda, and the company is now looking to replicate it for its various distributors around the world. We are also in the TV app business, and have developed local TV apps for MTV, Flair, Beiruting, and more.</p><h4>How do you plan to expand your product lines and operations over the next year?</h4><p>We want to diversify our businesses further, and already own several outdoor LED networks. We do kitchen fittings, mostly from Italy with a company called Cesar, which is also under AC Holding. With Samsung, we are focusing on the solutions business and other products, particularly B2B. We want to provide security solutions through Samsung, while also continuing to develop renewable energy with Samsung SDI.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the continued deficit in the balance of payments and falling capital inflows affecting the profitability and net returns of the Lebanese banking sector?<br></h4><p>Though we had a deficit in the balance of payments for the last three consecutive years—2011, 2012, and 2013—and in the amounts of $2 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively, we believe that this shrinking deficit trend is likely to be discontinued over 2014. In fact, we had a surplus in the balance of payments in 1Q2014 of $301 million. In any case, the shift from a $3.3 billion surplus in the balance of payments in 2010 to a deficit of $2 billion in 2011 was associated with a drop in the profits of banks by 3.4%, then the profits slightly declined by 0.6% in the following year to increase by 4% in 2013 to the equivalent of $1.6 billion. It would seem, therefore, that the banks were able to adjust quickly to the new environment and minimize the adverse effects.</p><h4>How exposed do you perceive Lebanon's top banks to be to the country's public debt risk?</h4><p>The total claims of commercial banks on the public sector stabilized recently at 22.8% of total assets, while the share of foreign currency denominated claims is at 10.5%. We believe that this level of exposure is manageable, with the weighted life on government debt securities denominated in LBP close to 3.4 years, and that on securities denominated in foreign currencies around 5.5 years. Nevertheless, the banks are continuously pressing the government to speed up the needed reforms to keep on financing part of the government deficit; otherwise, they will only roll over existing debt.</p><h4>In what ways is the Association of Bankers in Lebanon (ABL) working to combat money laundering in the local banking sector?</h4><p>Combating organized crime and money laundering were high on the agenda of talks between the ABL Board of Directors and Interpol on January 28, 2014. ABL's Board reviewed these issues with the Secretary General of Interpol Ronald Noble and his accompanying delegation, and both sides agreed to strengthen areas of cooperation to better combat financial crimes, such as money laundering and terrorist financing. Such talks follow similar regular discussions with the US Treasury and some US congressmen to assure compliance with the latest international regulations on Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing (AML/CFT). Lebanon is not and has never been a part of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) list of jurisdictions that are either subject to counter measures by the international regulatory bodies, or ones that have made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies in AML/CFT, or ones that have only recently provided a high level of political commitment to address deficiencies.</p><h4>Lebanon is ahead of many countries in the region in meeting US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) conditions and requirements. What conditions and requirements have been met and are still to be met?</h4><p>The ABL developed early on a manual of policies and procedures for compliance with the US FATCA regulation with the valuable assistance of Deloitte for the banking sector. It covered many key points, which include the qualifications or competencies of the responsible officer, and a checklist for all pre-requisite actions for a bank to become compliant. Banks are constantly raising awareness of the issue to employees and customers. The IT departments are effecting the necessary cost changes and modifications, and many banks have started to register with the IRS. A questionnaire for FATCA compliance readiness was developed and circulated by the ABL recently. The responses were positive in terms of the appointment of a project sponsor and a responsible officer. A FATCA steering committee is also in place as well as the procedures for opening new accounts incorporating FATCA requirements. Overall, most banks are ready and will hopefully comply fully by the due date.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the last financial year for Bank Audi?</h4><p>Last year was a good financial year for Bank Audi. Within a challenging operating environment, consolidated assets reached $36.2 billion at end-December 2013, registering a growth of 15.6% relative to 2012. As a result, Bank Audi continues to have an undisputed leadership position in the Lebanese banking sector in terms of all business criteria and to reinforce its position among the top 20 Arab banks, whereby it reported the third highest activity growth rate among top Arab banks in 2013. The growth in the bank's activity was not realized at the detriment of its financial standing. Primary liquidity placed with central banks and foreign banks reached $12.6 billion, representing 40.4% of customers' deposits, an elevated level when compared to regional and global averages. At the loan quality level, gross doubtful loans accounted for only 2.8% of gross loans, with the coverage of those loans by specific and collective loan loss provisions reaching 95% at end-December 2013. In parallel, the Bank's Basel III capital adequacy ratio stood at 12.1% at end-2013, against a 10.5% minimum regulatory requirement. At the profitability level, Bank Audi's net earnings reached $305 million in 2013. The Bank's recent results reflect the strategic orientations set by management so that the group remains ready to seize opportunities for the development of activities and expansion in better rated new countries, ensuring added value to all stakeholders within its customers' and shareholders' base. On the back of the bank's recent financial and business achievements, Bank Audi looks at the future optimistically. The Bank is steadily growing toward its objective to become one of the most diversified regional banks by both business lines and countries of presence in a regional landscape that still lacks full-fledged, well-diversified regional banks at large.</p><h4>What do you think the ratio of activity abroad to total activity change says about the dynamics of the Lebanese and regional finance sector?</h4><p>You can see in 2014 that 55% of our assets are in Lebanon, down from 71% in 2010 and 88% in 2005, which highlights the success of our cross border expansion strategy despite the overall tough regional operating conditions of the past few years. This means we have 45% of our assets abroad, of which half are tied to our operations in Turkey. Those ratios are much lower in terms of loans, whereby we have 40% of our consolidated loan portfolio only in Lebanon, and the remaining 60% abroad. We would have over 40% of our profits coming outside Lebanon when we normalize the contribution from Turkey from a current negative contribution tied to the acceptable time lag between operating expenses and expected revenues in greenfield operations. As such, the first results of our strategy were quite enticing and encouraging despite the adverse environment of the past three years. We have been able, in less than three years of average activity, to build close to $6.3 billion of regional assets that almost stabilized during the Arab Spring years. Despite the tough conditions that some countries are currently witnessing, the Bank remains dedicated to its regional expansion policy, which is anchored on continuing to grow the customer and account franchise in new markets with potential for high growth in financial services over the medium term. We also entered Turkey at the right time. It was triggered by our view that a presence in Turkey is complementary to our regional presence. The license was provided after the outbreak of the Arab Spring, so it came at an excellent time to compensate for any delay in the revamped business plan. Due to the size of the Turkish market and the fact that our operating model in Turkey is proving to be successful, we will be more than offsetting the relative delay, the end result being considerable to the Group's advantage in terms of assets and earnings growth.</p><h4>What ongoing steps are you taking to build up and maintain your captive market share, and how does this strategy differ between markets?</h4><p>Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon will represent 90% of the forecasted growth for the group for the coming three years. In parallel, we have a high-quality operation in Jordan. We would be interested to do commercial banking in Saudi Arabia; however, it has not opened up to players from outside of the GCC, meaning the market would have to free up competition. We have a bank in Qatar that is regulated by the Qatar Financial Centre and not by the Qatar Central Bank. Currently, there are talks that they might merge shortly, which will mean greater flexibility for us. With the outbreak of the Arab Spring, there was a major re-adjustment to our strategy; before the Arab Spring, our aim was to expand in the region to become one of the main regional players—I defined it at the time as cross-selling markets and business lines to capture the market share—but this was before 2011. Up till 2011, we had achieved probably 50% of the set targets; we were halfway to becoming a regional player. We had succeeded in Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. But then there was the Arab Spring, which affected the whole Middle East. To adjust our strategy, we completely deleveraged in Syria, whereby our assets there today represent less than 1% of our consolidated assets reaching $350 million, reduced from $2 billion in 2010. We have adopted a consolidation mode in Jordan. We have also revisited our business plan in Egypt to adjust to the current political environment. Therefore, you cannot consider that the Arab Spring had a zero impact on our previously announced regional expansion strategy. Today, we have shifted toward a much more southeast Mediterranean profile rather than being a deep Middle Eastern bank, focusing on our three main regional pillars: our home market, Lebanon, Egypt, and Turkey, with a fourth pillar which is our private banking business. As such, Bank Audi's development over the coming years hinges on the following drivers: first, consolidating and strengthening its leadership in Lebanon with a particular focus on pursuing asset utilization optimization while reinforcing operational efficiency to enhance a greater generation of productivity gains. The second driver is strengthening our market background and positioning in Egypt, which, despite the persisting uncertainties, remains a core growth market by virtue of scale and abundant resources triggering self-sustained economic and financial growth prospects. And thirdly, we need to secure over the medium term an established position in the Turkish market, which still enjoys a large size and high levels of growth in spite of short-term volatility, building a franchise ranking second to Lebanon in term of size and earnings. Fourth, leveraging cooperation and synergies across the private banking entities in Europe, the Levant, and the GCC, while transforming the wealth management operating model, enlarging its geographical footprint, and reinforcing the range of products and services to shore up private banking development at large is important.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Has BLOM BANK been affected by the regional turmoil over the past year?</h4><p>Relatively speaking, 2013 was a good year for BLOM. We registered growth on the balance sheet, and in loans and deposits, and posted growth in profits of around 5%. BLOM is a very consistent bank, and we continue to be prudent with gradual growth, and have never seen a year of decline. Three years ago Syria was the second most important market for us after Lebanon. Yet today it is one of the smaller ones—there has been a major drop in deposits and loans. Therefore, the war in Syria has not really affected our bottom line by much in 2013 as the country is a proportionately smaller operation. We were affected more by Syria in 2011 and 2012 because of the big drop in our operations during those two years. There is another dimension to this, however, in so much as both in addition to our operations in Syria, Lebanon is also feeling the pinch in terms of lower economic growth due to the security situation in the region and the arrival of refugees. Ultimately, the performance of the economy affects that of the bank, too.</p><h4>But if we talk about the year to date, have overall deposits grown on last year?</h4><p>We are still growing continuously, as we have recently published our 1Q2014 results showing growth in deposits and loans. The bank's strategy errs on the side of caution and looks for gradual growth, and while we are modern with a liberal outlook in general terms, we opt for a conservative stance in business.</p><h4>What is BLOM's overall market share in terms of the Lebanese banking sector?</h4><p>In terms of customer deposits in Lebanese pounds, we are number one, at around 13%. In terms of overall deposits, we hold 13.4% of the market. As for lending, we are number one in retail banking in all product categories (housing loans, car loans, personal loans, and credit card receivables). We are also the number one lender for loans made to entities operating in Lebanon. BLOM BANK has also been voted unanimously as the best bank in Lebanon by many major international institutions.</p><h4>Does BLOM BANK have any intentions to significantly expand its foreign market size in terms of loans and deposits similar to Bank Audi?</h4><p>While we are present in 13 countries, for us the bottom line is more important than scale. Our shareholders are more concerned about return on equity (ROE) and profitability than about the size of the balance sheet. This is where our culture is different, because we are very careful in terms of keeping our costs low and our ROE high—we have the highest ROE and the lowest cost-to-income readings in the sector. And today, we even have the highest level of profits even though we do not have the highest equity, so our profitability is the highest in relative and absolute terms. At BLOM BANK, we have more than sufficient equity from our internally generated profits, which makes for a relatively strong equity base, meaning there is no need to raise additional equity.</p><h4>How well do you feel Lebanon's banking sector is progressing to be able to meet Basel III requirements?</h4><p>The sector is in good shape. First of all, Lebanon is going to be compliant with the ratios required by Basel III by the end of 2014. The central bank has actually asked the banks to be compliant by the end of 2014, stipulating a 12% capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Basel III stipulates full compliance by January 2019, and therefore we are set to be at least three years ahead of the rest of the world. Already, the average CAR of the banks in Lebanon is close to 12%.</p><h4>How is your investment banking arm developing in Lebanon and the region?</h4><p>There is little investment banking activity in Lebanon. We do have our own investment arm, BLOMINVEST BANK, which deals with most of our investment banking activity, but Lebanon is a very limited market and we have seen only two deals in the government debt market of late. There is more of a focus on our investment banking activities in Saudi Arabia, where the market is bigger and the prospects are better. Our investment company there, Blominvest Saudi Arabia, is currently very active, especially in the area of real estate funds.</p><h4>What could you tell us about the BLOM Development Bank, which is specialized in Islamic banking?</h4><p>It is doing well, and experiencing growth, although Islamic banking in Lebanon represents a minuscule market when compared to the total size of the commercial banks. There is no real tradition of Islamic instruments in Lebanon—they are much more established in the Gulf. In Lebanon, people prefer commercial banks. Islamic banks still account for less than 1% of the banking universe locally.</p><h4>What areas is BLOM BANK investing in the most?</h4><p>As a universal bank, we undertake all activities. In 2013, growth in lending was mostly in housing loans in light of the central bank's incentives. Asset management and fund management have also grown amid greater public interest. We have also paid attention to the SME sector, and hence these three areas have seen the highest levels of growth, in that order. And then, of course, technology is crucial in our business, and we always try to lead the field in this area. We have also pioneered several products, with one being a credit card, the Touch pre-paid VISA Credit Card, which loads units onto your mobile phone as you spend, instead of receiving points. This card proved highly popular with the public. In fact, it was so successful it received VISA's “Best Acquisition Campaign" award for Lebanon in 2013.</p><h4>Do you have a technology budget?</h4><p>Whenever we see an opportunity to invest in an innovation that has the potential to bring us benefits, we don't hold back.</p><h4>In what region will you be expanding your operations the most over the next year?</h4><p>The growth of our operations is mostly observed in those countries that we have recently entered. Our investment banking arm in Saudi Arabia is growing rapidly. Meanwhile, our corporate and commercial banking operations in Qatar are also expanding swiftly. Overall, our Gulf operations, namely in the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, are in general doing well. Our operation in Egypt performed strongly in 2013, and we expect 2014 to be extremely good as well. I would, in fact, say that the Gulf and Egypt are posting the best growth performance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant achievements of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists (ALI)?<br></h4><p>Lebanese industry is driven exclusively by the private sector. The association is defending the general interests of and representing the industralists. We are also trying hard to boost industry's role in the Lebanese economy. Among the most recent achievements of our previous board headed by Neemat Frem was the establishment of four industrial zones across Lebanon. This was a long-lasting demand from various sectors. We are interacting with the Ministry of Industry and with government officials to solve specific problems, and to promote an overall industrial policy for the benefit of the sector and of the economy. As part of a free market economy, we are always trying to put forward the role of industry, particularly in development, growth, and job creation. Although public policy does not envision a clear industrial plan, despite the great efforts of all ministers of industry of recent years, ALI has been proposing suggestions and concrete measures both to tackle specific issues, and provide a building platform for an industrial and economic plan. ALI is interacting with governmental bodies and non-governmental institutions that can play a role in industry. For example, the central bank has been offering loans preferential terms for capital investments.</p><h4>What have been the most active committees within the ALI over the past year?</h4><p>ALI has three councils and 15 committees, each dedicated to a specific topic. In view of what is happening in the country, and in order to avoid further economic decline caused by the regional turmoil, we have focused lately on economic policy. We have proposed mechanisms and economic stimulus measures, as has been seen elsewhere in the world. We called to inject 3% of the GDP, hence $1.2 billion, into the whole economy, and across all sectors of activity. We have also put forward what is needed for industry in particular. These demands began in the paper sector three years ago. The validity of this suggestion has been confirmed by the fact that the Banque du Liban has launched a financial stimulus package worth $1.4 billion.</p><h4>How did you transform the stimulus package into long-term growth?</h4><p>Measures were taken by various industries. Some of the financing was dedicated to industry, specifically. This package has ensured that viable industries that provide jobs and growth have been able to sail through these difficult times, particularly when many traditional export routes were compromised. Investment in industry has continued. This has been productive in consolidating the industrial base and increasing exports and local output. This has played an important role, because if you look at the growth of our exports since 2005, they have more than doubled. Our exports are in traditional, and in value-added products. We are reaching traditional as well as more demanding markets all over the world.</p><h4>How have you been opening new markets and improving partnerships with industrialists abroad?</h4><p>This is what we are working on now. As a newly elected board, a central component of our strategy for industry development is to promote partnerships both with international groups and the Lebanese diaspora. Our confidence that this can be successful lies in the fact that Lebanon has strong resources, $167 billion in assets in the banking sector, and a very solid base of human resources. Our GDP is only $45 billion in size, and our per capita income is $10,000, so there is a great deal of growth to be achieved and potential to be tapped. We want to move forward. This is why we have called for measures and programs for “Lebanizing" the economy by putting together, in synergy, all of the potential of Lebanon—both the residents and the diaspora. We have a strong diaspora that is capable to creating some growth. We had 9% growth in 2009 when everyone else was in crisis. So, we are capable of putting more growth into the economy by building in these synergies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the municipality's most significant ongoing infrastructure projects?<br></h4><p>I am happy that we have finished the René Mouawad Sanayeh Garden. We wanted to create a new concept for a garden that all the generations could come and enjoy, and we also included a new amphitheater. We have approved a new master plan for the Horsh area of over 300,000 sqm. We are currently preparing a tender document so we can have a private company provide us with maintenance, security, and administration. I believe in public-private partnerships  (PPPs) in respect to the city's projects.</p><h4>Are there any concrete plans for other forms of public transport or cycle routes?</h4><p>In respect to transport, the Council has commissioned the consultancy firm TEAM to do a study. One major objective is to get the stakeholders in Beirut to believe in public transport, and this needs media exposure, town meetings, and more. TEAM will identify short-term actions, consider the prerequisites for starting organized public transport in the city, and propose detailed plans and designs. We will need to consider issues such as separate bus lanes, which highways to use for ground transportation, the possibility of a tramway, and whether we need an above-ground transit system. We are considering monorail transport—it is efficient and people are asking for that. Overall, traffic and public transport issues are at the top of our list of priorities.</p><h4>What is the current status of the Fouad Boutros Boulevard?</h4><p>The Bechara El-Khoury tunnel, under one of the busiest intersections in Beirut, will be completed in 2014. The Fouad Boutros Boulevard is an old project that goes back to the 1970s. The owners of the lots along the alignment received their compensation in the 1970s and 1980s. All the subsequent building construction that took place from the 1980s through to the present day is based on that alignment; however, we are still trying to execute it today. Our administration needs more efficiency; this project has taken 40 years to date, and the problems are accumulating. We also have a significant problem with traffic, parking, and green spaces in Achrafieh. This project will partially solve the problem for all the traffic coming from the mountain area crossing the narrow streets of Achrafieh and going to the Charles Helou highway along the coast.</p><h4>How much is the total investment in the project and what is the timeframe for its execution?</h4><p>The Council has put on hold around $75 million to execute Fouad Boutros Boulevard, which includes a small bridge over the Charles Malek highway, and then a tunnel under the residential area so we can keep all the streets intact at ground level without destroying anything. Second, we will have almost 1,000 underground parking spaces at three different locations along the alignment to provide room for cars that are causing a negative environmental impact in Beirut in the Achrafieh area. Then, above the tunnel, in the residential area, we will have a beautifully landscaped area. At present, we are awaiting an environmental impact assessment study executed by a private firm along with a new traffic model.</p><h4>How are you working with the ministries to improve wastewater treatment facilities around Beirut?</h4><p>At the moment, we are coordinating with the Ministry of Power and other ministries on the wastewater treatment plant. This is a high-priority project that has been neglected for a long time because any wastewater treatment plant for the northern part of Beirut also has to serve Bourj Hammoud and part of the Metn area. This meant the plans were put on hold for decades; however, since we started our term, we have been lobbying to start this project. Now, we have a protocol of cooperation between the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), the Ministry, the Municipality of Bourj Hammoud, and the Municipality of Beirut.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon is obviously much more than a beautiful country, which it is. It is a very important country, and it is very important to the security of the region and beyond. And I think everybody knows that the United States of America is deeply committed to Lebanon's security, to its stability, to its sovereignty, and to supporting the Lebanese people during this difficult period.<br></p><p>We all know that the consequences of the civil war in Syria reach well beyond Syria's borders, and Lebanon is feeling those consequences as much as any other country or community. Nowhere, in fact, has the international impact of what is happening in Syria been felt more in many ways than what is happening here. And that particularly includes the 1,600 cities, towns, and villages across Lebanon that are now hosting refugees of all ages.</p><p>I have personally had the opportunity to meet with some of those refugees, the Syrian refugees, who are now in Jordanian camps. And when I was there, it was impossible for me not to feel the incredible frustration and anger and loss that those refugees felt. If it isn't enough that they don't see their life situation changing, what they also don't see is they don't see the war ending, and so for them life is difficult, and it is bleak every day.</p><p>With the newest contribution the US has now committed more than $2 billion to support refugees and the nations that have opened their doors to them.</p><p>The devastating events in Syria have obviously gone on for far too long, and I am proud that we have stood by the people of Lebanon from day one. We will continue to support the people of Lebanon. I made it clear to Prime Minister Salam that President Obama is deeply committed to supporting Lebanon, supporting the security initiatives, and we will continue to remain engaged in our efforts to try to find a way to move forward.</p><p>Lebanon's security for years has been of paramount concern to the US. And that is why I have to say that the current political stalemate here in Lebanon is deeply troubling. It is unfortunate that the parliament did not elect a president on schedule, as the Lebanese constitution requires. And now it is far more important for the vacancy to be filled so that the people of Lebanon can reap the benefits of a fully constituted, fully empowered government. That is important for Lebanon, it is also important for the region, and it is important for those who support Lebanon. And we need a government that is free from foreign influence, with a fully empowered president, and with the president and the parliament responding directly to the people and to the needs of the people of Lebanon.</p><p>I reiterated my support to Prime Minister Salam at a meeting we recently had, and I reiterated President Obama's support for the stewardship of the Lebanese government by Prime Minister Salam and his cabinet. And I thanked the Prime Minister for the principles that we share and for his commitment to those principles. This is not a time for business as usual. The challenges are just too significant, and the challenges are all interconnected. Lebanon needs and Lebanon deserves to have a fully empowered, fully functioning, complete government. And we hope the Lebanese parliament will select a president quickly.</p><p>In the meantime, I did assure the Prime Minister that the US will remain a strong and reliable partner, and we will continue to support Lebanon and its institutions. That includes support that is aimed at building the capacity of the Lebanese armed forces and the internal security forces in order to help them be able to secure Lebanon's borders, to be able to handle the refugee flows, and to be able to calm the tensions and combat terrorism. In fact, we are seeking, right now, to increase our assistance to those institutions.</p><p>Therefore, the bottom line is this; a secure and stable Lebanon is a prerequisite for a secure and stable region, and the US will continue to work closely with our partners in Lebanon in order to protect against any of those who seek a different goal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Banking Inside Out]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[banking-inside-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1981, Creditbank today ranks among Lebanon's largest banks. Could you briefly give us an idea about the bank's rapid growth?<br></h4><p>When I first joined the bank in 1992, Creditbank was one of the Lebanon's smallest banks. It had a total balance sheet of some $50 million, four domestic branches, and a $500,000 bottom line. Today, we have over $2.5 billion on the balance sheet, 22 branches, and a $25 million bottom line.</p><h4>What was Creditbank's increase in deposits YoY in 2013?</h4><p>In 2013, we witnessed a 20% increase in deposits. Over the last eight years, this key growth indicator has consistently hovered between 20% and 25%, which is significantly higher than the sector's benchmark average of between 7% and 10%.</p><h4>What have been the main reasons for this increase?</h4><p>The main reason is that, from the outset, Creditbank has embraced a business strategy that caters to the private sector. In fact, we have the highest loans-to-deposits ratio in the country, which currently stands at over 56%.</p><h4>Do you have any idea how much of your deposits come from the Lebanese diaspora?</h4><p>It is close to 20% to 25%. There are many ethnic Lebanese living all over the world and to cater to their needs we need to establish a presence outside Lebanon. Our next challenge is to set up a network of representative offices and branches outside the country to further attract members of the diaspora.</p><h4>In 2013, you completed your expansion into Armenia and Russia. What was the strategy behind this?</h4><p>We started investing in Armenia in 2008. Now, we have acquired full ownership of Armenian Anelik Bank and its subsidiary bank in Moscow, Anelik RU. Anelik has a network of 15 branches in Armenia and a full banking license already operational in Russia. In addition, the Armenian market has a significant potential in terms of human capital with a high education level and sound work ethic. I believe Armenia can serve as a services hub for the region.</p><h4>Are you planning to further expand the number of branches domestically?</h4><p>We plan to open a couple of branches per year. I would estimate that our domestic market share requires a maximum of 35 branches to cover the whole country. I believe we will achieve this in the next four to five years. However, in the near future internet and mobile banking will carve out a larger market share and naturally this will shift management attention away from the further expansion of branches.</p><h4>How do you diversify your range of products and services?</h4><p>We believe the market is too small to solely operate as a niche bank. Basically, in Lebanon, you have to serve everyone and, therefore, you have to offer a wide range of products. Corporate clients normally need credit cards and retail loans. SMEs need, among other things, advisory services. I think Creditbank more significantly invests in new technologies than the sector as a whole. For example, we have recently introduced a mobile solution, MasterCard's PayPass technology, which allows you to pay with your mobile phone at any point of sale.</p><h4>What are the main indicators of transparency at Creditbank, and in what ways do you try to maintain high transparency standards?</h4><p>Our key structures are completely transparent. For example, we are transparent on fees. We do not have hidden charges. We are also transparent in our policies and ways of processing. Clients know exactly what parameters we use to grant a loan. And if we decline they know for what reason. Our employees understand the rules of engagement and are able to give clear, direct answers. This basic principle simplifies the chain of command internally and offers the client a direct and efficient interaction.</p><h4>Finally, what are the main areas for future growth?</h4><p>What we need to further develop is private banking, in the broadest sense of the word, as in asset management. Our other main challenge is to set up a network of representative offices and branches outside the country to cater to the Lebanese diaspora.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of the two decrees relating to the delineation of the offshore blocks and the model exploration and production agreement?<br></h4><p>We are waiting for the Council of Ministers' approval for the two decrees. One of them relates to block delineation, and the other to the draft exploration and production agreement (EPA). In April 2013, the Council of Ministers formed an inter-ministerial committee. We had questions about the autonomy of the Lebanese Petroleum Administration (LPA) and how it can be improved. Other questions were more technical, mainly about the management of the EPA because we do not have a national petroleum company yet, and about how Lebanese interests can be protected. The LPA's powers and responsibilities can be improved parallel to the development of the upstream (exploration and production [E&amp;P]) sector. Stopping the current bidding process until more powers are given to the LPA would not be fruitful. Having more autonomy and developing the upstream sector can be done in parallel.</p><h4>Why are there 10 blocks and not 16 or 20?</h4><p>The LPA divided the Lebanese offshore into 10 blocks based on geophysical seismic surveys that covered the whole offshore. We tried to have equivalent blocks in terms of surface area and potential. Then, we took into account the fact that we do not have any oil and gas infrastructure in Lebanon. Upstream companies working in Lebanon will have to make huge investments to build what is required, including all types of facilities. We cannot attract them if the block size is any smaller; bearing in mind that Lebanon is still considered virgin territory in terms of the upstream industry. The average block size in offshore Lebanon is around 1,700 square kilometers, which is less than in the Syrian and Cyprus offshore areas, where it is around 3,000 square kilometers. Once the exploration well results are available from the first round, the LPA will redo its geophysical interpretation for the whole offshore. Then, we might propose smaller blocks for the second bidding round, if we manage to use facilities already developed during the first round.</p><h4>How many blocks are currently open for bidding?</h4><p>We have five blocks currently open: two in the north and three in the south. We will decide if we will open more or less in the near future. We believe it is wiser to award a limited number of blocks in the first round.</p><h4>Is there a strategic plan to draw investment into Lebanon separate from the bidding process and interest by the multinationals?</h4><p>A strategy will be drawn up once the exploration well results are available and proven discoveries are announced. Our vision for the petroleum sector covers both upstream and the petrochemical industry. For upstream, field development and facilities construction will bring investment. Lebanese SMEs will play a role in covering the upstream value chain: services, catering, logistics, transport, E&amp;P, and construction. They will be encouraged by the preference we are giving to local enterprises. Petroleum companies will be required to subcontract to local enterprises that have the same technical level as their foreign equivalents, even if they are 5% to 10% more expensive. Plus they will be required to hire more than 80% Lebanese. On the other hand, we are studying the possibility of developing LNG facilities to feed the Asian market. Of course, we will require more than 8 tcf to 10 tcf for plants to be built. The petrochemical industry is a significant potential job creator in terms of plastics, fertilizers, and so forth. We are working with the Ministry of Industry to see how petrochemical industries can be developed in the country.</p><h4>How have you decided on appropriate royalties to be taken?</h4><p>Our model is a standard production sharing agreement (PSA). Profit is shared between companies and the state, after deducting royalties and capital expenditure (capex). The government take includes royalties, profit sharing, and taxes on company profits. For royalties, we are proposing 4% on gas, as we are in the first bidding round. This value can increase in the second bidding round.</p><h4>What other kind of infrastructure do you want to see in anticipation of exploration, perhaps in education or other programs?</h4><p>First of all, a new land use law adapted to the upstream and petrochemical industry will be adopted to establish where petroleum facilities will be installed, including services bases, gas or oil terminals, and processing and petrochemical plants. In higher education, the LPA has done a great job with the universities in terms of awareness. Five universities have opened petroleum-engineering classes with all the specialties covered including geology, geophysics, production, and processing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you talk about how the financial crisis affected the country?<br></h4><p>What happened in 2008 affected the whole world. Firstly, AIG came out of the crisis a smaller company; however, we are nimbler, more solid, and more regulated. We find it a positive to become more regulated. Secondly, the crisis did not affect the insurance companies and subsidiaries of AIG, which honored all of their liabilities vis-í -vis the policyholders. Thirdly, the US government provided financial support to AIG because it had faith that ultimately, it would be beneficial to the global financial system as a whole. In four years, we repaid the $182 billion loan, with a profit of $22.7 billion. As a result, local regulators are more confident of our financial position and acknowledged our commitment to the local market.</p><h4>How did this affect the strategy of AIG internationally?</h4><p>We honored our commitment to the international community. We continued to provide our product innovation, services, and expertise to our clients and brokers and maintained our global footprint. The operation in Lebanon also maintained its position as market leaders in commercial insurance.</p><h4>How has your portfolio changed over the past decade?</h4><p>When we started in 2001, our goal was to be a leading insurer in commercial lines. There was a great need in the market for expertise in commercial lines, hence we decided to support the market with lead terms in the various business areas that comprise commercial lines: marine, casualty, property, energy, construction, and financial lines. We are known for product innovation and are the first insurer to offer cyber coverage.</p><h4>How would you assess the market for financial lines in Lebanon?</h4><p>The market for financial lines still needs further encouragement, because it is confined to Bankers Blanket Bonds (BBB) coverage for banks. Other products, such as directors and officers, professional liability, and cyber, have yet to develop. We won't see much activity unless there is a requirement by law to buy a professional liability or management liability policy.</p><h4>How important is Lebanon for the company's overall presence?</h4><p>AIG is a global insurer, and is a great advocate of diversity and inclusion. This is part of our value proposition to our customers. The business model that we follow varies and depends on the size and potential of the market. In Lebanon, we look specifically at multinational clients, Lebanese interests abroad, and the local presence of a wide network of regional brokers. We also try to benefit from the Lebanese diaspora abroad. In Lebanon, there are around 4 million people, but outside Lebanon there are another 14 million expatriates and their children.</p><h4>Who are your other target clients?</h4><p>Corporate clients, banks, financial institutions, investment bankers, high-impact accounts, big projects in development, electricity, and infrastructure are the main areas we target. We benefit from the global network of Lebanese expatriates working outside their home country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Ministry's plan to bring down the cost of telecoms in Lebanon?<br></h4><p>When I started in my role as Minister of Telecommunications, I knew my plan would not exceed a three-month period because of political and constitutional reasons. Therefore, I introduced a plan of 100 days in order to achieve what I could achieve in that period. I assigned a group of technicians and counselors, and together we studied the problems that we are facing. I found that Lebanon is far behind the average in regard to telecommunications, and there is a lack of strategic decisions. That is why Lebanon should look at where to go, how to get there, and how to succeed in taking measures that help to change the face of Lebanon in telecommunications. Fortunately, we went to the Council of Ministers and my plan was approved. At my suggestion, we reduced the prices of internet, telecoms, mobile, and fixed services. This was implemented between June and July 2014. This is a huge step for Lebanon, and it will contribute to changing the face of telecommunications in the country. It will help the Lebanese reap the benefit of high-speed, low-cost broadband. We have fiber optics to help DSL for fixed-line users. We have 3G on mobile telephones. Decreasing telecommunications and internet prices encourage people to use more, and increases the penetration rate, which in the end will generate more income and open the gates to the future for an enhanced economy.</p><h4>What are you trying to do to improve the framework for investors coming to Lebanon?</h4><p>Raising Lebanon to international standards will help. It will increase the interest of people coming to Lebanon and working here, while taking advantage of the services we offer. In Lebanon, compared to the West, the cost of work is less. That will encourage people who have money to come to the Middle East and find a place where the prices and climate are good and the people are hospitable. I know that Dubai and Abu Dhabi are much better now because they have the liquidity, they don't have political problems, and they have an up-to-date telecommunications hub. I think we should transform Lebanon into a telecommunications hub. I have many projects that we can start or think about and put in the hands of my successor. For example, I started negotiations with Turkey about laying a cable between Turkey and Lebanon for international communications. It will be beneficial for Lebanon because Turkey needs it, and we need it as another way of securing our telecommunications if any problem happens.</p><h4>The Ministry recently redistributed LBP56 billion ($373 million) to 800 municipalities. Are there any conditions on how this money is spent?</h4><p>No. This is the right of the municipalities. It has been stopped for the last four years, and I don't think it was logical or a good thing. When I took this post, I considered that the money should be given to the municipalities. It will help inspire economic development in the country. Secondly, it was their right to take it. I met the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Interior, and we decided to start giving the municipalities this money, and I think it will soon be implemented. The three of us agreed on how to distribute the revenue to the municipalities. How the municipalities are going to use it is their responsibility; we don't have the right to tell them what to do. It could help their growth and help with creating a dynamic economy and a new environment in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have been the architect of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Lebanon, and you have been working hard to achieve a political consensus. Where does that process stand?<br></h4><p>We are still trying to get legislation passed. In Lebanon, there is nothing that prohibits the government or private sector from engaging in PPP projects; however, we have a history of less than satisfactory projects on both sides, mainly for three reasons. One is that these projects have typically not involved all the stakeholders in the design, tendering, and contracting process. The second is that there has not been enough transparency. And the third is that the people negotiating the PPP contracts, especially on the government side, have no real experience in PPPs. What we are trying to do in the proposed legislation is address these three issues: ensure all the stakeholders are involved, make sure there is a transparent tendering process, and create a PPP Unit within the Higher Council for Privatization (HCP) to become the government arm for designing, negotiating, and tendering PPP projects. The delay in establishing this legislation has two main causes. The first one is that we have had governments that have only lasted in office for a year and a half on average, and their priorities have not been on PPPs. The second reason has been that some ministers have fought PPP in the format that we are presenting it because they prefer the old way where the minister decides who they give the PPP contract to. I think this is unacceptable and will only lead to more problems with the private sector.</p><h4>As an advocate of all-out privatization for telecommunications, what is your vision for the liberalization of that sector?</h4><p>The 2002 legislation that we have in place is good. Unfortunately, it has not been applied. Firstly, it calls for the creation of a regulatory authority and the merging of the three directorates that belong to the Electric Board and to the Ministry of Telecommunications into one incumbent operator fixed-line and mobile telephone company, Liban Telecom, which would then be privatized at some point; in part by selling a minority stake to a strategic partner, and by floating the rest on the Beirut Stock Exchange. Two is creating Liban Telecom, and three is privatizing the mobile networks. Throughout this process, we can open up more to competition, for example in the fixed-line market.</p><h4>Telecoms are a major source of revenue for the government. How will this be affected?</h4><p>It is fake revenue; we tax telecoms beyond reason. Instead of having cheap telecommunications that will encourage investment in the ICT sector and in the knowledge economy, we are taxing that infrastructure, which is needed more by our young people for developing their potential so that we can collect enough money to pay for the deficit in the electricity sector, where we have a very inefficient form of subsidy. We subsidize consumption in Lebanon, instead of subsidizing people in need or underprivileged parts of society like in other countries.</p><h4>How credible is the Blue Gold water project in your view?</h4><p>In terms of funding, I believe the amounts that are being talked about are right. It is not rocket science; water infrastructure is something basic. Does it cost a lot of money? Yes. Does the government have the money to fund it? No, it does not. Can the private sector play a role? Of course it can. There can be many PPP projects in water management. Can it be done today? The answer is no, because the Ministry of Energy and Water does not have the expertise to handle PPP projects. It does not have plans for specific projects that are in the form of information memoranda that can be circulated to investors. There is much preparatory work that needs to take place, and because these are large projects it means de facto that large investors will be needed and large investors are not going to want to play ball unless there is transparency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[banking-on-a-better-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant will the consequences of the World Bank's restructuring be on the Lebanon operation?<br></h4><p>The World Bank's engagement in Lebanon is strong, deeply rooted in history, and multifaceted. We have channeled our assistance programs over the past years to help this country weather the immediate and constraining difficulties that burden its economic and social wellbeing, notably the impact of the Syrian crisis and the influx of refugees. However, we are also looking long term and working with the Lebanese government and people to build the pillars for structured and more sustainable economic development. The World Bank has put together a broad reform package to bring the best services to its member countries, clients, and partners. We have developed a new structure to help bridge some of the gaps we had in channeling the right and most relevant solutions to our partners. In the case of Lebanon, that new structure will help us deliver the services in real time. The changes will also allow us, as staff and management, to draw from all the Bank's resources, experience, and knowledge to provide a wide array of proven solutions to our Lebanese counterparts in all relevant sectors of their economy.</p><h4>You currently have 21 active projects in energy, water, and sanitation. How are these progressing?</h4><p>These ongoing projects in various areas and sectors are in response to particular needs at a particular juncture in Lebanon's relationship with the Bank. The needs have evolved and changed somewhat over the past couple of years. The Syrian crisis and ensuing refugee influx has had a dramatic impact on the country, exacerbating already delicate economic and social conditions. We are working hard to bring about solutions that will help Lebanon manage this present crisis whilst working on ambitious, structurally transformational projects which will help solve some of Lebanon's long lasting problems. Water is one sector that requires immediate attention, and needs a sustained effort. For example, we will be engaging in an ambitious water project in Lebanon, which will possibly be the largest project we have ever financed in the country. It involves water augmentation, mainly targeting the Beirut and Mt. Lebanon regions, where most of the population lives. It will bring water from the Awali River to the Bisri Dam. We are building a dam and a conveyor to bring potable water to Beirut. This project will secure fresh water for the majority of the Lebanese people. We would also like to be engaged in modernizing the management of the electricity sector. This is a long overdue reform that would help provide less costly and more secure energy to households and businesses, thus encouraging investment in the country, and giving a welcome boost to the economy.</p><h4>Do you do anything to nurture the development of public-private partnership (PPP) schemes in Lebanon or is that out of your realm?</h4><p>Engaging the private sector in vital sectors of Lebanon's economy is not just a matter for the World Bank or for international donors. The government itself feels that there is a crucial need for building stronger partnerships between the public and the private sectors through building the right legal framework. We are working with the Lebanese government on a number of projects that could trigger PPPs. For example, we are looking at a partial risk guarantee for electricity that is basically going to open the door for private sector engagement.</p><h4>How successful do you feel you have been in your goal to strengthen fiscal and public management in Lebanon?</h4><p>This is a country that hasn't had an approved budget since 2005. This year, a special effort is being made by the Minister of Finance to move beyond the difficulty of approving a formal budget, and we are encouraged by that. It is with the perspective of having a finance law adopted that we have been working over the last few years on strengthening the financial management capacity of the Ministry of Finance and its capacity to execute its budget and to rationalize its ways of financing government expenditures in a strategic and structurally sound manner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[state-links]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role have you played at AmCham to ensure that such trade links and business relations have been developed and come to fruition?<br></h4><p>We played a major role with the help of the US Embassy here in Beirut and the Lebanese Embassy in Washington, DC. There was a push to improve this relationship and trade between the two countries. Historically, the number one trade partner with Lebanon was always either France or Italy. Why? This is a trend. Nowadays, most of the time you cannot ask why you are consuming McDonalds, for example, and not buying from Paul. It is a trend in the market, especially with the youngsters. There is an image of the American way of life. It is a whole cultural movement that is happening. Do not forget the education side of it, such as the American University of Beirut (AUB) and other US schools and universities. There are plenty of forces that are channeling people toward consuming American goods that built up over the years. It took years, and we definitely went through ups and downs, especially during the war with Iraq and the problem with Kuwait. But after that it picked up like crazy. In French they call it “boule de neige"—it means there is a snowball effect. Once it begins growing, it grows faster and faster.</p><h4>What would you say are the most active committees today at AmCham?</h4><p>We have several, but mainly the most active are the banking and finance committee, and the events committee, which is planning different activities that we do in Lebanon and the US, including our lobbying mission. We do one every year and actually at the moment we are preparing for our “Lebanon Day in the USA," which will be held in New York in November, to which we will bring the flagships of Lebanese industry and exports, including the successful wineries, jewelers, fashion designers, the IT sector, as well as the food and beverage sectors including ethnic foods, which are well developed in the US. Lebanon Day aims to promote all of these sectors in the US market by highlighting the most successful products and companies from Lebanon. It will be a major event with a conference, sector specific roundtables, business luncheon, and a spectacular gala dinner.</p><h4>How is AmCham working to harness the financial sector and maximize its appeal to US and foreign investors?</h4><p>The banking and finance committee does not focus only on direct investment. In Lebanon, you cannot tell people how to spend. It is not really chaos, but a kind of positive chaos. People really pick up on different sectors and know where to invest. It is a question of the period in time, and how the market is fluctuating at that point. You cannot really direct them. You can only give them the incentive and the guidance when they are going to invest in Lebanon. In this committee, we play a certain role in promoting external investment in Lebanon.</p><h4>What other strategic areas for investment in Lebanon are you promoting?</h4><p>Lebanon is known for several sectors, but one of the major areas is in services. That is the major part of the economic picture. The investment in start-ups has also grown very quickly, and the ICT sector is amazing. You do not see it or feel it but when you know about it, it is quite something. IT is creating plenty of new jobs. In real estate, there was a small slow down, but the majority of consumers are now in a better mood than they were a year ago. And there is the industrial sector. This is a sector that exports nearly $5 billion a year. For a country like Lebanon, if you want to compare that figure to other countries, then we are very well positioned.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al-Iktissad Wal-Aamal made the transition from solely being a business magazine to becoming a business intelligence brand?<br></h4><p>I think there are two things. First, we were among the pioneers in business publishing as Al-Iktissad Wal-Aamal began 35 years ago as a regional business magazine. As a result of this, we were able to establish a regional network across all the Arab countries in the Gulf, the Near East, and North Africa. Then, we expanded into the conference business. Now, we are the leader in conferences because we conduct them in practically all the countries in the region. In the last 25 years, we have held more than 300 events, which are all major conferences. We are not an events management company, we are more of a conference-making company. We develop the concept, content, and agenda. We do the marketing and we bring in participants, sponsors, and engaging speakers. Then, we do the logistics and manage the whole thing. Alongside this business we also do some consultancy work.</p><h4>How do you decide on the content of the conferences?</h4><p>Sometimes we are approached by governments, chambers of commerce, and large companies that want to hold conferences. Other times we propose the idea, and it could be for governments, government institutions or ministries, or private sector partnerships. For example, we organized a conference for Qatar Rail in conjunction with the Ministry of Business and Trade. Then, we have the marketing side of our business where we leverage our network and our ability to put a project together, which we can do in any country. In Turkey, for example, we did the Turkish Arab Economic Forum with the Turkish Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Then, we ran another event for the Turkish Arab Capital Markets Forum. We have also done some events in Africa.</p><h4>How significant is your contribution to business tourism in Lebanon?</h4><p>Al-Iktissad Wal-Aamal is incorporated in Lebanon and has its head office here; however, we are a regional player, with 80% to 90% of our business being outside of Lebanon. We did the first Arab Economic Forum Conference here, and that has continued for the last 22 years. That conference helped to bring back investors to Lebanon after the war, which was a challenge. When we started the conference the concepts of economic forums and privatization were strong. Subsequently, I think the issues became broader and we felt we had to address policy issues at the conferences, too. During its peak years the Arab Economic Forum was attended by between 800 and 1,000 plus people.</p><h4>What investment trends would you say the conferences have encouraged over the last three years?</h4><p>Before the Syrian crisis, residential, retail, and commercial real estate were all prime investment areas. The growth sectors are predominantly the knowledge-based industry, the fashion and jewelry industry, and ICT. Lebanon is an exporter in these sectors. Business is more challenging at the moment than it has been in the past five years. Conferences usually help because they help spread optimism and confidence, especially if you have a conference with regional participation from high-level government and business interests.</p><h4>What themes are you focusing on at the moment and where are you focusing your international expansion?</h4><p>We are, of course, doing events in Lebanon; we have three events coming up in 2014 that have to do with SMEs, e-banking, and female entrepreneurs. We are focusing on a number of countries in Africa and Central Asia where we do conferences relevant to the economic relationship between the region and the Turkish Arab Economic Forum. We are also focusing on re-launching in countries that have seen changes such as Egypt and Tunisia, because we used to do events in these countries. Now investors want to re-explore these countries in light of the changes. In the region we also focus on specific topics, for example we are doing a number of events on entrepreneurs and SMEs in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant factors for the company over the last 15 years?<br></h4><p>The first company was launched in September 1998, meaning we have been in the reinsurance business as brokers for over 15 years. We had a defining moment when we relocated our head office from Cyprus to Beirut. By moving and setting up in Beirut, we have recruited highly qualified, experienced individuals with international exposure and know-how. Since 2004, we have also been recruiting fresh college graduates through an apprenticeship program so that they can gain experience and meet international standards. The team is our strength. In the financial services industry, we also need the vision and ambition to do something meaningful and make an impact. In 10 years, we became one of the major players in the region, and since 2008 we have been ranked among the top three and since 2012 the largest in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Is that thanks to the EuroMena Fund Investment?</h4><p>The investment from EuroMena has a different perspective. Since 2008 it has helped us institutionalize our shareholding structure, as well as help us with corporate governance and the expansion of the group in its relations with investors from outside Lebanon. Therefore, its support has helped us grow.</p><h4>What are the most significant ways in which Chedid Re's corporate governance has changed during this time?</h4><p>Year after year we have enhanced our structure, processes, planning, internal control and risk management all under the supervision of the board. The direction and strategy is set by the board. The ambition to expand is continuously monitored and challenged by very experienced directors. Every step is well studied and prepared in relation to value creation. We always look for sustainable growth with the long-term well-being of the group in mind. Our board comprises Charles El Hage as Vice-Chairman, Charles was the Managing Partner and Senior Vice-President of Booz Allen Hamilton in the Middle East, Romen Mathieu, who is the Managing Director of the Euromena Funds, and Sami Chedid, who has over 30 years of insurance experience. Our Advisors to the board are HE Ziyad Baroud, former minister and a very active lawyer, as well as Aldo Cardoso, the former President of Anderson France and Anderson worldwide, who is a current board member of a number of French-listed companies.</p><h4>What are the main trends in the Lebanese insurance sector at the moment that you are trying to accommodate?</h4><p>Lebanon is one of the most profitable markets in the region. The market is much smaller, but net profit in the insurance industry is doing well. The shareholding structure of the companies in Lebanon makes them different. The reinsurance market is attractive in Lebanon, whether it is treaty or facultative. The insurance industry in Lebanon needs government support, because the rules and regulations are outdated. We have an insurance commission trying to do the best it can to improve the industry, but it needs a new comprehensive law. The minimum capital requirement is $2 million, but if you compare that to other countries in the region, the minimum base capital is around $20 million in most countries. To be in line with the 21st century, there needs to be reform in the sector.</p><h4>You service over 270 companies in Lebanon and the region. How are you expanding your portfolio, and what is special about the services Chedid Re offers?</h4><p>Our offices in Beirut, Riyadh, Dubai, and Limassol service over 270 companies in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. Today, all insurance companies in the region know us and the solutions we provide. We have a specialized team that understands the requirements of the companies in the region. We have the trust and support of insurers and reinsurers throughout the world. We have been a Lloyd's cover-holder since April 1999, which means that we have underwriting authority on behalf of Syndicates there. We also underwrite on behalf of other global players, with Partner Re being the latest company that signed an agreement with us for financial lines. The range of support from European, US, Asian, and Middle Eastern reinsurers is impressive, and they are keen to support us because of our expertise, integrity, and ethics.</p><h4>You have a strong focus on product innovation and providing risk management solutions. In which areas have you innovated?</h4><p>We have been able to provide solutions to insurance companies through the structuring of innovative programs. If you provide a plain vanilla solution, anyone can do that; however, we have been different, which is why we have grown. In terms of risk management, if you look at the construction industry for example, we have a team of engineers that understand the risks involved with the construction industry, and have been involved in providing risk control solutions to our clients. We are one of the largest reinsurance brokers handling financial institutions. Our market share across the region is substantial. In Lebanon, if you take bankers blanket bond coverage for financial institutions, we have a 60% market share.</p><h4>How much value-added does Chedid Re's regional presence bring to your clients?</h4><p>It is all connected; you must have the people and the talent, and they must provide solutions that add value or you do not get the business. A few decades ago, business was about friendships and relationships, but now 90% of the business is done because you produce valuable solutions. Reinsurance is a business where you protect the balance sheet and reduce the volatility in the results. Reinsurance is also an alternative to capital by providing capacity through a combination of risk transfer mechanisms. This business is complex, and you need to understand the requirements to service your clients. We have engineers, lawyers, and actuaries involved in our team. I cannot think of any other broker in the region, even internationally, that has a team of 140 people between all our offices that can offer the same level of localized knowledge and expertise.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the founding of SEIB Insurance company?</h4><p>That was an opportunity that came up due to the growth expectations we had in Qatar and the vision and ambition of our partners. We realized we can service and add value to Qatari companies and its economy. Qatar is a market for large and complex risks that require major support from the reinsurance market, which is our core strength.</p><h4>Do you plan to start any more companies under Chedid Capital Holding?</h4><p>As an insurance company, no; however, we do have plans to open new offices for Chedid &amp; Associates, which is our insurance broker brand name. Chedid &amp; Associates is an insurance broker located in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE and we are planning to expand. As for Chedid Re we have new offices coming up soon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) since its founding?<br></h4><p>The BSE is actually the second-oldest stock market in the region, first established in 1920. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a lot of activity on the BSE. Then, the civil war erupted in 1975 and the BSE closed in 1983 until it was reopened in 1996. Lately, the Lebanese parliament endorsed a new Financial Markets Law that resulted in the creation of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), which aims to regulate and supervise the activities of the capital markets in Lebanon and create an adequate legal framework conducive to the development of the Lebanese financial markets. This new law previews the establishment of a Financial Market Court to adjudicate financial matters, and the restructuring of the BSE with a view to transfer its ownership to the private sector. Recently, in March 2014, the BSE signed an agreement with Euronext, a wholly owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange Group (NYSE: ICE), for the implementation of a new trading application platform that supports the expected growth in equity listings and the entry into new asset classes in the Lebanese markets.</p><h4>How successful has the CMA been since its inception in August 2011?</h4><p>After the complete formation of its board of directors in July 2012, the CMA issued a series of circulars and resolutions aimed at regulating the disclosure policy of joint-stock companies and mutual funds that have their shares or units traded on the BSE or on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, as well as of the firms' obligations in terms of disclosing information to shareholders and unit holders. Likewise, the CMA also issued resolutions relating to the committees, units, and departments that must be met by these companies. These circulars specify that, by September 2014, joint-stock companies and mutual funds that have their shares or units traded on the stock exchange or the OTC market, or that have more than 20 shareholders or unit holders, are required to have a compliance department and an internal audit department that shall be autonomous from other departments. The basic functions of the compliance department shall be to ensure the obedience of these companies and mutual funds with anti-money laundering laws and related Lebanese laws and regulations, while the internal audit department shall evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. The CMA also issued circulars related to crowd-funding activities and to the requirements to practice specific functions in the financial sector in Lebanon.</p><h4>Besides establishing the necessary laws, do you think there is anything else the government can do to attract more institutional investors to the BSE?</h4><p>Globally, institutional investors have come to play a key role in the development of the capital markets. Recent studies show that most institutional investors share a preference for large, liquid, and widely held stocks, with high disclosure standards. Likewise, institutional investors are biased for stocks that are members of a regional or international index. We believe that, in addition to political and security stability, the intelligent levels of corporate governance of listed companies is pivotal in attracting institutional investors to the Lebanese market as institutional investors rely on proper governance to enhance long-term investment returns and diminish risks. We are confident that the creation of the new financial market authority and the series of circulars that have been published and will be published in the future will give national and foreign investors a clear message that Lebanon now has the proper legislation to control and regulate its financial markets, which will help in attracting more foreign institutional investors.</p><h4>In an ideal world, where would you like to see the BSE in a year?</h4><p>From the standpoint of foreigners, we need to become a real offshore financial center with real facilities for foreign companies. That is very ambitious, but if the political and economic situation would allow for it, Beirut could perhaps regain its position as a financial center for the Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prospects are there for offshore hydrocarbon drilling?<br></h4><p>Advanced seismic surveys have been conducted offshore. The interpretation of this data is ongoing, resulting in very promising prospects for hydrocarbon resources spread over the whole offshore, extending from north to south and from shallow to deep waters. These surveys provide excellent estimates of the hydrocarbon reserves; however, they need to be confirmed through drilling wells. Accordingly, the bidding round needs to be concluded before an exploration and production (E&amp;P) agreement is signed to initiate the exploration activities.</p><h4>What infrastructure needs to be further developed to fully benefit from the process and end goal of extracting petroleum?</h4><p>The current plans of the Ministry to build the floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) and the coastal gas pipeline are vital for the supply of gas to the power plants and local industry until the offshore gas is extracted. The coastal pipeline will be used for the transportation of offshore gas once produced. In addition, based on the size of the discoveries to be made, as well as the market options, additional infrastructure needs to be built. This will be detailed in the development plans to be prepared after discoveries are made and assessed.</p><h4>How will the development of Lebanon's oil and gas industry benefit the Lebanese people and the international community?</h4><p>The oil and gas industry will have direct and indirect benefits to the national economy. The direct investments will boost the local economy, which will provide the goods and services needed by the IOCs and provide new employment opportunities for the Lebanese youth. The Ministry and the Lebanese Petroleum Administration (LPA) have put in place a strong policy for local content, whereby IOCs are required to employ up to 80% of Lebanese nationals in their workforce. This target is to be met gradually. In addition, goods manufactured in Lebanon will have a 5% cost incentive, and 10% for services provided by Lebanese companies. The benefit during exploration and production is vital in order to ensure that foreign investment benefits the local economy. Lebanese gas will boost the industrial sector by providing a secure and affordable source of energy. Currently, the energy bill represents a burden, hindering the growth of local industry. In addition, petrochemical industries and industries with high energy demand will have an opportunity to grow and prosper, thus providing new sustainable job opportunities. The availability of Lebanese natural gas will be vital to secure a clean affordable energy source to generate electricity. The Ministry's plan is to have all existing and new power plants operate using natural gas. This will cut the energy bill of Electricité Du Liban (EDL) and thus ease the budgetary deficit.</p><h4>Is Lebanon on track to meet its targets for renewable energy by 2015?</h4><p>Back in 2009, the Lebanese government committed itself to reaching 12% renewable energy use by 2020. The Ministry of Energy and Water, through the work of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC), has launched different initiatives toward achieving this challenging goal. Currently, 5%-6% of Lebanon's electricity generation comes from renewable energy sources, namely hydropower, solar thermal, and recently solar photovoltaic systems. Should the wind farm projects became a reality soon, the 12% target could be easily achievable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main ways Total has positioned itself for the impending offshore exploration in Lebanon?<br></h4><p>Total has been present in Lebanon for 63 years now and has built a strong marketing base in the country. Despite the unstable situation and all the difficulties faced during the 15-year civil war, our company decided to stay and continue its mission in the country by maintaining its activities and local workforce, making us the only major international company aiming at building a long-term relationship within the land of the cedars. In the past, most of our international competitors decided to leave the country because of the situation. However, our presence, extending for more than half a century, reveals our commitment, as one of the world's largest oil groups, to this country. Total is one of the 12 companies that have been prequalified as an operator for the first offshore exploration round. In line with our long presence and commitment to Lebanon, Total is willing to help the country with its worldwide deep offshore experience.</p><h4>How do you set the standards in the market?</h4><p>As far as marketing and distribution are concerned, we have no choice; we have an international standard that we need to follow and it applies to Lebanon just as it would in any other country. As far as the environment is concerned, we implement extremely high standards when we set up a service station. Our service stations are equipped with spill collectors on the forecourt and at the level of oil change and car wash facilities, designed for collecting hydrocarbons, spilled water, and oil in order to ensure a proper disposal system. It is a costly investment and invisible when you visit the service stations, but it is there and a factor that differentiates us. Moreover, when it comes to energy savings, we try to reduce the consumption of electricity at our service stations, which are equipped with LED lighting that reduces energy consumption by up to 80%. We position ourselves as an energy company. Total is also a global gas and petrochemical operator. Today, in response to soaring energy demand, Total is stepping up its expansion into solar and biomass. Going forward, the group's mission is to enable as many people as possible to access energy. To do that, Total is counting first on oil and gas and activities in renewable energies. That is why, some years ago, we acquired 60% of SunPower, one of the largest solar panel company in the US and the world's most efficient solar panel technology.</p><h4>How are you diversifying your goods and services?</h4><p>It is all related to consumer satisfaction and what the consumer expects from our stations. We offer additional services to fuel at our service stations. We aim at applying the one-stop shop concept. Total offers its customers a wide range of products and services. Thus, when the customer visits the service station, we provide attractive promotions in our Bonjour stores, and even the option to play the Lottery. In addition to being enjoyable, our service stations are also efficient since they are equipped with automatic car wash and oil change facilities, ATM services, money transfer, and mobile phones and internet recharge cards. Now, all over the world, Total displays its new visual identity within its network of service stations to ensure its customers comfort and safety by providing quality service and an unmatched range of products and services. As a leader in the market, we have to provide what we feel is best to the customer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[want-not-waste]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main milestones in averda's progression to becoming one of the leading international waste management companies?<br></h4><p>Since the company was founded in the 1960s, I have invested in technologies and quality engineering that help solve operational challenges and creates efficiencies. Our first focus as a company was on specific industries, especially food manufacturing. At the time, most factories in Lebanon were artisanal. Because the local market could not absorb the high capacities of professional production lines from the US or Europe, they made do with a combination of manual labor and sub-standard machines. Noticing this area of weakness, in 1965 I secured contracts to upgrade almost all of the food manufacturing plants in Lebanon as well as various projects in other fields in the region. This created a strong core in the company that still exists today.</p><h4>What have been the main changes in the culture and business of waste disposal and collection that you have experienced in the last 30 years?</h4><p>The main change we have experienced is the privatization of waste management services. Whereas the municipality itself used to control waste management, now it is increasingly outsourced to private operators. This has caused a fundamental change in the way the service is provided, in that governmental bodies are now both the client, utilizing the service from the private operator, and also the regulators, allowing for growth in the market. However, while the waste management industry has matured in Europe and North America, it has seen little change in this region. The duty of care principle, where every polluter is responsible for his or her pollutants, still lags behind international standards, and needs to be addressed urgently. We have partnered with regional governments for several initiatives that will hopefully yield fundamental changes in behavior, such as sorting at the source, pay as you throw, and hazardous waste collection.</p><h4>You recently launched your first gas-to-energy project in Naameh. To what extent would you say this is a landmark project for averda?</h4><p>This is indeed a landmark project for averda, where we have obtained permission to distribute electricity as a pilot plant, free of charge to the neighboring areas. We plan to do this in every region where we have a landfill in operation, as it reduces the reliance on polluting fuels.</p><h4>How much of your total waste disposal is recycled?</h4><p>We have a multitude of waste streams in our operations globally, ranging from household waste to industrial and construction waste. Many of the simpler wastes can reach over 70% diversion and recycling rates, while more highly technical waste streams require disposal as recycling them may cause harm.</p><h4>You have recently expanded to Galway in Ireland with a $15 million investment in The City Bin. What was the motivation behind this investment?</h4><p>Our investment in The City Bin Company was a strategic decision. First, Ireland operates a unique waste management model, whereby the individual chooses his or her waste collector; similar to the way you would choose a milkman. The relationship is direct between the client and the company, which is a strategic advantage that allows us to serve our ultimate client directly and learn his or her expectations and habits. Secondly, we now have access to a new talent pool that we can recruit from for our operations elsewhere.</p><h4>Where else are you concentrating expansion efforts?</h4><p>Our expansion efforts are focused primarily on the Middle East and Africa. We have been successful in pursuing this strategy, and plan to continue with it for the foreseen future. The population and economic growth in this region interests us, and we have skills that have been specifically designed and developed to cope with the complexity of operating in developing economies. We also can cope with the risk that such markets present.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your system of corporate governance?</h4><p>Unlike most companies in this region, we are not a family business. The group was established in 1967. Shortly after its inception in the mid-1970s, the founder started to introduce the shareholding concept to various managers. It was, and still is, a privately owned group, but it is managed in a way that is a hybrid model between a public and private group in terms of the ability of managers to acquire shares in the company. The major advantage of such a model is that you able to motivate talented resources and retain them. This is how our group sustained its growth in the various businesses, sectors, and countries we are present in.</p><h4>What sectors are you currently expanding into?</h4><p>First of all, it is worth noting that 90%+ of our group's business is in the IT and telecoms industry. We do have sister companies that operate in pharmaceuticals too, but 100% of Information Technology Groups' (ITG's) business is in IT. In addition to banking, which is our top target sector, we are involved in various other verticals. Traditionally, we have worked with many banks, because this is the largest and the most solid sector in Lebanon. Historically, it was natural for us to work with banks. However, over the years, we have expanded to other verticals, in particular hospitality, higher education, and public sector infrastructure. More recently, we are starting to invest in acquiring expertise in healthcare. We have established some partnerships and started to train people, aiming to develop that promising business. That is a sector we are looking at with lots of interest.</p><h4>How would you assess ITG's business performance over the last year?</h4><p>Despite the fact that 2013 was a challenging year, we were able to grow over 2012, which by the way was an excellent year. To be able to do that, we focused on growth while controlling our expenses. We also developed value-added businesses in terms of introducing more value-added solutions to our portfolio, in particular those that generate service revenues. We are actively promoting more software and more services, with less of an emphasis on hardware, which you practically sell at cost. In fact, we use hardware sales as a vector to introduce ourselves in accounts and then target the sale of services and solutions that generate margins. This is how we are managing our growth, by investing more into value-added businesses.</p><h4>Have you undertaken any mergers or acquisitions this year?</h4><p>Yes, over the recent period we have acquired an Oracle Gold partner, Fadel Systems, which we renamed Primeware—family names don't fit in our group's culture. After establishing a company called SYSPRO around 18 months ago, specialized in smart building solutions, we then acquired Light &amp; Build, which was established a decade ago in Lebanon, to complement our solutions and integrated it into SYSPRO. Moreover, as Canon—one of our major suppliers—has acquired Océ globally, we have decided to acquire the business of the local Lebanese distributor of Océ. That transaction was completed in early 2014. We have made other investments as well. Back in October 2013, we invested in a banking software company called Capital Banking Solutions, which has offices in New York, Paris, Monaco, Dubai, and Beirut.</p><h4>What can be done to nurture talent in the IT world in Lebanon?</h4><p>The country needs faster internet and a better legal framework. Those things need a lot of work. Today, we have poor internet speeds and high costs; our telecoms infrastructure is old and needs to be upgraded. In 2013, we had 12 months without a government, meaning people were not legislating or implementing new laws. On the bright side, our education system is still good; we have a good and growing talent base. It is worth noting that our company is very much merit-driven and people normally evolve from the bottom up. Our preferred approach is to recruit from within. Most of the managers here in the company started as engineers, sales persons, programmers, or accountants. I personally started as a field engineer in one of our affiliated companies and I slowly, but surely, moved up.</p>]]></richbody0content>
