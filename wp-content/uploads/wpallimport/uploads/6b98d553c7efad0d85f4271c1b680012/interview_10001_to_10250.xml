		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012 the first heart transplant was performed in the Dominican Republic. How important a milestone is this for the country's health system?</h4><p>Completion of the first heart transplant in the country represents proof of the evolution of the ability of Dominican cardiovascular medicine to provide medical care. On the one hand, this fact proves the technological development that has been achieved, but on the other hand it reveals the lack of national policy regarding the sustainability and implementation of an enduring heart transplant program. A successful transplant program in emerging economies requires government involvement to ensure its continuity.</p><h4>When will CEDIMAT's cardiovascular medicine center be operational and what means will it have?</h4><p>The center will be operational in January 2014. The construction and installation of equipment will be completed between November and December 2013, and thereafter a training program for all personnel who will be working with the high-tech equipment for cardiovascular medicine will be conducted. We expect the training to take two months, so that the personnel are knowledgeable of the center's existing technology when it opens its doors. It is an advanced medical center where the simplest to the most complex cardiovascular specialty procedures will be performed. The center will consist of seven floors, 150 beds, and diagnostic, therapeutic, and chirurgical procedures will be performed there. The center is already considered one of the most advanced in Latin America in this specialty and others, and the blueprints have been certified to international standards. We will perform a type of medicine that will give the country a great boost to assert itself in the medical tourism field.</p><div class="quote">“CEDIMAT performs about 30% of the nuclear medicine studies carried out in the Dominican Republic."</div><h4>In fact, CEDIMAT already has special treatment services for international patients. What does providing such treatment services entail?</h4><p>CEDIMAT has an International Patient Unit that coordinates everything from appointments, either through its website, call center, or walk-ins—as well as an efficient medical and administrative process—from the moment the patient is admitted until the discharge or delivery of the studies or procedure results. The personalized service also includes translation services into multiple languages. Some international patients come from specific contracts with foreign missions that have relied exclusively on the center's medical services for the treatment of their members, as well as international medical insurance companies, including the social security administrations of some neighboring islands.</p><h4>How has it been sourcing specialists for the center?</h4><p>In terms of human resources, we already have a good team of medical specialists, but we are also training personnel in France, Spain, and the US. They will be joining the center once it starts operations. We also have proposals from foreign doctors who want to work at the center, and we will also have them working with us. The most important thing, which is something that has been going on for some years, is that CEDIMAT has served as a magnet so that Dominican professionals abroad choose to return to the Dominican Republic to practice their professions. The main reason is that in CEDIMAT they find the same technology, the same working conditions, and the same scientific environment to develop their specialties as they have been doing in developed countries.</p><h4>What is the importance of investing in nuclear medicine?</h4><p>We have made a significant investment in nuclear medicine. In fact, CEDIMAT performs about 30% of the nuclear medicine studies carried out in the Dominican Republic. We perform between 500 and 600 nuclear medicine procedures per month, a significant amount for any center in Latin America. It is the only center in the Dominican Republic with two gamma chambers and a specialized unit dedicated to treating patients needing iodine therapy. Right now we are working with the IAEA, at which CEDIMAT represents the Dominican Republic, to develop a Cyclotron PET/CT project, which is positron emission tomography, as it is the one diagnostic method lacking in the Dominican Republic preventing us from stating that we possess all the advanced technological means to perform a complete diagnosis at the highest level.</p><h4>What is CEDIMAT doing to improve its international profile?</h4><p>CEDIMAT is undergoing a certification process with Joint Commission International, the entity in charge of certifying hospitals in the US and other countries, to provide medical services conforming to international standards, focusing on quality of care and patient safety. This will open a spectrum of possibilities for CEDIMAT and the Dominican Republic with respect to medical tourism. On the other hand, it also opens the door for more interaction, information exchange, and brings our medical personnel up to date with foreign experts. Our doctors are being invited to hospitals and international conferences to present their research and practices, and to pass on their experiences at CEDIMAT. We have also received proposals and visits from international universities interested in developing research projects and exchanging information with CEDIMAT.</p><h4>CEDIMAT has a telemedicine system permanently linked to Massachusetts General Hospital. How important is it for CEDIMAT to have an open line of communication with such a prestigious US institution?</h4><p>It is extremely important because our doctors can teleconference regarding a patient and take advantage of this medium as a means of training. Our operating rooms have a telemedicine system that allows us to consult with doctors from other hospitals located around the world. For example, a doctor from the Massachusetts General Hospital can participate live in a surgery being performed in CEDIMAT. Similarly, we do teleconferences with other medical centers in the country, during which personnel can interact, discuss medical cases, and even participate remotely in a surgery. This system is extremely important to keep doctors up to date, and it benefits patients as several specialists may be intervening simultaneously in a medical procedure from different locations.</p><h4>What potential do you see for the development of medical tourism in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has great potential to develop medical tourism, but so far it is in its early stages because there is no state policy to develop it. The initiative should have its origin in breakthrough policies in this new tourism model coming from the Ministry of Tourism. Medical tourism is a new opportunity for the Dominican Republic because we have great comparative advantages, such as our proximity to developed countries like the US and Canada, with the former having a large number of uninsured citizens and high medical costs. It is estimated that in the US there are about 40 million people without insurance, and medical service costs are among the highest in the world. The proximity to the Dominican Republic would allow us to capture a percentage of this market, who could come here instead of going to India, for example, which is much farther away. In addition, the country has extraordinary access infrastructure with seven international airports and sophisticated communication systems, as well as a high-quality hotel industry.</p><h4>How would you rate the government's support of the healthcare sector in recent years and what role does the private health sector play in the country?</h4><p>In recent years the government has made some progress with the sector and social security  reform, but much remains to be done. Social security coverage is still insufficient and limited; there are many exclusions and little coverage for serious illnesses. Many procedures are beyond the scope of services, resulting in stagnation in the health sector, and the population cannot benefit from innovative procedures, such as laparoscopic surgery, which is a great breakthrough because it is minimally invasive and has great benefits for patients. The non-coverage of new procedures and technologies limits the investment capacity of the private sector. However, the private sector continues to make significant investments in medical technology, as well as in improving the quality of care.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of FNSS in the Turkish defense sector?</h4><p>FNSS was the first private defense company in Turkey, established back in 1988. It became operational in 1990. At the beginning we thought this was going to be an eight-year company with just a single contract, because the purpose of the company was to produce 1,700 armored combat vehicles (ACVs) for the Turkish Armed Forces under a single contract signed with the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (SSM). That program was extended for another two years and it went on until 1999. In the meantime, we had offset obligations that brought the question of whether we could export products. We started to investigate export possibilities, and there turned out to be real opportunities. The first 10 years of FNSS were taken up by licensed production. From 2000 on, it became more focused on the development of new products, more engineering, and, of course, it became more export oriented. After 2005, we won two indigenous development products with the Turkish Ministry of Defense: the amphibious assault bridge and the amphibious earthmover.</p><h4>As Turkey's first private sector defense company, what kind of unique challenges did you face?</h4><p>During the very first days of the ACV contract, nobody knew how to conduct the acceptance process or how to handle the changes. The user was experienced in employing equipment simply given to it previously. For us and the user, though, it became a challenge to come up with a platform upon which we agreed what was required and how we were to meet all of the customer's requirements and produce according to budgetary and time constraints. In our first contracts there were terms and conditions missing that today are very essential to conducting business. It was a learning process at first.  The big challenge was to gain the confidence of the customer and manage the contract effectively. Since then, over the last 22 years, not only FNSS but also the rest of the Turkish defense sector has shown perfect progress, where we can manage very complex international defense programs.</p><div class="quote">“We want FNSS to be the biggest land systems company in Turkey."</div><h4>How has that experience benefited your current operations?</h4><p>It was a big experience—everybody learned a lot. In retrospect, what we did proved to be right, even considering the mistakes we made. It was a big experience for SSM and for FNSS. Most of the people in top management positions at SSM have been raised through the Turkish ACV program. After struggling for the first couple of years, it turned out to be one of the best examples within the Turkish defense industry.</p><h4>How has the perception of the Turkish defense sector changed since FNSS has been in business?</h4><p>To make a defense export contract successful, a few factors are required. These include a strong proven product, a good price, and sound relations between the two countries involved. In addition, trust in the company is also a must. At that time, however, FNSS was still a new, unproven company. Of course, the American brand names that we were working with provided comfort to our customers. They then saw the quality of our products and our level of service. Today, however, we hide the US flag in many cases. I would not compare FNSS with the rest of the industry. However, as a private entity, everybody knows and respects FNSS in the regions we operate, and that sort of reputation does not happen overnight. It is the result of several successful contracts, timely delivery, overall quality, and, moreover, sticking behind your product after the sale, which is an important thing in defense. You do not gain confidence through advertisements or by appearing in newspapers. This is not the way it works. This is a sector in which you deal with the end user directly, so you cannot lie or manipulate events. The product either works or it does not. In many ways the sector is different from others, but that is an important distinction: there are no layers in between the manufacturer and the end user.</p><h4>How would you characterize the availability of technical education in Turkey?</h4><p>There is definitely an engineering workforce available in terms of good schools and university education. However, in terms of experience there is a problem, and it started to be an issue after the Turkish defense industry started working on indigenous programs. Today, with TAI and Aselsan, we are talking about companies with 3,000 to 4,000 employees. Given the amount of work given by SSM to the industry, there is a huge amount of development work going on and we are about to reach a bottleneck in terms of finding people who have experience. This gives us another burden, as we have to hire young people and spend time on their development and education. It is a bit critical at the moment. Will all of those foundation companies continue this level of work? I think, as a minimum, in the next four or five years it will continue. To increase our engineering workforce we need to do something.</p><h4>What does Turkey need to do to increase the availability of local content for defense manufacturers and to allow its defense industry to move up the value chain?</h4><p>What I will say is consistent with SSM's strategy. We have top-level companies, like FNSS and TAI, and we must not increase the number of these companies. We need to support the development of second-tier companies, and those should be coming from the bottom. That takes a lot of R&amp;D, some basic studies, and the incorporation of all of the authorities, organizations, and universities. A good example for land systems is gearboxes. On the subject of gearbox design and production, we can do something here and we are doing something. In an ideal world, I want to be in a position where I can call my gearbox company and say I want such and such a design and I am sending you inputs and outputs—just design me something. And that is the biggest strength of Western companies. In Germany you have that support; in the US you do as well. Here we have to struggle with all of these subcomponents and try to educate vendors . An option is to do everything in house, but then I would need a facility 10 times the size and another 5,000 people to deal with. This is not the right way. We need experienced companies to support not just FNSS, but all of the top-level companies. That way they would not have big business risks. If my business goes down a little bit they could balance their load with other companies. For land systems, another example is that we need some basic capabilities with materials like armor steel. We need to invest in that area in Turkey. Again, basic industries like power packs, engines, and transmissions are needed. I know this cannot happen overnight, and I am not talking about conventional engines and power packs necessarily. Everybody produces those. I am talking maybe about  fuel cells and electric drives, which are the future. We need to spend time on things that will make Turkey unique in certain areas. There is not much left to do with internal combustion engines.</p><h4>What is your vision for FNSS over the next decade?</h4><p>We want FNSS to be the biggest land systems company in Turkey. We want to be the local defense company for foreign and friendly countries. That means we are going to work very hard to get more business, aggressively, within Turkey. Also, we will continue to explore in order to spread our products throughout the world, mainly in the Middle East and Far East. However, Eastern Europe is also coming into our focus. The next target—once they are released from their Russian influence in terms of old military equipment—are the Turkic republics. Based on our research and analysis, our plan is to reach turnover levels of $400 million to $500 million a year. We want to reach that level in the next five years, and in the five years after that we intend to stay at that level while getting ready for the next jump. This is based on our current strategic plan, and we are about to revise our strategic plan in the coming years. We think this is achievable. For 15 years we have been on average a $100 million company. From 2005 to 2008 we dropped down to $25 million to $30 million a year, which put us into survival mode. We reached levels above $100 million for the last four years, and in 2012 we are jumping up to $180 million. Over these periods we have gone from being a company with 450 people, to 140 people, to nearly 800 people currently. So over the last four years there has been a huge jump, and we want to reinforce our current position for some time before making the next big jump, which has already been planned.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you were appointed President of Banco Caja Social, what are your main strategic goals?</h4><p>I was appointed President of the Bank in July 2012, and my objective is to ensure compliance with the strategic guidelines defined for the bank. This is a solid, robust institution, which for more than 100 years has focused on working for the masses through savings as a source of development and growth. In this vein of ideas, the activities for 2012 will be directed primarily toward facilitating access to banking, achieving greater penetration in the low-income segments, and providing financial solutions for SMEs.</p><h4>What were the core reasons for the rebranding exercise the bank underwent in 2011? How has this move changed your activities?</h4><p>Beyond a simple rebranding, the exercise conducted in 4Q2011 was intended to introduce to the market and clients a bank that has established itself as an indisputable leader in our country in terms of servicing its target markets, without losing its essence resulting from over 100 years of development. Hence, this change gives greater value to the defined brand attributes: the bank is friendlier; it respects and values clients; it is a good communicator; clear, consistent, transparent, and veracious; it is creative and bold; and furthermore, it makes things easier for everyone.</p><div class="quote">“We have implemented new services in mobile banking and strengthened our presence in the online world through various products."</div><h4>How has Banco Caja Social's product portfolio evolved over the past five years, and what are your future targets?</h4><p>Our strategy is focused on consolidating our leadership in the low-income market as well as increasing our participation in housing loans, in addition to strengthening our brand attributes. In terms of products, the bank has made great efforts in the micro-enterprise and mass-client segments. We believe that savings are a driving factor in generating development. For this reason, we are experts in promoting individual savings, and we have a broad portfolio of products to meet the different needs of the Colombian people. We are focused on offering access and opportunities for growth to low-income people. Furthermore, we believe that innovation is a key element in our business.</p><h4>What role does financial inclusion play in your overall business strategy?</h4><p>Financial inclusion is the basis of all our activities, and we are always looking at how to provide better services within this approach. We constantly strive to better understand the social and economic dynamics of the Colombian low-income segment, and believe that thanks to innovation, we can provide the social and financial tools necessary for that process. Recent studies show that only 24.6% of the adult population has a bank account in Colombia, and only 52% of them have an active bank account in urban areas. Therefore, our intent is always to provide savings tools that will promote the growth of the working class. We also have a significant presence in the housing finance business, where we have a market share of 11.5%. Finally, we focus on the SME and micro-enterprise segments, in which our interest is to increasingly expand our value proposition, not only in terms of recruitment and placement of resources, but also in offering products and financial services such as foreign trade and cash management.</p><h4>What are you targeting in terms of loans?</h4><p>Today, housing is the most important sector of our loan portfolio, accounting for more than Ps2 trillion. SME-oriented commercial loans, as well as consumer and micro credit lines, are fundamental elements within the portfolio of financing products.</p><h4>How would you assess the evolution of e-banking in Colombia?</h4><p>Banco Caja Social has increased its participation in the internet banking segment in recent years, and I believe this is a common trend within the market. E-banking contributes to reducing costs and increasing levels of so-called financial inclusion, which is very important in Colombia. For this reason, we have implemented new products and services in mobile banking and strengthened our presence in the online world through various products. Finally, banking correspondents play a key role in the penetration rates of banks in Colombia and the use of new technologies. At present, we have about 2,300 “Amigo Points," or banking correspondents, across the country, and hope to have 3,000 by the end of 2012. Nevertheless, our main objective in the medium term, in this sense, is to build a network of more than 20,000 banking correspondents.</p><h4>What are some of the key figures of your audited financials?</h4><p>In 2011, the bank's profits were around Ps160 billion. Overall, 2012 has been very positive so far. By October 2012, we were close to Ps166 billion in profits, and we believe we can end the year with overall profits of Ps190 billion, which would represent an increase of about 15% to 20% compared to 2011. In addition, our portfolio is growing at an average rate of 24%. Currently, Banco Caja Social has about 4 million clients.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the banking sector over the medium term?</h4><p>The development and stability of the country clearly play a key role in our development, and Colombia is among the top four countries in the region. Furthermore, the penetration of banking services in the country still holds great opportunities. That on its own provides a unique context for our industry, which has grown stronger since the last financial crisis. Currently, the Colombian banking sector is very attractive for international players, and I believe we will see an increase in the arrival of foreign banks.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>HEPCO represents the largest share of production, supply, and support for heavy machinery in Iran. What are some highlights from your experience in 2011 and how do they compare to overall trends in the industry?</h4><p>In comparison to 2011, we are increasing and promoting our business in the local market and are looking for new activities, while diversifying our business at the international level. HEPCO mainly focuses on the mining sector, providing machinery to mining companies. The mining sector has flourished in recent years, and the demand for machinery is very high. HEPCO is also looking seriously at opportunities arising from public sector contracts, allowing us to get more involved in the provision of machinery for the mining industry. We have also been looking at the agriculture sector, providing heavy combine harvesters and tractors. In terms of its work with municipalities, HEPCO has provided machinery to specialized affiliated enterprises, such as waste management companies. We would also like to get more involved in the petroleum sector in order to increase our market share in the industry. Our approach is to develop subsidiaries to work under this group in various sectors, while the HEPCO plant will be specialized in producing machinery for road construction.</p><h4>Which sectors is HEPCO most involved in?</h4><p>We are most heavily involved in road construction, but in the future we will concentrate more on mining. Agriculture is also increasing in significance. We will certainly be cooperating with international brands on road construction machinery, but for mining operations we need more cooperation from our international partners. In terms of constructing subways for the municipalities, we have to be more involved with constructing tunnel-boring machines (TBMs), and from this year on, we are going to be working with our partners to build some parts for TBMs in Iran. We have to increase our international cooperation with non-Iranian companies that are involved in supplying and supporting machinery for mining and TBMs. In Iran, the construction of subways is on the rise. Projects to develop subway systems have already begun in Tabriz, Ahvaz, Mashhad, and Shiraz. In addition to providing excavating machinery, HEPCO will also be engaged in manufacturing parts for subway carriages. Different varieties of TBMs are used depending on soil type. We tailor-build machinery depending on the unique conditions of each city. From now on, we are also going to specialize more and more on the design and construction of subway carriages.</p><div class="quote">“We are most heavily involved in road construction, but in the future we will concentrate more on mining."</div><h4>Why did you decide to specialize in this niche sector?</h4><p>We already have the necessary capacity to produce passenger carriages. HEPCO's main shareholder is Kowsar Wagon Construction Company, and we can tackle such projects together.</p><h4>What steps need to be taken by the government and the private sector to develop the local mining industry?</h4><p>The most critical element is to support exploration. The development of the mining industry depends on the exploration data available. Iran has a Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), and in the near future the excavation ratio should be doubled. The FYDP outlines increased levels of investment in aluminum, copper, and iron ore. According to the FYDP, HEPCO will provide $800 million worth of machinery for this industry, which in our view is the most important element of the plan. We are interested in providing this kind of machinery, and the government is solidly supporting the private sector to be able to achieve the stated targets.</p><h4>What does HEPCO bring to the mining industry in terms of value-added compared to its competitors?</h4><p>HEPCO provides machinery to companies in order to begin excavation activities. We provide machinery for the mining of natural stone for residential use. Usually, around 30% to 40% of the stone mined is good to use, while the rest is rubble. However, we have introduced machinery that increase the usability ratio to 70% or 80%. In the past, miners used heavy loaders. Now, HEPCO has introduced more modern machinery and equipment that not only increases productivity, but also promotes value-added. Our backhoe loaders also cost one-third that of the normal heavy-duty loaders in the market. This equipment can be used in both iron ore and copper mines, reducing costs and upping productivity. With our new range of excavators and loaders, we are also looking to further decrease costs.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013 and what are your expectations for the export market?</h4><p>We are optimistic. In terms of exports, the government is working to promote trade links for machinery sales. We hope that this, in turn, will improve our access to the parts that we need to import from abroad. The HEPCO team has continued to develop the firm's capacity to export machinery to neighboring countries in the CIS region and also Iraq. We are currently working on an export development plan and, since the automotive industry in Iraq is flourishing, you will see a lot of Iranian cars and machinery in Iraq. We work to cater to the needs of contractors in foreign markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gassed-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Gas Natural play in the wider Gas Natural Fenosa Group?</h4><p>Gas Natural Fenosa Group has three active business lines in the country: gas distribution, a segment in which we are the leading company with some 1.3 million clients of the overall 2 million; electricity generation by combined-cycle plants that can generate up to 2,000 MW—we currently have four generation plants; and wind energy, an area that is quite new for the company and in which we are developing a wind farm that will generate and supply 234 MW.</p><h4>In your opinion, what is Mexico potential to become a larger energy player?</h4><p>Mexico has a big opportunity within the natural gas energy segment. Canada, the US, and Mexico form the region with the best natural gas prices in the world. In this regard, Mexico is ranked fourth in terms of shale gas reserves worldwide, despite the country having not started to exploit them. In addition, Mexico also has gas associated with crude oil and dry gas. I believe the country faces an important challenge in starting to exploit its shale gas reserves, for it would make Mexico a self-sufficient country in the energy sphere, and even allow it to become a key exporter. The US is setting the best example for the country, for it's clearly gearing up to become a key player in the sector, producing shale gas locally and also exporting it to other countries. México's potential is enormous, and it is time for the country to turn it into a reality.</p><div class="quote">“Mexico has a big opportunity within the natural gas energy segment."</div><h4>What are the steps that should be taken in order to realize Mexico's potential in the gas industry?</h4><p>The country needs to rethink its energy policies at the national level in order to give a boost to the gas industry. The newly elected government of Mexico has to decide whether to allow a greater participation of the private sector in the industry or, on the other hand, further develop the gas industry through PEMEX. In this regard, Gas Natural does not have active participation in the exploration and production of shale gas, for our partner Repsol is in charge of such activities. In Mexico we focus on the distribution and commercialization of natural gas.</p><h4>What would you say needs to be done in terms of the operational framework to enable effective leveraging of that shale gas potential?</h4><p>Oil production companies deal with both exploration and production (E&amp;P) activities when it comes to gas reserves, and our interest in developing shale gas comes from the opportunity to offer competitive prices to our customers, which would enable Gas Natural Fenosa to further strengthen its position in the market. Our company can provide its own logistics, distribution, and commercialization infrastructure in order to contribute to the development of the gas industry in the country. However, for that to happen measures need to be taken at a higher level, as well as at the production level. The case of Texas and the US is the best example for Mexico, because the development of the production areas of shale gas has enabled the development of the distribution and commercialization areas.</p><h4>Mexico's pipeline network is being extended at the moment. How do you hope Gas Natural's operations will be affected once the pipelines are completed?</h4><p>The government of Mexico has an infrastructure development plan as part of its wider project of exploiting the shale gas industry. The main aim of these infrastructure activities is to strengthen pipeline links with the US in order to import gas, and take the supply points to those areas that lack such infrastructure. Gas Natural Fenosa is following such developments, because reaching new areas that previously lacked infrastructure means new distribution markets. We aim to take part in the tendering processes that have already started to supply gas to these areas. In addition, Gas Natural Fenosa aims to further develop the areas where the company is already active, including the North, Center, and Federal Districts, where there is enough room to expand our activity and further grow our presence in the market. For example, in Monterrey, in the north of Mexico, gas penetration reaches about 80%, whereas in the Federal District the figure is only 20%. Gas Natural Fenosa will increase its level of investment in Mexico in the coming years in order to gain more market share in some of the areas we are already operating in, and, of course, try to expand into new areas.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>Gas Natural Fenosa's expansion plans for the next six years focus on increasing activity in the Federal District and the Bají­os region, which means increasing our investment activity two fold, especially regarding infrastructure. We plan to construct 11,000 kilometers of a new distribution network. At the moment we have more than 16,000 kilometers.</p><h4>How does the company plan to grow its activities within the electricity generation sector in Mexico?</h4><p>Gas Natural Fenosa currently has four combined-cycle generation plants in Mexico with an electricity generation capacity of 2,000 MW. The company's main target in this segment of our activity in Mexico is to continue taking part in tendering processes to construct new plants in the country that the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) could make available in the future. At the moment, we are very content with our participation in the sector, and we believe that we can further increase our stake in the industry in the near future. That will enable Gas Natural Fenosa to be selective when deciding the projects it takes part in. I have to add that Gas Natural Fenosa only applies for tendering processes that envisage the winning company being an independent producer rather than just a building firm to construct the plant.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the natural gas sector in Mexico for the future?</h4><p>In order to further develop, the natural gas industry in Mexico needs to start shale gas exploration activities, further invest in infrastructure, and also improve and strengthen the regulatory framework. This would help us and the other players in the sector better understand the parameters in which we can operate. In this regard, the government has held talks with all the major players in the sector. However, no measures have been taken so far and we expect that within the newly elected government's term to see the parameters within which we can operate. At the same time, I believe that the sector has huge potential growth. The year 2013 will be very important for Gas Natural Fenosa as we have key projects coming up, especially in Mexico City, where we are constructing hundreds of kilometers of pipeline.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What brought on the decision to begin operations in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Schneider Electric's operations have been developing very successfully in Turkey as well as in Russia for the last 40 years. As soon as the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia became independent and political stability was restored, our company started its activities in Azerbaijan. Following the signing of the oil and gas production sharing agreements and the arrival of major international companies, we opened an office in Baku in 2006. Formally managed from Moscow, our Azerbaijani operations are now part of the Middle East and Central Asia division based in Istanbul.</p><h4>How large are your operations in Azerbaijan compared to other countries?</h4><p>Although we started less than five years ago, in terms of ratio to GDP per capita, our level of operations in Azerbaijan already reaches about one-third of what we observe in Turkey. However, the market in Azerbaijan is not as mature as it is in Turkey or the EU. The market is very different mainly because the public-private partnership (PPP) model is not as developed at the moment. We have been growing fast in Azerbaijan and we believe this growth will be sustained in the coming years.</p><div class="quote">“We have been growing fast in Azerbaijan and we believe this growth will be sustained in the coming years."</div><h4>Where is your main target market?</h4><p>As a global specialist in energy management with operations in more than 100 countries, Schneider Electric offers integrated solutions across multiple market segments. Schneider is the market leader in sectors such as public administration and infrastructure, machine industries and manufacturers, both residential and non-residential buildings, and data centers and networks. Dedicated to producing safe, reliable, efficient, productive, and clean energy, its more than 130,000 employees realized sales of ‚¬22.4 billion in 2011, working alongside individuals and organizations to help them make the most of their energy. Schneider Electric specializes in energy management and directly addresses the energy efficiency challenge that humanity is facing. How do we meet world energy demands, which will double by 2050, while halving our CO2 emissions to avoid dramatic climate change? At this moment this is not as big of an issue in Azerbaijan as it is in the EU. However, energy consumption in Azerbaijan is growing fast and the issue is becoming a general concern also for local economic actors. Indeed, today we can see that about 40% of our business is related to energy efficiency. Schneider Electric is involved all along the chain between energy production at power stations and consumption through electrical sockets in the home, with solutions including hardware, software, as well as services.</p><h4>What are some things Schneider has done to increase energy efficiency in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We are working very closely with the local authorities that know us very well from numerous seminars given in Azerbaijan and abroad. Our customers are very much aware of the energy challenge and are willing to cooperate with us on many projects. One example is the Gobustan Alternative Energy Polygon Project developed by the Agency for Renewable Energy. This project aims at demonstrating how small- and medium-sized renewable energy generation can be effectively integrated into the power network of the region of Gobustan, thus feeding a great part of local needs while keeping connected to the national grid thanks to the latest “Smart Grid" solutions developed by Schneider Electric. Another example is our cooperation with utilities and design institutes to promote the design of more efficient solutions for industries and homes. Indeed, with the technology available today on the market, a 30% energy saving can be easily obtained from existing building or industrial facilities. A final example is our already famous online “Energy University," which over the last three years has been providing free training in energy efficiency to thousands of engineers. We now offer, in cooperation with the Institute of Energy Professionals (IEP), online Professional Energy Manager Certification. This program provides individuals with the training required to be successful in this field—and proof of their capabilities. What we really bring to the market can be summarized through the slogan, “We help everyone to make the most of energy everywhere." With 39% of its turnover made in new economies, and about 5% of turnover invested into R&amp;D, Schneider Electric is a world leader in developing new solutions that make energy safe, reliable, efficient, productive, and green. In Azerbaijan, we are now close to 10 people, mostly electrical engineers. Azerbaijan is developing quickly and it is an increasingly easier environment to work in. Our business model is to bring knowledge and advice to improve our customers' business. Our customers invite us because of our technology, engineering expertise, and our technical support. We bring specialists from abroad to encourage and develop cooperation with our customers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Azerbaijani economy in the upcoming years?</h4><p>I have been here since 2010, and it has been a very satisfactory time for us. We have seen very positive government action on many fronts. In business operations many things have become easier, such as the tax issue. There has been major progress, and due to this, business opportunities will increase. However, there are still issues, the biggest of which is the lack of transparency. For an international company to thrive in this environment is not simple. We hope and believe this will improve. We see signs and action, but it will take a long time.</p><h4>What advice would you give to someone wanting to invest in the Azerbaijani electricity sector?</h4><p>First, I would advise getting an agent and starting the business slowly to see how things go. The selection of a partner is obviously the key factor for sustainable development. Schneider Electric in Azerbaijan owes its success not only to the quality of its solutions and reputation, but, to a great extent, on the right choice of strategic partners. Our business partners manufacture under our technology license, distribute our products, and integrate our products into theirs. Such co-operation makes our business in Azerbaijan very sustainable.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Schneider Electric over the coming years?</h4><p>Within the turmoil of the worldwide economic crisis, our company has demonstrated strong resilience. Energy efficiency and cost management are major concerns for all our customers and Schneider Electric offers efficient and flexible solutions that are very well appreciated and valued in the market. We believe that our culture of flexibility and permanent adaptation will enable us to continue our successful growth in the coming years in Azerbaijan and in the region.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Puerto Plata, in the Dominican Republic, was the first Caribbean destination your company incorporated into its portfolio in 1987. How has this country contributed to the growth of Grupo Globalia over the years?</h4><p>Overall, it has been a very successful story with a lot of satisfaction, much effort, and many investments. We have a large corporate structure in the Dominican Republic and 4,000 employees, for whom I would do absolutely everything. Over the years, we have reached an investment level of around $400 million.</p><h4>The Dominican Republic in particular, and the Caribbean region in general, is the main destination for 14% of Air Europa's international passengers. What are the future prospects regarding these touristic destinations?</h4><p>Air Europa will maintain its daily flights from Madrid to both Santo Domingo and Punta Cana, as well as some other specific flights to Puerto Plata. Currently, we are analyzing and exploring the possibility of diverting some of our operations to La Romana.</p><div class="quote">“Visitors can enjoy beautiful beaches and landscapes, and soon there will also be a good motorway network."</div><h4>What will the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner bring to the company's fleet?</h4><p>It will be part of a unique experience for our customers traveling to and from the Dominican Republic. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is considered the plane of the future; it is much more comfortable, quieter, and consumes 30% less fuel. When traveling on it, passengers should be reminded that they are certainly traveling in the most modern aircraft available on the market. At least two of the eight such aircraft that the company owns will be flying between the EU and the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>Air Europa started flying to Puerto Plata in June 2011. What are your future expectations for this destination, and how would you assess the results up until now?</h4><p>We have high hopes about Puerto Plata's present and future. We own two hotels that are practically new, with the most advanced technology and modern settings, and we currently have direct flights to Puerto Plata from Madrid. We are putting great efforts into internationally promoting Puerto Plata through our Travelplan network and Halcón Viajes, as well as through tour operators in the US, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and basically all the countries where we work. I must say that it is not an easy task, for the competition is tough.</p><h4>Be Live Hotels, the group's hospitality chain, launched a tour around several American countries in 2011 to present its new image in the Caribbean. Which countries do you focus your efforts on?</h4><p>Our image is currently associated with quality and the perception that our hotels transmit feelings and sensations, as well as the culture of the country where we operate. Currently, our investment in hotels is greatly focused on the Dominican Republic, a country where we own establishments. Elsewhere in the Americas and the Caribbean region, we only manage the hotels.</p><h4>Do you think the franchise business model can work well in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>My answer is clear; why not? We would be delighted to franchise the brand under high-quality standards. We would have higher commercial volumes, and applying economies of scale, we would certainly be more competitive.</p><h4>In your opinion, what are the main competitive advantages of the Dominican Republic as a destination compared to its tourism competitors?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is a sweet and kind country, in which everybody is looking for the best way to assist you. And they do so with sympathy and really good work. That already makes the country stand out when compared to other destinations. In addition, visitors can enjoy beautiful beaches and landscapes, and soon there will also be a good motorway network. In my opinion, it is an ideal country that lies only four hours away from the US by plane. I believe that it certainly has a bright and promising future ahead.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

We are a very open and welcoming society. We have shown during the Olympics what an individual and quirky place the UK is, and that essentially it is a nice place to be in. Notwithstanding that the economics do have to make sense—and right now they do. We have a number of intelligent industries. We have very advanced financial services, data handling, and the structuring of financial products. As Lord Mayor of the City of London, I represent the world's preeminent global financial center. I speak for financial and professional services, and for the City of London, but also for a great deal more, promoting British expertise across all business sectors and across the globe. I spend a lot of time promoting the UK's excellent expertise in infrastructure, design engineering, project managing, construction, delivery operation and maintenance, technology, innovation, science, creative industries, and education. We are the seventh largest manufacturing country by value in the world. This has been a wonderful year to champion Britain and London. The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games have showcased our city as never before. I congratulate Mexico on the seven medals in the Olympics, particularly in diving and football, and on its 21 medals in the Paralympics. Competitors came to London 2012 from over 200 countries, and they came to a city where some 300 languages are spoken. For the first time in Olympic history, every competitor found their own language already spoken in an Olympic host city.</p><h4>You have spoken about the need to foster strong international partnerships abroad in order to create more jobs at home. What role can Mexico play in that?</h4><p>Mexico has a similar approach in many respects to the UK. Britain historically had a strong presence in Mexico: back in the 1920s most of the railways in Mexico were constructed by British engineers. Over the last 100 years we have paid too little attention to the affinities between the two countries, particularly when it comes to business. I see a number of sophisticated British manufacturers here because they can find the necessary skills and workforce, as well as an open approach and a good geographical position. Beyond just simply exporting, you do a lot better if you establish a strong presence in a target country. Trade flows back and forth at the same time. Mexican companies are attracted to the UK because of our open capital markets, which enable them to raise money more cheaply than in other locations. Plus, we are a gateway to much more open markets, particularly in the EU and further east into Asia. The UK wants to build deeper and stronger international partnerships, as this means jobs, growth, and prosperity for all. Some people talk about trade as a competition, in which one country's success is another's failure. But the whole point about two-way trade is that it is like baking a bigger cake; everyone will benefit from it. In particular, the UK has a need to increase its penetration into export markets, which is why we are looking more and more for opportunities in Latin America. As our Foreign Secretary William Hague stated, “Britain's retreat from Latin America is over, and it is now time for an advance to begin. We will seek intensified and equal partnerships with countries in Latin America." Nowhere is that more important than in our relationship with Mexico, with whom the UK shares so much. As Prime Minister David Cameron said, “We are both vibrant, free-enterprise economies, and crucially, we are free-enterprise economies that depend on trade, investment, and open markets around the world." President Calderón has said that he wanted to see more of the world in Mexico, and Mexico in more of the world. I have been struck on my visit by the similarity of the cultural and business approach between our two countries. We are both open for business, we don't erect barriers to other companies and business coming in, and we benefit from that experience. I recently visited Monterrey where we identified a similar approach to London, a very high proportion of services in the economy, which match the UK in high-value, high-end, high-tech manufacturing. We have a great deal in common.</p><div class="quote">“We look forward to working with our Mexican partners on trade and investment in both directions, all along the supply chain."</div><h4>What steps are being taken to foster two-way trade relations between Mexico and the City of London?</h4><p>We are already engaged with the president-elect and his team here in Mexico and in London. We look forward to working with our Mexican partners on trade and investment in both directions, all along the supply chain, whether that's raising finance via the London Stock Exchange or in the whole range of world-class professional and business services that London provides. Mexican companies have already seen the benefits of what London can provide and want to see more. We had a “Mexico Day" recently, and I strongly suggest there should be more Mexico Days and further visits to London.</p><h4>What can the City of London in particular offer Mexican companies?</h4><p>The City of London is with a truly global reach. We host around 300 foreign banks, more than any other country, with foreign banks managing nearly half of all assets in the UK, totaling over £8 trillion ($13 trillion) at the end of 2011. There are around 1,400 foreign-owned companies operating in the UK licensed by our financial services regulator. We continue to see around one-fifth of world cross-board bank lending done in the UK. We are the largest exporter of financial services in the world; more than double that of our next competitor. Our city continues to prove the full range of services of a global financial center. It has the world's largest insurance market, the most comprehensive range of specialist maritime services in the world with a 20% share in maritime insurance alone, and the whole range of professional services including the major accountancy and legal firms. We recently opened the largest specialist high-tech center for the resolution of financial business and poverty disputes in the world. This is an investment in our future as a center for international law and as a center for international business, which is the largest concentration of judicial expertise on commercial matters in the world. In Tech City, near the City of London itself, we have one of the largest concentrations of small, fast-growing, digital technology companies in the EU, attracted by access to our expertise in private equity and venture capital, entrepreneurial clusters of likeminded businesses, and the close proximity to four of the world's leading technology universities, Oxford, Cambridge, University College of London, and Imperial College of London. These same advantages and opportunities are open to Mexican companies. All in all, it is a great competitive offer, but it is an offer founded on the quality and the cluster of services and people in the City of London. The continuing uncertainty of the eurozone is not helping to create the stability, predictability, and clarity that business demands. All EU countries have a degree of exposure to the sovereign debt crisis, and the UK is of course in the EU, but not the eurozone. The city is a global financial center and is not confined by European markets. We in the City of London are wholly committed to a vibrant, single market and are wholly committed to playing a part in resolving the crisis in the eurozone. We will continue to work with our European partners to resolve the underlying structural issues, but also to find the right balance between regulation that protects consumers, investors, and markets, and regulation that stifles business and enterprise.</p><h4>Where do you see the most obvious opportunities for mutual collaboration?</h4><p>The relationship of Mexico and the UK is at a very good stage. There are great opportunities for partnerships, for British companies investing here, or for profitable joint ventures. Investors know that by investing in the UK, they will realize a good return in a stable and predictable environment. The UK's stable and secure environment means that we remain resilient and offer a well full of opportunities for business. There is an expectation that where there are issues, London will sort them out, which we are doing. In India, I was told by a senior local business figure, “London is the only place I trust." The city wants to deepen its partnership in Mexico in order to build a stronger global economy and create jobs and growth here in Mexico and in the UK. We look forward to working together to do just that.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Mexico over the medium term?</h4><p>My strong sense is that the new government will want to continue the pro-business approach and introduce reforms that will make the economy more open and receptive to foreign investment. This will project a good degree of confidence about Mexico's image around the world; Mexico is currently understated on the world stage. In London, we would like to help Mexico project itself more accurately on to the world stage, and I think the new government will be very supportive of that.</p><p>This interview was conducted during David Wootton's term as Lord Mayor of the City of London.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of Ekol Logistics?</h4><p>Ekol is a traditional family company that goes back 22 years. Ekol is built on “heart and technology." It started as a services company with its main goal being to focus on our customers' needs. The ultimate objective was to serve the customer at all costs, literally. Ekol is a brand name that can and will prevail as a leader across the region and Europe. Ekol employs more than 5,400 people and has annual revenues of ‚¬300 million. We have 1,200 people working internationally and more than 4,200 in Turkey. Ekol is not just a logistics company or a warehouse provider. Ekol is a multicultural, international, Turkish-based, integrated, logistics-solution provider. Those we serve can continue with their business while we provide what I call the “neurological background." Our clients do what they do best, and Ekol will add value to that by ensuring their product is handled, managed, and delivered wherever and whenever. As a company, we have certain strategic advantages. We offer logistics contracts, such as handling our customers' entire supply chain according to their specified guidelines. We do this for some renowned companies.</p><h4>How important is technology and R&amp;D to your business?</h4><p>Ekol is the only company in the sector that develops and produces its own software. We have more than 60 experts whose job is to translate our know-how into software so we can best serve the needs of the customer, often creating tailor-made solutions. The importance we give to technology has helped us to win an award from the Ministry of Science and Technology as the first—and only—R&amp;D company in the logistics sector. Today, we have PhD students and engineers working with us, creating new programs and systems to serve our company and the sector. To receive such an award means we have become the older brother in the industry; the one responsible for generating new technologies. Another advantage is that we receive certain tax breaks and incentives due to our R&amp;D efforts and investments. The sectors we are most active include textiles, automotive, pharmaceuticals, and the rapidly growing e-commerce sector. These are all very sensitive industries. They require serious care and handling. You have to deliver products long distances, on time, and sometimes in very specific conditions, such as at certain temperatures. Ekol's team of experts is working on a number of projects, including software and systems development. We are trying to eliminate as many non-value-adding elements as possible. We want to develop an efficient and sustainable service. We are also working closely with universities and with PhD thesis programs to help achieve this goal. The combination of youth, energy, and innovation is our strength. From day one, the vision was to create a company of young and happy individuals who put the customer first. We were awarded the European Eco Performance Award 2012 by St. Gallen University thanks to our green and eco-friendly practices.</p><div class="quote">“The combination of youth, energy, and innovation is our strength."</div><h4>How would you characterize Ekol's expansion strategy in Europe?</h4><p>Our vision from day one was to be a top brand, not only at home but in the EU as well. In 1996, we opened our first consolidation center in Germany. We have been a dominant force in Central Europe ever since. Now, with the addition of our centers in Romania, Ukraine, Bosnia, France, Italy, and Scandinavia, the company has truly become European. In Romania we have local drivers and number plates, in Greece we have two headquarters with Greek employees, and in Italy and Bosnia the same too. They are small teams, but up and coming. Today we are the fastest growing company in our region, and a fast-growing company in Europe too. We recently joined the CargoLine Logistics Network, and we are the only Turkish company to do so. We believe in building strategic alliances. We have always been keen on associating with international associations and networks. CargoLine will give Ekol several inroads into new business opportunities. I believe it will be a real success.</p><h4>How does Ekol work to integrate environmentally friendly practices into its business?</h4><p>I'll give you an example. When we were building our headquarters, there was a tree that needed cutting down; however, we decided to keep it and build around it. Today, the tree remains in the middle of our building. At Ekol, we have always placed great importance on the environment since day one. We try to save as many kilometers on each logistical route as possible. We have saved the equivalent of 750 football fields worth of forests, and more than 3 million liters of carbon dioxide emissions. That is green. In Ekol there is a company commitment to green awareness. We even have regular tree-planting activities. In 2013, we will be planting 5,000 new trees.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in the logistics sector in the next three to five years?</h4><p>E-commerce will be a growing topic. Logistics is a huge sector, but it is a low-margin business. You are dealing with what is left. Increasingly, the question will be how to maintain sustainable growth. This is a concern in all industries, but especially the highly competitive logistics industry, which is very sensitive to global and economic conditions. A third trend I expect to see will be “fully integrated supply chain management." A logistics company is not just a transport company, it is a company that takes care of the entire process enabling a person to go buy a CD from Virgin Records anywhere in the world, for example.</p><h4>What is your vision for Ekol?</h4><p>The vision had already been set before I joined the company. It is to become a leading logistics brand in the region—the EU and the Middle East. I believe we are there; we are becoming one of the top brands in our sector in the region. I am, in that sense, already a part of an ongoing successful drive. Our next vision is to change the definition of the sector, and we will do it.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you compare Colombia's energy sector with its regional counterparts?</h4><p>Colombia requires three elements in order to become an energy power. The first is natural resources, which is something the country has in huge quantities. Colombia has large amounts of hydrocarbons and alternative energy sources able to produce electricity, such as water, solar, wind, and geothermal. I believe that the latter resources are underdeveloped. If we compare Colombia to other regional countries, the use of these natural resources is only around 10%. The country possesses huge potential in the renewable energy industry, and only Brazil has an amount of natural resources at a similar level. However, Brazil is a much larger country than Colombia. Secondly, I believe that Colombia has a very skilled and professional workforce to satisfy the sector's current needs. Still, I am a little concerned about the future needs of the sector in terms of engineers and specialists, because in the last few years the sector has had to seek out foreign workers due to the decreasing number of engineers graduating from Colombian universities. Thirdly, we need to upgrade the regulatory framework for the renewable energy industry, especially within the electricity generation segment. Colombia has achieved many important things since 1995, when the country adopted market-oriented reforms, with the government leaving regulatory issues to an independent body.</p><h4>What other steps should be taken to speed up the development process of renewable energy projects in Colombia?</h4><p>The main obstacle to more projects being developed in the electricity generation segment is Colombia's most common renewable energy resource. Colombia has large water resources, and it is cheap for us to produce hydroelectricity. The generation price of hydroelectricity is two times lower in Colombia than in any other region. Because of this, the cost of equipment to produce electricity from wind, solar and, geothermal energy is much more expensive, and this poses a clear barrier for their development. I hope than in the next five to 10 years electricity prices in the market will increase in Colombia, and at the same time the cost of alternative energy technology will decrease. This will boost the development of other renewable energy types. I believe that the government should also promote the development of different segments of the renewable energy sector by granting subsidies and incentives to electricity producers. Also, it is a matter of social consciousness, and society is slowly showing an increasing interest in renewable energy. In the near future, we expect to see an increase in the demand for renewable energy. I would also like to add that ISAGEN is working toward this goal. ISAGEN is monitoring the development of geothermal and wind energy facilities and the cost of technology in order to judge when to increase our participation in this segment in the near future.</p><div class="quote">“We need to upgrade the regulatory framework for the renewable energy industry, especially within the generation segment."</div><h4>What are the advantages of geothermal energy, and what is the potential behind this type of energy in Colombia?</h4><p>This type of energy has two main features that make it outstanding; ultimately, the main resource for this type of energy is water. What producers seek out when developing a geothermal project is suitable temperature and soil area to let the water circulate while warming up to become steam. Technology enables us to utilize steam and generate electricity. Therefore, generation costs are very low. I believe it can compete with hydroelectricity in Colombia. However, there are some issues to keep in mind when discussing developing geothermal projects, and one of them is exploration. Initially, the costs and risks of investment are high.</p><h4>In which areas of the country is ISAGEN currently developing geothermal projects?</h4><p>At the moment, and as a sole developer, we are implementing a project at Nevado del Ruiz, where there is a volcano. We have carried out studies with specialized international firms from the US and Japan. We also signed an agreement with an Ecuadorean company to start developing a project in a border area between both countries where there are three small volcano craters: Tufiño, Cerro Negro, and Chiles. However, there are many more potential areas in Colombia for geothermal projects: Paipa, in Boyacá, Santa Rosa de Osos, and in the south of Colombia, between Nariño and Cauca, in the Azufral area.</p><h4>What is the company's current market share?</h4><p>Currently, it stands between 19% and 20% in terms of commercialization. Regarding installed capacity, we are around 17%. We are the third company in the market behind EMGESA and EPM.</p><h4>Is the company considering expanding its activities abroad?</h4><p>For the last three years, we have been looking into production and commercialization projects outside of Colombia. We are looking at expanding into Peru, Chile, and Central America. However, we have yet to find an adequate project that fits our goals, expectations and plans, because we are highly committed to protecting the environment.</p><h4>What are the general expectations of the company's performance and the prices of energy for the current year?</h4><p>Extreme weather conditions can easily drive prices up in the capital markets, and over the last few months there has been speculation as to a possible weather phenomenon affecting the country. However, energy in Colombia is sold over two- to three-year contracts between producers and distributors at fixed prices. This means prices are unaffected by market volatilities, and provides companies and customers with security. Although prices in the last few months have been rising, I believe that by the end of 2012 they will return to their usual levels. I believe ISAGEN is doing well after some extremely positive years, and for the next couple of years ISAGEN is expected to generate revenues worth Ps1.7 billion, with an estimated operating margin of 40%. We anticipate the company and prices will grow in an organic way according to the development of the sector.</p><h4>What will the Sogamoso hydroelectric project mean for ISAGEN, and for Colombia?</h4><p>It is a key project for the company, because it will multiply the company's size and activity 1.6 fold. Currently, ISAGEN has 2,000 MW of installed capacity, and with the Sogamoso project this figure will increase up to 3,000 MW. The size of the Sogamoso project is 820 MW, and it will require Ps4.1 billion in investment. It will enable us to increase production figures by 60%. We believe that the project will be fully operational by 2014. To put the project into context at the national level, Sogamoso will meet 10% of the country's current energy consumption requirements, or some 5,050 GW/h per year. In other words, it would be like providing energy to half of Bogotá. We also believe that the Sogamoso project will be a leading infrastructure project for the development of the Santander region. It is a project that involves international contractors; Italian contractors manage the civil works and engineering, while German, Japanese, and Brazilian companies are also involved in the project from the equipment and provision point of view.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Total in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have had over 15 years of history with some unfortunate trials as well as some successful ventures. It started with entry into the Shah Deniz gas field. There was also an exploration project, on the Lenkoran-Talish-Deniz block, operated by ELF, one of the companies now a part of Total, as well as a former partnership with Chevron on the Absheron block. Both Absheron and Lenkoran-Talish-Deniz turned out to be considered dry in the beginning, so we relinquished them. Shah Deniz turned into a success and we are still there. We continued studying the Absheron block and we recently took it on again. This time we partnered with SOCAR, and in September 2011 we made a successful discovery. We believe there are around 5-10 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of potential reserves there.</p><h4>What are your future exploration strategies in the Absheron field?</h4><p>First, we need to evaluate the extent of the field and shoot a 3D seismic survey in 2013. After that, we will drill an appraisal well once we get access to a drilling rig. In parallel, we issued a notice of discovery and its commerciality in June 2012, and we are launching studies on the first stage of the field's development.</p><div class="quote">“It is good for the Azerbaijanis to work with different kinds of people with different experiences so they can gain experience."</div><h4>What sort of working relationship do you have with your partners?</h4><p>The relationship is a normal working partnership. SOCAR has 40%, Total has 40%, and GDFSUEZ has 20%. The next step will be to create an operating company for future development. This means that an entity made out of Total, SOCAR, and potentially GDFSUEZ will be in charge of the development and production activities as soon as the development program is agreed upon with SOCAR. It will be a closer relationship because we will have a common entity to work through.</p><h4>What is Total's role in the development of the Shah Deniz field?</h4><p>Total has a 10% stake in the Shah Deniz field. We aim to be a constructive partner that tries to bring our experience to the project and provide some of our know-how while working with the operator to propose improvements where we see possible. At the moment, in Phase I, we are producing something between 800 million and 900 million standard cubic feet (scf) per day. In Phase II, this is expected to increase by an additional 16 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year comprised of 6 bcm going to Turkey and 10 bcm going to the EU. Most of our activities in Shah Deniz at the moment are concentrated on Phase II development.</p><h4>How important are Total's Azerbaijani operations for the Total Group?</h4><p>It terms of production, it is not that important because our equity production here is about 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day this year, whereas the total equity production of Total worldwide is close to 2.4 million boe per day. We project that this proportion will increase significantly when Phase II of Shah Deniz comes on stream and later when Absheron begins to produce. There are also further opportunities in Azerbaijan, such as offshore exploration, which we can contribute to and would be ready to work on if SOCAR is interested.</p><h4>How do you think that Total's international background can be of use to Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We bring experience and know-how, which we gained working in many other places in the world, and through significant R&amp;D activities. Total is French, but it is a global company with international experience, and we have people from all over the world working for us. We have our own company approach to problems, and we have a management made up of people who are educated in the French system, which is known to teach an intellectual management approach different to the Anglo-Saxon one. Total has a very strong technical approach. We study every technical aspect and we believe in technology. In terms of business and relationships, we tend to favor discussion and have a belief in the value of agreement rather than confrontation. It is good for the Azerbaijanis to work with different kinds of people with different experiences so they can gain experience. We do not pretend be the best, but we try hard and we bring a novel approach to problem solving, which can be of use for Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What is the role of Total in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) and South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) projects?</h4><p>We have a small equity role of 5% in BTC and 10% in SCP, so we don't have a major influence. BTC is of interest for us to export our liquid production from Shah Deniz and eventually from Absheron. It is also of interest because we will begin production in Kazakhstan, and we may ship some of that production through BTC one day. Regarding the SCP, it is linked to our role in Shah Deniz because we use it to export the gas from the field. It may be an export solution in the future for the gas production of Absheron. It is an asset that has significance for us. At the moment, the capacities of those pipelines are matched to Shah Deniz output, which is about 8 billion cubic meters per annum (bcma), at the moment, and 24 bcma once Phase II is completed. SCP is also the first link to the Trans-Anatolia Pipeline (TANAP) then to the South East Corridor onto Europe.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Azerbaijan's role as an energy hub in the future?</h4><p>On a regional scale, it could be a route for the export of gas from Turkmenistan once that comes online. In my opinion, Azerbaijan is less of a hub and more of a source for the EU, albeit not a major one. Once Shah Deniz Phase II comes on stream, Azerbaijan will export 10 bcma to the EU. As a matter of comparison, France alone consumes about 40 bcma. The energy potential in Azerbaijan represents around 10% of the total consumption of the EU. It will play a role in providing competition and an alternative, but it will not be a dominant provider. However, this doesn't prevent Azerbaijan from being a major provider to some countries, which would be absorbing some of its production. New exploration technology might provide Azerbaijan with the capability to produce five times as much as it exports currently, but even that will not make it the EU's sole provider. In terms of oil, production is declining in Azerbaijan. It reached a peak just above 1 million barrels of oil per year, and it will not grow much above that. Based on 2011 statistics, in terms of production or proven oil and gas reserves, Azerbaijan's rank is between 20th and 30th in the world. Though Azerbaijan will never be Saudi Arabia, it is an achievement.</p><h4>How does Total try to incorporate Azerbaijani nationals into its operations?</h4><p>We are integrating more and more locals into our operations. Apart from recent exploration activities, approximately two-thirds of our company is currently Azerbaijani. In 2010 and 2011, the percentage of expatriates increased because it was an exploration project, on which we needed highly specialized workers due to the various technological aspects. Since our project here has been successful, the foreign specialists are leaving and we will bring in some new people with different capabilities, we will continue recruiting Azerbaijanis, and we will also build on our present Azerbaijani employees. Total's operations in Azerbaijan are today rather small. We have about 45 employees here in 2012. This will go down to 35 in 2013 because we will not have drilling operations. We will increase it later on once Absheron's development speeds up.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the austerity plans announced by the Dominican government impact your Ministry's plans?</h4><p>Many of the key people within this Ministry come from the private sector, and therefore we are used to living under austerity plans. For that reason, when I recently took over the position as Minister, my team and I assumed the responsibilities handed over by President Danilo Medina. Sometimes, a team can do better than its predecessors with half of the economic resources the others had, and therefore our vision is to tend to the needs of small projects rather than look at the big picture. The country currently has very important road infrastructure that over the years has been forgotten. For that reason, we aim to boost road maintenance investment rather than develop new projects. Our main target is to implement road infrastructure policies and works that will last—those that the Ministry will not need to re-invest in every time there is a change of government. In addition to that, we are currently revising all of the existing project contracts as part of what we call “value engineering." We will revise the terms, work done, and budgets of these projects to see if they conform to today's realities.</p><h4>What plans does the Ministry have to contribute to the government's target to reach 10 million tourists per year?</h4><p>Our Ministry's working agenda is tightly linked to the government's national plans, and through our strategies and work we aim to reinforce them. President Medina established tourism as a strategic sector for the country's economy, and the first thing we did here was to revise all of the road infrastructure projects in the eastern part of the country, the main tourism destination of the Dominican Republic. For example, the tourism boulevard project was initiated eight years ago and has yet to be completed. At the moment, we have reached an agreement with contractors to boost the project and accelerate its construction by signing a new contract. We have also re-established some of our Ministry's priorities after a long and fruitful meeting with the tourism authorities in Puerto Plata, another very important tourism center for the country. We agreed upon a working agenda for the next four to five years. We share the President's vision of establishing the tourism sector as the strategic engine driving the national economy.</p><div class="quote">“We share the President's vision of establishing the tourism sector as the strategic engine driving the national economy."</div><h4>Since foreign investment has played a key role in developing infrastructure projects in the country, how would you assess the importance of FDI in the Ministry's future plans?</h4><p>In terms of the Ministry's work, we have not developed projects through foreign investors, because it has been an investment carried out by the country. The Ministry, either on its own or through either local or foreign contractors, directly develops road projects. The latter option is prioritized when beneficial payment agreements are reached. However, at the hospitality level, the great majority of the projects developed over the last few years have been done through FDI, because they are private initiatives. Having said that, any foreign investor interested in developing projects in the Dominican Republic will always be more than welcome, and from the Ministry, we will make sure that they will compete at the same level as any local company.</p><h4>What role can private investment play in the implementation of national infrastructure plans in a time of budget cuts?</h4><p>We are currently working on several areas. For example, we have set up a working group to determine the best utility for the taxes collected from road tolls, and at the same time, we are working on raising awareness among Dominicans of the importance of paying these fees if they want to enjoy high-standard roads. The Dominican Republic is home to the most important city with colonial heritage, Santo Domingo. However, current tourism trends are not linked with these cultural aspects because of the lack of good road infrastructure linking the main cities of our country. The Coral Highway and some other complementary projects along this road will make the eastern part of the country a well-connected tourism destination that should boost the overall number of visitors and investment figures.</p><h4>What are the key strategic plans that the Ministry has to improve transport infrastructure with Haiti?</h4><p>There are two main roads that currently connect the Dominican Republic and Haiti: through the Dajabón province in the north, and through Independencia province in the south. We have already started the whole southern road circuit, and we are working toward recovering the road across Enriquillo Lake in Independencia province. In addition, we are finishing repaving work around the border connection in Jimaní­, which is the border point with the highest traffic density between both countries. We believe that, for our part, the southern connection points will be fully completed by early 2013. We are also in the process of establishing the infrastructure needs of Dajabón, and that will be one of our main focuses of 2013, because Haiti is where we export the most.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to strengthen the country's response work for natural disasters?</h4><p>We currently have the highest and latest international regulations related to earthquakes when developing construction projects. The Dominican Republic has always been at the international forefront in this field, and we have learned a lot from catastrophes in other countries in the last 20 to 30 years. Also, we belong to leading international bodies and institutions, and that enables us to always be on top in terms of regulations and procedures. At the same time, we have a plan to strengthen the monitoring of construction work in the country, as well as to start a process to monitor the quality of older buildings in the country.</p><h4>What are the main projects that will be inaugurated in the near future?</h4><p>We will be launching a new Caimán Bridge between Enriquillo and Pedernales in December 2012 to replace the one that collapsed 14 years ago when Hurricane Georges hit the country. At the same time, we just finished the Jatubey Bridge in Bonao, and we will inaugurate several new roads such as the Guaco and Salcedo roads. We will boost the Eastern Road Circuit—which is formed of about eight roads—and we expect that it will be finished in 18 months. From December, we will inaugurate the toll points on the Coral Highway, and that will help us to collect funds that will be allocated to the maintenance of the highway. Finally, we will open the first part of the seafront promenade in El Malecón, Santo Domingo. These are only some of the many infrastructure projects we are currently handling and that we will be completing in the next four years, with an average investment budget of Ps50 billion per year.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have been adopted to support investment in the oil sector in the face of possible price fluctuations?</h4><p>Iran's Ministry of Petroleum and its subsidiaries, based on the deals signed with contractors, are doing their utmost to minimize losses inflicted on investors should the costs of project implementation increase. Normally, based on the content of the contracts, investors are bound to accept risks associated with their activities. As far as financing for projects is concerned, if the ministry and its subsidiaries face funding shortages, we will focus on several strategies: implementing projects with acceptable physical progress; developing oil and gas fields shared with neighboring countries; and providing customs, economic, financial, and taxation incentives.</p><h4>How can the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between Iran's Ministry of Petroleum and the National Development Fund (NDF) in early July 2012 strategically expand the oil industry's projects?</h4><p>The facilities envisaged in the MoU mainly apply to upstream projects, and more specifically to shared fields, in order to enhance oil and gas production and encourage competition. Given the NDF's mission to finance projects operated by the private sector, contractors, manufacturers, and other private contributors will receive the required funds. Moreover, the development of upstream projects will lay the groundwork for the expansion of refining, gas, and petrochemical units, which will, in turn, expand the oil industry's value chain.</p><div class="quote">“If everything goes as planned, Iran will be exporting 34 million liters of gasoline a year by 2015."</div><h4>Iran sits atop huge untapped hydrocarbon reserves. How does the government support the exploration of new reserves and what are the main projects currently underway?</h4><p>More than $4.5 billion is forecast to be invested in the exploration of hydrocarbon reserves through the fifth Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP) covering 2010-2015. To that effect, exploration operations are already planned in Khorramabad, Garmsar, Dayer, Danan, and the Moghan II blocks under the plan. Moreover, 16 new onshore and eight offshore blocks are also expected to undergo exploration operations during this period. Articles 125 and 129 of the development plan require the Ministry of Petroleum to support exploration operations.</p><h4>What do you expect from the development of Yadavaran oil field?</h4><p>Sinopec is currently developing the Yadavaran oil field, the early production of which is forecast to reach 20,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). After the full implementation of the project, the field will be producing 180,000 bbl/d.</p><h4>Iran's petrochemical industry has attracted huge investment. How does your ministry facilitate foreign investment in the sector?</h4><p>Given the daily growing use of petrochemical products across the world, countries facing shortages in feedstock, technology, infrastructure, and experienced manpower will be driven out of the loop due to high production costs. But in Iran, thanks to huge gas, gas condensate, and liquid reserves, the petrochemical industry is thriving and welcomes investment. A simple review of the country's petrochemical production under the third, fourth, and fifth FYDPs indicates that investment in the petrochemical and downstream industries has been growing at an acceptable level. To that effect, the ministry envisages introducing new opportunities for investment, supplying feedstock to petrochemical plants, contributing to the centralization of the investment permissions procedure, establishing petrochemical towns to serve the petrochemical value chain in a complementary fashion, and preparing the necessary infrastructure for new petrochemical plants.</p><h4>Over the past few years, Iran has expanded its refining capacity while the country's gasoline consumption has declined following the removal of energy subsidies. How is the ministry planning to rebalance domestic supply and demand?</h4><p>The development of refining industries is aimed at halting crude oil sales. To that effect, the ministry envisages boosting oil product exports. If everything goes as planned, Iran will be exporting 34 million liters of gasoline a year by 2015.</p><h4>The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and Iran's Ministry of Petroleum are looking to establish the Oil Bank of Iran. What does this bank represent and what will its primary functions be?</h4><p>Such a venture, although not yet agreed upon, is envisaged through the contribution of private contractors. However, the Energy Fund has been set up with the contribution of domestic banks to finance oil and gas projects.</p><h4>What are you expecting from Iran's oil and gas industry in 2013?</h4><p>Based on the fifth FYDP, the objectives of the oil industry in 2013 include: increasing the country's crude oil production to 4.831 million barrels per day (mb/d); raising the country's natural gas production to 973 million cubic meters per day (mcm/d); lifting gas condensate production to 781,000 bbl/d, boosting natural gas exports to 125 mcm/d; upping naphtha and natural gasoline production to 106,000 bbl/d; escalating gasoline and gasoil production to 82 million liters per day (ml/d) and 97 ml/d, respectively; and finalizing decisions about the development of shared oil and gas fields.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What levels of investment will Shell be maintaining in the market over the coming years to finance its upstream operations?</h4><p>It really depends on what opportunities arise in the future. Shell has made significant investments in the past. We have a contract with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) to supply LNG, and we have made significant investments in that area. The future depends on how the energy sector evolves. The expectation is that an energy reform will take place in the near future and we will be following the debate and outcome of the discussion very closely, with the intention of continuing to expand our operations in Mexico.</p><h4>The development of Mexico's untapped gas reserves remains the subject of much speculation. What can be done to capitalize on the opportunities that exist?</h4><p>I think Mexico needs to sit down, take a pause, look at successful examples like Colombia or Brazil, and decide what it wants to adopt from these models to create its own. Then, companies like Shell will be able to make a decision on whether to participate and to what extent. We are very keen on working and cooperating with Mexico just as we have in the past. We run a refinery with Pemex in the US, and our contract with the CFE is also very significant—we would like to continue these relationships. Pemex has done a great job so far, but the challenges moving forward are so big that no company can do it alone. We are hopeful that an energy reform will take place in the near future that will allow Mexico to tap into its hydrocarbon resources.</p><div class="quote">“We are always looking for new opportunities in Mexico. At the moment, we have a few projects in the pipeline."</div><h4>What potential exists for Mexico to become a significant regional player?</h4><p>I think that the potential is huge provided the regulatory framework that will be put in place is competitive against other models around the world. The knock-on effect of capital investment in the energy sector will have an impact on the rest of Mexico's economy and allow it to continue growing at a very accelerated pace. Health, education, and energy are the key sectors of any economy, and in the case of Mexico energy is very important. If it were to be developed more intensively, it would create an impressive virtuous cycle.</p><h4>What is the company's strategy for adopting new technology, and how are you using technology to minimize your impact on the environment?</h4><p>Shell's vision is to be the most competitive and innovative company in the world. We probably invest more in R&amp;D than most companies around the world. In 2011 we invested over $1 billion in R&amp;D alone. When it comes to sustainability, Shell does it in different ways through a number of programs. Obviously, one is that we are becoming more of a gas company. Gas is the cleanest fossil fuel, and it produces some 50%-70% fewer CO2 emissions than coal. Shell is also investing in biofuels, and today the company is probably the largest global distributer of biofuels. We also manage important Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects around the world. We have one in Canada, we are proceeding with another one in Norway, and are developing another one with Chevron in Australia through Gorgon. We reduced atmospheric emissions by 3% last year, which basically means the reduced flaring of gas.</p><h4>In this region, to what extent is there an awareness of the complex relationship between water, energy, and food security?</h4><p>I think this is an area in which much more needs to be done. We recognize that the link between food, water, and energy is enormous. The view we have is that by 2030, which is not far away from where we are now, the demand in these three areas will increase between 30% and 50%. To produce more food we need more water, and to produce more water and distribute it we need more energy, but we also need water to produce energy or extract oil and gas. The link is very close, and I think our aspiration eventually is to link water and energy. We are launching many global initiatives to try to reduce our water usage and become more efficient. However, in this region it is something that we need to work harder to achieve, and it is at the top of our agenda.</p><h4>What are your key ongoing projects and what are your development plans?</h4><p>We are always looking for new opportunities in Mexico. At the moment, we have a few projects in the pipeline. One is called the Mexico Sourcing Office (MSO). Shell has identified four locations in the world where we would like to develop suppliers: Russia, China, India, and Mexico. We are bringing local companies that are established in Mexico up to Shell standards so that they can compete in Shell's international tenders. We are making sure that suppliers buy into Shell's code of conduct and principles, and then we certify them. It is a project that will hopefully not only benefit Shell, but other international oil companies (IOCs) around the world. It will allow them to compete in other international bids as well. We have a team here devoted just to this project and to working with companies in Mexico to make sure they are up to speed. We have a large operation in the US and in Canada, making Mexico very well placed. The labor force is strong and Mexico is very competitive in that regard. Even with the lack of pipeline infrastructure, we are looking on the gas side to see if we can establish or expand the usage of LNG, both in industry and transport. Gas is very competitive price wise. It is more efficient, cleaner, and there is the potential for users to make big savings. It is an area that we are again slowly opening up. I think Shell is probably the first IOC that is tapping into this new business, and it takes a long time and a lot of commitment.</p><h4>Do you find enough high-quality contractors available in this market?</h4><p>One of the reasons we decided to work with Mexico was because many firms have been producing for quite some time. They have been providing products to Pemex, meaning they already know what the business is about. It is now about bringing them up to higher standards when it comes to safety and codes of conduct. There are some that need less work and others that need a bit more help, but in general we are quite pleased with what we have found in Mexico. That is why Mexico has been chosen as a potential supplier for the group.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>Hopefully, 2013 will be the year when we discuss energy reform. I think it will be a great opportunity for the new government to deliver on its campaign promises and to listen to all the different points of view. I am hopeful that 2013 will be a year when there is a lot of debate on what Mexico wants to do and where it wants to go; hopefully, Shell will be able to contribute to that debate. We will be more than willing to share experiences, participate in those discussions, put proposals forward, and hopefully partner with Pemex and with Mexico in general to bring the country to the next level of development. We have been here for nearly 60 years, and I hope that we will be here for at least another 60. We are always looking into new areas of investment and are very committed to Mexico in the long term, regardless of what happens with the energy reforms in 2013 or in the coming years.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are the number one mobile communications provider in the region. How do you shape your competitive strategy?</h4><p>We have one national asset—we were the first operator to enter the market with the largest customer base. After the second provider entered the market, we tried to strengthen our competitive advantage against our rivals, and our main advantage was the coverage we provided. We tried to utilize and shape this competitive advantage by leveraging our coverage and providing more services to be more attractive to customers. In the last six years, we haven't increased our prices and we have tried to keep them constant. Although inflation increased the prices of goods and services, we tried to manage our tariffs, providing more high-quality services. Being a state-owned company, the government was the only shareholder and it was not looking for much profit. We tried to improve coverage in rural areas, and after being privatized, MCI increased its coverage span, offering high-quality and more competitive and innovative services.</p><h4>ICT is a fast-growing sector in Iran, with positive spillovers into the non-prime sectors of the economy. Which ICT-related areas do you consider need further investment?</h4><p>In the ICT market, broadband remains an underinvested segment. Based on our license, we are not allowed to launch our mobile broadband services yet. As part of its M&amp;A strategy, MCI acquired 40% of a broadband service provider called MobilNet, which provides wireless broadband services via WiMAX technology and has a nationwide license. The broadband world is actually the most attractive, but it is underdeveloped in Iran. If you look globally at a country level, investments in the upstream oil industry need more attention. Value-added services over mobile technology seem to be very attractive for further investments, including mobile financial services, mobile payments, mobile banking, and machine-to-machine (M2M) services. When the broadband system expands, broadband-related services grow apace. The third underinvested sector is devices; 12 million tablets have been purchased in the country, and we are planning on rolling out our chain store to provide complementary services rather than just basic connection services. The increased presence of smartphones in the mobile industry and the market for applications is explosive. One of our own strategies is to build local app stores to protect the Farsi language and meet local demand.</p><div class="quote">“We believe that to shape the value chain and sell content and applications we should maintain a focus on content."</div><h4>How important is it to link your brand to VAS and mobile devices?</h4><p>Globally, there is a war between mobile operators and content providers. We believe that to shape the value chain and sell content and applications we should maintain a focus on content. For example, US companies such as Google and Facebook offer well-known applications such as Google Talk; the content provider sells it to the customer, and he or she can use any kind of connection for voice, video, or SMS without paying the operator the cost of the service. We, as an operator, spend money and build the network infrastructure, and someone else will use it and make revenues from our network. If we provide internet services, we can connect our users. However, if people use voice over IP, the operators are globally trying to charge customers with different models based on the content. This is a global war, and if operators do nothing they will lose market share to content providers.</p><h4>How will the dynamics among the current operators change with the introduction of 4G to the market, and what major trends are you anticipating?</h4><p>The regulators considered a two-year exclusivity protection period for service providers, and this period will end in June 2013. Both MCI and MTN Irancell will be allowed to launch mobile broadband services after the approval of the operator. We are going to invest in mobile broadband technology. Therefore, MCI is going to bring 4G to the market. Globally, 4G is not as developed as 3G. This will allow MCI to think about how to be compatible with and evolve 4G technology and introduce it in the market for the people. One of the big concerns is which new technology we are going to choose and invest in, and how it can increase our productivity; the company's approach is to go toward 4G because the cost per megabyte is cheaper than 3G.</p><h4>What are your plans to develop infrastructure and in which direction are you planning to take your capital expenditure in 2012 and 2013?</h4><p>The GSM network has two main types of equipment: the first is the radio network that you can see from the streets, and the second one is the core network. Starting in 2011, there were several initiatives designed to modernize the core network and replace what has been installed in the past 18 years in order to manage and prepare for the broadband connectivity of the future. By the end of 2012, the radio network will be replaced and modernized, and this requires an investment of $600 million. We are going to replace the system that we bought from Siemens; since the acquisition of Siemens by Nokia, the equipment has not been upgraded. We would like to provide more capacity for the network and increase demand. Also, we are thinking about becoming an international operator. We have investigated many operators in the region, and our focus is on buying assets from them. The National Development Fund can invest in our international operations, helping us in this international M&amp;A process.</p><p>© The Business Year - July 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of Irancell's activities in 2011 and 2012?</h4><p>In 2011 and 2012 we reached a 47% market share in the local mobile telecommunications sector. We managed a very stable network to satisfy subscriber requirements and offers acceptable coverage. However, we are continuously working to improve our quality. MTN Irancell has achieved all the targets set under its license with the Ministry of ICT. The company has also begun to offer several new services to send and receive e-mail, as well as develop new platforms for making bank payments. We are working on expanding our channels for sales in order to open up opportunities to everyone, particularly by providing fast access to our network and offering recharge cards and other services. Our corporate offerings are also expanding; we offer our corporate clients VPN, APN, and mobile newspaper services, which allow them to broadcast their bulletins or other documents through our system. Newspapers and other media organizations are also able to utilize this mobile technology.</p><h4>What specific approach do you have for corporate services that differentiate you from other mobile providers?</h4><p>We tailor our services to the needs of our clients. The company also offers the enterprise messaging system (EMS) to our corporate clients. This system allows companies to communicate quickly and efficiently both internally and externally. For example, EMS is useful for banks as they communicate with their customers. Companies come to us with their needs and we create total solutions for them. There are an unlimited number of solutions that we can provide to different segments of the market.</p><div class="quote">“We are optimistic about further increasing coverage in 2012 and 2013 while maintaining high KPIs in areas such as call quality."</div><h4>What services are you promoting in order to attract a larger customer base and expand your market share?</h4><p>One important service is our mobile media portal, or Vitrin, which is a platform with a variety of content. Through Vitrin young customers can access wallpapers, ringtones, and music. This is one of our main data services. We also provide internet access through GPRS, which is very fast and reliable. MTN Irancell is expanding its e-mail and media offerings for younger customers. In addition, we are trying to adapt our product offering according to the feedback we receive from the market. Every month, we analyze our subscribers' feedback in order to identify solutions and provide better and high-quality customer service.</p><h4>Iran's mobile penetration rate is up 129% in 2012. In this context, how does Irancell shape its competitive strategy?</h4><p>Iran is not the only country that is experiencing mobile penetration rates higher than 100%; this is common across the Middle East. Our growth during the first eight months of 2012 shows that there is still plenty of room in the market and it is not yet saturated. How can we maintain our market share? First, we provide high-quality service. During the last few years, we have maintained a higher level of quality than our competitors. We have exceeded our goals according to a number of important key performance indicators (KPIs). We have reduced the number of dropped calls and improved success rates. We have also expanded coverage and call quality. We believe that the demand for data is increasing significantly—not only in Iran, but also globally. Therefore, the company is making preparations to expand bandwidth to meet this growing demand. We are also adding new services such as the banking system, LBS, e-mail products, and other content. The key way to maintain our position is for us to adapt our capabilities to the subscribers' requirements.</p><h4>Earlier you mentioned coverage. What is the actual coverage that you have in Iran?</h4><p>Irancell covers more than 80% of the population of Iran. The majority of the urban hubs in the country and about 50% of the villages are covered. We are a very young operator, and it hasn't been easy to obtain 80% coverage. We are optimistic about further increasing coverage in 2012 and 2013 while maintaining high KPIs in areas such as call quality. There may be some specific zones that experience a lack of coverage due to interference. However, all of the main cities are covered.</p><h4>How are you planning to cover other cities?</h4><p>Over the last eight months, we have experienced very significant growth in terms of the number of subscribers. In 2012 and 2013, we aim to invest substantially to maintain a high level of quality and expand coverage. Our customers are used to high quality, and we are not going to change our policy because the number of subscribers is increasing. Our plan is to invest more, especially in network technology. We also plan to invest in improving the speed of data services and offer more services based on data. We want to continue to improve the services that we already offer.</p><h4>What is the current data speed, and how do you plan to increase it?</h4><p>Technology generation 2.0 and 2.5 is limited to GPRS. Technology EDGE or 2.75 is limited to less than 200 kilobytes per second (kbps). With the existing license and technology that we have, data is limited to this speed, but we also need to have enough capacity in our network to support all the subscribers. With this technology the data speed is limited.</p><h4>What challenges do you encounter in your operations? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the local mobile sector?</h4><p>One of the challenges we face is that we do not yet have access to 3G technology. At the same time, we have better quality and coverage than other companies. The second challenge is that we sometimes face difficulties with municipalities, landlords, or operators in expanding our network sites. Despite this, the market is very good and the demand for new services is high. This means that there is substantial incentive for operators to make significant investments.</p><h4>In 2011, the company introduced WiMAX internet services. How is this project developing and what other internet services are you planning to offer in the near future?</h4><p>WiMAX is a new service being offered for the first time in Iran. We have tried to educate our subscribers about the benefits of this new system and we have learned a lot from the market. We have introduced ourselves not only as a mobile operator, but also as a major telecommunications company. At Irancell, we are working to expand our internet network in the way that we have done with GSM in different provinces. Currently, Irancell has licenses in seven provinces. We have launched VPN products on WiMAX and have given the opportunity to banks and large corporations to use our network to support their systems. We are also aiming to activate VoIP technology so as to provide this service to our customers in the near future as well. At the same time, we are planning to combine our service options such as GSM and WiMAX to offer dual plans to our clients. Furthermore, we are testing IPTV technology. Currently, internet and VPN are available, and we have both private and corporate users.</p><h4>How is Irancell integrating value-added services?</h4><p>For all of the value-added services, we employ third parties. We have a very attractive revenue-sharing system that incentivizes third-party investment and participation. For example, the Vitrin service enjoys participation from private companies. We implemented the infrastructure to create opportunities for any company that wants to get involved with value-added services. There are almost 20 companies offering content with Irancell. They're offering many new services that are controlled and managed independently. Our platform for value-added services is profitable today, and there is the potential for increased profitability in the future, as well as opportunities for any company to invest.</p><h4>Are you planning to invest heavily in this area?</h4><p>We have begun offering a banking platform through USSD, a system that offers more security through SMS verification. Now we are investing heavily to increase security and create extra opportunities for banks and subscribers to do more with mobile technology. This is the same for all of the value-added services we provide; we are aiming not only for growth, but also for increased quality.</p><h4>How would you evaluate your position in the market?</h4><p>One of our major focuses is quality. The main reason we are equipped to achieve a strong market position is because we maintain superior service quality. We are investing and we plan to invest more. For 2013 and 2014, we are planning to invest significantly in broadband technology such as 3G, 4G, and WiMAX in order to increase data speed and capacity. Another area where we excel is with corporate business. These focuses contribute to maintaining a strong market share and position in the country.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2013?</h4><p>We will continue on the same level of growth as in 2011 and 2012, and we expect to achieve all of the KPI targets in coverage, quality, and services. We hope to get a license to launch 3G in response to the large demand from our customers. We expect a strong market in 2013. So far, it has been a very successful joint venture, especially for the ICT sector. We believe that we set a very strong example for other sectors to follow.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2011, The Mehr Housing Project produced 600,000 new units in its first phase. How has the Ministry balanced supply and demand considering the mass production of these units?</h4><p>It is the Ministry's goal to increase housing supply and create a balance between supply and demand in the housing market in order to control the trend of housing prices and provide housing to the vulnerable. By accomplishing these two objectives, the government's ability to respond to security challenges increases.</p><h4>How would you describe Iran's current infrastructure network?</h4><p>Sustainable development is fundamental in economic, social, and cultural matters. Roads, in particular, are very important in regards to the communications network, and also affect many of the country's activities. Any new roads to be developed will be based on internal arterial roads. More than 90% of passenger transport is currently road based. The main priorities of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development are the extension of the road network and communication lines. The Mehr-Mandgar project has been developed to help achieve these priorities. The Roads and Urban Development Ministry and the government plan to complete 745 kilometers of freeways, 5,626 kilometers of highways, and 2,970 kilometers of main roads by the end of the 10th government's term. Iran has land and sea borders with 15 countries. This reveals the growing need for the development of trade and transit in the region. There are three main transportation corridors and two main plans regarding road transport at the moment. In the north we have transport connections with Russia, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. While it is also possible to access Southern Asia and the Persian Gulf states, we also have the TRASIKA transit corridor that connects Europe to the Caucasus and Central Asia. The East Transit Corridor aims at establishing relationships between the countries of Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Indian subcontinent, as well as countries in North Africa and the EU. In development we have the Land Transport Infrastructure Network and Asian Highways Development Plan. Iran is also considering a transit-oriented development plan for the east of the country with the aim of establishing a quick and affordable network between the north and south.</p><h4>What investments have been made over the past two years in order to improve the country's transportation routes?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Iran has made several investments in railways, highways, ports, and airports, which included negotiations with a number of countries such as China, Ukraine, Turkey, Malaysia, India, Germany, Italy, and Spain, among others. Several Chinese companies in the field of financial resources have invested in transportation projects, such as the China Railway Engineering Corporation's (CREC) high-speed rail projects in Tehran, Qom, and Isfahan. There have also been railway project agreements with other Chinese companies including China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export (CMEC), China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), China Machinery Industry Construction Group (SINOCONST), and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) using the EPC+F method. There are also many EU countries seeking to invest in transportation projects here, but due to political issues we are still in the preliminary phases. With the implementation of a targeted subsidies law, the transport sector has been affected by increased fuel and ticket prices, meaning transportation costs have increased. More than IRR180 trillion has been invested in the transportation sector. Due to the lack of parts and the cost of transportation projects, negotiations with several foreign parties involved in construction projects have been carried out. In the aviation sector, investments, aircraft purchases, and passenger yields have all grown, both domestically and internationally. Due to sanctions, Iran does have a problem with an aging fleet, and the inability to buy new aircraft is affecting the quality of services. The air transport sector needs more investment and it also needs to replace inefficient aircraft. Airline mergers or liquidations will enable the sector to develop the air transport industry and thus improve quality. Despite the profitability of the commercial sector, there still needs to be much investment into sea, rail, air, and other subsectors. There needs to be incentives for private sector actors to encourage more investment. The right incentives could attract investment accordingly and in this way the internal transport sector could develop. In fact Iran, with its 980 kilometers of strategic borders, is the transportation hub for 75% of the world's oil and gas reserves. Being neighbors with Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan has provided our country with an exclusive transportation position.</p><div class="quote">“Sustainable development is fundamental in economic, social, and cultural matters."</div><h4>According to the Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), Iran will extend its railway network to over 5,000 kilometers in length. What is the overall strategy behind this upgrade?</h4><p>Because of the characteristics of the railway system and its compatibility with sustainable development, rail transport is considered green transport. Considering its high level of safety, demand for this type of transportation is increasing year-by-year. The Ministry of Roads and Urban Development has set the expansion of the railway system as its major priority. When the plan is completed, 4,683 kilometers of rail line will be added to the country's railroad system, and 1,033 kilometers of it will be in use by the end of this administration. The priority will be the completion of the railway system in order to develop the railway transportation network and its connection to important borders and ports. Some of the new projects will connect Qazvin-Rasht-Anzali-Astara, Kermanshah-Khosravi, Chabahar-Zahedan-Mashhad, and Shalamcheh-Basra. The completion of these projects will bring benefits such as increased transit revenues of about $350 million, 7,300 new jobs created, lower fuel costs, and reduced pollution levels. Iran's rail network will benefit from connecting the railway systems of the Middle East and the EU, as well as Central Asia and China. The new networks will also connect to Caspian Sea countries such as Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia in the north. This new network will not only benefit Iran, but will also provide international benefits. Due to its location it will make Iran a crossroads. It will provide access for our landlocked neighbors to Iran's 3,000 kilometers of open waterways. The network will increase activity in its many ports in the north and south, which in turn will bring political stability as international trade increases. It will also provide a secure mass transit system for imports and exports. Over the coming years, the transport sector is expected to grow higher than the GDP growth rate of 8%. The transport industry is not the only sector growing; the steel industry, for example, is expected to grow 13%. Higher oil prices have led to an increase in investment, which has been behind the country's growth. As a result of this economic growth, the transport industry is expected to double in size. The government is also planning to introduce fuel price subsidies, which I expect will increase the demand for rail. Along with the networks already mentioned, the 20-year development vision regarding railway networks plans to build an express passenger railroad in order to connect major metropolitan and tourism centers. The plan also aims to connect the country's major ports as well as its mining, manufacturing, industrial, agricultural, and provincial centers. To eliminate bottlenecks in the system, we plan to use two lanes or electrify high-traffic lines. We will use the newest and most advanced technologies available for rail. By building these new routes, we will dramatically cut the travel time for passengers and goods. We have the best consultants and contractors who are qualified and competent to complete the projects. We have an international and unparalleled managerial and operational team. We plan to train rail experts in Iran and look into the possibility of training experts in other countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize your current strategy and role in Turkey's financial sector?</h4><p>We are really focusing more on the commercial, SME, and retail sectors as we want to maintain our leading position in the SME and commercial sectors. Türkiye Finans has a 1.5% market share in the commercial sector, and we would like build on this as well as maintain our strong market share in the SME sector. For that reason, we have been investing in a strategy of governance and infrastructure, which was behind the launch of our new retail products in October 2012. This is our main strategy for growth, and our main goal is to increase our market share from 1.5% to 1.8% by 2016. This means that whatever the banking sector's growth rate, Türkiye Finans has to grow 20% over that.</p><h4>Why are SMEs so important to Türkiye Finans and how do you tailor your products and services to SMEs?</h4><p>The raison d'íªtre for participation banks is to support trade and production. We finance retail businesses via a different process to commercial banks. It is not simply enough to request a sum of money. In the participation banking system one has to tie that borrowing to a commodity or service and provide us with the invoice. The banking sector mainly supports production and trade. This is the reason for our existence, and participation banks have really advanced on this front.</p><div class="quote">“In order to issue a lease you need assets, and Türkiye Finans has spent time building up its assets."</div><h4>What actions is Türkiye Finans taking to increase its share of the retail banking market?</h4><p>We are launching a new credit card-driven product. It is a pre-credited card. It is not pre-paid, but a pre-credited installment card. The card will have a limit and an expiration date. We decide on the limit, expiration date, and the repayment schedule together with our customers. Upon utilization the customers will be billed throughout the installment period and at a rate agreed upon with the customer. This way, we know the customer spends that money on an invoice. This is a new product, and we have high hopes and hopefully we will be marketing it heavily toward the end of 2012. We are going to invest into our delivery channels, especially on mobile phones. We are now designing our budget for 2013 and are trying to specialize in alternative distribution channels. We are also investing heavily in opening new branches. In 2012 we are opening 38 and over 2013 we are going to open 26 branches. Türkiye Finans is also hiring at the moment. Over 2012 we will hire around 1,000 people. Basically, we believe we have reasonable range and number of products and now it is just the case of transmitting these to our customers.</p><h4>What challenges do you think participation banks face in growing their market share in Turkey?</h4><p>In the participation banking sector, there are challenges in terms of excess liquidity management. However, with the recent regulatory reforms and the lease certificate market growing, this will be resolved. In the future, when we look back we will see that these days were the turning point for the participation banking system in terms of greater excess liquidity management and improved asset management. This will be an important era, because the lease certificate gives us the chance to gain improved returns on our overnight facilities. We can funnel our customers' money into these overnight channels.</p><h4>What factors were behind Türkiye Finans' recent decision to issue a lease certificate?</h4><p>In order to issue a lease you need assets, and Türkiye Finans has spent time building up its assets. One is leasing and the other is real estate. Since 2011, we have been working heavily on our leasing assets. Now, we have about TL250 million worth of leasing assets, up from TL55 million in 2011. Also, we had very little real estate that we could convert to lease certificates. This is why we have been waiting, and now we can continue with the lease certificate program and go forward with this mandate. Right now, we are about to obtain the authority to give this mandate to one of the brokerage houses to issue a lira-denominated lease certificate—it will be the first of its kind. There are a couple of banks in the market trying to do this. A Turkish lira lease certificate is more important for us than the one denominated in a foreign currency, and to prosper you need a long-term local currency source in order to lend. This is why the deal is very important and pioneering for the market. However, we are about to obtain a mandate to issue a foreign currency lease certificate by the end of 2012. We believe we are the optimum size needed to perform such a transaction. If everything goes well internally and externally, we expect to close one or two deals by end-2012 or early 2013.</p><h4>Will the recent issuance of Turkey's sovereign lease certificate spur similar lease certificate issuances among banks and corporates?</h4><p>Before this issuance we didn't have the infrastructure or legislation. The government believes lease certificates are very important on many fronts. Firstly, they are lent at a much cheaper rate than what our credit rating says the country should be able to. Second, there was eight times more demand for them than the amount actually issued. Another positive thing is that now we have a benchmark. Türkiye Finans can add it to its portfolio. Now, the bank will be able to offer those assets to both institutional and retail investors.</p><h4>How can Turkey ensure that its recent high growth rates remain sustainable?</h4><p>First of all, we should give credit to the government. It must carry on with what it has been doing. The budget deficit is maybe not as aggressive as a year ago, but certainly not as easy as in previous decades. Despite the election, the government is giving the signal that it will be tough on controlling the budget. However, we need to work on inflation, as that will certainly reduce interest rates. I think inflation is in the center of attention for the authorities in charge of the economy. The bottom line is that we claim Turkey should grow 5% annually. At the moment, Turkey's growth rate is 3%. In a growing economy there are different sectors growing at different paces. Take banking, for example. This sector is growing at a rate of 15%, while the economy is growing 3%. I believe we must focus on those faster-growing sectors and improve the strength of the country. The government has been paying attention and is voicing its goals and targets for the country, especially in R&amp;D. I support this initiative and believe that Turkey can easily become an R&amp;D center in the region.</p><h4>What is your vision for Türkiye Finans over the next decade?</h4><p>We are aiming to be a mid-tier bank in a few years, and are making excellent progress toward achieving that status. Türkiye Finans has strategies in five-year blocks, as they are usually environment driven. We want to be a pioneer in participation banking, not in terms of asset size, but certainly in terms of service quality and customer experience. Over the next 10 years we are certainly on track to become a second-tier bank.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Nutresa's contribution to the agriculture sector?</h4><p>Nutresa produces and distributes its products all across Colombia. We are not involved with agricultural production; however, we have many links within the agricultural sector. For example, we have an experimental farm in Santander that produces the best cocoa beans in Colombia. Our factory produces clones of these cocoa bean trees as well as performs R&amp;D. We have a program that supports agricultural producers, so we sell our cloned trees at a nominal rate to farmers and show them how to plant, care for, and harvest these trees. Afterward, we buy these products back from them. They can sell the beans on the market, but we compete for the output of those crops. Our link to the agricultural sector is by supplying advanced and adapted varieties of plants to Colombian farmers. We have Fairtrade certification for coffee, which implies that consumers pay a premium. The premium does not go to the production or distribution chains, but directly to the actual farmers. We have another program, called Bird Friendly, which ensures that the way coffee is harvested is not harmful to birds. Bird Friendly coffee is another one of many certifications we have. In meat products, we also have experimental farms where we develop purebreds through genetic farming and sell them to the farmers who then raise the pigs and sell them on the market.</p><h4>Which of Nutresa's 44 companies earns the highest revenues, and which has the most potential for growth?</h4><p>The snack division—ice cream, chocolate, biscuits, cookies, and the like—has the highest growth rate all over the world. That trend is also true in Colombia; however, processed meat is another sector that has been growing consistently for many years. As the middle class in Colombia has grown, people from the countryside have moved into urban areas and switched to eating packaged goods. These people, who used to get their meat from farmers, now want branded foods because they feel they are safer to eat. Formal consumption has grown in Colombia as purchasing power increased.</p><div class="quote">“After our home market, the next biggest is the US, which represents about 10% of our sales."</div><h4>From your 74 export destinations, which one represents the largest market?</h4><p>After our home market, the next biggest is the US, which represents about 10% of our sales. Cookies and coffee are our most popular products in the US. Our third biggest market is Central America as a bloc. As a company, we have been in Japan for many years, but we are trying to expand into the rest of Asia as well. We have identified other strong opportunities and Nutresa is expanding aggressively in Asia and Africa. The company has operations in the EU; however, they are not as significant, representing less than 1% of our sales.</p><h4>How has the 2010 acquisition of Fehr Holdings impacted operations, and what was your strategy there?</h4><p>The reaction has been very positive. Our operations have grown significantly since buying the company. Even though the US economy is growing slowly, there are always opportunities. Nutresa had been selling in the US, particularly to Hispanic consumers, for a long time and it wanted to have a more widespread presence there. Fehr Holdings with its local manufacturing plant, good brand, and excellent distribution was ideal for reaching mainstream US consumers. It was also strategic to have a manufacturing plant in the US because of its wheat production, which we used to import to Colombia for our cookies that we would sell to the US anyway.</p><h4>How will the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, and in the near future with South Korea, impact operations?</h4><p>There is always both a threat and an opportunity with FTAs, but this is a positive move. The benefits will be greater than the threat. Nutresa has supported the different governments throughout the negotiations. The US FTA will have biggest potential impact, and it is already producing very positive results. It will enable Colombian companies to be more competitive in international terms since they can source from international suppliers. There will also be competition from the outside coming in; however, this will be a good thing since the competition will remain healthy. The worst thing that can happen is for a company to feel too comfortable or dependent on protection and not be competitive. The threat of competition is healthy and we should be open to that.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coffee and chocolate sectors?</h4><p>The consumption of coffee in Colombia has only grown at 2% or 3% in volume terms. The problem is that the Colombian crop has decreased in size. We have entered a deficit regarding local coffee producers and we are forced to import coffee from other countries. The Peruvian bean is the closest to Colombian tastes, so we import most of our coffee from Peru. It is a high-quality Arabica coffee, very similar to Colombian. In a blend, it keeps the same profile as Colombian coffee. Even other Colombian producers are importing from different countries. This is disappointing because Colombia used to produce nearly 13 million bags, and now we are down to 7 million. There are many commitments to export coffee, and this has created a shortfall from the producers. This was caused by the weather and a program launched by the coffee federation trying to reorganize the crops. It wanted producers to cut down old crops and plant new ones, but it was during a rainy season caused by La Niña, as well as at a time when oil prices were high; this was related to the increase in the cost of fertilizers and therefore the reduction in the fertilization of trees and the consequent reduction in output. Those effects combined halved the production of Colombian coffee. Cocoa prices were high in 2010 and 2011 because of political problems in Cí´te d'Ivoire, which produces more than half of the world's cocoa. Its ports were closed following the election controversy and cocoa prices increased dramatically. However, this was solved and there was not a big impact on the consumer; chocolate consumption is still growing worldwide.</p><h4>What is the potential for investment in Colombia, particularly in Antioquia?</h4><p>Antioquia, especially Medellí­n, is attracting foreign investment in multiple sectors because of good local management and excellent labor. There are white- and blue-collar workers who are hardworking and well educated. There are also great universities and a good quality of life. All of these aspects are attracting large amounts of foreign investment.</p><h4>How much does Nutresa plan to invest in R&amp;D in 2012, and what innovations are going to be launched in the short term?</h4><p>Innovation is a high priority for us, and the company has been working on creating an innovative culture amongst its employees. We have our own innovation model, “Imagix," which is how we stimulate innovation and develop products. We have 200 employees working in our R&amp;D centers and another 200 innovation sponsors who facilitate research processes throughout the company. We invest approximately 0.8% of our total sales in R&amp;D and in 2013 we hope to invest closer to 1%. Nutresa hopes to have over $3 billion in sales in 2013, an increase from nearly $2.8 billion in 2011. It depends on the exchange rate, but 2012 should produce roughly $3 billion in sales.</p><h4>How do you see Nutresa evolving over the next decade?</h4><p>If I look 10 years in the past, Nutresa was much more domestic and had a small footprint in other countries. In the last decade we have expanded a lot, and I expect we will continue to expand in other parts of the world over the next decade as well. Our international sales are close to 30% of our total sales at the moment, and we hope to increase this number to around 50%. We are also committed to sustainable development. Nutresa is one of the nine food producers in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and its vision includes geographic expansion with a balance between the social and environmental dimensions. We will be a global company, but a sustainable one, and hopefully one with a carbon-neutral footprint.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given speculation concerning the oversupply of natural gas and LNG, is East Africa at risk of missing the LNG boom if Mozambique's gas doesn't come on stream by 2018?</h4><p>The natural gas discoveries in the Rovuma Basin represent a tremendous opportunity for Mozambique and our partnership. It is extraordinarily rare to find resources of this scale in today's world. We believe there is an optimal window for securing terms that will meet the requirements of the LNG project, the Mozambican government, and the joint venture. Estimates for supply and demand vary widely, so it is important for us to control what we can and ensure we develop the resources as safely and cost effectively as possible, keeping in mind that a significant factor will be the cost of Mozambican gas compared to other competing projects around the world. One tremendous benefit in Mozambique is the world-class scale of these resources. From the upstream development perspective, we anticipate that we will be very competitive and be able to offer a premium product at a premium price. These are excellent reservoirs with exceptional flow rates. We have tested wells at rates of 100 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day, and believe the wells are capable of producing 200 MMcf per day. These are very high productivity wells, so the amount of drilling we need to do to be able to feed an initial 10 million ton per annum development is relatively low. Another benefit to Mozambique is that our targeted markets are seeking new supply sources and Mozambique offers a huge resource base that can supply them for the next 40-60 years with competitively priced LNG. We are moving forward in cooperation with the government. The technical side of the project is well advanced, and we are making progress on the other fronts as well.</p><h4>What is the potential to diversify production so that LNG could supply both hinterland countries and the domestic market?</h4><p>Our current plan is to sell our gas as LNG directly to the international market, which brings the most value to all stakeholders. The fact that the fields are offshore in deep water means that their development will require significant investment, although the quality of the resources and our ability to drive efficiencies in our business will help minimize costs. Currently, there's no domestic market in Mozambique, so we are focusing on LNG exports and the revenues that exports can create for the government. The government is reviewing its options through the development of a gas master plan, and there may be some opportunities in the future for greater domestic use. Additionally, the government will have a significant volume that it may choose to commit for domestic use through royalties and equity in the projects.</p><h4>How would you characterize the appetite for long-term LNG buyers in Asian markets?</h4><p>The interest appears to be very high in Asian markets; they see this as a potential new long-term supply of cleaner energy. This enormous volume of gas along with a multi-train LNG project could provide a long-term, competitively priced supply of gas to these markets for many years to come. The natural gas resources are in place to elevate Mozambique to the third-largest LNG exporter in the world, behind Qatar and Australia.</p><div class="quote">“Responsible development of the natural gas resources in the Rovuma Basin represents a transformational opportunity for Mozambique and its people."</div><h4>What is the potential for a significant oil discovery?</h4><p>Though we anticipate the majority of our exploration activities will continue to find primarily natural gas, the geologic conditions toward the southern end of our acreage in Offshore Area 1 may have the best chance of containing some liquids. We are excited to continue pursuing additional opportunities through an active exploration program.</p><h4>What are your crucial milestones before a further investment decision is taken in 2013?</h4><p>From an offshore perspective, we need to get certified reserves for the initial two trains—we are on target to do that in early 2013, so from the lenders' and buyers' perspectives, we will have certification that we have the natural gas they seek. Environmentally, we recently completed a comprehensive draft Environmental Impact Assessment, which basically lays out our plans for developing the resources with a minimal impact on the environment. The land for the liquefaction facilities has been selected, and we are working on other aspects that go along with that for financing. We're engaging with the government on the necessary contractual and legal arrangements required for an LNG project of such magnitude. We are also engaged in actively marketing the LNG to potential buyers and customers.</p><h4>Are you still on track to have committed $3 billion worth of investment by the end of 2013?</h4><p>By the end of 2012, we expect to have invested about $2.2 billion in the project. By the end of 2013, we'll likely be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion investment in the project, which is significant for Mozambique. For the LNG plant, including the liquefaction facilities, upstream development, and transportation, we expect to invest about $15 billion to complete the initial two trains.</p><h4>How is capital being raised for these projects?</h4><p>We are working closely with our project financial advisors. We are contacting major potential lenders to understand their interest in our project and have found significant interest and support from East Asia, the US, and Europe to invest in Mozambique.</p><h4>Will Anadarko partner with Eni to build the plant?</h4><p>Since the Prosperidade complex straddles the block lines between our block and Area 4, unitization is called for under the Petroleum Law in Mozambique. Though no agreement is currently in place, we have discussions ongoing with the government and Eni relating to both the offshore and onshore development. We have a long-established and good working relationship with Eni, having had operations with it in many other places around the world.</p><h4>What impact will the new Petroleum Law have on exploration and production?</h4><p>It's still in draft form, and we are working with other industry players and INP to ensure that legal, fiscal and contractual stability are incorporated to encourage investment.</p><h4>Does it worry you when Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz and Former Prime Minister Luisa Diogo call for the renegotiation of concessionary contracts?</h4><p>Responsible development of the natural gas resources in the Rovuma Basin represents a transformational opportunity for Mozambique and its people. It is essential for the future of any project and foreign investments that host governments adhere to contracts and maintain fiscal stability. Our contract is a tax royalty contract, which we view as a fair contractual arrangement for the government and the partners. Under the terms, the government receives royalty gas and significant tax revenue as we are subject to the 32% corporate tax rate just like everyone else. The government also receives a large volume of profit gas that can be exported as LNG or used for domestic purposes if it chooses. Once the first project is completed under a stable legal and contractual framework, we believe the buyers will recognize Mozambique as a preferred supplier for years to come, and that can create wealth for the country.</p><h4>What is Anadarko doing with regards to investing in education such as developing courses at Eduardo Mondlane University (UEM)?</h4><p>One of the pillars of our social-investment strategy in Mozambique is education and training. Anadarko is working with the University of Eduardo Mondlane (UEM) to develop a petroleum engineering curriculum here in Maputo. It's linked with several universities in the US, including Texas A&amp;M and the University of Oklahoma. It's progressing well and we are excited by the prospects that Mozambique will train its own professionals rather than send them to the US, Europe, or elsewhere. The industry and country as a whole will see benefits from that program for years to come. We have assessed the capabilities in Maputo and what is needed, both on the equipment side and on the curriculum side. We'll start putting that together and implement this plan in 2013.</p><h4>What level of employment is Anadarko providing for Mozambicans?</h4><p>Currently, we employ well over 1,000 Mozambicans, either directly or indirectly. We have an onshore and offshore block. The onshore block is more labor intensive, and there are several hundred people currently employed in the project. We are looking at vocational training, which is a big focus for the government. It's important to recognize that while you may have 10,000 people on-site during construction, it takes far fewer to efficiently run an LNG plant. Over time, as a trained workforce is developed, it is our expectation that more and more of these positions will be filled by Mozambicans. The vast majority of job creation generally occurs through indirect or induced employment opportunities. As part of our LNG project management, we will work to ensure that our contractor will establish training programs to provide basic skill sets and will look to employ as many Mozambicans as possible during construction and production. We are also actively recruiting a number of Mozambican engineers and technicians that we can take to the US for two or three years to work in facilities for on-the-job training in offshore environments and gas plants—the idea being that they will come back and ultimately end up as supervisors. We have very qualified Mozambicans working in our offices in Maputo and Pemba. The challenge is there are not enough, and the competition is very intense.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Empresas Públicas de Medellí­n (EPM) evolved since its establishment in 1955?</h4><p>It evolved from a small company in 1955 with 50 MW of installed generation capacity to a large corporation with 3,600 MW. We grew from just a few thousand clients in 1955 to more than 6 million today. In 2013, the company expects to transfer more than $500 million in dividends to the Municipality of Medellí­n. Compare that to 1970, when the transfer of dividends was less than $5 million. This illustrates the company's impressive growth in its 55 years of history.</p><h4>What have been the company's milestones since you were appointed president on January 1, 2012?</h4><p>Most important was the successful awarding of EPM's largest contract in history. It was a $1 billion contract for the construction of the civil works of the Hidroituango project, which will be the largest hydro facility in the history of Colombia. With 2,400 MW, it is equivalent to the installed capacity that EPM developed in the first 45 years of its history.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia is full of opportunities, especially in hydroelectric projects."</div><h4>How will the Hidroituango project impact the local energy sector and when will it be completed?</h4><p>We will start operations of the first four units in 2018 (1,200 MW). The remaining four units (1,200 MW) will start operations in 2022. Hidroituango will generate close to 17% of the total electricity available in Colombia.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's energy sector, and what is the potential for investment in this sector?</h4><p>Colombia is full of opportunities, especially in hydroelectric projects. We are bullish regarding the future interconnection of Colombia with Panama and Central America. It is taking longer than expected, but we are confident that in the future the interconnection will become a reality.</p><h4>What about the potential for renewable energy?</h4><p>We are starting with wind farms, and EPM has a small 19-MW pilot project in La Guajira. We are interested in expanding EPM's involvement in renewables. We are looking for more wind farm opportunities in other Latin American countries where the regulatory framework is attractive for renewables. We have also been planning pilot projects with solar panels in rural areas of Colombia, where it is becoming economically inefficient to continue deploying the distribution infrastructure. Solar panels may become the best alternative sources of power for those in remote or rural areas.</p><h4>Does the government offer incentives for renewables?</h4><p>Not yet, but hopefully in the future it will increase the promotion of renewables. We are carrying out a variety of hydro projects in Colombia, making use of clean technology.</p><h4>What are your plans for Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and Peru? When will you enter the Mexican market?</h4><p>We are close to announcing our entrance into the Mexican market. Our goal is to enter before the end of 2012. Mexico is full of opportunities, and we have a goal to become a relevant multinational company in the near future. For this to happen, we have to be in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and Peru. We can't talk about the specifics of the plan until the deals are closed, but we do plan to enter Mexico and Chile soon.</p><h4>EPM controls 25% of the energy business in terms of distribution and generation. How would you assess the level of regulation in the sector?</h4><p>I think the regulations are appropriate. There is a solid framework for investment, with strong institutions in the energy sector in Colombia, and we feel that the rights of investors are well protected. However, the regulators do not allow us to increase our 25% share, and we are pushing for that limit to be changed because we feel that it is inappropriate. Growing organically, we still have the room to purchase a small distribution company in Colombia.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the gas sector and EPM's plan to have 10 gas stations in the country by the end of 2012?</h4><p>I strongly believe in the gas sector as part of the company's commitment to environmental responsibility. We want to be the leaders of environmental responsibility in Colombia. We have a plan to strengthen natural gas as an alternative for sustainable transportation. We believe that natural gas is the best, cleanest fuel available. EPM has an advantage in Medellí­n, which is the only city in Colombia where the mass transportation articulated bus system is fueled by natural gas. This is a good start. At EPM we have a large fleet of vehicles that we plan to convert to natural gas as well. At the moment, about 40% of our fleet runs on natural gas, so we plan to lead by example. Medellí­n will be a precursor for natural gas, and I'm sure that we will be leaders in that regard. Our proprietary network of gas stations will help many corporate clients and people to feel comfortable converting their vehicles.</p><h4>How has EPM contributed to developing the economic and social wellbeing of the region?</h4><p>We consider ourselves leaders in the region regarding economic, social, and environmental responsibility. We are not only generating employment in the region, but we are also developing major infrastructure projects that have a direct impact on the competitiveness of Colombia. EPM's total investment in Ituango will exceed $6 billion, creating close to 27,000 direct and indirect jobs. We are not only leaders in hydro generation, which is highly competitive, but also in energy distribution, water distribution, and waste water treatment as well. We cover Colombia from coast to coast—from our border with Venezuela to the Pacific coast—providing essential services that are making Colombia a more competitive country. Millions of Colombians and Central Americans have a better quality of life thanks to the services we are providing every day.</p><h4>You have a budget for the investment of $1 billion in acquisitions per year. What are your short-term projects?</h4><p>We are already in Guatemala, Panama, and El Salvador, but we would like to increase our presence in Central America. We are participating in the distribution business with the goal to add generation assets in those countries. We are looking for opportunities in distribution and generation, as well as opportunities in the water business. We have the largest electricity distribution company in Guatemala with more than 1 million clients. EPM also holds that title in Panama with about 360,000 clients. In El Salvador, we are the second largest provider, with close to 330,000 clients.</p><h4>EPM has suffered losses from not being able to distribute all of the energy it generates because of terrorist attacks. Can you asses the security landscape?</h4><p>We are confident in the peace process led by President Santos. However, Colombia's transmission infrastructure network has faced isolated terrorist attacks in the past. When those sporadic attacks have arisen, we have lost revenues associated with restrictions to export electricity from Antioquia to the Atlantic coast of Colombia. We feel that the government and the army are fully committed to protecting the electric infrastructure of Colombia and they are putting their lives on the line for this. We are bullish and believe the current process will improve the situation.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the energy sector in Colombia and the future of EPM?</h4><p>We are seeing a myriad of opportunities. There is huge hydro potential that still needs to be fully developed. The mining, oil, and gas sectors have huge potential and will be responsible for a large part of the growth in electricity demand in Colombia. We will also benefit from upcoming integration strategies with Panama and Central America. More importantly, in 10 years, there is a high probability that Colombia will finally be living in peace. Once the security problems are resolved, it will be easier to deploy the infrastructure that Colombia needs to continue growing and attracting more international investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Contecon obtained a concession for the Port of Guayaquil in 2007. Why did your parent company decide to invest?</h4><p>Contecon Guayaquil is a subsidiary of International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI), which handles port operations around the world. The company began operations in 2007, when the bidding for the lease of Guayaquil took place. ICTSI decided to invest in Guayaquil because the group follows a growth policy for its global operations. In the Americas, there are many opportunities to expand business thanks to the performance of economies like that of Ecuador. In 2011 its economic growth rate was 8%, and this year it is predicted to be around 6%. The opportunity to improve the economy, carry out projects, and design new plants and facilities comes with the need to attend to cargo and maintain good port infrastructure. Contecon's mission is to be ready for increasing demand and to accompany Ecuador on its growth path.</p><h4>Does Ecuador have a promising economy in terms of trade volumes and growth?</h4><p>The government is handling the economy in a way that opens up new opportunities for the country. To complement an increasing number of imports, the proper equipment needs to be brought in for production purposes; heavy machinery and raw materials for the construction of new infrastructure such as hydroelectric power plants and oil refineries, among other projects, are required. This is also the case for the private sector. As the economy grows, new business opportunities appear on the horizon for the entire country. Moreover, there is increasing participation from Ecuador in terms of exported goods and international trade. Economic growth has long supported the importance of port operations, and our mission is to grow side by side with the country and seize these opportunities.</p><div class="quote">“The government is handling the economy in a way that opens up new opportunities for the country."</div><h4>How has Guayaquil's main port changed since Contecon won the concession?</h4><p>When Contecon was awarded with the concession for the Port of Guayaquil, we received a 50-year-old terminal, which in many ways did not meet contemporary international demands. Since we took over, we have had to invest over $250 million to expand the port's capacity and be able to handle new cargo and projects. Therefore, we were eager to invest in new infrastructure and more advanced equipment. We have also been investing in technology, security, training, and environmental issues.</p><h4>What are Guayaquil's advantages over the ports of Manta and Bolí­var?</h4><p>The Port of Guayaquil is close to the commercial, industrial, agricultural, and economic production areas. It is also located toward the center of the country and can handle cargo from other main cities that view Guayaquil as the most convenient place to receive and dispatch cargo to and from international destinations.</p><h4>The port is about to invest $70 million to increase its capacity. How has Contecon financed this expansion?</h4><p>Contecon Guayaquil SA is expanding its infrastructure and handling capacity by almost by 50%, which includes the reinforcement of berths, yards, and new handling equipment. Contecon saw an opportunity to finance and participate in its growth via the issuance of debt in the national stock market, in which the main investors were public finance institutions, private banks, private funds, and particular individual investors. In two months, 100% of the securitization was placed on the market. This also reflects the confidence that the local investors have in Contecon's ability to manage its activities.</p><h4>Why did the company choose to expand the port over the coming year?</h4><p>The reason behind the expansion of the port was primarily because of the growth in Ecuador's economy. This made us accelerate the investment plan forward by a year in order to accommodate cargo volumes. Our mission is to accompany and go along with the country's growth, and that meant pushing investments forward.</p><h4>Is the port of Guayaquil a reference for any specific sector or market?</h4><p>As port operators, we are focused mainly on containers, bulk, and project cargo. We have the infrastructure to attend to these segments. Ecuador has been moving toward the refrigerated cargo business, and I believe that Contecon has an interesting capacity to handle reefer (refrigerated) containers of this type. By the end of 2012 we will have a supply of over 3,500 electric sockets and plugs for reefer containers. These containers will carry a variety of goods, including bananas, fish, fruit, shrimp, vegetables, and flowers.</p><h4>What are the challenges for this year of expansion?</h4><p>We will continue to operate as efficiently as possible and search for alternative investments when and where possible. Contecon Guayaquil SA will also continue evaluating how the country needs high-quality port services and infrastructure. We are aiming to engage in discussions with the government regarding the dredging of the port's access channel. It is a very interesting project that will require heavy investment, but offer the country alternatives to service larger vessels. The Port of Guayaquil is always reinventing itself to meet growing incremental needs.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-combined-passion]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have had a long and successful career in a number of industries. How did you end up in the aviation business?</h4><p>It all started in 1954 when I was a law student. Around that time I fell in love with aviation—it was the new way to see the world. Since then I developed a deep interest and a combined passion for tourism and aviation. However, I was too young then to embark on such a task on my own. Also, I had to bear in mind that due to the importance of my father as a former President of Mexico, people would assume that my success was due to his strong political and economic position, and not due to my personal and professional interest. So, instead, I started a successful career in journalism. I started a magazine in partnership with a few friends that was quite successful. I eventually had to sell it. A few years later I made the transition from written journalism into television newscasts, and bought myself some stock in a newly created company. We developed a national network of TV channels and incorporated the firm Telesistema Mexicano. In less than 12 years Telesistema Mexicano became a large communications corporation that integrated TV, radio, magazines, and printed press. We covered a wide array of activities: news, musicals, sports, and entertainment for children. We also developed a strong competitive edge in soap operas. In a short span of time technology evolved fast, and we knew that investment was necessary to grow and keep up with the times and adapt to the arrival of videotape, microwaves, and satellite telecoms and the like. Also, the structure of the company evolved into Televisa as we know it today. Then, after many years of successful evolution my partner became seriously ill and died. As a precautionary move we decided that is was time to leave the company in the hands of the younger generation. It was a changing world in many ways, and new technologies changed the structure of our market, as well as some regulations. Also, my father had already passed away and I was invited into politics and took up the offer. I was in pubic office for 12 years (1992-2004). First, I was elected Senator and later Governor of my home state of Veracruz. After that, I finally went into the area I had always loved: aviation. I saw the growth of airmail and thought, why should a piece of paper have more rights to travel abroad than a human being? Why should a postcard or a letter or anything with a stamp and the label “airmail" be able to go from anywhere to China and back without problems while a passenger on a commercial flight is limited by passports, visas, vaccines, and other requirements? It was a crazy world and someday, I said, I want to be able to fly anywhere around the globe directly. The transition form turboprop to jet engine was the most significant innovation of our times. Many groups that used to build airplanes for civil aviation chose to build warplanes, so they left the projects we had. We therefore decided to establish an aircraft maintenance center in Mexico. Military planes from countries such as France, Chile, or Argentina usually flew to San Antonio Texas for repairs, so we decided to establish a similar plant in Mexico. There was an airline there called Aeronaves de Mexico, which merged with ours and began domestic and international operations, later becoming known as Aeroméxico. Additionally, another airline, Compañia Mexicana de Aviación, grew and began to develop other airline firms across Latin America and suffered from an over extension that led to its collapse. The most important lesson of an airline is that you need to stick to flying if that is your business. Restaurants should not be your business. If you want to serve food on board, a concession is the best way to go. You also must be careful not to buy too many planes if you don't have a solid position in your market. Around that time I had job offers from a few airlines, including Aero California and Azteca, but they were on the verge of going broke. I wanted to do something new that really had a future. There were no local airlines in Mexico with jet engines and wide-bodied airplanes, so I began to study airlines all over the world from Europe to the US. They were all completely different. Some airlines were crowded, had old planes, bad maintenance, served poor quality food if any, and treated people badly. Those kind of flights are cheap, yet my idea was to offer high quality at a low price. I wanted the best airplanes with the best service and the best pilots. Starting up any business has many challenges and a new airline is an even more difficult process. We began to examine costs, including each airport's individual taxes. If a new airline begins operations at an airport with eight or nine flights, you pay expenses on all of them. These costs are higher if the airport is new or underserved, as the costs then increase. Additional costs are not usually included in the ticket price, but I wanted everything to be included and clear. I told my colleagues I was going to avoid intermediaries and allow the customers greater flexibility to go online by themselves buy a ticket, and then change the ticket according to their needs at no further expense if necessary. This strategy began to work and all of a sudden we were doing well. The market discovered us and we discovered a new segment of the market that was not into air travel before. We later added a customer loyalty program for miles travelled based on a cash back bonus rather than the traditional model, as we realized that was more appealing to customers. Also, we provided a separate toilet for ladies in the cabin, which has been very successful. Our planes are spacious and provide plenty of legroom. If the passenger in front of you reclines, then you do not get disturbed.</p><h4>What has been the strategy behind providing a quality product while adopting a low-cost, low-fare business model?</h4><p>First, we bought new planes to lessen maintenance costs. However, we developed our own maintenance center in Toluca City, which can service a wide variety of planes from Boeings to small warplanes, too. We are now working to team up with Lufthansa as a partner in this maintenance hub. I admire Lufthansa in the way it maintains its aircraft and I think this venture would be very interesting for us. The business is doing well, and today we are servicing planes from Argentina, the US, and some Central American countries. We are happy with our progress as the business has grown as large as the airline itself. It is a good fit, and it saves us money in the long run. We have also recently selected a new sort of airplane for short distance flight—the Sukhoi Superjet-100. It is a combination of European technologies that is originally a Russian airplane with a wide body it's a capacity for 100 passengers. Its engines are made in France and the US, and all its technical and navigation instruments are from the US and Europe. The interior decoration was designed by Pininfarina in Italy. The performance is fantastic. Its engines consume nearly 15% less fuel and it lowers carbon emissions into the atmosphere by 80%, which is very good news. It creates less noise and can fly into any airport. We are going to use it for short flights from Mexico City to Querétaro, Acapulco, Puebla, and other nearby routes.</p><div class="quote">“In less than five years we could make Interjet one of the best airlines in Mexico."</div><h4>How do you intend to expand on the successful introduction of international routes at the end of 2012?</h4><p>After making comparisons of several routes, we decided to fly to Orange County in the US. Besides local demand, it is only 40 minutes from Los Angeles. It is also 50 minutes to Disneyland and five minutes to Costa Mesa, which has the largest mall in the US and is a place where Mexicans and passengers from other Latin American countries love to shop. I think we will have a good reception there. Our Las Vegas route is popular at the weekend for many people from Mexico. We also run flights to Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. We are not going to go to Europe for a couple of years, but Canada is in our plans.</p><h4>The year 2011 was described as a break out year for Interjet. What characterized the success?</h4><p>We have to be very careful with timing, and it requires vision to know when to make the right moves. That is why we chose that year to really expand our frontiers and go international. That was before Mexicana had serious problems and collapsed into a legal labor and financial impasse. However, in support of the needs of our local market and with the authorization of our civil aviation authorities, we have been serving passengers on some of its routes. At some point Mexicana will have to be handed back to private investors to attempt once again to make a successful comeback, but it will take some time recover customer confidence and fly as many passengers as we do. That is why we are trying to consolidate our position in the local market as much as possible. I do not worry about being the biggest. For us, quality is far more important. This has always been the core goal of our strategy.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Interjet? Where would you like to see the company in five years?</h4><p>It has been a hard job to start up. In less than five years we could make Interjet one of the best airlines in Mexico. First, we have to make it a reality in our own country before can compete with others internationally. The main problem has been communications in Mexico because the topography of the country is very complex. Nevertheless, it can be done. Italy succeeded in building tunnels and bridges, and something similar needs to be done here, too. Air travel is free of most security concerns, and the country now needs more airports and much better road and transport infrastructure and services. Through airports you can get where you are going faster and more safely. This is one way aviation has proven to assist in the development of the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of Iranol Oil Company in the past two years?</h4><p>Considering our vision, mission, strategies, and values, Iranol Oil Company has become a leading company in producing base oils, engine oils, and industrial and automotive lubricants. We have two refineries. Tehran refinery has an annual capacity of 250,000 tons of various grades of base oils, and the other is Abadan refinery with the annual capacity of 50,000 tons. Considering furfural extract (RPO) and other side products used in finished heavy oil products, this brings our total yearly production to over 600,000 tons per year for both domestic and overseas consumption. This equals total sales of almost $650 million per year. Our total exports equal $250 million. We produce the highest quality oil for gasoline and diesel engines, as well as industrial oil including, hydraulic oil, compressor oil, gear oil, circulating oil, transformers, and many other industrial lubricants. In total, we offer over 180 types of different products. Some of our latest high-quality diesel and gasoline oils are Iranol Power, Iranol Top Engine, Iranol D-40000, Iranol D17000, Iranol Ronia, Iranol Royal, and Iranol Hyper. There are many others that have been approved for use in engines manufactured by Man, Volvo, and Renault, for example. We are considered one of the leading lubricant companies in Iran in terms of our R&amp;D, customer service, sales, and revenue. That's because we anticipate a bigger share of the domestic market and continue satisfying our major internal clients with quality products and outstanding service.</p><h4>How will your market share evolve?</h4><p>Our philosophy is to provide good quality products that must come at an affordable price. Therefore, our strategy is based on the best quality production for the best comparable price. That's what we're doing to increase our market share considerably. We don't produce additives, but we generally import them according to our needs. We use about 50 different types of additives, especially for industrial lubricants such as turbines and compressors. Importing additives may be costly sometimes, but it's never been a serious problem. A high-quality additive makes for better final products. We're working to import those additives to keep us competitive. Our strong R&amp;D department and laboratories with 15 highly educated experts are developing new products. We have a quality control department, to make sure everything is checked and controlled for the best quality production. Our sales department with its highly quality staff can offer the best to our esteemed customers.</p><div class="quote">“Our philosophy is to provide good quality products that must come at an affordable price. "</div><h4>How many employees do you have in total?</h4><p>We have over 520 employees at our refinery in Tehran, and 200 in Abadan. Our central office in Teheran also has around 85 people. In total we have around 850 employees that are highly trained and skilled.</p><h4>What is your best-selling product internationally, and which countries do you trade with the most?</h4><p>We export base oils and recently started to export rubber process oil. Of the base oils, we export around 250,000 tons a year. We export 60,000 to 70,000 tons from Abadan, and we also export the heavy base oils SN-500 and SN-650 from Tehran. This is all base oil and sometimes we have excess. In 2012, we've started exporting furfural extracts, a new project for which we have a license. We mainly export to South Asia and especially India, as well as the UAE and China.</p><h4>Do you export raw materials or processed oils?</h4><p>In the past we haven't been active in exporting finished products, but we have carried out an extensive marketing campaign for exporting finished products. We do export finished products to some of our neighboring countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, as well as other CIS countries. We also are testing a handful of markets in Africa and South America.</p><h4>What other projects are you currently working on?</h4><p>In addition to our research on new products, we have an R&amp;D committee for special products. So far, its members have developed an extract for rubber processing firms and a side product that is environmentally friendly and enjoys 50,000 tons consumption annually.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the Colombian banking sector?</h4><p>It is a solid, competitive system and it is increasing its presence in the region. Until recently, the Colombian system has been mainly a national system. More than 70% of the sector as a whole belonged to local banks. However, in the last five years, different institutions have been entering other regions and they are now behaving as international players. The system is doing a good job dealing with the different challenges of the country in general. The economic growth that we are experiencing is a great challenge for the whole system. It is twice as big as it was five years ago. The main challenge, and maybe the main opportunity of the banking sector, is related to the fact that 40% of the population does not have any access to the system. The bancarization level of Colombia is very low, both in credit, transaction services, and insurance, which are provided by different types of non-banking personnel institutions. Government banks are seeing this as the main challenge.</p><h4>What is Davivienda doing to bank the unbanked, and what has been your growth strategy over the past couple of years?</h4><p>This institution began as a savings and loan company in 1972, and a universal bank in 1997. It is really a young bank for the Colombian environment. Even though some banks have been here for over 100 years, we have been able to become the third largest bank in the country. We are not solely a savings and loan company anymore, but also a universal bank with a presence in Panama, the US, and Central America. We have more than 4.5 million customers in the country. Our specialization in mainly low-income mortgages allows us to be closer to the base of the pyramid. We have won a bid to participate in the dispersion of subsidies that the central government will give to close to 2.5 million families on a monthly basis. With this initiative, we could gain another 1 million customers who might be willing to make payments not just via ATMs or Davivienda branches, but also in more than 700 different cities and towns nationwide. Davivienda charges the government when it disperses money and charges companies when they pay wages, but the people who receive the money and want to use it do not get charged. The company is also working on offering people different kinds of micro insurance, micro savings, and maybe in the future micro credits.</p><div class="quote">“We are optimistic and committed to Colombia as well as to the other countries in which we are active."</div><h4>What has been Davivienda's most important achievement in recent years?</h4><p>The most important thing that we have done so far is the launch of a platform called DaviPlata in February 2011, which is an electronic wallet. We want to have an instrument that allows any Colombian, customer or not, to be able to have access to the different services that banks provide. We have more that 600,000 new customers, and more than 300,000 of them were people that did not have any kind of relationship with a bank. This wallet allows them to manage their cash through their mobile phones, to make bill payments to other electronic wallets or different bank accounts, and to buy pre-paid mobile phone time. The main feature that characterizes this innovation is that customers are allowed to withdraw money from any Davivienda ATM without a card. Now any Colombian, with only their mobile phone, can have an electronic wallet. Likewise, you can add money to the electronic wallet from a Davivienda account or by making a deposit in a branch.</p><h4>Davivienda plans to double the profitability of its recent acquisition of HSBC in Central America in two years. How are you planning to achieve this and what was the strategy behind this acquisition?</h4><p>We have two different strategies. Those HSBC banks are charged by their headquarters and have expenses related to supervision and different services provided by their headquarters. We will support those operations, but without the charges. Davivienda expects growth of almost 10% in 2013. In three years we expect to be able to have maybe a 12% return on equity (ROE) for our operations in Central America.</p><h4>How important are the operations in Miami for Davivienda internationally?</h4><p>The Miami operation is very important for the Colombian market, both for individual and corporate business. Many different businesses require support from the operations we have in Miami. In the same sense, many different individuals like to have the products that we offer there, not only in banking, but the investment products we intend to offer as well. We are also trying to increase the value-added services we offer in Miami. We expect the Miami branch will be very important for the whole market in Central America. It's very important for us to have that point of service in Miami to offer to our high-income customers in Colombia. We have to complement this service in Miami with the service we offer in Panama. Both of these bases are very important to be able to compete properly for both corporate and individual business.</p><h4>What is Davivienda's position in the Colombian market?</h4><p>In personal and individual banking, we are probably the largest player. We are first in mortgages and first in the business of loans and credit cards. We are third in automobile loans and we have about an 18% market share in consumer loans. We are third in commercial banking and Davivienda is the top private bank in agricultural banking. Our operations are quite small when it comes to SMEs, but we do see an opportunity in that segment because we have a relationship with more than 65,000 different companies in the country. We have about 6% of the market and we expect to be closer to 12% soon.</p><h4>How important is Davivienda's presence in the capital markets?</h4><p>Davivienda entered the capital markets over a year and half a year ago; we made our first issue in 2010. It was the biggest success of any company in Colombia. Later in the year we were again very successful, a return of $350 million allowed us to gain about 23% of the capital in the institution of the Colombian market. We are working hard to enter the international market, possibly New York in 2014. In 2012 we issued bonds and placed them very successfully for $500 million over 10 years. Our presence in the capital markets is very important for the bank. The company has been working very hard to become known by different local and international investors. We foresee the bank growing in Colombia, and having access to the capital markets seems feasible in the long term.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the bank's performance in 2011 and what do you expect for 2012?</h4><p>Over 2012, the bank is expect to grow approximately 10%, which is a bit lower than the sector. This is likely related to our decision to decelerate the growth in consumer loans after foreseeing problems in certain sectors of the economy. The bank expects its income to grow above 20%, so it is important to improve efficiency. The results are going to be very interesting for 2012, both in terms of the composition of our portfolio as well as the income of the bank. We have good margin management and we are working to improve our efficiency. Davivienda has many opportunities to improve efficiency because Colombian banks are not very efficient generally. There is a lot of work to do, but we are on the right track.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Colombian economy and the financial sector over the next five to 10 years?</h4><p>There is a good chance we will see an average growth rate of 4%-5% for the next five years. However, if Colombia is to attain this growth then it must maintain the different improvements that have been achieved so far in security and in social efforts. The country must also increase its efforts to improve education, health, and technology. This country has many opportunities and many natural resources, and geographically it is located in an excellent position. The Colombian people are very skilled and hardworking, and we believe we can take advantage of these factors. The government has done well over the last 30 years, and the economic policies have been generally well managed. The fundamentals of the economy are strong and the management has been very wise. We are optimistic and committed to Colombia as well as to the other countries in which we are active. We foresee a very good future for the country and we are investing in Colombia.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Shipping companies have recently expressed some concerns regarding the trading deficit that the Dominican Republic suffers. What is your view of the current situation?</h4><p>Any economy that is facing such a thing is probably faced with inflation. This could benefit exports, but on the other hand negatively affect the volume of imports. Obviously, in the shipping business and the air freight business, volume is always an important factor for the success of our services and the infrastructure that has been created in the port and airport terminals.</p><h4>How was Maritima Dominicana's performance last year?</h4><p>In our specific case, we celebrated our 40th anniversary in 2011, and for the first time in the history of the company we were able to attend to more than 2,000 ship calls at Dominican ports. We were the first shipping company in the Dominican Republic that was ISO 9001 certified. Over the last few years Maritima Dominicana was also awarded the ISO 14001 certificate for the protection of the environment and gained OHSAS 18001 certification for the protection and security of all employees, and this is one of the requirements of global companies.</p><h4>How has the country evolved to face its challenges and improve its competitiveness over recent years?</h4><p>The private sector shipping business has made some very important investments over the last 10 years, including Haina International Terminals (HIT) and the terminal at Caucedo, which is being managed by DP World, but is 50% owned by local investors, including Maritima Dominicana. One of the worries that the sector has had over the years is bureaucracy, especially in the areas of customs and security services. In the case of customs, fortunately, the Dominican Republic has initiated an entirely different system to perform customs clearance electronically.</p><div class="quote">“The economies in South America and the Caribbean are stable at the moment, and our economy will also benefit from that factor."</div><h4>Has your investment in expansion in Haina increased your business in the country?</h4><p>We have invested in both terminals since the beginning as the private sector obtained the license to operate the port of Haina, which is still owned by the state but is operated by a private entity. Maritima Dominicana invested both in Haina and Caucedo. The reason why we felt this was extremely important was that when the ISPS security requirements structure was produced, a state-owned port terminal could not have reached the compliance level of these requirements without the help of the private sector. This was particularly important in the case of Haina, whereas Caucedo was always a private terminal. In terms of getting ISPS certification in Haina, the government, 12 years ago, realized this would not be reached and Haina would be out of business. Obviously, this has contributed to stabilizing the maritime industry in the Dominican Republic to remain competitive and in a position to offer adequate services to the shipping community around the world. This has resulted in Haina increasing its volume dramatically over the last 10 years, while Caucedo has attracted entirely new business. Around 60%-70% of Caucedo's business is  trans-shipment today, rather than local cargo. This has also given us opportunities to attract services, and therefore made us capable of attending more ships.</p><h4>How has Maritima Dominicana's model changed as a service company over the last 20 years?</h4><p>We started as a shipping agent and stevedore, and now we are also a warehouse operator, reefer warehouse operator, and equipment operator; we have a fleet of over 1,200 chassis to provide inland transportation services. We have off-dock terminals both here where our office is, and in Caucedo and Puerto Plata. We have a company called Reefer Services, which provides reefer container repair and maintenance to all shipping companies that operate in the Dominican Republic. We have a company called Equipos y Transportes (ET), which provides equipment at the port terminals and for local inland transportation. Therefore, the model of the service range we provide has changed to what I today call supply chain management.</p><h4>Maritima Dominicana is a member of the Baltic &amp; International Maritime Council (BIMCO). What does this mean for a shipping company in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We are a member of BIMCO, which is based in Copenhagen, Denmark. This is an organization that was created 100 years ago in the steam ship sector and provides norms of conduct within the industry. For example, it develops examples for shipping contracts and insurance conditions. Because BIMCO tries to help the idea of globalization, a certain standard of services are provided; whether it is here in the Dominican Republic or in Timbuktu, it is the same. And that is the idea of BIMCO.</p><h4>What is your economic forecast concerning trade for 2012?</h4><p>I believe that this year will be a very stable year. We are facing financial challenges of which we are all aware. Inflation could be a factor that will affect international commerce. But in a globalized world, we are also impacted by influences from all around us. If the US and Europe do well, we do well. If they suffer, we suffer too. It is the same in South America because those countries are our most important trading partners today after the US. The economies in South America and the Caribbean are fairly stable at the moment, and our economy will also benefit from that factor.</p><p>© The Business Year - November 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia recently signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US and is planning to do the same with the EU. What are the advantages for Colombia of these FTAs, and what are the prospects for FTAs with other nations?</h4><p>Colombia's trade agreements have several goals. First, the idea is to leverage the advantages of international trade as a means toward economic growth. This includes providing clear rules for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs seeking to increase investment in our country. Additionally, trade agreements give Colombia a level playing field in target markets, where competitors already enjoy the advantages that come with trade agreements. Finally, these agreements facilitate the integration of Colombian companies into global value chains. Within this framework, the trade agreements that provide the greatest impacts are those we have with our key partners: the US and the EU. These partners buy a significant portion of our exports (38% and 18%, respectively), but they are also markets where we face competition. The US and the EU are also major importers of products for which Colombia already has or can develop competitive advantages. This, of course, applies to mining and energy products. However, in order to leverage the impact of these exports, we must also strengthen our higher value-added products. On this front, we should begin with processed foods, apparel, the metalworking industry, auto parts, chemicals, and business process outsourcing, among others. We have an ambitious agenda for our trade negotiations. Currently, we have nine agreements in force. And we are aiming for 16 trade agreements with over the 50 countries that account for roughly 60% of the world's imports. In addition to the US and the EU, this group includes all the Latin American countries, as well as Canada, the EFTA countries (Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland), South Korea, Japan, and Israel.</p><h4>You recently entered the Pacific Alliance with Mexico, Chile, and Peru. What are the strategic advantages of this trade bloc and how will it impact the region's competitiveness?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance is one of the most innovative integration strategies pursued by Colombia as part of its internationalization process. It is an open and flexible arrangement, with clear goals and pragmatic efforts to strengthen the existing bilateral trade agreements among member countries. The aim is to develop a joint policy on trade and economic integration, so as to advance internationalization as an economic bloc. Essentially, the goal of the Pacific Alliance is to establish an area of deep integration driving higher growth, development, and competitiveness in the participating economies. This is to be realized through streamlining the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. While it is true that in the field of trade in goods integration is well underway, we must continue deepening and strengthening the existing relationships and agreements dealing with services and investment among the member countries. Likewise, the four Alliance members must work on maximizing the benefits of foreign investment and international trade in services in the region, so as to achieve higher growth and economic development.</p><div class="quote">“Attracting foreign investment is very important for Colombia because it will allow us to grow at an even higher pace."</div><h4>Improving the country's infrastructure is one of the government's priorities. How is the current administration channeling investment in order to address Colombia's infrastructure needs?</h4><p>As a matter of fact, this is one of our priorities, and we have been taking bold steps toward tackling this challenge with efficiency, transparency, and accountability. So far, we have doubled investment in infrastructure from $1.6 billion in 2010 to $3.3 billion by the end of 2012. This is a huge step forward; however, it's not enough. We surely need more investment, but without jeopardizing the country's finances. This is why we have invited the private sector to join us, as partners, in building the infrastructure Colombia requires to live up to its highly promising potential. And in order to foster the conditions for this partnership, we have focused our efforts around two tiers. First, we set the legal framework—through the Public—Private Associations Law—to promote the birth of the strong partnerships necessary to make a real breakthrough in our country's infrastructure, which will result in building new and upgrading existing roads, ports, highways, and airports. These rules encourage companies and investors to become our allies in the design and execution of multiple ventures. And the results are forthcoming. Our National Infrastructure Agency has already received over 15 proposals from private investors to develop projects worth $7.2 billion. Furthermore, we have also launched the most ambitious infrastructure plan in our country's history: the Fourth Generation of Concessions. It comprises 30 projects valued at more than $22 billion. The first six will be opened by December 2012 and their cost amounts to approximately $4.4 billion. This means that investment in infrastructure during the next two years—as a result of solid public-private partnerships—will exceed the aggregate amount invested in Colombia in the past 20 years.</p><h4>According to the World Bank's Doing Business report, Colombia ranks first in Latin America for investor protection. What other aspects make Colombia attractive for investors, and what is the government doing to boost confidence in the country?</h4><p>Attracting foreign investment is very important for Colombia because it will allow us to grow at an even higher pace. When investment only amounted to 13%-14% of our GDP, we could hardly expect growth rates above 3%-3.5%. Today, investment represents 27% of our GDP, giving us the opportunity to grow at about 5%. And we are aiming for the 30% milestone, which would allow us to grow in excess of 6%. The message we want to convey is that Colombia is an investment-friendly country. To this end, we are improving the business climate and providing clear and stable rules for investors. Through our FTAs and bilateral investment treaties, we can ensure a reliable and stable investment framework. Moreover, given Colombia's FTA network, together with its advantageous geographical position, we offer a golden opportunity for foreign investors to improve their access to very interesting and promising markets. For example, Asian entrepreneurs can dramatically cut costs by accessing the US, Canada, and the EU by way of Colombia. Furthermore, we also offer incentives such as free trade zones, which feature lower income tax rates as well as duty and value-added tax exemptions on the import of raw materials and capital goods. And in order to attract even more investors, all these factors are integrated into our worldwide marketing efforts.</p><h4>What have been the biggest successes in your campaign against guerrilla groups in Colombia, and what are your expectations and strategies for a peaceful resolution?</h4><p>Guerrilla groups in Colombia, which sadly persist in waging a long, painful, and outdated struggle that has cost thousands of lives and resulted in thousands of victims and displaced communities, have been harshly hit, particularly over the last six years, to the point that their ranks, previously estimated at over 20,000, today are not even half that number. Since the administration of President Álvaro Uribe, under which I served as Defense Minister during its second term, our armed forces have been permanently on the offensive against the guerrillas based on joint and coordinated efforts among different components, on equipment upgrades, and—something of utmost importance—on strengthening our intelligence capabilities. Thanks to these efforts, members of the FARC's Secretariat, its highest ranking body, started falling in 2008. And during my administration it has lost not only its number one and two leaders, but also more than 20 of its regional ringleaders. While meeting our obligation to fight the guerrillas, we have not set aside the possibility of finding a peaceful solution. For this reason we conducted exploratory contacts with the FARC over nearly two years, which concluded in the signature of a General Agreement for Ending the Conflict, whereby a procedure was established for engaging in discrete conversations to be held abroad, addressing a limited thematic agenda, which should conclude in the guerrillas laying down their weapons and seizing the opportunity to champion their ideas on the political arena instead of seeking to impose them by force. Formal conversations were begun on October 18, 2012 in Oslo and will be held thereafter in Havana, Cuba, starting in mid-November 2012. Norway and Cuba act as guarantors, and we're also accompanied by Venezuela and Chile. We are moderately optimistic in Colombia as to the results of these dialogues, and, on behalf of the government, I can affirm that we'll strive toward achieving the goals. The Colombian people yearn to finally live in peace, and we all want to devote all our efforts toward building a more prosperous and equitable country.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Latin America's economic future, and what role will Colombia play in shaping this trajectory?</h4><p>The world economic context has changed drastically during the past four years. The 2008 financial crisis that began in the US and later weakened the fiscal solvency of the euro zone resulted in a profound change in the main drivers of world economic activity: about three-quarters of the growth in world output is now attributable to emerging economies. Riding on this wave of growth, Latin America, which now has a GDP of about $6 trillion, will triple its size by 2050 to about $18 trillion. Colombia will play the role of regional leader along this path, consolidating its position as the third largest economy in the region, a milestone achieved during 2012. In 2050, Colombia's GDP is forecasted at $1.1 trillion, more than three times its current size of $362 billion. This will be the byproduct of sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies targeted at increasing competitiveness, protecting investors' rights, and reducing inequality. Colombia, along with whole region, will be a highly integrated and dynamic economy with a diverse export sector and access to billions of consumers around the world as a result of our continued efforts in signing FTAs. Colombia's current economic strength, along with the structural fiscal reforms that have been approved during recent years, will enable the country to maintain stable growth rates in the future. High investment rates will continue to improve the country's infrastructure, making it more competitive with respect to its peers. In addition, Colombia's institutions are well prepared to cope with future external crises, as evidenced by the fact that Colombia was among just a handful of economies that managed to grow during the recent financial crisis. All these factors guarantee that Colombia will remain a leader within the region in the coming decades.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key reforms are being carried out to enhance the healthcare system?</h4><p>Strategies taken by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education for the development of healthcare services include designing and building a clear healthcare network that will perform basic sanitary functions. Some of the fundamental principles of developing such a network include prioritizing preventative treatments, increasing services in rural areas, and better distributing resources to the vulnerable parts of society, while also prioritizing and balancing services for inpatients and outpatients. It is also necessary to create a good private-public balance while also promoting decentralization in order to create independent healthcare networks. Designing and implementing basic healthcare services is in line with the Alma Ata Declaration, and the expansion of services is demanded by the public. Services demanded include dental and mental health services and preventative services for non-contagious diseases. We also aim to expand fair accessibility to service providers by choosing the right technology for maximum efficiency in the system, providing primary health care (PHC) for the majority of people, especially in rural and deprived areas, and improving living conditions in rural areas while promoting self-directed health care (SDH) in order to improve public health.</p><h4>What role does medical education play in the healthcare system?</h4><p>By combining medical education and healthcare delivery, we can create a broad context of service delivery that makes a shorter and more widespread training program possible. Due to this combination, an education system based on the community is provided that will better serve the needs of the healthcare sector. This expansive package automatically guarantees high-quality healthcare services. With the integration of medical education into service delivery complete, a number of other actions have been taken, including training manpower on the basis of the system's requirements, performing the necessary tasks for the codification of training programs, and carrying out the required interactions in order to make sure faculty members conduct research.</p><div class="quote">“We are working on integrating medical education into primary care systems."</div><h4>How will healthcare costs evolve over the coming years?</h4><p>In line with communicated policies regarding health care and the requirement of a family practitioner in urban areas under clauses A and D of Article 32 and Clause A of Article 35 of the Fifth Development Plan, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education is required to implement the family practitioner plan and the urban referral system, which will have a direct impact on health costs. An increase in health costs can be divided into two sections: necessary and unnecessary. For the necessary increase in costs, the required actions affecting policymaking and legislation have been taken, such as the Fifth Development Law. By managing the entrance and use of new technologies and also by implementing strategies such as the family practitioner plan, we have been trying to control the increase of costs that are unnecessary and irrational.</p><h4>What steps has the Ministry of Health and Medical Education taken in order to lower the infant mortality rate?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health and Medical Education has taken many steps in order to decrease the infant mortality rate. A newborn health program covering the first 28 days will also feature preconception care for women at risk due to old age or chronic diseases, and referral mechanisms directed toward specialized care. We will also carry out the implementation of a grading program for prenatal services, which will have four key dimensions, including assessing health defects in pregnant women on a primary care level and their referral to specialized care when needed; the effective management of consultancy and transportation of endangered mothers and newborns to higher levels of health care if necessary; the standardization of beds in specialized care sections for endangered mothers and specialized care for newborns; and the enhancement of IT infrastructure and the hospital care quality improvement program. We are also working on designing and implementing service packages and several care systems to improve the quality of hospital care with a greater focus on the primary care level, including newborn resuscitation services, healthy newborn services, critical care for endangered newborns, developmental care services for newborns, prenatal care, and infection control in specialized care sections for newborns. Child health programs will also include a combined healthy child care system, comprising of efforts to reduce the risk of incidents, promote breast feeding, monitor the growth of nutritious eating programs and developmental care, and care for those with sight and hearing disorders as well as supply vaccinations and referrals when necessary. A combined care system for sick children will also feature standard controls and cures for infectious respiratory conditions as well central nervous system disorders, diarrhea, vomiting, growth and nutrition disorders, fevers, paroxysm, coma, shock, and referrals when necessary. A child mortality monitoring system will also assess the causes of death among children. The main goals of the children's health program include enhancing and promoting breast feeding in Iran, especially raising awareness and improving staff skills in case breastfeeding problems arise, raising awareness and improving staff skills when it comes to caring for healthy children as well as sick children, and improving a family's ability to care for sick children and promote healthy eating. We aim to decrease the mortality rate of children under six years of age by means of controlling contagious and non-contagious diseases. The program's strategies include enhancing the continuity of breastfeeding programs; expanding integrated care systems for children under six years old; providing standard healthcare services to healthy children and extending programs to the private sector; enhancing the prevention of accidents in children and raising awareness of preventable deaths; introducing a child nurturing program aimed at spiritual growth and lower crime and child abuse; enhancing the process of providing, distributing, and prescribing medical equipment; overviewing and completed programs related to enhancing and expanding the death registration for children between 0 and 59 months; and intervening based on the results. It will also focus on improving and empowering referrals and follow-up systems in child healthcare programs at various network levels. Taking into account the importance of the child mortality index, for the purpose of monitoring child deaths and calculating the death index as well as analyzing the causes of death, special information systems have been developed by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. With the help of this system, we can analyze child mortality rates and also assess interventions made for the improvement of child health. Through broad activities in the expansion of basic healthcare coverage during the 1980s and their continuity, as well as creating the family practitioner plan in 2005 in rural areas and urban areas with less than 2,000 people, our country has made exceptional progress in decreasing the mortality rate among children.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Health and Medical Education's plan to decrease health expenses from 50%?</h4><p>According to clause B of Article 34 of the Fifth Developmental Plan, the Supreme Leader has stated that expenses paid by the public must reduce to 30%. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education, with the help of the Ministry of Cooperatives, by means of the legal context of this law has the implementation of the family practitioner plan and the referral system on its agenda. The plan is to increase the practitioner payroll on a per capita basis and increase the share of insurance in health-related expenses, thus decreasing expenses paid by people.</p><h4>What steps has the Ministry of Health and Medical Education taken in order to raise awareness of personal health?</h4><p>Based on clauses A and C of Article 37 from the Fifth Development Plan, which forbids the advertisement of harmful products, the Ministry compiles an annual public list. We are also working on integrating medical education into primary care systems, enhancing instructors' skills in consultancy and public education, and taking a broad range of actions to gain the cooperation of other organizations in order to raise popular awareness about personal health. We also research, plan, and assess the processes, train and empower staff, carry out public relations exercises on the expansion of healthy environments, introduce new educational and electronic technologies, and use volunteer forces as health messengers to educate people.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the second largest stock exchange in Latin America, how has the BMV contributed to the overall development of the Mexican economy in recent years?</h4><p>In recent years, the stock exchange has been a major source of finance for the Mexican economy, and in the last three years there has been Ps160 billion financed through the exchange. The BMV has been a source of equity for the major players in many different sectors of the economy. We not only issue equity, but also debt; over Ps2 trillion has been raised in debt on the exchange over the past three years. It is a fully integrated exchange system with clearing houses for both the equity and derivatives markets. We hold the depositary institution of Mexico, where all Mexican securities, except for government debt issued in US dollars, are held. We are not as large as the Brazilian stock exchange, but the BMV is growing. With the new source of savings that was created through the 1997 reform of the pension funds system, we now have around $130 billion of institutional money that can be channeled through the exchange for productive purposes.</p><h4>What industries do you believe have the most growth potential in Mexico?</h4><p>Heavy manufacturing has been something that Mexico has become very competitive in—specifically auto parts, automotive production, glass, and domestic appliances. We are huge exporters of industrial service goods that form part of the global supply chain. Some companies within that sector are already public, such as ALFA. I believe that more companies will go public in the future. Mexico has definitely become competitive, even as the country still faces several challenges. One is the delivery of natural gas, which is very cheap in North America, but there are not enough pipelines in Mexico for the transportation of this resource. Pemex is confident that by the end of 2013 the problem will be solved and we will have access to affordable gas in the future. This will increase the competitiveness of Mexico's industry.</p><div class="quote">“In recent years, the stock exchange has been a major source of finance for the Mexican economy."</div><h4>What are the main activities the BMV is currently focusing on?</h4><p>We recently renewed our trading system. The new system has the speed and capacity to process 500 times what we were doing previously. This new system was launched in September 2012, and it has been very successful thus far. We are at the forefront of technology, even though we are a small exchange. With Mexican companies growing in line with predictions, the demand for capital is growing and must be met by expanding the exchange. Even international companies have been using the BMV, including Spanish developer OHL and Santander, which has been the largest listing ever on the BMV. We are very positive that new companies will come and look for growth, equity, and debt on the BMV.</p><h4>Despite the relative strength of the market, IPO levels have been constrained. What challenges do further listings face?</h4><p>The number of listings depends very heavily on the economy; as the economy grows, we will see more listings. Medium-sized firms reach a certain level where they simply cannot grow further without financing—they need capital and they come to the exchange. We have seen several SMEs tap into the exchange, as well as larger ones such as petrochemical company ALPEK from Monterrey. In addition, Sports World recently used the exchange to expand its operations. Following this trend, I firmly believe that the exchange will grow substantially in the coming years.</p><h4>How has the launching of a faster trading engine helped to manage overloads in the system?</h4><p>The faster trading engine has improved efficiency substantially. The number of trades we have seen since it was established has doubled. These transactions will continue to rise as time goes by and more people become aware of our offerings. We altered our trading rules, which was very favorable for the market. The changes in the trading system make it even more favorable.</p><h4>The Sustainability Index was launched at the end of 2011. What factors spurred the launch of the index and what is its significance for the BMV?</h4><p>The idea is that sustainability should be a part of doing business. The index is not only a green index, but it also has to do with corporate governance and community relations. If a company has very good corporate governance, maintains a positive relationship with the community, and follows more than the basic rules by going that extra mile in terms of the environment, it can be listed on the index. One of the nice things about the index is that we don't decide who gets listed—the matter is decided by UK firm IRIS and a host of Mexican universities. Therefore, the index very neutral.</p><h4>In what ways would the proposed Volcker Rule, which bans proprietary trading, impact the BMV and other exchanges around the region?</h4><p>I think the Volcker Rule will impact exchanges globally in terms of less trading, but at the same time the Dodd-Frank legislation regarding the regulation of the OTC markets will imply more trading in established derivatives markets. We have a clearing house for derivatives, so that will undoubtedly have a positive impact on the exchange. We have huge fixed income and interest rate swap markets in Mexico.</p><h4>What new instruments and platforms are being developed to drive the evolution of the stock exchange?</h4><p>One new instrument is the Development Capital Certificate (CKD), which is an open-ended equity vehicle. Investors are able to invest in private equity funds or open infrastructure projects that are not yielding a certain return yet, but will yield a return in the future. We have also developed real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Mexico for the first time. So far, they have been very successful and have shown excellent returns—in 2011, we saw 20%. There are now several REITs in the pipeline.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>I am very bullish about the economy, because for the last 15 years Mexico has experienced very stable public finances and monetary policies, as well as a solid and coherent trade policy. We have been successful in terms of fundamentals, and I firmly believe that Mexico will be increasingly seen by international analysts as having a very strong economy. There was a depreciation of the exchange rate and a change in relative prices. We have a very good workforce, with highly trained engineers and professionals. Once the issue with the gas pipelines is resolved, we will have access to more affordable natural gas. In general, the economy is looking very strong.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bizim (BMD) Securities grown and developed since 2003?</h4><p>BMD Securities started as a boutique investment institution in 2003, and began with an agency agreement with Family Finance. We started offering capital market services to the clients of private finance houses in 2003. Although we are a conventional company, we developed know-how in interest-free investment products. Family Finance was similar to Islamic-style banks abroad, which have been called “participation banks" since 2006 in Turkey. Before 2003, there were no compliant interest-free investment vehicle products in Turkey, and no regulations. The regulations have changed and become more flexible to cover interest-free investment products and tools. In 2003, the finance houses as they were became participation banks and are now regulated by the banking laws. We work with all four Turkish participation banks at the moment, and are their exclusive investment institution. BMD Securities provides capital market services and products for all of the participations banks' clients, including brokerage services and other integrated investment services, such as investment consulting, IPOs, asset management, and similar investment services. That is where most of our growth comes from. We've developed an expertise in Turkey, and now this is the only institution that has an exclusive partnership with more than one bank and serves as an interest-free capital market service and products provider. We started with a few hundred clients, and now have over 50,000. We are almost in the top 10 in terms of assets under custody in Turkey, and we are in the top five in terms of corporate finance revenues coming from IPOs, M&amp;As, and similar activities. We are one of the largest brokerage houses in Turkey in terms of client size and assets under custody. Since we were the first to provide interest-free investing, we developed and pioneered a number of investment vehicles in Turkey. We were the first provider of Islamic, or interest-free, investment funds in Turkey specifically tailored to participation bank clients. Also, we were the issuer and asset manager of the first Islamic exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the world. It's called the Dow Jones Islamic Market Turkey. It was launched in 2006 and was the first of its kind. Since then we've launched a few other ETFs, and we are known for our expertise in this field in Turkey. We are the second largest provider after Finansbank, and also have the highest number of ETFs after Finansbank. They are all compliant products and are marketed toward participation banks. One of them is the Participation Index ETF, which is provided by BMD Securities. We are also the Turkish provider of gold and silver ETFs for Kuveyt Türk Bank in Turkey. In total, we have four ETFs and are planning to launch more.</p><h4>How would you characterize the demand for access to capital markets among interest-sensitive investors?</h4><p>At the beginning, it was huge because there had previously been no market at all. The growth rates naturally became very high, some at 300% or 400% per year. We started with a few hundred clients in 2003 and by 2007 we had close to 20,000 clients. Since there were no products to supply, we provided investment funds and brokerage services for participation banks. The demand was comparatively large. It has diminished over time, but we have been the fastest-growing brokerage house in Turkey since 2006. Back then, we started with one bank, Türkiye Finans, then made an agreement with alBaraka in 2007, Kuveyt Türk in 2008, and Bank Asya in 2009. As we made agreements with the banks, the clients came from these institutions to us. We saw both types of clients; the first being those who had worked with conventional institutions before and who were the clients of participation banks. When they heard that we provided investment services, they came from those institutions. The second type of customers had never been introduced to the capital markets at all; they were fresh, new clients who hadn't been trained or introduced and didn't know anything about the kinds of products on the market. We are trying to push products through participation banking channels. Usually, we are the initiator of demand by introducing products and explaining what these products do. Both people and institutions need to be aware of the products that exist. Because the participation banks never worked in this way, they were not aware of how we investment bankers can add to the value of an institution. This is transforming gradually.</p><div class="quote">“We will face more international competition, and may see a higher foreign presence in Turkey's capital markets."</div><h4>What was the significance of the Participation Index to interest-free finance in Turkey?</h4><p>It is a fruit of the process that began in 2003. Back then, the participation banking sector had no products at all and the Participation Index defined the standards of interest-free investments and equities in Turkey for the first time. To me, this is the most important part of the Participation Index. Turkey didn't have regulations or sector standards. We are the initiator because we've worked with all of the participation banks in Turkey, and we know their expectations and demands for these standards. These are the mutual standards approved by all of participation banks. The other important part is that it's an index in which we can establish investment products, such as ETFs. Now we expect an increase in the number of licensees. BMD Securities is not an index provider company, but there was no other institution who could do the job, and so we stepped up to the plate.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in interest-free banking in Turkey in the medium term?</h4><p>Until 2006, we didn't see any significant steps from the participation banks because they were limited by regulations. They couldn't perform many operations, such as launching investment funds or getting a license from the Capital Markets Board for certain capital market activities. Since 2006, we've seen an increasing awareness from the participation banks on the investment banking side, and even more so since 2009. Now they are starting to demand products and services on the capital markets side. Before that, we were trying to push products and services through their channels, but now their awareness is growing and they understand the importance of the capital markets and investment products. As the market in Turkey stabilizes, we are seeing decreasing interest rates, which proves that the focus is moving more toward investment banking. Banks must now find new instruments and products to get more revenue than in previous periods when the interest rates were high. During periods of high interest rates, the banks are not as interested in other products because they make money from the high interest. As interest rates decrease, banks are trying to collect more revenue from the commissions, services, and capital markets sides, as well as through insurance and similar activities. We expect that this will increase the size and volume of the participation banks in the capital markets in the following years.</p><h4>What role does corporate finance play in BMD Securities' business in terms of your work with M&amp;As and IPOs?</h4><p>We are one of the top five companies in terms of corporate finance revenues, from which we've made the most revenue until now. We have the highest number of colleagues in corporate finance, with around 20 people. We have experience in this sector and we will continue putting emphasis on corporate finance projects. Until now, we've mostly carried out projects at BMD Securities' headquarters, not through the participation banks. Usually the more experienced and qualified people are needed in the banks, so those people are typically on the banking side, not the corporate finance side. In the future, we are planning to continue corporate finance projects as this is an area where we expect more growth in the coming years. The demand for corporate finance services is related to the companies themselves. The current corporate structure in Turkey is not suitable to create that line in corporate finance services. With the new Commercial Code in Turkey, we expect this will change and the corporate structure in Turkey will lead to increasing demand as the companies prepare themselves to be publically offered. Depending on the preparedness of the company, the public offering of a company may take a year or more; if the company is prepared, a few months should be enough. At the moment, there are roughly 2,000 corporate finance projects in Turkey, and we expect this will increase to at least 10,000 in the next two or three years.</p><h4>How would you characterize the outlook for Turkey's capital markets over 2013?</h4><p>I expect many fundamental changes in the capital markets before the year ends. The structure of asset management companies and brokerage companies will change. We expect a more competitive sector, both locally and internationally in the coming years. We will face more international competition, and may see a higher foreign presence in Turkey's capital markets.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Behind the Fiscal Fence]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[behind-the-fiscal-fence]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, it is no news to say that Colombia has been putting its house in order. Politically, the country is far more stable and new peace negotiations with the FARC are raising renewed hopes of further progress. Social indicators have continued to improve, with nearly 1.2 million Colombians lifted out of poverty or extreme poverty between 2010 and 2011.</p><p>By 2011, the country set a series of records for job generation, FDI, and export growth while keeping inflation under control. This year, following an impressive jump in GDP of 5.9% in 2011, Colombia's tax revenues are up an additional 30%.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia has never defaulted on its debt, and markets recognize this."</div><p>More to its credit, Colombia has been making these gains in the midst of an unfavorable international context. The global economy and market sentiment continue to be subdued, encumbered by the eurozone debt crisis, the slow recovery of the US economy, and concerns about a slowdown in economic activity in emerging markets, most notably China.</p><p>There are many factors that help explain Colombia's remarkable advances, but there is one that we at the World Bank find particularly significant and not sufficiently advertised: its fiscal soundness. Through a series of prudent fiscal reforms, Colombia has helped erect a kind of protective perimeter—a fiscal fence—that should ensure the sustainability and protection of Colombia's recent progress.</p><p>Colombia has never defaulted on its debt, and markets recognize this. Its emerging market bond spreads and credit default swaps are among the lowest in the region and the world. Standard &amp; Poor's recently raised its investment grade outlook for Colombia's sovereign debt from “stable" to “positive."</p><p>To appreciate the significance of this fiscal fence, it is useful to consider how Colombia laid its foundation. Following the introduction of a new constitution in 1991, the size of government started to expand. Much needed public spending in health, education, and justice, however, was not matched with a commensurate rise in revenues. By the end of the 1990s, fiscal sustainability in Colombia was uncertain: central government debt was rising fast, and local governments were over-indebted.</p><p>Starting in the early 2000s, successive governments embarked on fiscal adjustment. The sovereign debt trajectory was brought under control in part through a series of revenue-raising tax reforms and changes to subnational transfers. Fiscal rules were introduced for departments and municipalities to rein in fiscal discipline. Medium-term fiscal and expenditure frameworks were implemented at a national level to help strengthen the overall direction of fiscal policy. Debt management was also shrewd, including the reduction of currency mismatch and increased use of fixed-rate paper with extended (and cheaper) maturities.</p><p>Toward the end of the 2000s, new challenges emerged: royalties paid to subnational entities were negligible in size. Buoyed by high international prices, Colombia was becoming an oil and mining nation and royalties stood to rise to 2%-3% of GDP in the coming decades. Royalties were often poorly spent and only benefitted a few producing regions.</p><p>As President Santos came to office, the first major fiscal reform that he embarked on was the development of a new royalties system, which entered into effect in 2012. In brief, all departments and municipalities now benefit from these revenues, some of which are prudently saved in a fund while global prices remain high.</p><p>While the fiscal framework had been strengthened at the national level, important challenges remained. Most importantly there were no clear targets for fiscal policy and the fiscal course could be changed by the stroke of a pen by any given minister of finance. At the same time, oil and mining revenues were rising and there were concerns about how and when to spend a possible oil bonanza of the central government.</p><p>As argued in a recent World Bank report, “policy challenges associated with commodities production can be effectively addressed through fiscal rules, stabilization funds, and a flexible exchange rate." This was exactly the path that Colombia followed. In mid-2011, congress approved a fiscal rule that sets the structural fiscal deficit on a declining path. By 2022, the target is 1% of GDP, but interim targets were also introduced, effectively tying the hands of the next three administrations.</p><p>Over the past two years, the World Bank has increasingly tied its support to the government's fiscal reforms. Budget support worth a total of $500 million has provided a cheaper alternative to bond financing. A new program of knowledge services has helped the government prepare for possible reforms in tax and pensions. A subnational investment loan will help strengthen the capacity of departments and municipalities in executing royalties spending. An innovative financial instrument can help Colombia address immediate liquidity needs in the wake of natural disasters, as it effectively did during the 2010 La Niña. From the perspective of the World Bank, Colombia is the new frontier where innovative financial and knowledge solutions are piloted.</p><p>Going forward, Colombia continues to face important fiscal challenges. The tax system could benefit from becoming fairer and simpler, while raising more revenues. The pension system needs wider coverage and enhanced equity, which will strain public finances. The health insurance system requires additional fiscal and financial reforms to sustain close to universal and equitable coverage.</p><p>A set of fiscal challenges faced by the authorities arises from the legal system, which often issues rulings that have important fiscal consequences. In fact, legal claims against the state today amount to 69% of GDP. The introduction of “fiscal sustainability" as a constitutional criterion now offers the minister of finance the option of formally commenting on fiscal aspects related to court rulings.</p><p>As Mauricio Cardenas, Colombia's new minister of finance, takes control of the country's economy, he takes over a world-class fiscal infrastructure that many a finance minister would dream of having. His predecessor, Juan Carlos Echeverry, a former mentee of Cardenas and two times winner of the “Latin America Minister of Finance" award, leaves behind an impressive legacy and institutionalism in a country already well known for its fiscal discipline and credibility.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-art-of-change]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Suramericana (SURA) of Colombia decide to invest in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>The origins of the group are based in insurance, and it is a company with more than 67 years of history in the Colombian market. SURA is the leading provider in that market. Three years ago, SURA started the process of expanding throughout the region. Seven years ago, it bought a company in Panama, and in 2011 the group bought two companies: one in El Salvador and Proseguros here in the Dominican Republic. SURA has a solid reputation in the region and is focused on sustained profitability based on attracting and retaining customers by offering value-added insurance solutions. SURA has good human resources and excellent risk and capital management records.</p><h4>What have been the achievements after the first year of operations under the new owners?</h4><p>We billed more than $74 million in 2011, and have a 10.5% market share. Our current budget forecasts 6% growth over 2012. As of July 31, 2012, we grew 4% above our forecasts. We are among the top four insurance companies in the market</p><div class="quote">“We billed more than $74 million in 2011, and have a 10.5% market share."</div><h4>To achieve this 6% growth, what markets are you targeting and what products are you planning to introduce?</h4><p>In total, 48% of our revenue comes from fire insurance, 25% comes from automobile products, and 16% comes from life and health insurance, with 86% of our company focused on property and casualty and 16% on life and health products.</p><h4>Why did you decide to concentrate on the corporate sector?</h4><p>One of the goals in this market is to accelerate the penetration of insurance, which is very low in Latin America. In the Dominican Republic, it is close to 1.4% of GDP. Innovating and creating products that will capture the attention of the customers is important. We do this through alternative channels such as bancassurance or affinity groups.</p><h4>Taking into consideration the experience and position of the company in Colombia, what innovations did you bring to the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>An insurance contract includes a host of assumed responsibilities. However, the company always works to add value to different products. Through our automobile insurance solution, this value-added could be the services we offer to the customer such as roadside and home assistance. SURA is very focused on the client and is completely service oriented. This culture of service has been developed over a period of years. Over the last year, we have been focused on aligning our organization with SURA's corporate culture. The main resource, we believe, is human capital. Pricing is not the only issue—the product and service are also important. We aim to identify customer needs, add value, and develop long-term relationships with clients. Usually, customers in the personal sector move from company to company. We want to avoid that situation. The sector has been focused on corporate clients; we are oriented to multi-segment and multi-product offerings. The usual channel is local brokers, but we have worked to diversify using our expert sales force and the latest in technology. Now, customers and brokers can connect with our database through the internet and obtain quotations. We recently introduced a tool that the customer can use to go directly to an auto repair garage and from there make a claim. That is new for the industry. In the past, customers had to go to our office or to a broker. They can go directly to an auto repair shop and open the claim there.</p><h4>How many offices do you have in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>We have offices in Santo Domingo, Santiago, La Romana, San Pedro de Macorí­s, and Las Terrenas. We cover the rest of the country through the agencies and brokers that work with us.</p><h4>Who are your main suppliers in business?</h4><p>Our main supplier is our reinsurance network, which is very important in this business. We have strong relationships with the top reinsurers in the world, such as Swiss Re, Transatlantic Re, and Hannover Re Group. This island is exposed to hurricanes and earthquakes; reinsurance enables us to share the risk in order to provide our clients with the protection they need.</p><h4>Are there any specific products designed for the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>All our insurance solutions are designed with our client's need in mind. Let's say for example business and homeowner's insurance; due to the fact that the country is exposed to hurricanes and tropical storms, there is high demand for this type of coverage. Our reinsurance backing is designed to take into account the nature of the country. We are generally conservative. We use A-rated reinsurers to guarantee the best coverage, and our reinsurers have been working with us for many years.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the competitiveness of the local insurance sector?</h4><p>There are approximately 34 insurance companies active in the Dominican Republic; however, the top six companies control an 85% market share. The insurance sector in this country has mainly been developed in the corporate sector, making it highly competitive and price sensitive. Therefore, premiums have a tendency to get discounted in order to maintain or attract new customers. The current government is currently working on regulations to promote adequate premium calculations. We believe that future opportunities will stem from economic growth, and insuring first-time clients in the personal segment. SURA's local operations have experienced a compound annual growth (CAGR) of 30% in life insurance over the last four years. Moreover, only 6% of our revenues came from life insurance six years ago—now this share has climbed to 16%. Our brokers are very happy that SURA entered the market because they felt that the industry needed a change, and the personal segment has tremendous growth potential; they foresee a very positive outcome in this market segment.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-significant-distinction]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the state of the real estate sector in Colombia?</h4><p>The real estate sector is not as big in Colombia as it is in developed countries. However, we are receiving support from government policies in order to facilitate the development of different projects. For example, in Spain, they build around 500,000 new homes a year, whereas here in Colombia we build around 120,000 homes. There is a significant distinction between Colombia and developed countries, but the country is getting stronger.</p><h4>How has Coninsa Ramón H. contributed to the development of the country's urban landscape?</h4><p>Coninsa Ramón H. started in Medellí­n; however, we are also in Bogotá and the coastal regions. In 40 years of operations, we have built many new homes, as well as commercial and institutional buildings. We do not just build real estate; we are also involved in the infrastructure sector. We have made a big impact on Medellí­n and the company is very proud of its accomplishments. Coninsa Ramón H. has constructed about 18,000 new homes in the city, and it also built the stadium suites for the South American Games. The company also built many non-residential buildings. When I go around the city with visitors, I am able to show them one of our buildings every five or 10 blocks.</p><div class="quote">“When I go around the city with visitors, I am able to show them one of our buildings every five or 10 blocks."</div><h4>Coninsa Ramón H. built the Empresas Públicas de Medellí­n building, nicknamed the “intelligent building." Why is it an “intelligent building"?</h4><p>When it was built around 12 years ago, it was the first intelligent building. It is an eco-building and a system-controlled building that has a master control room for fire protection, air-conditioning, and energy conservation. Because of its size, and this specialized control room, it was called the first intelligent building in Medellí­n.</p><h4>What are the most iconic buildings in Medellí­n?</h4><p>In my opinion, the Empresas Públicas de Medellí­n and the buildings we constructed for the South American Games are the most iconic buildings. Coninsa Ramón H. built four coliseums and the athletic field. It was extremely important for the city and we did not have much construction time. They had to be approved by the International Olympics Committee, so there was a lot of pressure, but we built them right on schedule and the South American Games were very successful.</p><h4>How would you assess the country's infrastructure needs?</h4><p>Colombia is investing a significant amount in the infrastructure sector. For the first time in many years, infrastructure is the leading sector in construction. It was not always this way. The different forces of the country are pushing toward investing more in infrastructure. The government is improving policies for local investors, and especially for foreign investors. The amount of capital that has to be invested is huge. The government is giving excellent incentives for those investors.</p><h4>Coninsa Ramón H. recently won the bid for the Hidroituango project. What will this project mean for Coninsa Ramón H. and for Colombia in general?</h4><p>The project will cost approximately $1 billion and it must be built in 72 months. It is currently the largest project in the hydroelectric sector. It is good news for Coninsa Ramón H., and we are delighted with winning this contract. Coninsa Ramón H. has entered into a joint venture with a Brazilian company and Constructora Conconcreto. We also built Porce III, which was another hydroelectric project from Empresas Públicas de Medellí­n. Since Coninsa Ramón H. was part of the same joint venture, we were able to offer a very competitive bid. Our company is proud to participate in this project and many people have congratulated us. The Hidroituango project will help us strengthen our image as a market leader in infrastructure construction. The company has received a lot of publicity about this project due to it being the largest of its kind in Colombia. Along with Hiudtroituango, we are building various other smaller hydroelectric projects. Adding all of these together emphasizes our expertise in such projects.</p><h4>What other projects are you focusing on?</h4><p>Our company has four different business units. In the infrastructure sector, we specialize in hydroelectric projects, but also in roads and highways. We have won a contract called La Via to Chocó. Chocó is a very poor region in Colombia, and for many years the people of Chocó have wanted to be connected by roads and highways. Coninsa Ramón H. was awarded with a contract to improve Chocó's infrastructure. Recently, the company also received a contract for road maintenance in Los Llanos, a region known for its strong agricultural industry. These two contracts are some of our other big achievements in the infrastructure sector. Coninsa Ramón H. is also involved in commercial, industrial, and rental property units in the housing and commercial sector. These three sectors, along with the infrastructure sector, are our core business. We started with housing units, and we continue to do very well in this area; around 40-50% of our business is dedicated to housing units. Regarding rental properties, we are managing about 5,000 homes. Our company does not own them; however, it does manage them. Coninsa Ramón H. introduces the owners and the renters. Another area of expertise is commercial building. Grupo Éxito, the largest commercial (retail) group in the country, has recently awarded us with a contract to build a $50 million shopping center in a city called Villavicencio in Los Llanos.</p><h4>Describe the companies financial performance during 2011, and what do you expect over 2012?</h4><p>During 2011, it was not as good as previous years. However, we are expecting a superior performance over 2012. In 2013 we will have an 80% backlog, i.e. the contracts we have won over 2012 will be constructed in 2013. That is why 2013 will be a very good year for income and earnings results.  Coninsa Ramón H is improving its process knowledge and investing in technology to become the leading company, delivering good results for our customers and shareholders.</p><h4>How do you see infrastructure of Colombia developing in the next 10-20 years and what are the main challenges?</h4><p>The country is investing a lot in infrastructure. The government's goal is to invest $20 billion over the next 10 years. The industrial, agricultural, and government sectors are aware that if the country does not invest in infrastructure, Colombia is not going to be a competitive country. There is a chance that not all of the $20 billion in investment will be completed over the next 10 years, but it will not be like in the past, where only 40% of the budget was used. We will see numbers in the 80% accomplishment range. There are very good opportunities for foreign companies that ally with local companies like ours.</p><h4>Does Coninsa Ramón H. have plans for expansion abroad?</h4><p>Not in the short term, there are no plans to leave the country yet. Coninsa Ramón H. has a lot of projects within Colombia right now. The market has enough opportunities for us here. However, we have in the past taken advantage of opportunities in other countries, such as Peru and Ecuador, or within the Caribbean region. We are not being pro-active in expanding abroad, but if there is an opportunity, we will pursue it.</p><h4>How has the rental sector evolved in Medellí­n over the last 5-10 years?</h4><p>The rental sector is not as volatile as other sectors are; it usually maintains a steady growth rate. The rental sector is expected to grow at about 4-5% per year over the next couple of years. Bogotá is the largest city in the country and it has grown faster than Medellí­n, especially in the housing sector. There is an increasing number of foreign companies in Bogotá, and as a result the possibilities in the rental sector there are better than in other cities around the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strengths of Nuevo León as an economic hub?</h4><p>It is very important to point out that Nuevo León is the most competitive and productive state in the country. It has four strategic pillars that are the focus of all our energy. The first is our human capital, the second is our strategic location or logistics platform, the third is our supplier base, while the fourth and last pillar is innovation. These four pillars contribute much toward Nuevo León's development strategy. With just 4% of the national population, Nuevo León actually produces 8% of the country's GDP. We have been and continue to be the industrial capital of Mexico, and are transitioning to advanced manufacturing in several strategic sectors. Nuevo León produces 11% of all manufactured goods in the country, and in terms of exports that means approximately $30 billion a year. If you compare that to other places, we export more than all Central American exports combined, and are comparable with the US states of Tennessee and Massachusetts. This is a $90 billion economy. We are double the national average for GDP per capita. The national average is around $10,000 per year, while in Nuevo León it is around $20,000 a year. Nuevo León has been rated by the OECD as the most productive state in Mexico, the most competitive by IMCO, and the most productive by KPMG. We have been the highest receiver of FDI for the past six years. It is a tendency that continues to grow despite global levels of economic instability. Nuevo León is a logistically integrated platform all on its own. In fact, 70% of all economic activity that transits to the US passes through Nuevo León.</p><h4>What strategies is the department employing to ensure that this is a sustainable, competitive, and innovation-based economy?</h4><p>The governor commissioned us to restructure the primary functions of this organization to become more efficient and tailor it to the needs of enterprises. Nuevo León is interesting in the way that the industrial community here tends to push or align public policy. It has a very important say in how public policy is drafted. This comes from Nuevo León having 10 out of the top 20 companies in Mexico. Industry here has a very strong weight. Thus, it was necessary to understand and bring the needs of enterprises closer to the Secretariat of Economic Development. As a result, the entire undersecretariat was restructured. Now, it is called the Undersecretariat of Investment and Industrial Development. We are very tailored to foreign investment, but in 2013 we want to begin to develop local industry. To stimulate industrial development, we created two divisions that are now a part of our pivotal strategy. The automotive sector is key and it represents one of our nine strategic sectors. What we try to do is identify the needs of entrepreneurs and enterprises. How do we do this? We map the value chains. For example, in the automotive sector, Nuevo León produces approximately 27% of all auto parts in Mexico. However, we want to map all the components that compose a car in order to see all of our tier-one, tier-two, and tier-three suppliers. This is done to see how well integrated our supply chain is and to fill in the gaps. What we do then is develop SMEs, certify them, and promote them as reliable parts of the value chains of larger enterprises. Out of the 27% of national auto parts we produce, 70% of all raw materials are still imported. Consequently, we need to stimulate import substitution from a competitive standpoint. We bring in SMEs and develop them so that they can provide services via certification. We also have a foreign investment strategy, and try to look for companies that are targeting markets in the US, Europe, or Asia. When the big tier-one automotive companies came into Mexico, Nuevo León was already the industrial capital, and it developed in the face of many barriers to entry, whether political or economic. This is why Nuevo León's strength lies in its supply base. The northern part of Mexico as a whole supplies approximately 65% of all auto parts.</p><div class="quote">“It is very important to point out that Nuevo León is the most competitive and productive state in the country."</div><h4>Nuevo León recently won the tender for the construction of the new Caterpillar plant. What does this and other recent successes demonstrate about the state's attractiveness as an economic hub?</h4><p>Winning this tender was a very important step for us as it means a $45 million investment. It represents the first time Caterpillar is outsourcing its cabin manufacturing to Mexico. Also, it represents an interesting time for us because the transition from simple manufacturing toward advanced manufacturing is where Nuevo León is proving itself. Nuevo León has the advanced technicians and specialized engineers available in order to produce the cabins for general tractors, which will be assembled in the Caterpillar plant in Victoria, Texas. It was a very interesting expansion. We welcomed it and assisted with a whole soft-landing platform. This investment speaks to the fact that advanced manufacturing is one of our strategic sectors.</p><h4>What regulatory reforms would you say are currently needed to support economic development?</h4><p>A nationwide policy needs a lot of coordination. There are countries like Singapore, for example, where companies can be opened in approximately 14 to 20 minutes. It has very well aligned national policies. We have very good levels of cooperation with the government, both at a state and municipal level. I think it is a national challenge to have better cooperation mechanisms between municipal, local, state, and federal entities. In Nuevo León, more than 80% of all economic activity is in the metropolitan area, which forms a major cluster of development. Our municipalities are very integrated in the metropolitan area. That is a strength because we have a lot of industrial parks, and it all makes for a very business-friendly environment. Obviously, at times local regulations can contravene state and federal regulations, and can give rise to problems for companies. In those cases, we help to mediate the situation. I think we need to concentrate more on a nationwide policy. If I have a state law on investment and employment that supports foreign investment, but may directly conflict with some municipal or federal laws, then we have to negotiate with the municipal and federal authorities to find a solution—I would not call it lobbying.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-the-look-out]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you see international investors playing in Mozambique's long-term economic development?</h4><p>Mozambique has become a prime destination for investment. Foreign companies started in the country by looking for opportunities in coal and natural gas, and since then we have been welcoming investors from around the world. Now, we are raising awareness that Mozambique is not all about coal and gas. The country boasts other business opportunities in agriculture, energy, and infrastructure. Due to our privileged geographical position, we have corridors that provide access to landlocked parts of Africa. In coal and gas there are opportunities beyond production, especially in the downstream chain and logistical backbone. One of the reasons investors come to Mozambique is the stability the country enjoys; we have macro-economic, political, and social stability. These are key attractions for any investor and boost our own development.</p><h4>Has Mozambique met its FDI targets? What are your goals for 2012 and 2013?</h4><p>We've been successful in meeting our targets each year. Our FDI has reached levels of between $1 billion and $1.8 billion annually, not including coal and gas. We are now aiming for $3 billion in FDI across the spectrum. Huge public investments have been made to overcome the infrastructure deficit. Our projects include the power transmission “backbone" from north to south and a hydropower generation facility in the north of the country. Regarding logistics, we have plans to build railways that provide support for the transportation of coal mining. These projects are valued at some $6 billion.</p><div class="quote">“Due to our privileged geographical position, we have corridors that provide access to landlocked parts of Africa."</div><h4>What are your main priorities in the medium term?</h4><p>Our top priority is to invest in agriculture, because more than 70% of our people are living in rural areas and are engaged in the sector. The second top priority area for Mozambique is vocational training. We have several projects geared toward capacity building. The preservation of national unity will rely on a great deal of engagement from our citizens. This participation will depend on the development of their skills. A third priority is infrastructure: access roads, national highways, and rural roads that can ensure the movement of both people and goods in the country. The current coverage of the national grid is 36%—we need to see more Mozambicans enjoying the benefits of power. Production levels will also increase with greater access to electricity. A fourth priority for us is investment in the healthcare sector, where we are mainly addressing child mortality and endemic diseases.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Zambezi Valley project for improved agricultural development and investment?</h4><p>It is said, “He who owns Zambezi Valley has every resource." We have been focusing on Zambezi Valley because the region has the potential to become the breadbasket for the country and its neighbors. The specific mission for our agency is to conduct technical and feasibility studies and provide support for the government as it identifies fundraising projects, gathers financial resources, and dedicates investments to the provinces. For example, we have a coal basin in Moatize where coal is exported from ports such as Beira or Nacala. We believe that the communities living along those railways can also benefit from the existence of that infrastructure, instead of just watching trains go back and forth. The members of each community should also be able to ship goods to any of those business hubs. Our agency aims to encourage the government to approach infrastructure planning in a global and integrated way.</p><h4>To what extent are development funds from BRIC countries important for Mozambique's development?</h4><p>Most of our funding comes from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and Europe. However, considering the crisis in Europe, we realized a need to rely on other sources of funding. In seeking other sources, we have discussed opportunities to work with the BRICs—except Russia, a country that has not initiated donations to Africa yet. We have been enjoying great support when it comes to funding, but in a country like ours it is advisable also to look for concessional funding. Therefore, we have to strike a balance between concessional and non-concessional loans.</p><h4>How will funds from coal and gas exports be used to create sustainable development across the country?</h4><p>We have been blessed with the discovery of new resources in 2012. In addition, we have the Congo, Liberia, and Angola to learn from; our agency will focus on avoiding previous mistakes to ensure that the resources in Mozambique are being used for the country's development. The resource management team should act in line with the will of the government and the country. That will challenge us in terms of legislation, especially as we work to ensure transparency in the extractive industries. Our focus is on the management of resources that will begin pumping funds into the state budget.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Planning and Development working to encourage international investors to develop value-added products in Mozambique for export?</h4><p>When companies come here, their flagship is to provide support to the government—but at the end of the day, they are here to maximize their profits. This means that the government of Mozambique is working to enforce legislation that ensures that these activities are benefitting the country. In this way, Mozambique will not be exporting raw materials, but instead adding value locally. This processing will add value to the economy and provide more jobs, which will generate more revenue and engage local companies downstream and boost profits. We are working toward that goal.</p><h4>What specific incentives are in place to encourage value-added production?</h4><p>We offer favorable tax incentives for private investments. In terms of natural resources, these tax measures are lowered. In the post-war period we had to provide a lot of tax advantages to Mozal, which became a kind of calling card to present to other countries and painted a picture of Mozambique as an investment-friendly country with a positive environment for investors. For current investments, we enforce a regulatory framework based on established international standards. Special tax incentives for goods that are produced exclusively for export still exist. To this end, there are also special economic zones and industrial free zones in the country. There is definitely no company, mega-project, or natural resources production activity that will become duty free.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the success of these zones in encouraging companies to come to Mozambique and launch value-added production?</h4><p>These zones are experiencing excellent growth. We have experience with Nacala, which is seeing growth in terms of FDI and local investment levels. We operate an industrial park close to the smelter, which is also enjoying substantial growth. In summer 2012, we established another duty-free industrial area in Beira. This zone aims to provide logistics for hinterland countries, and has demonstrated remarkable growth. In 2010, we made an initial investment of $5 million in the special economic zones. The project has shown promising results, and we are very hopeful that there will be many more investments in the future.</p><h4>What level of involvement does Mozambique have within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) infrastructure plan?</h4><p>Without Mozambique, this infrastructure development plan would not be in place. The majority of the beneficiary countries are landlocked, and therefore rely on us. We consider it our responsibility to increase the quality of services we provide to landlocked countries. Following the approval of the SADC infrastructure plan in Maputo, it has become much easier to raise funding both locally and throughout Africa as a whole, as well as from the African Development Bank and from our multilateral partners. This project was carried out because Mozambique is enjoying a competitive economic advantage. We aim to raise approximately $10 billion for the SADC as a whole, a figure that is required for the improvement of infrastructure. This will ensure that the SADC countries run smoothly in the forthcoming years.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were named GM of DuPont last year. What have been some of the company's milestones since then?</h4><p>We have started a journey to accelerate growth in Colombia and to further increase our penetration of the Colombian economy. Those were the two objectives that we had one-and-a-half years ago. Since 2011 we've grown 35% and the level of penetration of our portfolio in the economy is increasing. Reaching those rates of growth has been a major milestone for us, and means we are on the right track to keep accelerating.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance of Colombia for your global operations?</h4><p>Colombia is important; it is turning into the third largest economy in the region. It is also the third most populated country in the region after Brazil and Mexico, which represent DuPont's largest operations in Latin America. However, Colombia is also very significant. We're getting a lot of support from the corporation to identify the needs of the market and how DuPont can be part of that growth in this environment. Colombia is very active in energy—oil and gas in particular—and DuPont has a strong portfolio in that area. Infrastructure is another area where we are working very hard here in Colombia, providing new roads that the country needs. And now we're signing agreements and we have technology that can improve and enhance paving. We're present in one of the most important projects, the Ruta del Sol II, which is 528 kilometers in length and incorporates DuPont paving technology. We are also planning to be part of other projects in Colombia. Agriculture and nutrition are other areas we are interested in. In Colombia the middle class is growing, meaning the level of consumption is growing as well, and we want to be part of that in terms of nutrition and solutions for the food industry. DuPont also has corn seeds in its portfolio and we're gaining a share in that area as well.</p><div class="quote">“We have started a journey to accelerate growth in Colombia and to further increase our penetration of the Colombian economy."</div><h4>In terms of crops, what have been your major developments in the country?</h4><p>Corn is an area we're investing a lot in, and our technologies are improving the way farmers grow their seeds. They're becoming more productive by using our technology. This means that a farm in Colombia can produce more with our technology than it used to produce without it.</p><h4>Are there any new areas you are willing to expand into?</h4><p>We are always looking for opportunities. In 2011, we announced the purchase of a company called Danisco. And now we're in the process of leveraging the portfolio that Danisco brings into what we already had. It brings in a lot of technology as well as different areas of ingredients. In terms of resins, we provide solutions to the packaging industry as well. Through our extensive portfolio we are able to put together complete packages for various industries. That is our focus right now.</p><h4>How will the recently ratified free trade agreement (FTA) with the US impact operations?</h4><p>I think it is going to be good for all of us. We think that it will help the economy as a whole in Colombia to grow, and we want to be part of that growth. At DuPont, we see it as a win-win situation. It's going to be good for the US and it's going to be good for Colombia. And as the economy grows, we want to be part of that growth.</p><h4>You grew 35% in 2011. What are you expecting for this year?</h4><p>Even though 1Q2012 was very strong and we see a good 2012, growth is probably going to be slower than it was last year, but it will still be a strong year for us. The economy grew 6% last year. The last projection I heard for 2012 was 4.4%. We're probably not going to grow at the same rate as 2011, but it's still going to be a good year for us. We're positive.</p><h4>How would you assess technological and scientific development in Colombia?</h4><p>We leverage all of the capabilities that DuPont has on a global basis in terms of technology. We have more than 8,000 scientists around the globe and we try to adapt what we have on a global basis to use that capability for local needs. There is a need to improve the infrastructure here in Colombia, and now we're using a technology that can help to provide better and longer-lasting road paving materials. We're always looking for opportunities and how our technology and our people can use their knowledge for local needs.</p><h4>Do you carry out R&amp;D in Colombia?</h4><p>We don't have a lab here, though we are connected through our technical organization with Brazil. There is a vice-president in Brazil who is in charge of R&amp;D, and we have local people who report through that line. Whatever needs we have to develop with local companies and institutions we channel through that line.</p><h4>What other advantages does Colombia offer for further investment?</h4><p>In the oil and gas and mining areas we have a business called DuPont Sustainable Solutions that is focused on providing service and safety consulting. We provide support for managing the environment and improving safety in the operations. We have ways to grow here and support local needs. We also have a strong portfolio in protective wear as well, such fire-resistant clothes. These products are useful for people working in refineries who face danger from fire and also from chemicals.</p><h4>How do you assess the investment climate for foreign companies wanting to come to Colombia?</h4><p>I think it's pretty good. We can say that because we've been here almost 50 years already. In 2013 DuPont's operations will turn 50 in Colombia. With the number of FTAs increasing and the economy continuing on its growth curve, the climate is strengthening.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the local economy?</h4><p>The investment that we're seeing in the oil and gas area is very tangible. Agriculture and nutrition are certainly areas people are investing in because of the growth of the middle class. And something very particular in Colombia is the infrastructure. It is taking time and people are complaining a lot, but Colombia is going to improve its infrastructure and there is going to be a lot of investment in that area. We want to be there and we want to be part of the solution business in that area.</p><h4>Are you launching any new projects soon?</h4><p>On a global average, we produce one patent every two days. DuPont is always introducing new technologies. Elvaloy is the product that we are using for paving. We're definitely always looking for good opportunities to launch new products, such as new seeds in the corn area. DuPont has also launched new technologies to produce corn. We are additionally working with the government to provide nutritional solutions to children, and that's something we're planning to do in the next few months. We're also launching projects like Protera, which is for fire and electrical hazards. Every year we launch new products targeted at local needs.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You've been in the business of cement production for over 60 years now. What are some highlights from 2011?</h4><p>Fars &amp; Khuzestan has been in the business for 62 years—since our first plant was established in Fars. Throughout that time, we have been continuously growing. In 2011, our production grew at a rate of about 6%. In that same time, overall cement production in Iran has grown from 56 million tons to 66 million tons annually. We are still the number one cement producer in Iran with 17 plants all over the country. Right now we are focusing on productivity and increasing the capacity of the machinery in our plants. We are also following a strategy of focusing more on producing blended cement.</p><h4>Taking this into consideration, what are Fars &amp; Khuzestan's current objectives in terms of growth?</h4><p>There are a number of companies under Fars &amp; Khuzestan Holding, some of which are active in areas such as consultancy and cement plant construction. However, the Board of Directors has now decided to sell a number of these companies so we can focus solely on cement production and trading. Many of the companies in Fars &amp; Khuzestan Holding were founded to provide specific services that were needed to support the work of our main cement business. However, in recent years, it has become easier for us to obtain these services more competitively from outside providers. Our focus now is on maintaining and growing our market share in cement production. We are also looking to increase our share of the export market. Right now about 14% or 15% of our production is exported to other countries. We now own 55% of production plants in Iran and we own shares in 55% of the cement market. Our goal is to increase our market share and right now we are in negotiations to purchase shares in a number of other producers, which would bring our market share up to about 60%.</p><div class="quote">“Branding, packaging, and quality are the major factors that determine whether or not you will be able to compete in market."</div><h4>How is the growth of the construction sector affecting your business?</h4><p>The construction industry is mainly divided into two sections. The first is government infrastructure projects, which are very important for the cement industry. The second is the housing industry. For the last 10 years the construction sector has been growing at about 5% to 10% annually. As a result, local cement consumption has been increasing every year—last year at about 6%. Our strategy for now is to increase our exports so that we can adjust to changes in local cement consumption each year.</p><h4>Do you work mostly with the government or with the private sector?</h4><p>It varies from year to year depending on the amount of investment from both the government and the private sector. Through 2010 and 2011, the government has been involved in housing projects all around the country, so for the past few years, we have been working primarily with the government. However, in 2012, as these government projects have been completed, we have begun to work more heavily with the private sector.</p><h4>How would you assess the cement industry's future growth prospects in Iran?</h4><p>Iran is still a developing country. That means that construction and infrastructural projects are still active. This will translate into a big demand for cement for at least the next 10 years. With our wealth of raw materials, Iran has the capacity to easily produce more than enough cement to meet domestic demand. That said, I don't know how much more scope there is for further expansion of the cement industry in Iran. There are 15 plants under construction right now. Once they are completed, cement production capacity in Iran will increase to 92 million tons per year, which should meet domestic consumption needs. Instead, the future may lie in blended cement, which could increase existing capacity by a further 150%, bringing our future capacity to 135 million tons. That's a huge amount of cement. Instead of building new plants, we should focus on productivity and capacity, both of which can be increased by producing blended cement. Blended cement also has environmental benefits because it saves energy. That is why it is important for us to move in this direction. Switching to blended cement production will lower costs and be more environmentally friendly. In my opinion, it is the way we should be producing all cement right now.</p><h4>You mentioned that your exports vary across different years. Which countries are the main recipients of your cement?</h4><p>Iran is in a strategic location. Not only do we benefit from oil wealth, but also neighboring countries all have massive construction plans. For example, Qatar is planning to host the World Cup in 2022, and has a 10-year construction plan in place. Iraq, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan also all have big construction plans. In addition, we are seeing increasing demand for cement in Africa, although, at this point, we are not in a position to export massively to Africa.</p><h4>Currently, the cement industry in Iran is dominated by local producers. Do you see room for foreign investors to enter the market?</h4><p>Right now Holcim, which produces about 10 or 11% of the cement in Iran, is the only major foreign producer in the country. There is not necessarily room for new plants, but there is certainly scope for foreign companies to invest in increasing the productivity of existing cement plants.</p><h4>How has the cement industry changed over the past two years and how have you adapted in order to maintain your market share?</h4><p>Two years ago, cement demand was higher that production; Iran faced a shortage of cement. Now, supply has surpassed demand. Two years ago, there was no need to expand or diversify production. Now you have to spend money on introducing your brand to the market. It is more difficult to sell cement now than it was two years ago. Now if you want to be competitive, you need to distinguish yourself from the competition with quality and variety in order to meet customer demand. That is why we are now focusing on building our brand—something that didn't mean anything three years ago. Right now, branding, packaging, and quality are the major factors that determine whether or not you will be able to compete in the Iranian cement market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the next three years?</h4><p>We are focusing on following our strategic plan. We have doubled our capacity in the past eight years, so I don't think we need to invest in more plants. Our focus now is on quality, branding, and costs, all of which will help us stay competitive and maintain our market share. Our goal is to ensure that our investors are earning more than long-term bank deposit interest rates, which right now are at about 20%.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Autogermana is turning 30 years this year. What have been the milestones so far?</h4><p>Autogermana started in 1982 while Colombia was actually closed to the import of luxury items. We opened one small showroom and workshop in the central part of Bogotá. Then, in 1993, the government opened the economy up to the import of goods. We also opened a few facilities in the other two main cities, Medellí­n and Cali. Those were import milestones. Then, in 1994, Autogermana started distributing BMW motorcycles. We then started to grow in terms of service locations. By the end of the 1990s, we had opened an exclusive showroom in the northern part of the city. We kept the original location as our service facility. Starting in 2000, we began opening new facilities on the northern coast of Colombia (Barranquilla city). Then, in 2007, we also included Husqvarna, which is another motorcycle brand acquired by BMW that is based in Italy. With that, in 2008, we were the third importers in Latin America to start distributing Mini vehicles. Mini was bought in 1994 by the Rover Group. After a few years, BMW decided to divest from the Rover business, but the Mini and Rolls-Royce brands remained in its portfolio. So, by that point, we were distributing BMW, BMW Motorcycles, Husqvarna Motorcycles, and the Mini. Also, in 2008, another milestone was the opening of a showroom facility in the capital city; this remains the biggest showroom and workshop that a luxury brand has in the country at 8,000 sqm in size. It is still a benchmark in the industry. Then from 2008 until 2012, Colombia really started to grow at a fast rate. Autogermana was visionary enough to start investing in expanding its facilities and its capabilities in terms of customer service and sales. We also opened showrooms in locations such as Cúcuta, and new facilities on the northern coast, in Cartagena and Santa Marta. We started getting into mid-size cities of around 1 million inhabitants or less. In addition, over the past year, we also opened a state-of-the-art service facility on the north side of Bogotá. We are looking at where the city is growing and expanding accordingly.</p><h4>BMW just launched the fifth generation of the M5. What are some of the model's specifications?</h4><p>The M5 is one of the flagships of BMW in terms of sportiness, design, and performance. It is an exclusive and very powerful car, but it is not for everybody. The car has developed very well, even surpassing our expectations as a vehicle worth more than $200,000. Whenever you get in the car and drive it, you feel the power, design, safety, and comfort that it offers. It has more horsepower than any other car in Colombia. It has had a great response from our customers in the country. As a model it is important because it has helped us to promote the BMW brand.</p><div class="quote">“The exchange rate has been a significant factor and has had an important impact on the development of the luxury segment."</div><h4>The automotive sector has had steady and rapid growth over the last few years. What is your outlook for the premium sector?</h4><p>In recent years the automotive sector has been growing very fast. We broke records each year until 2011. Now, there is a slight slowdown in growth across the market. However, the slowdown in growth has only been about 0.2%. Nevertheless, it is at least a different pace from what we had experienced in previous years. Despite that, the premium segment has been growing above the rate of the market, and we have been increasing our penetration level. Even though, compared to 2011, we are pretty much steady as the premium segment continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate.</p><h4>How is the exchange rate impacting the premium sector?</h4><p>The exchange rate has been a significant factor and has had an important impact on the development of the luxury segment. There is a strong correlation between the sale of luxury cars and the exchange rate. Whenever the exchange rate goes up, imported car sales go down.</p><h4>What impact will the free trade agreement (FTA) boom have on the automotive segment?</h4><p>We import cars from the US and Europe. Certainly, as a result of FTAs, customers in Colombia will see a decline in the cost of cars over the medium to long term. Nevertheless, it is 100% dependent on what the exchange rate is going to be at that point in time. There will be a reduction in import tax, which is going to be progressive. In the case of the US, it is going to be 3.5% over a 10-year period. That means that on a yearly basis, the government is going to reduce import tax by 3.5%. At the end of the 10-year period, it will have dropped to 0%. Nevertheless, the exchange rate will still affect affordability. A similar system will apply to the EU, except the import tax rate is going to drop from 35% to 0% over seven years.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the demand for automobiles?</h4><p>The 3 Series is the most successful model in the BMW line up, and a mirror of what happens worldwide. This year was, in a way, a bridge year as we recently launched the sixth generation of the 3 Series. In addition, the 1 Series is picking up significant volume. Due to the kind of roads in our country, SUVs have also become a desired car in our portfolio. The X3 is the most preferred in the X range. Also, a few years ago people were trying to keep a low profile here. You never knew what was going to happen in Colombia if you showed off too much. The good thing is that now having a BMW or a premium car is no longer contrary to keeping a low profile. Now, people feel much more comfortable to have a BMW or to ride a BMW motorcycle without feeling that they are showing off. They want to have a safe car and the sportiness of a BMW without the guilt of showing off in a way that could be unsafe. That has changed the dynamics of the market significantly.</p><h4>What is your expected financial performance for 2012?</h4><p>We are expecting growth of 10% for the BMW brand. Sales of the Mini will also grow 40%, and in the motorcycle category we will also grow above 30%.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core strategic plans the Ministry is implementing to strengthen national strategic sectors?</h4><p>President Medina clearly stated in his inaugural speech that the development of both micro firms and SMEs in the country is the strategic axis of the industrial and commercial sectors. Today, this type of enterprise composes 90% of the Dominican industrial park, while almost 56% of employment is produced in the informal sector. We have to keep in mind that that people working in this shadow market earn between 30% and 45% less than people employed in the formal market. The development of these sectors will come with fairer and more stable job opportunities for our population, and I would like to remind you of President Medina's plan to create as many as 400,000 jobs for our population. One of the main problems micro firms and SMEs face is difficulties when trying to access a loan, and for that reason we are in the process of identifying potential new financial resources for these enterprises. In this regard, we have established a fund of Ps4 billion and created the Solidarity Bank, which aims to attend to the needs of micro firms. We expect to contribute to the development of a wide range of companies from different industrial and commercial segments. I would like to add that this strategy will also boost activity among large and corporate companies, because many of them are directly related to the activity of micro firms and SMEs. In addition, we plan to introduce some tax amendments at the industrial level and institutionally reform the Ministry in order to create sector-specific vice-ministers to better implement strategic policies. In fact, we plan to establish a new Energy and Mining Ministry, areas that are currently under our influence, due to the importance of these sectors for national development.</p><h4>What initiatives does the Ministry aim to develop in order to boost exports and strengthen trade policies?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has four free trade agreements (FTAs) in force. As a result, most of our trade is liberalized through these agreements. Also, we aim to reach a similar agreement with Haiti, our second most important export market at the moment, with an average trade balance of $1.3 billion a year both in the formal and informal markets. We'd also like to develop closer ties and perhaps commercial agreements with countries like Canada and Chile, or accede to regional entities like Mercosur. At the moment, we are also trying to boost mining exports, a sector labeled as strategic by the government. For example, the implementation of the “Pueblo Viejo" mining project will add more than $2 billion to our overall export figures in 2013, which represents a 20% increase in our exports. The government also aims to provide continuity to the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) scheme to further attract FDI into the Dominican Republic, especially in the manufacturing sphere.</p><div class="quote">“The Dominican Republic has four FTAs in force. As a result, most of our trade is liberalized through these agreements."</div><h4>What have been the main advantages of the Dominican Republic—Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA)?</h4><p>It has consolidated some favorable import-export tariffs that the country individually had with some of the region's states. If we had not taken part in such a scheme, we would have lost this favorable treatment, and the Dominican Republic would be at a competitive disadvantage with its regional counterparts. Also, it encouraged an exporting culture in the country and increased the presence of Dominican products in the US, a country that today receives 80% of our exports.</p><h4>What is the potential behind developing closer ties with China?</h4><p>Over the last few years, we have intensified diplomatic and trade relations with China, and we already have a representative office in that country. In this regard, we are promoting official visits between both countries at the diplomatic and business level. In the future, I believe trade relations will increase and we aim to start exporting both goods and services to China. There are plenty of opportunities for both countries to develop commercial and industrial initiatives within the mining and energy sectors.</p><h4>Since the extracting industry is to play a key role in the development of the national economy, what is the significance of the Loma Miranda mining project?</h4><p>Mining is a very aggressive activity at the environmental level, and it sometimes generates controversy among social spheres. In this regard, the government currently plans to develop a proper environmental management and remediation plan for the Loma Miranda project. Once the plan is fully drafted, we will be able to start exploiting the resource, because we believe it is a very important mining project for the country. However, it is essential to implement responsible mining practices and we know that Xstrata Nickel Falcondo, the company that plans to develop the area, complies with the highest international standards in the nickel sector.</p><h4>Are there any plans to explore other potential mining areas in the country?</h4><p>At the moment, we are revising all the mining concession contracts, because many of the country's mines are either out of use or they do not receive the appropriate investment. We will re-issue exploration and exploitation licenses, favoring all those companies able to better implement exploitation and operation activities. The Dominican Republic is a very rich country in terms of metals, and we believe there's a bright future ahead of us in the extracting industry.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's strategies for the development of the hydrocarbon sector?</h4><p>Hydrocarbons means the regulation of a fuels market on the one hand, and on the other hand, the exploration and exploitation of natural reserves, an area in which the future Energy and Mining Ministry will take over. Through the new ministry we hope to improve exploration activities in the country in order to find reserves that enable us to exploit them at the commercial level, while also cutting down our dependence on the import of petroleum products. Right now, and thanks to an agreement with Venezuela's Petrocaribe, we are financing around 40% of the country's oil bill, which represents some 30,000 barrels a day out of the 146,000 that the country consumes daily. The country is very much affected by the fluctuations in oil prices, which has had a negative impact on us in the last couple of years. The electricity sector is among the most affected. The country's general subsidies for 2012 in the electricity sector will amount to $1.3 billion. This sector has had a structural deficiency for the past 50 years, and its development is one of the country's main challenges. We need to reduce generation costs, which would at the same time reduce distribution and purchasing costs as well.</p><h4>Is the Ministry considering any action to target losses in the electricity sector?</h4><p>Reducing generation costs, as well as investment plans from sector players and potential foreign investors, are vital measures to address the situation. However, it may take several years before we see any positive trend in this area. The government plans to build generation capacity to deal with inefficient generation in a sector burdened by the Madrid Agreement. Additionally, investment in the electricity distribution network is also very much needed.</p><h4>What are the country's future prospects for natural gas?</h4><p>The government of the Dominican Republic is promoting the construction of a new gas terminal in the country, something that requires high levels of investment from both the public and private spheres in order to encourage the participation of a second distributor in the country. Despite high prices at the international level, we will continue promoting gas as an alternative energy resource, while trying to strengthen the distribution network across the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Export Guarantee Fund of Iran (EGFI) was first established in 1974 and re-opened in 1994. How are your operations increasing the nation's non-oil exports?</h4><p>EGFI is doing the same type of business and provides the same insurance coverage that many other export credit agencies (ECAs) around the world do. We are a member of the Prague Club and meet every six months and review all of our activities relating to export credit insurance and risk coverage. Our main duties can be divided into two parts: banking coverage, which is designed to provide export finance for Iranian exporters, and export credit insurance. We are the only Iranian organization to support non-oil exports of the country. Exporters need to know they will get paid after delivering their goods and services outside the country, and we play a major role in these kind of transactions. We can guarantee payment and issue an insurance policy for exporters to ensure that they will be able to receive their money after exporting. We work closely with companies and importers in other countries, and this is the non-banking aspect of our support. In terms of banking activities, there are a number of credit facilities offered by Iranian banks to exporters, but banks need to be sure that when they provide a loan to an exporter they will get their money back. We guarantee loans in favor of the bank so that we can help exporters to be financed. We are acting as intermediary between banks, Iranian exporters, and foreign importers.</p><h4>How do you protect your investors from foreign political risk?</h4><p>Upon assessing credit risks and export credit finance, the creditor or guarantor risk is analyzed with a model. Then a credit ceiling is allocated accordingly. In this case, the risks are both political and commercial. However, for FDI only political risks are important and this involves the study of business environments, investment climates, political stability, and investment rules and regulations of the host country. The main political risks are: war, expropriation, and acts of government. Like many ECAs, EGFI supports Iranian investors.</p><div class="quote">“Our plan is to reach $80 billion in exports by 2013. By doing this, we can reach a trade balance with less dependence on oil."</div><h4>How much has EGFI enhanced export volumes?</h4><p>Our role in non-oil exports is reasonable, however, we are trying to increase our involvement. We currently cover around 7% of Iran's non-oil exports, but we have a target to increase that percentage by 1% every year because exports in Iran are increasing accordingly. The international average for top ECAs is around 10%, and in the MENA region it is around 4%. I believe that we will have many more active years in the future, and the number of exporters asking us for credit coverage is increasing year by year.</p><h4>What are the main Iranian products EGFI covers and what trend do you see with respect to products exported?</h4><p>Petrochemicals, industrial goods and machinery, and pistachios are the top three, followed by carpets, dried fruit, and other agricultural products. At the moment, we are covering many techno-engineering products and services, and we cover many construction projects such as water treatment plants and hydro power dams. We also cover non-oil related chemicals and medicines. According to statistics, the IT sector is also increasing its production and exports. As a rule, large companies do not prefer to work with EGFI, as they are already strong enough. Therefore we are more inclined to assist SMEs that are working actively to develop Iranian markets. However, we never decline a request for coverage, as we do believe that “Made in Iran" has the capacity to expand in emerging markets.</p><h4>In which foreign markets is EGFI providing the greatest level of coverage?</h4><p>We are covering many African states, CIS countries, and Asia—especially China and India. We also cover some exports to Europe, Latin America, even the US and North America. We don't see serious problems in our future exports because foreign importers are familiar with our products such as pistachios, caviar, and carpets. Iranian exporters trade mostly with neighboring Muslim countries where they have stronger ties.</p><h4>How has the credit contraction due to the global economic downturn affected EGFI's operations?</h4><p>Many countries have been influenced by the global economic situation, but some of our activities have expanded because of a global credit crunch; it had a positive impact on our activities. We are working closely with other ECAs. We are also looking at helping companies obtain the machinery to manufacture products we normally import. We are acting as guarantors between the companies that produce this kind of equipment and Iranian producers.</p><h4>What are your medium-term expectations for export growth?</h4><p>Considering the statistics since 2005, we have seen increasing exports. I believe that in 2013 we will have see a greater export volume compared, for example, to 2011, when we had $45 billion worth of non-oil exports. Our plan is to reach $80 billion in exports by 2013. By doing this, we can reach a trade balance with less dependence on oil exports.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The 2012 World Economic Forum on Latin America was held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Why was this year important for the country and the region?</h4><p>Mexico has the second largest economy in Latin American and has acquired more prominence in global affairs as Chair of the G20 in 2012. The context of Mexico's Chair of the G20 and hosting the G20 summit, together with Brazil hosting the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+ 20), have been unprecedented opportunities for Latin America to take on a leading role in global issues. Despite the current international economic context, Mexico has proven to have a dynamic and resilient economy and has continued to receive significant flows of FDI in diverse sectors. A similar positive economic trend has been experienced by some other Latin American economies. Both regional conditions and positive trends, together with the region's stance in the international scene, have put Latin America in a relevant position in 2012.</p><h4>How would you assess the outcome of the event?</h4><p>It was extremely successful. We convened more than 850 leaders from business, government, international organizations, academia, and civil society from over 70 countries, setting a record for the number of participants and in their diversity for a regional meeting on Latin America. There was also a positive response acknowledging the relevance of Mexico and Latin America in world affairs, since the meeting was an important milestone in the process leading up toward the G20 summit at Los Cabos. The key priorities for the Mexican presidency of the G20 were mapped by the Mexican government, and the World Economic Forum contributed to this with the creation of multi-stakeholder task forces on the eight priorities outlined by the B20, including green growth, food security, transparency, trade and investment, innovation and ICT, financing for development, and the creation of an advocacy group that will ensure continuation between one G20 presidency and the next.</p><div class="quote">“Latin America has achieved its lowest levels of poverty in 20 years and has implemented innovative programs."</div><h4>What key economic priorities have been identified for Latin America?</h4><p>While the dynamism and financial resilience of Latin American economies have been acknowledged, a broad consensus about the importance of introducing more innovation in Latin America was clear, as well as other challenges—such as the need to increase productivity, modernize infrastructure, simplify governmental procedures, and promote wider hemispheric integration—and obstacles preventing Latin America from reaching its full potential. Other acknowledged priorities are the need for improved education and training, together with public security issues and the need to strengthen institutions and ensure a firm rule of law to offer both legal and physical stability in the long term. Creative policies must be implemented to foster a path toward societal growth while building on the wealth of human capital in Latin America.</p><h4>The theme of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 in Davos was “The Great Transformation". In what ways can Mexico and Latin America contribute to new socioeconomic models in today's world?</h4><p>Latin America has achieved its lowest levels of poverty in 20 years and has implemented innovative programs to boost the middle class. There are lessons to be learned from Latin America that can be shared with other regions facing a transformation process; much is also to be learned from the fast development of other regions, particularly from some Asian nations. Now that there is uncertainty in the developed world, more importance is attached to the emerging economies. Latin America presents an interesting array of opportunities for investment. With the sustained levels of economic growth achieved in most of the region's economies, it should be a timely opportunity to bridge the inequality gap through prioritizing in the social fields. In the near future, we would like to focus in sharing best practices, transferring technology and innovation applied to social programs, and promoting new financing models, for example, through public-private partnerships (PPPs) dedicated to attaining social goals. This is the time when sustained growth demands investment in human capital.</p><h4>The World Economic Forum recently launched the Mexico Gender Parity Task Force with the goal of closing the economic gender gap in Mexico by 10% in the next three years. What are the current issues surrounding this drive?</h4><p>While there are improvements in closing the gender gap on education, women still lag behind men in terms of labor force participation, representation in leadership positions, and in terms of wages. Under the leadership of Margarita Zavala, First Lady of Mexico, Angelica Fuentes, CEO of Omnilife, and Carlos Danel, Co-Founder of Compartamos, the World Economic Forum launched in Ouerto Vallarta the Mexico Gender Parity Task Force, an initiative that aims to close the economic gender gap in Mexico by 10% in the next three years. This is a very relevant initiative, considering that more than half of Mexico's population is female. There is a general acknowledgement of the need to support women to become more active players in the country's economy. The task force initiative involves the identification of leaders committed to the cause, implementation, and collaborative learning that we can gather within the country and a reporting of results. We believe that an important way to support women in business is through mentoring and coaching as well as through the inclusion of more women on corporate boards.</p><h4>How important do you believe PPPs will be for the development of the country going forward?</h4><p>I am sure that PPPs will be an important catalyst for the economy. However, it will not only be significant for large infrastructure, energy and connectivity projects as traditionally conceived, but also for other less evident areas such as healthcare and education. I believe there is significant opportunity to work through PPPs to achieve social agenda goals. A great example of this is the “Mesoamerican Health Initiative" launched in the Forum's meeting in Puerto Vallarta—it has brought together the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carlos Slim Health Institute, the IADB, and the Government of Spain as donors to contribute to maternal and child health in Central America and the southern states of Mexico. These are more than just simple donations; contributions made by private actors are complemented by public funds, incentives are created, and a careful monitoring system for the effective and transparent administration of these combined resources is put in place. These new financing models should be fostered throughout Latin America.</p><h4>Mexico is making various commitments to incorporate sustainable economic practices in industrial development. What are the most important steps to be taken in this respect?</h4><p>Mexico has been a leading country in the area of sustainable development. I think it is very important to acknowledge the public policy decisions that have been made in this area. Mexico has already introduced a transversal approach toward climate change. This is one of the first countries in the world that has applied such a policy on this matter. This program was launched a few years back and it will continue to be developed. Mexico has also committed to reduce its emissions by 30% by 2020. This is a very ambitious target. The country has passed comprehensive climate change legislation and I understand that there was only one international precedent to this, which was a law enacted by the UK. Now, Mexico has also envisioned specific targets and uses some instruments to promote adaptation. There has also been a cultural change whereby members of society have begun to understand the importance of sustainable development.</p><h4>What is your short-term regional outlook?</h4><p>We would like to urge the region to look at the common challenges and opportunities so that Latin America may, in a more integrated way, strengthen its capacity to be a strong player in the global economy. The stimulus packages in developed economies will drive these in a positive path, but a level of uncertainty at the global level seems to remain in the short term. Financial institutions continue to give positive projections for Latin America in terms of economic growth and continued inflows of FDI in most of the countries. Adequate fiscal and monetary policies are needed to maintain the path of growth, while increasing productivity and competitiveness and managing inflation. Countries with positive levels of growth have the opportunity to develop financial instruments that enable them to invest in long-term goals to ensure that growth translates into sustained development. This could be the Latin American decade. It is up to Latin Americans to take the bull by the horns.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-our-hands]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Alborz Insurance has been in the market for 52 years, with a wide portfolio. What are the cornerstones of your activity?</h4><p>Five or six years ago, insurance was mostly marine oriented, but now we insure more automobiles and motorcycles. In fact, about 50% of our portfolio is focused on automobiles and motorcycles. Switching to cars and motorcycles was not a decision we made, but instead it was due to market forces. Currently, automobile and motorcycle owners are obliged by law to obtain third-party liability insurance. In addition to that, the automotive market is growing at a rate of 1.5 million new cars every year. The main reason we have expanded our automobile portfolio is because auto production has increased dramatically over the past couple of years. Coupled with imports, we are starting to see a luxury market that has to be insured. When considering the size of the insurance market, more than 55% belongs to motorcycles and cars, with rates decreasing because of the tough competition in the market. Before privatization, there was no real competition; now we are witnessing a market undergoing expansion and we have to adjust to that trend. Every insurance company tries to maintain a balanced portfolio of risks, and Alborz Insurance has a historical advantage in marine and transportation insurance. Given that marine and travel insurance has been less popular over the past few years, our shares in the auto insurance market have increased accordingly. That is how we have managed the composition of our portfolio. While the market pushes us toward auto insurance and we attract more business from other sectors in order to maintain a more balanced portfolio. When it comes to marine insurance, the rates are going down because of competition, not volume. We offer premiums that have been decreasing due to the greater number of competitors in the market. Transportation insurance rates have lowered as a result of the global economic downturn as well.</p><h4>What strategies are you putting in place to differentiate the company from its competitors?</h4><p>We offer a variety of policies in life insurance. Some are designed for the event of death and others are more long term in maturity. Due to the inflation rate, buying life insurance is not convenient for consumers. If someone passes away, the amount of money left is rarely considerable. What the country as a whole is lacking due to laws and regulations is incentives; we cannot make life insurance more attractive to customers and it is difficult to make insurance in general alluring. Breaking down our markets, auto insurance comprises 42% of our business, health 20%, marine 5%, construction and engineering is 5%, and 10% of our portfolio is geared toward professional liability. About 6% of the company is dedicated to life insurance, and we are working to increase this figure—the future belongs to life insurance. The premiums raised by life insurance need to be invested in programs and assets that will generate an income to be paid off in the future. However, current laws and regulations do not allow us to do that in an economically meaningful manner.</p><div class="quote">“We conduct a very rapid evaluation of claims and disperse payments quickly, which is highly attractive for our clients today."</div><h4>What can be done on a legislative level to ease these laws?</h4><p>As insurers, we would like to foster an insurance culture. People are not familiar with the insurance world. It is not my duty to educate them—it is the government's role to improve the insurance environment and raise people's awareness about insurance.</p><h4>What projects are in the pipeline to make the company more competitive and profitable?</h4><p>What distinguishes us is our service. We have been customer-oriented through the years to provide value-added services. We conduct a very rapid evaluation of claims and disperse payments quickly, which is highly attractive for our clients today. What we have done recently to increase our competitiveness is introduce new products, exclusive to Alborz. One is coverage for cancer treatment. Patients pay premiums for a few years and are covered for the rest of their lives. We have designed this product with a team of practitioners and doctors. The other Alborz product we have recently introduced to the market is coverage for newly married couples that are struggling to have a baby. After certain conditions are met, we pay for different treatments to help them have a child.</p><h4>What do you expect from these two unique services you are bringing to the market?</h4><p>These two products have been introduced fairly recently to the market, and what we intend to have is not only customers using these products but also contributing to brand association and recognition. We want to inject the market with innovative products because we are an avant-garde insurance company that goes against the grain of more conservative competitive enterprises. We are trying to project an image of ourselves, using these products as tools to create a fresh perception.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, the UK Foreign Secretary William Hague launched the Canning Agenda—a drive to reverse a long-standing British tendency to underestimate Latin America and neglect its huge opportunities.</p><p>Colombia has been a clear case in point, and a country with which we have been determined to work more diligently. We have a long-standing relationship with Colombia that has supported the country's transition from being described as close to a failing state 20 years ago, to a modern, dynamic, and progressive economy in 2012—particularly in security matters. Our relationship is now starting to develop even further, and together we have made big strides toward a more mature and wide-ranging relationship.</p><div class="quote">“The UK is the second largest investor in Colombia, with recorded investments of over $5 billion over the last 10 years."</div><p>A major step along the way was President Santos' Guest of Government visit to the UK in November 2011, during which he inspired many people with his vision to transform Colombia. The visit also helped to develop a close working relationship between our two governments, reflected ever since through a series of ministerial exchanges on issues such as education, science and innovation, climate change, and human rights. We have also developed a close partnership on global challenges, notably during Colombia's time as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and around the Rio+20 Summit in June 2012. Throughout, we have found Colombia to be a particularly constructive partner on a wide range of foreign policy issues and we are pleased that Colombia is now taking on more of a leadership role across Latin America.</p><p>The UK has also been championing Colombia's bid to become a full member of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as part of an agreed accession process. We welcome the Colombian government's strong leadership to achieve OECD standards. We see this process as an important opportunity not only to support Colombia's transformation into a more competitive and open economy, but also to make the OECD a stronger and more globally relevant institution. I am delighted that we have been offering technical assistance where appropriate, including in areas such as fiscal transparency and anti-bribery legislation. We have also helped with the establishment of a National Contact Point as part of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to encourage adherence by businesses to international standards of business ethics.</p><p>British companies are being alerted to Colombia's impressive growth rates and by its unwavering commitment to trade liberalization and investor protection. Colombia looks set to become an even better place to do business if, as we hope, the EU-Andean Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is ratified over the coming months and as the Pacific Alliance trading bloc continues to develop. Given this encouraging backdrop, it is perhaps little surprise that overall trade between our two countries reached a record level of £1.68 billion in 2011 and UK exports of goods and services to Colombia rose by 45% compared to 2010.</p><p>The UK is the second largest investor in Colombia after the US, with recorded investments of over $5 billion over the last 10 years. This investment is primarily concentrated in the services, beverages, and extractive (oil and mining) sectors. Many of the British companies present in Colombia are seen as pioneers in responsible business practices, and we will continue to offer support to their efforts. The UK is also funding a number of projects involving UK companies and local NGOs to promote and implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.</p><p>We are also working intensively to develop links in areas where growing Colombian demand matches UK technical or commercial expertise. One is in science and innovation, where we have signed a number of agreements to promote collaboration in sectors such as technology transfer, energy, and health. This is supported by an intensive program of activity to facilitate exchanges of students and staff between our universities—Colombia will support 1,000 (increasing to 1,500) Colombian PhD students per year as part of its “Science without Frontiers" program, and the UK is a target destination.</p><p>A second relates to green growth, where President Santos' long-term low carbon development plan fits well with UK expertise in areas such as transport, construction, agriculture, and energy.</p><p>Finally, we are helping to bring UK infrastructure companies to Colombia to see for themselves its huge potential as the Colombian government looks to invest $60 billion in this area over the next eight years. Our Colombian colleagues have already shown strong interest in our experience as highlighted by the transformation of the previously derelict and contaminated area of London that became the host and showcase for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>We have significantly expanded the British Embassy in Bogotá to deepen our relations in areas such as infrastructure, science and innovation, and green growth. But we need to do more. Given Colombia's openness, tremendous resources, and relative ease of doing business, I want to see more UK companies, research institutions, and universities make Colombia a priority for international engagement. The opportunities for UK business are huge.</p><p>Broadening our range of activity does not mean that we have turned our backs on the types of engagement that have long been central to our relationship with Colombia. Our important collaboration on counter-narcotics work continues to deliver results, and we are pleased to support the Colombian government's initiative to share its expertise with other countries affected by the illegal drugs trade.</p><p>Human rights also remain an important part of our dialogue with the Colombian government. We welcome the steps taken so far by President Santos, particularly the passing of a law to return land to its rightful owners and provide compensation to victims, as well as proposals to improve protection for human rights activists and trade unionists. We will continue to assist the Colombian authorities in their efforts to tackle the remaining human rights issues and to implement the new laws.</p><p>The changing climate in Colombia is perhaps most perfectly embodied by President Santos' courageous decision to launch a peace process with the FARC rebels. This brings the hope of peace to all Colombians and reaffirms Colombia's commitment to transformation after many years of internal conflict. As Prime Minister David Cameron has said, the UK stands ready to draw on its experience to assist, including by sharing experience from the Northern Ireland peace process. Colombia's consistently strong economic growth and successes by the armed forces create a favorable climate for the talks. And while significant challenges remain, President Santos can count on the full support of the UK and the wider international community in this important effort.</p><p>The Colombia of today is a place of great dynamism and optimism. It is therefore encouraging that so many influential British people and organizations are overcoming outdated stereotypes about the country and are finding such imaginative opportunities for collaboration. The UK government will do all that it can to facilitate further such exchanges and to support President Santos in his drive to transform Colombia. Given how much we have achieved over the last two years, it is clear that we have only just scratched the surface of the wealth of opportunities that exist for us to work together.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main factors behind EGE Haina's impressive revenues in 2011?</h4><p>The company has invested in technologies that allow us to generate energy more efficiently. I think that has been the key to our success, and although we are still burning oil, we are burning it in a very efficient manner. Additionally, the company has invested in building a coal facility that was a part of the acquisition when we purchased shares of the company from the state in 1999. We now have a coal plant that allows us to divorce ourselves somewhat from oil. In 2011, EGE Haina installed the first wind farm in the Dominican Republic. That shows our commitment to continuing our investment in energy despite the challenges that are associated with doing business here in the energy sector, as well as our focus on renewables as a way for the Dominican Republic to, as whole, reduce its dependency on imported oil. In December 2011 we kicked off the construction of a new plant, which will be a duel-fuel plant burning either oil or natural gas. That will give us the flexibility to use the best-priced commodity at the time.</p><h4>What is the potential for wind energy in the country?</h4><p>We inaugurated the first phase of Los Cocos in October 2011. It was a 25-megawatt (MW) power plant investment of over $100 million. This investment has been very successful. We are meeting our production expectations and continue to see good results from the wind farms. For that reason, and because the wind resources in this area are world class, the company decided to expand the wind park. We are investing another $100 million to expand the capacity of the plant to 77 MW because we already have the infrastructure. In the first phase we had to put in the infrastructure of transmission lines and substations, and we had to do some roadwork, but that is already in place. Now it is just a matter of the wind turbines and some internal roadwork to the wind park. That allows us to grow incrementally with marginal investment. As a matter of fact, we are installing 52 MW for the same price that we were producing 25 MW before, so that helps us tremendously.</p><div class="quote">“We inaugurated the first phase of Los Cocos in October 2011. It was a 25-MW power plant investment of over $100 million."</div><h4>What are the savings of oil that the country will get from EGE Haina's investments in wind energy?</h4><p>Phase I will probably mean about 200,000 barrels of fuel savings annually. At today's prices of close to $100 per barrel, that is $20 million worth of savings. Phase II will be more than that at close to 500,000 barrels worth of savings. More importantly, however, is the CO2 emissions savings. We are saving 70,000 tons of CO2 emissions in Phase I and double that for Phase II at 150,000 tons. These are very significant savings and this is very good for the environment, too. Those are the kind of non-monetary results that are also present.</p><h4>What factors led to your technological partnership with Vestas and Gamesa?</h4><p>We are using the latest technology of both Vestas and Gamesa, and we have extremely good relationships with both companies. We now have a year of operation with Vestas wind turbines under our belt, and they are performing remarkably well. We have nothing but good things to say about our relationship with Vestas and how they have supported us during the construction and operation phases. For Phase II the company selected Gamesa for a variety of reasons, not least because we enjoyed a very positive experience with them during the construction phase. The engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract was made with Cobra, a Spanish company and member of the ACS Group. Cobra has done both EPC and provided the expertise that it has from its installations in Europe. It provided a high-quality installation that was completed on schedule. EGE Haina had no experience in wind farming in the country, so our partners brought experience with them and this knowledge transfer gave us the confidence to initiate Phase II. The target date for the beginning of Phase II is December 2012.</p><h4>What special challenges has the company faced in establishing the first wind farm in the country?</h4><p>Being the first there is always some fear and uncertainty, and unfortunately people play up those fears. These investments are challenging because you do not have local experience to point to. Now that the wind farm is operational, we have even taken those who are critical of the noise or wind power equipment out to see the farm itself. One particular reporter asked for a hammock to go to sleep because he loved the sound that the turbines make. This shows that those kinds of fears were hard to overcome at first. By working with the community and explaining the benefits we overcame this challenge, and were able to build the wind turbines. Quelling the community's fears and uncertainties was the biggest challenge that we faced.</p><h4>EGE Haina is planning to make a large investment in two plants in Quisqueya, including the Pueblo Viejo mine. How significant is this investment to the company?</h4><p>This is the most important electricity project in the recent history of the Dominican Republic. For us it is a tremendous source of pride that Barrick Gold has chosen EGE Haina as the partner to operate its power plants. EGE Haina will be operating its 215-MW power plant. This arrangement will also allow us to operate another power plant that it bought in Monte Rio as well serve as the operator for the transmission line and the substations—everything on the electric side outside of the mine. For EGE Haina this is an acknowledgement of our strategy for many years of training our employees to do things right. After visiting our plants, Barrick Gold indicated that it wanted us to be its partner on the electrical side. Once it committed the investment for the mine, we decided to build a duplicate power plant. We invested $300 million to build a plant right next to it that is identical, but is to be dedicated to supplying power to the electrical grid. In the last 10 years we have been growing, and we have not had significant investments in the electrical sector, only minor ones. Cocos I, Cocos II, and Quisqueya II are the first big investments in the electrical sector. Quisqueya I is power that is not going to be drawn from the system, so in some ways it adds to the available power because it is not going to be taken out. It will be supplied by Barrick Gold, and we are very proud to be a part of those investments.</p><h4>What were the main advantages that EGE Haina offered to Barrick Gold?</h4><p>We have 12 years of operating experience in the Dominican Republic. The company has very well-trained technicians that make very efficient use of the engines. We have demonstrated that we can maintain and operate a power plant to world-class standards. As I always say, I invite anyone to come and see our power plants, and I could put our power plants up against any in the world—we are a world-class operator.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Inatur's landmark achievements as it approaches its fourth anniversary?</h4><p>We've been in the industry for a long time, albeit under different names. Our biggest achievement is having exposed Mozambique to the international market as a credible tourism investment destination. However, Inatur can't take all of the credit for that as merit has to be given to the whole private sector, since it is marketing the country. Inatur is the official promoter, and its goal is to facilitate the entry of tourists and investors to the country. It also helps small Mozambican tour operators enter the market. At Inatur, we want to give pride and ownership to the Mozambican people. The tourism industry was historically run by the Portuguese and South Africans, but we are encouraging Mozambicans to take a role in the sector. We have been trying our best to make tourism an important industry for the economy.</p><h4>How has Inatur's portfolio increased over the past few years?</h4><p>Inatur was created mainly to market Mozambique as a tourist destination. However, over the years there was a need to incorporate more roles into Inatur, thus the change of name. Energy and mineral resources are very important for economic growth, but one should bear in mind that natural resources will finish one day, while tourism is a sustainable industry that will always be there. I believe that tourism and mineral resource development will grow together hand in hand.</p><div class="quote">“We see a high number of visitors coming from neighboring countries... as well as Portugal due to cultural and historical ties."</div><h4>Which international markets have the most potential for companies coming to invest as well as incoming tourists?</h4><p>We see a high number of visitors coming from neighboring countries to visit friends and relatives, as well as Portugal due to cultural and historical ties. Lately, we have seen an increased number of inbound tourists coming from Western Europe as well as the BRIC nations. The main tools we use to penetrate these markets are participating in travel shows, organizing road shows for B2B meetings, producing marketing material, as well as going to conferences. These have been the main tools. We also use our embassies as a vehicle to distribute information. Additionally, Inatur works with public relations companies that are contracted to work in China and Germany. An official from the Ministry of Tourism has just been dispatched to Brazil, and one will be dispatched to China in the next six months. We also have a tourism official at our embassy in London. Arrival numbers have been increasing, even in years when Europe has been hit by recession. Global arrival numbers have been up due in part to marketing efforts, but as well as the stability that we enjoy. The natural beauty of the country is also an asset.</p><h4>Have you seen an increased investor appetite for tourism since the discovery of coal and gas?</h4><p>We have noticed a 50% jump in demand since the discovery. We have developed a project to capitalize on the investments in the areas closest to the coal and gas, as there is an inherent lack of infrastructure in those regions. We have been in contact with various international hotel chains to discuss investments in these areas, although there are also hotels that go straight to regional governors to make deals.</p><h4>How are you working with private investors to establish high-end tourism?</h4><p>It has been the policy of the country to target people with large disposable incomes that arrive in smaller numbers. In the north, there are several small lodges attracting celebrities from Europe and the US looking to escape the limelight. In addition, there is a new trend of travellers wishing to combine bush and beach tourism. That will be the future of this country.</p><h4>What initiatives have you taken to promote sustainable, eco-friendly projects?</h4><p>As an institution like this, we promote investment opportunities to investors for them to either go it alone or to partner with others. In our experience, for ecotourism projects, investors usually partner with local communities, and that is very good. For example, locals can see an elephant as a source of food, whereas the partnership can teach them that the elephant can be an attraction that brings income and, in turn, reduces poaching.</p><h4>How are you working with USAID? What are your main priorities?</h4><p>A project was initiated by USAID in 2006. In the beginning, it was to provide a backbone for us to develop our tourism sector. It comprised of three phases. First, it helped us to identify the potential areas for investment and set out a development plan for infrastructure. Second, it created a master plan for our tourism sector, which is ongoing. Finally, it began attracting investors. It has actually been a lengthy exercise. We have declared seven sites as “tourist interest zones" for integrated development resorts comprising of hotels, airstrips, malls, restaurants, casinos, and golf courses as well as other tourist attractions. We are trying to diversify as much as possible so more people can be involved in each project, which also alleviates risk.</p><h4>What have the main challenges been?</h4><p>Lately, everyone has been talking about Mozambique due to the resource boom; however, there is a lack of infrastructure in the country. You can have pristine beaches and crystal clear waters, but you need infrastructure. We are not only attracting investors to build hotels, but also attracting companies to invest in infrastructure that the government is not able to provide.</p><h4>How do you facilitate the training of human capital?</h4><p>Inatur is a small entity. In a huge country, we can't be everywhere that we are needed. We partner with the private sector to coordinate training. In addition, we have been dealing with international donor organizations, which fund our training initiatives, as well as partnering with local universities and several public hotel schools, one of which is under our supervision. Mozambique has only been independent for 37 years. All of the foreigners managing the tourism industry left the country. With more and more hotels opening, there is a large human resource gap. In many central Mozambican areas, there are Zimbabweans working in the tourist industry as they are trained in hospitality and speak English. We are all doing our best and in the very near future we will be able to mitigate that gap by getting more Mozambicans into the industry.</p><h4>What are your targets looking forward to the next few years?</h4><p>I would be happy seeing 4 million to 5 million visitors per year being given top-quality service. I would also be happy to see a “Maldives" or “Mauritius" in Mozambique, with people drawn from all over the world. We always aim for the best; all of our efforts are to promote Mozambique to the outside world through our donors, corporations, and embassies. I would also be happy to see repeat tourists, as well as locals enjoying their own country. As much as it is important to attract foreign tourists, it is equally paramount to have Mozambicans be able to go to four- or five-star hotels in their own country. For now, a country like Mozambique does have other priorities, but I believe we are on the right track.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Coca Codo Sinclair project evolved over the last five years?</h4><p>The Ecuadorean Institute of Electrification (INECEL), which today does not exist, started developing this project back in the 1970s. The organization conducted studies on the Coca river valley, as well as a pre-feasibility study. Later on, in 1985, ELC Electroconsult of Italy, with several other consulting firms, carried out feasibility studies in order to develop a potential hydroelectric plant project. It took seven years for the companies to carry out their studies, which ended in 1992. In the late 1990s, INECEL disappeared, and the project fell by the wayside. It was of great satisfaction that President Correa decided to revive the Coca Codo Sinclair project. In 2008, the Coca Codo Sinclair EP enterprise was established as a joint stock company, and one year later it became a state-owned enterprise. In addition, the project got a boost; the same Italian company, ELC Electroconsult, updated all the studies that support the technical feasibility of the project, increasing the initial power of the plant to 1,500 MW, and a contract was signed with China's Sinohydro Corporation in October 2009. A year later a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China was signed, which financed 85% of the entire project, or $1.68 billion. The government of Ecuador financed the remaining 15%, or some $300 million, which was disbursed between 2010 and 2011.</p><h4>What is the current state of development?</h4><p>In 2010 we started constructing the project, and over the last two years we have relocated a section of a heavy crude oil pipeline running through a vital area for our project, and in 2011 we began developing the engineering works, starting construction on the water intake area, powerhouse, and conveyance tunnel. As of today, around 20% of the initial works have been completed. The first tunneling machine is also on site, and we expect a second tunneling machine to arrive soon. Such equipment has an approximate cost of $70 million. The Export-Import Bank of China has already provided $110 million for the project, which is clear proof that it is gaining speed. In addition, all the machinery designs are being prepared right now, and as soon as they are completed, they will be sent to Europe and China, where the machinery for the project will be manufactured.</p><div class="quote">“We are developing a very attractive, sustainable, and economically profitable project for Ecuador."</div><h4>What challenges did the company face when tendering the project to Sinohydro and negotiating the financial agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China?</h4><p>The biggest challenge was to close the deal with Sinohydro from a technical point of view. The talks, which lasted for six months, were very tough due to the language barrier. In fact, communication difficulties are still an important barrier to overcome. The Ministry of Finance was in charge of coming to an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China, and those were also very tough negotiations, especially regarding sovereignty and payment issues. Fortunately, we can say that, as of today, the project is fully financed, and it will be a reality very soon. One of our main duties is to check the strict compliance with technical specifications and deadlines agreed between all the parties in the contracts. Also, I would like to add that the project will have a payback period of 10 years after the plant starts operating.</p><h4>What will Coca Codo Sinclair's grade of responsibility be once the plant becomes operative?</h4><p>In the future, we will be integrated within CELEC EP's activities, and Sinohydro is obliged by contract to train our operators' employees, who in the future will be part of the company. This is part of the technical transference clauses agreed to in the contract. We are mostly talking about engineers in charge of operating and maintaining the plant.</p><h4>What are your views on the criticism the project received?</h4><p>When we updated the studies on the project's technical and economic feasibility back in 2008, we proved that we are developing a very attractive, sustainable, and economically profitable project for Ecuador. This is a so-called “run-of-river" project, and the environmental impact is minimal, for it is not a water impounding dam. Therefore, the project has been developed to generate electricity according to the flow of the river, so we can reach the 1,500 MW capacity when the river carries large flows, which are present for six months a year. During the other six months, the plant will not generate at maximum capacity. All the studies carried out over the years prove that regardless of the season and rain variation over the year, the average production of the plant will be around 8,600 GWh annually. Coca Codo Sinclair is the largest hydroelectric project in Ecuador, and will have one of the lowest levels of environmental impact in the entire country.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ready-to-serve]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Grupo Empresarial Ángeles (GEA) is focused on four sectors: tourism, health, finance, and media. Which of these sectors has the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Every sector has huge potential. In 1996, we redefined our business portfolio in order to participate in the sectors registering strong growth. Mexico has impressive statistics: 50% of the population is under 25 years old, and this demographic bonus foreshadows large expansion in the coming years. Our internal market has very considerable strength. Moreover, the world experienced the birth of a new civilization based on knowledge and education at the beginning of the 1980s, and we compete under these parameters. All the segments of GEA have one common denominator: they all belong to the service sector. We believe that in today's world, the service sector competes through value-added rather than price. Mexico's demography is changing, which will result in the large expansion of the health sector. In terms of finance, Mexico is one of the lowest penetration rates in the world, in terms of the credit portfolio to GDP ratio. Credit penetration in Mexico is approximately 23% of GDP, while other countries in the region such as Chile, Brazil, and Argentina enjoy 50%-70%. We believe that the finance sector in Mexico will continue to grow significantly in the coming years, which puts GEA in a great position. Regarding tourism, Mexico has a very large market. We are next door to one of the largest consumer countries in the world, the US. We have a vast border with the US and a privileged geographical location with natural resources that provide a competitive advantage against other countries in the region. Our fourth area of operation is media—the nervous system of today's society.</p><h4>What are GEA's plans for expansion in the tourism sector?</h4><p>We are building a tourist hotel business with several brands, which gives us a lot of flexibility. Currently, we are operating three brands: Quinta Real, Camino Real, and Real Inn. Quinta Real is a high-class hotel chain that offers service to the most financially elevated sector of the nation. Camino Real has been an emblematic Mexican chain for the past 40 years, and is focused on five-star services. Most executives of other hotel chains in Mexico have operated through Camino Real, a brand that has shaped many people and aspects of the business. Recently, we have decided to enter the four-star segment based on the premise that the business volume is larger. As a result, Real Inn will become the most important Mexican hotel chain owing to its diverse products and concepts. The possibilities of growth are widening; we are motivated to build a strong hotel industry in Mexico.</p><div class="quote">“We believe that in today's world, the service sector competes through value-added rather than price."</div><h4>How many Real Inn hotels do you intend to open?</h4><p>Currently, we have 39 hotels and our plan is to build another 39 over the next three years, around 13 hotels per year. The 39 hotels in operation are five-star quality, and are larger in size, scale and investment. For example, Camino Real Polanco México has 720 rooms. However, Real Inn hotels are rated four-stars, and have 120 rooms. With the mid-size hotel concept, it's easier to increase the number of units.</p><h4>What is your opinion of Mexico's potential to be in the top five countries for tourism?</h4><p>I am fully convinced that Mexico will be in the top five, and I believe that the country has every element necessary to be at the top. The geographical position of the country is a huge advantage. The US plays a very important role in the market, as does Asia. Mexico has a natural disposition toward the services industry, and there is a great variety of tourism options. There are colonial destinations, like Puebla and Oaxaca, where tourists are acquainted with our ancient traditions. Mexico also boasts locations with fantastic weather, such as Acapulco and Cuernavaca, with year-round temperatures that range between 17 °C and 27 °C. We are also seeing increased interest in health tourism. Furthermore, Latin American people are warm, an appealing quality for visitors. In the coming years, we are aiming toward revamping Mexico's image.</p><h4>What are the advantages of incorporating technology into the finance sector?</h4><p>There is a growing world tendency to merge mobile devices such as electronic agendas and cell phones into one device. Technology is allowing finance services to be operated through these devices and is opening up very important opportunities that are transforming the sector. Mobile technology does not require the same infrastructure to make transactions as ATMs, branches, and credit cards. Finance services are reaching remote populations faster and extending the products and services. As participants in the sector, GEA has low costs in infrastructure and thus we can offer lower prices. In late 2011, we released a product called Multiva Touch, an electronic platform. Once the application is installed and synchronized with your device, you can manage a variety of transactions such as monthly utilities and cable television payments, among many others. Our system generates a personal archive to administer personal finances, and we were the first to launch this service. It is also possible to invest by buying and selling foreign currencies. We are aiming to establish our competitive advantage as an innovative bank that can fulfill the needs of the new generation.</p><h4>In what ways have you transformed Mexico's private health practice?</h4><p>It is with great pride that we have been involved in healthcare developments. When we started in 1986, we acquired our first hospital from the Humana chain. At the time, the market penetration of private insurance in Mexico was very low. Private health services had little penetration because few people were insured, and no hospitals provided private service. As our presence in the sector grew, we began to contribute to the culture of health insurance. In the 1980s, people with more limited resources would seek treatment in Mexico, whereas people from higher income groups sought treatment in the US. We worked to transform this trend and nurture trust in Mexico's health services. Currently, more people are seeking services in the country in terms of cost and quality; many now prefer the warmth of Mexico's medical attention.</p><h4>What is the role of health tourism in your hospitals?</h4><p>The interest in health tourism is growing. We are building hospitals near the border, in locations such as Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, Texas, Tampico, and Torreón. Hence, we provide a belt of services close to both markets. As the market grows, so does our confidence; we see demand for elective operations such as plastic surgery and bariatric surgery. Obesity is a significant problem in the US—the treatment is very expensive and it is not covered by health insurance. The cost in the US for a number of operations could be $25,000. In Tijuana, the same procedure could be carried out for $7,000. Mexico represents a strong alternative for elective operations that are not naturally covered by health insurance.</p><h4>How has Excélsior evolved since GEA acquired it?</h4><p>Excélsior is a historical newspaper established 95 years ago. It is our social responsibility to preserve, improve, and direct the paper. In the communications sector, changes are happening at a rapid pace. We have tactically decided to transform GEA into a content factory to increase our competitive advantage. We are the only business that is producing fiction, apart from Televisa and TV Azteca. We have already produced several relatively successful series in order to produce television that enlightens people and contributes to the development of an intelligent, open-minded society. We publish material related to drug use, sex, and gender, and are unafraid to tackle taboo topics.</p><h4>Do you have agreements with foreign channels?</h4><p>We have been co-producing with Televen (Venezuela) and Caracol (Colombia), and we are also looking into to form partnerships with other Latin American companies. We need to produce programming designed to fill Mexican screens and export to other nations. Building alliances with foreign TV channels that share our vision feeds into our goals for growth.</p><h4>What is GEA's vision for the future?</h4><p>In the next decade, we intend to consolidate the sectors in which we participate. In the next five years, we will gain new access to the domestic market and develop routes for international expansion. There are a number of mature sectors that are ready for expansion, such as tourism and health. We are working toward gaining local acquisitions from Spain and Latin America.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

It was with this recognition that Mozambique established the Ministry of Science and Technology in 2005. Our main job is to make sure that scientific knowledge and technology are being strengthened to support national development programs. We say that science and technology are the first productive forces, meaning that whatever production you want to undertake, you always need support from science. In this regard, we have four major areas of operation: scientific research, innovation and intellectual property, ICT, and technology development and transfer. Technology transfer does not only mean a transfer between countries or continents; it also means within the country between districts and provinces. Our fifth area of interest is what we call the management of science. The country is vast, so we had to establish a countrywide system of science, technology, and innovation. That started here in the capital and has spread into three regional zones. The first zone covers the northern part of the country, which includes Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and Niassa, and is home to the Regional Center for Science and Technology, which is based in Nampula. Its purpose is to make sure that all of our policies and strategies are well handled at the regional level. In each province we have what we call a Delegation of Science and Technology. In each district we have education, youth, and technology services. We combine the job of three ministries in one entity to make sure that we harmonize the process at the operational level and avoid duplication. The central zone of our reach covers Tete, Zambezia, Manica, and Sofala, and is based in Tete. The southern zone is based in Xai-Xai City of Gaza Province, and it covers Maputo, Gaza, and Inhambane.</p><h4>What are the main challenges with regard to implementing this policy?</h4><p>We are presently confronted with four challenges. The first challenge is that we need to consolidate our science, technology, and innovation systems. We consider institutions of higher learning and research, as well as communities with special indigenous knowledge that we want to bring together, as pillars to consolidate and improve our work. This is a huge challenge because we need to ensure that we have the platforms and facilities that will allow our researchers to be able to do their jobs. The Science and Technology Park is an example of a platform where activities are happening related to the implementation of our national Science, Technology, and Innovation Strategy. New research centers and laboratories are also platforms that will allow us to develop more knowledge about the resources we have.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique is one of the few countries in the world where the top management spends time on science and technology."</div><h4>How is the Ministry working to build human capital?</h4><p>This is the second big challenge we face—the establishment of human capital resources. We have started a program that aims to increase the number of scientists in Mozambique at the level of Master's and PhD to 6,500 by 2025. Since 2006-2007, it has been very important to develop a plan that helps us develop knowledge in different areas. By 2025, we will increase the number of scientists that can contribute to our larger goal. At the moment, we have around 1,500 researchers present in our research and higher education institutions, excluding the administrative staff. We want our scientists to be working constantly to improve seeds, soil, and irrigation systems, for example. This is a very important program for us, and so we decided to undertake it in three dimensions. We are collaborating with partner countries to offer more scholarships and send people abroad. Secondly, we are mobilizing our resources to help our academic institutions in the country as they work toward obtaining Master's degree and PhD graduates. Thirdly, we invite institutions from abroad to establish branches here and make a contribution. Sending people overseas is useful, but the number of people we are able to send is small. Hence, it is very important to ensure that we can cover more people than the few who have the chance to go abroad, for which the expenses are very high. This program has gone very well. Another challenge is that the country has to generate R&amp;D-originated funds. To this end, the cabinet established the National Research Fund and called for proposals based on strategic areas. We then defined “Strategic Areas" and “Strategic Objectives" in the Mozambique Science Technology and Innovation Strategy, which we designed in 2006. There are 10 Strategic Objectives, and 14+2 Strategic Areas. We do not call them priority areas on purpose; we use the term strategic because we are looking for ways to add value. Agriculture, marine sciences, mineral resources, energy, water, human resource development, and education are strategic areas. There are also five areas that we call “cross-cutting strategic areas" such as environmental protection and the struggle against HIV. These are areas of research that we believe will cut across other segments and create a spillover effect. ICT and biotechnology/biosciences (including nanotechnology) are “enabling areas." These two major fields of operation will provide support to other areas of development. The National Research Fund helps the strategic areas gain support from the work scientists will carry out.</p><h4>Is the strategy open to international research organizations, or is it designed specifically for local institutions?</h4><p>To begin with, we are very interested in promoting the National Research Institutions, but that does not mean that the Eduardo Mondlane University, for example, cannot submit a joint proposal with Cambridge University. What we want to know is how much your work will contribute to a specific goal that we have set.</p><h4>What is the size of the fund?</h4><p>In 2006, expenditure for R&amp;D (GERD) was around 0.2% of GDP, and now we are close to 1%. We are currently analyzing the possibility that very successful programs could pay back the original investment. Instead of giving funds away, we may be able to get some back and consequently increase the number of people with access to the resources. We have offered more than 100 grants so far.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's role in promoting innovation?</h4><p>We finance innovators and ideas through what we call the National Program for Innovations. If someone comes to us and says there is a problem in the health sector in remote rural areas, it could be very difficult to take someone to hospital, but innovative equipment could help. There are some inventions in this field that we have sponsored, and a program of work has followed. In all parts of our system, we have people seeking innovators. As soon as we identify an innovation, we offer a small grant that can help convert the idea into a product. Companies are helping innovators transform their prototypes into commercial products. We are generating wealth based on this concept, which is great.</p><h4>How will the Science and Technology Park encourage industrial and economic crossover?</h4><p>The project is focused on three very important areas. The first area is the R&amp;D process, which is mainly practical-oriented research that brings about useful results. Master's degree and PhD students are encouraged to undertake research projects and design models with practical implications, which can be adjusted to their own companies. Some will be very successful, but others will need to be incubated. Therefore, we have an incubation program that supports students as they convert their knowledge into products, services, and start-up companies. Entrepreneurship is very important. The third step is to create an environment that is conducive for those companies to flourish in. We do this by reserving part of the space for young people, but also by bringing some already established companies in to create a Silicon Valley-type model. Big names such as Oracle and Microsoft have already expressed their eagerness to join. At the national level, we have a number of organizations and even banks that are interested in establishing operations inside the Science Park. We have established a partnership with the government of India, investing over $25 million to establish the Technology and Innovation Development Center. This will be the anchor of the whole process, and before the end of 2012 the inauguration will take place, making the center fully operational. The government created a company that will oversee the center's operations, but the implementation of activities, such as the R&amp;D incubators, will be done under a public and private partnership framework. The company will invite partners who are interested in working with us on those different areas.</p><h4>Internet penetration is still low at 6%-7%, but it has shown substantial growth over the past few years. What would you say were the key factors behind this?</h4><p>Mozambique is one of the few countries in the world where the top management spends time on science and technology issues. The President, Armando Guebuza, is a patron of science, which means he is very aware of the field. He contributes his experience and knowledge, and this is very important. Technology-related issues are embedded in our development programs. For example, in 2000 we approved the ICT Policy and in 2002 we approved the ICT Policy Strategy. This means that 10 to 12 years ago we were already defining our priorities in terms of penetration and accessibility. Accessibility means reach, but we also focus on getting access to the technology itself by installing computers. Human resources development is not a new issue, and that is why we were one of the very first countries in Africa to gain access to the internet. We have a strategic view—you cannot drive a car if you do not have roads. It is very important that before you dream of having internet in a district that you develop connectivity there. All of our provinces and nearly 50 districts are wired with fiber optics now. Almost 80%-90% are connected to wireless infrastructure with the capacity to provide an internet connection. The so-called “last mile" connection is our challenge. The government has established Community Multi-Media Centers (CMCs) because we want to make sure that in every district, even if someone does not have a computer, they can still enjoy the technology. The Ministry is also ensuring that at the provincial level we have platforms. We have established what we call Provincial Centers for Digital Resources (CPRDs). People can use these centers to send an e-mail or research training resources, for instance. In the CMCs we have installed computers, and people enjoy being able to communicate and send messages through this technology.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Millennium bim developed to become Mozambique's leading bank?</h4><p>Millennium bim began operations in 1995, and in the beginning we were a 50% Portuguese, 50% Mozambican-owned financial institution. We were the pioneers of banking in Mozambique, because when we started initial operations in 1995 the banking system, as we know it, did not exist here. There were three institutions: Millennium, the state-owned commercial bank, and one private Western bank. We introduced IT solutions for banking, focusing on our clients' needs, as well as ATMs and POS machines. Millennium bim was the first bank in Mozambique that segmented its clients into markets—affluent mass-market clients, corporate clients, and so on—in order to better assess their needs. We started with three branches, two in Maputo and one in Beira, linked online. Within two years, we managed to cover all provinces with our branches. At the turn of the century, Millennium bim began to penetrate rural areas to provide micro-financing opportunities. Today, we continue to expand our business and now have 150 branches throughout the country. We continue to open branches in remote areas of Mozambique, which is not easy, but is a necessity.</p><h4>To what extent do you have to provide infrastructure for rural branches?</h4><p>The three main elements we need are electricity, roads, and communications. Usually, we follow the infrastructure. We will follow a large corporation into a remote area because it will build its own infrastructure that can accommodate a small branch bank. The opportunity to have clients or business is there, so we do not hesitate. Some of these branches are not immediately profitable, but we feel we have the obligation or duty to open in these rural locations to help develop the economy in poorer places.</p><div class="quote">“Millennium bim hit the mark of 136 branches in 2011, with a target of 166 branches in 2012."</div><h4>To what do you attribute 50% year—on—year growth between 2010 and 2011?</h4><p>Initiative and modernity. We introduced a new way of doing banking in Mozambique, and because of this we convinced the market that the best way of banking is with Millennium bim. We are the only bank in Mozambique to have a call center and offer telephone banking, which is another advantage. The internet and telephone banking options allow SMEs to deal with the market using these instruments. In 2011, our performance was impressive and some indicators illustrate this fact. Our return on equity (ROE) achieved 38.8%, and this was underpinned by an increase in net income of 79%. This enabled an increase in shareholders' equity by $109 million, achieving the mark of $406 million. The bank improved its efficiency as depicted by the fall in the cost-to-income ratio from 44.7% in 2011 to 39.4% in 2012. The success was due to a tremendous effort to position Millennium bim's brand, product, and service innovation in a bid to tailor offerings to customer needs. As a result, funding from deposits increased by 36%, whereas credit hiked by 19%, implying a loan-to-deposit ratio of 75%. Millennium bim hit the mark of 136 branches in 2011, with a target of 166 branches in 2012. Our success stems from our commitment to place customer satisfaction at the forefront, while striking a balance between the country's development goals and the profit equation. To a large extent, our shareholders' commitment to the country's development has been crucial in consolidating Millennium bim's position in the market place.</p><h4>What is your client portfolio breakdown?</h4><p>It is mostly retail, but we are not only doing retail banking. Millennium bim has a very good department for corporate banking as well as for investment banking. In terms of volume of money, corporate banking is more important. However, for the number of operations, retail banking is more important.</p><h4>What role does Millennium bim play in developing the maturation of financial markets and investment banking?</h4><p>We do not have a strong stock market here, but the only bank that fully operates in the stock market is Millennium bim. If we stopped operations, there would likely be no stock market. We are not listed on the local stock exchange, although we are listed in Europe. Investment in Mozambique mostly comes through government bonds and bonds issued by the Bank of Mozambique, although the environment for corporate bonds is also good.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the insurance sector in Mozambique?</h4><p>It is growing well, and there are many companies coming to Mozambique. When we started in 1995 there were only two companies and now there are more than 10. This is due to the larger number of businesses now operating in Mozambique. The majority of the companies have come from South Africa.</p><h4>How significant is micro finance to Millennium's portfolio?</h4><p>It is performing very well and it is significant for our operations. After we decided to pursue it, other micro-finance institutions emerged in Mozambique. Micro credit makes up about 37% of our portfolio, and we control the largest slice of the market.</p><h4>How is Millennium bim working to attract more SMEs?</h4><p>Millennium bim does not have a policy of financing SMEs with low-interest credit, though we are trying to build an institution that will fund enterprises through micro financing. We are trying to find another instrument to better suit the needs of this segment of the market, and are looking at international and local organizations. At Millennium bim, we think SME financing is very important, because for this country to be stable we need to create a middle class. To create a middle class, you need to create financing for SMEs and the people who do business informally. This economy is supported by the formal sector, but it is spread out. Our policy in starting up with micro finance was to transform the informal sector into a formal sector. We wanted to create a micro-finance institution to finance these companies, creating new clients when they become formalized. At Millennium bim, we will transform the quality of our clients, and in so doing transform the middle class in Mozambique. All the major enterprises that come in to pursue mining and mineral resources need to deal with SMEs to operate.</p><h4>Looking at the corporate side of the business, are your clients mostly Mozambican, or are you working with international companies as well?</h4><p>We have some international companies from Portugal and South Africa, though we do not have any of the big corporations yet. Millennium bim offers factoring, leasing, various kinds of credit, currency accounts, debt financing for assets, and trade financing.</p><h4>Which sectors do you see the most growth?</h4><p>Mining is very important, though I also foresee a lot growth in agriculture, agribusiness, transport, communications, and electricity generation and distribution. The primary sector in extractive industries and investments in gas and power will lead the growth ladder in the medium term, while the requirement to build infrastructure is another turning point. Non-concessional loans have been capped at $1.5 billion for government projects, though it was previously limited to $900 million. While this is true in the capital-intensive sector, the country is bound to witness greater developments in the construction, logistics and transport, hospitality, industry, and agro-business sectors, following new trade orientation to serve the needs of other emerging countries for coal, gas, and raw materials.</p><h4>What is your strategy for 2013?</h4><p>We are a retail banking operation, and I think it is important to grow as a retail bank. However, it is important that we face the growth of the market, which has been enhanced by investments in the mineral sector. We will have to focus more on the corporate side. Another segment that is very important in the future will be prestige branches. We have been servicing individuals with very large assets, and many Mozambicans are becoming wealthier. Retail, corporate, and prestige banking are going to be our focus at Millennium bim.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Claro recently launched operations in Colombia, following the union of Comcel and Telmex. What have been the major advantages of this merger?</h4><p>We have made a statement to the market that has been clearly recognized by consumers, the industry of telecommunications is evolving into a new era of convergence, which is a worldwide trend. Everybody understands that telecommunications is a critical sector; it extends into many other segments of the economy and supports productivity. In that sense, consumers have started to see that the company is blending fixed networks, such as internet subscriptions and TV services, with mobile services, which shows the strength of our business and the power of telecommunications for the future of our country. The union seems to be working well for us and the change was very fast—the morning after the announcement, consumers saw that over 3,000 points of sale of Comcel and Telmex had changed to Claro. It is easier for the consumer to jump on to what's next instead of waffling back and forth. The merger introduced an international perspective to Colombia. Today, people recognize that there is a wider telecommunications world beyond the local players. Currently, the company has subscribed close to 37 million clients.</p><h4>What new products are you planning to launch in the short term, and what are the advantages of Multiplay?</h4><p>We are making all of the investments required to combine the two networks into a single network. It does take a significant amount of work to make sure the components are compatible to provide convergent services. We have done a soft launch to test quadruple play, which was historically known as triple play, a TV offer subscription with a phone and home internet service packaged together with the mobile internet offer. The program is fairly robust at the moment; we cover 100% of the counties of the country.</p><div class="quote">“The telecommunications sector has the opportunity to become much more robust and a driver of development for the country."</div><h4>What is your pre-paid to post-paid ratio, and how is that changing?</h4><p>It is changing slowly. Currently, 85% of the market is pre-paid, which is a reflection of the price sensitivity of the consumer. It is important to be price conscience for the Colombian consumer. The other 15% is post-paid, but that ratio is growing slowly. There is a huge amount of consumers that consider switching to post-paid services, and their credit history is adequate. Additionally, the demand for data services is a driver that is further developing our post-paid offer.</p><h4>What makes the Colombian consumer unique?</h4><p>Colombian consumers are heavy mobile services users. They use voice services for about twice as long as anyone else in the region. This comes combined with the fact that we offer almost the lowest tariffs per minute worldwide.</p><h4>What is your average revenue per user (ARPU)?</h4><p>ARPU is roughly $11, which is one of the lowest in the region. This is because people talk a lot for little. However, this characteristic of the company has attracted 37 million consumers.</p><h4>What has been the significance of 3G for Colombia?</h4><p>We have 3G coverage in almost every location nationwide. Claro has decided to extend that coverage to even the smallest towns. Although not a huge percentage of voice traffic has shifted to the 3G network, the demand for data services has evolved away from the 2G network. Considering the case of Bogotá, we are seeing about 50% of traffic going through the 3G network. This is happening as people update their technology and handsets. Therefore, we are doubling the amount of data we carry through the 3G network month after month.</p><h4>What is your outlook regarding 4G services?</h4><p>There is a great deal of contention surrounding 4G. There are many proposals from our competitors, and recent reports show huge potential. Everyone is aware that internet and broadband services outside the home are happening through the mobile world. However, we also need to provide fixed internet for people who demand the highest quality. The vast majority of consumers are demanding these services, and there is an incredibly powerful plan from the government to make this happen. Regardless, many different companies need to come to Colombia, invest in the country, and enjoy the legal stability we have enjoyed in the past few years. Our outlook is that the implementation of 4G will be the Ministry's decision. Our infrastructure is ranked third in the region, behind Brazil and Chile. The telecommunications infrastructure is one of the few aspects of the country that is not falling behind that of other countries in region. I am positive about the next five years—4G needs to happen, but sometimes decisions take a long time to make. The authorities discuss the issue and forget that 47 million users are waiting for a resolution. In the end, the service will be for the people and the users, not the government, so we are pushing for the process to move more quickly.</p><h4>What financial performance are you expecting for 2012 compared to last year?</h4><p>In 2011, our service revenue grew by around 10%-11%. This is significantly higher than the growth of the country's economy. There is huge demand for the services we provide. We are seeing that consumers demand more communications technology, which we struggle to provide because we lack different spectrums. 4G needs to be applied as soon as possible, so that we can provide higher-quality services at a faster pace. The demand for data is growing, and has reached about 17%-18% of our daily revenue.</p><h4>What is your vision for the ICT sector and Claro in the medium term?</h4><p>We definitely believe that the industry can become a locomotive for the economy. The telecommunications sector has the opportunity to become much more robust and a driver of development for the country. What we have been creating is a think tank for the telecommunications industry. The size of the market is an invitation for competition. If the conditions in the country are maintained and we don't change the rules of the game, people will continue to invest. I believe that we will start to see a more competitive environment. The country welcomes investment and seeks to ensure that there is always competition to drive the quality of services up. Claro will continue to push and compete, just as we have done over the past 18 years. We will do everything possible to maintain the leadership position that we have today.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the FDI environment developed recently?</h4><p>There has been a slowdown in terms of new FDI because of various policies. However, there are some transactions happening elsewhere, through a different kind of FDI. We have seen investment in some mature industries. For example, there have been several high-level acquisitions, and, despite being worried, Canadian and US companies are still investing in the mining sector. There is also a housing boom in Ecuador because of government spending.</p><h4>How is the financial sector responding to the country's situation?</h4><p>The financial sector is responding well. Before dollarization we had a big crisis—a banking crisis—and the reason was because there was so much money in circulation and the banks became used to making more money on foreign exchange trading than actually lending. In the first quarter of 1999, the banks made 85% of their profits on foreign exchange. Then, when the crisis hit, 70% of the banking system went bankrupt. Dollarization was then imposed in Ecuador and adopted by the Ecuadorean people, who didn't want to have their savings in the sucre, the former currency. The banks then couldn't play in the foreign exchange trade anymore, so they had to adapt to borrowing and lending, and making money on margins. Right now the banking system is much more professional than it used to be.</p><div class="quote">“Ecuador is an exotic country where the risks are higher and so are the returns on investment."</div><h4>How do you assess the new laws regarding competition and the capital markets?</h4><p>Ecuador needs a competition law and antitrust law. There are many businesses that are vertically integrated that can get away with murder. The problem is that there is too much discretion, so the government has made a law that can be better interpreted. Ecuador is also desperate for a real capital markets law. One of the problems in the Ecuadorean capital markets—in addition to economic policies—is that there has been overregulation.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities for investors in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador is an exotic country where the risks are higher and so are the returns on investment, if you are able to manage the risks. There are many opportunities beyond oil and mining, such as in industry and commerce. We have recently seen the entrance of Sherwin-Williams, Arca, and QBE. These are interesting times, and prices are low, which means that many assets are undervalued. For big multinationals, the risks are not that large. People focus too much on oil and mining, where the investments are huge, but in Ecuador there are other opportunities.</p><h4>What has led to growth in the insurance sector?</h4><p>There are several reasons. First of all, the Ecuadorean market has grown and today it is worth $1.3 billion, which is one of its main points of attractiveness. Secondly, the sector has benefitted from dollarization. There are not yet many multinationals, and the ones that decide to enter now will find a clear landscape and many opportunities. There are opportunities to enter a market that's not saturated and make big profits. New products can also be introduced, especially in life insurance.</p><h4>How would you describe Analytica and its strengths?</h4><p>Analytica is the only investment bank in Ecuador. We do debt restructuring, research, M&amp;As, and trading. We are independent and don't belong to any financial group, and this fact allows us to work with everyone. Analytica is a financial institution with the best research department in the country. It is private and very profitable. We are becoming the main advisors in restructuring, securities, and securitizations, and we are still experts in Ecuadorean external debt, though this is now a very small focus.</p><h4>How do you gain the confidence of your clients?</h4><p>We have to convince boards of directors about the reasons why Ecuador is a good investment. We did a study on Venezuela that demonstrated that despite the left-wing government, Coca-Cola is still the leader in that market. Here in Ecuador, if we take the example of the mining sector, we see new regulations in place that can be taught over time, but at least they exist, and the investors know what to work toward. In that regard, the perceived risk in the country is bigger than the real risk. This is what we explain to investors. Additionally, we have carried out weekly studies for over 10 years. Ours is one of the most credible economic publications that Ecuador has. We have been very honest since the beginning about external debt, and that has given us a lot of credibility.</p><h4>What can you say about Analytica's team?</h4><p>When Eduardo Checa, former Country Manager of ING Bank Ecuador and Analytica's CEO, joined in 2006, he helped us to grow, institutionalize the company, and make it more professional. We have an excellent young executive group of people, as well as directors with a very good reputation in the market. Our internships have a lot of prestige, and many people go from here to Fletcher, which is part of Harvard University. Our idea is to maintain first-rate people.</p><h4>How do you see Analytica's future over the medium term?</h4><p>We stayed in the country as an investment bank when others left, and so we are a reference in the country. We are expanding in Latin America and seeking the opportunity to do business in the US and South America. We are waiting for pending local authorization to bring mining companies to Ecuador. Also, we have enough influence and prestige, though we are extremely ethical, to get access, achieve successful deals, and manage investor risk better than anyone.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What monetary policies has the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) implemented in recent years and what elements have contributed to economic stability?</h4><p>The international economic crisis that began in 2008 caused a significant slowdown in global economic activity, which, combined with restrictions on capital flows, raised the need for a change in economic policies across the world. The spillover effect at the international level impacted the performance of major economies and, more noticeably, the eurozone. In this regard, in line with what happened in developed economies and in most of Latin America, the Dominican Republic implemented counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies in order to stimulate economic growth in the short term in a low-inflation environment. In effect, from 2009, given the unfavorable external situation, the CBDR adopted a more flexible monetary policy, reducing its monetary policy rate (MPR) by 550 basis points to lower the overnight rate from 9.5% to 4.0%, and decreased the reserve requirements ratio by 2.5 percentage points. The expansionary monetary policy measures were accompanied by a strong fiscal stimulus during 2H2009 and 1H2010. Public spending also increased, particularly investment, as part of the macroeconomic strategy defined in the IMF Stand-by Agreement. These measures had the expected effect, stimulating consumption and investment in the public and private sectors so that GDP grew at rates of 3.5% in 2009, the highest in Latin America, and 7.8% in 2010, fulfilling in both years the inflation targets set in the CBDR's monetary program. Since late 2010 the CBDR, in a pro-active manner, chose to move to a more neutral monetary policy stance. It is now less expansive and aimed at bringing economic growth up to its potential. Between October 2010 and May 2011, the CBDR gradually increased its policy rate by 275 basis points, from 4% to 6.75%, while from May 2011 until May 2012, the MPR remained unchanged at 6.75%. It is important to note that since the last quarter of 2011 a major fiscal stimulus was verified in the form of an increase in the rate of public investment over that period, associated with the electoral process verified in May 2012. Later, in the second half of 2012, in the absence of inflationary pressure, weak domestic demand, and a fall in private sector credit, the CBDR chose to modify its monetary stance by reducing the MPR by 175 basis points, dropping from 6.75% to 5.0% between May and August 2012. At the end of 2012 it is expected that economic growth will stand at around 4% and inflation well below the lower limit of the inflation target of 5.5%, +/-1%. Monetary policy, combined with fiscal policy, has served as a counterweight in handling the international crisis, or at least mitigating its effects on the Dominican economy. Keeping the expectations of economic agents anchored to sound policymaking created certainty in investors, both local and foreign. An important element is the strength of the financial system. This sector was not contaminated with the toxic assets that led to the global crisis, and throughout the period of the international crisis has reflected high levels of solvency, capitalization, and profitability. This is mainly due to the implementation of laws and regulations by the Monetary Board, in line with core Basel principles and international best practices.</p><h4>What measures have been taken to control the Dominican peso's volatility on the international currency markets?</h4><p>The relative stability of the peso with respect to the US dollar is due to several factors. First, the Dominican economy has seen a greater influx of hard currency, mainly FDI, while exports have been recovering. Furthermore, it is important to note that tourism revenue, which is the main source of foreign exchange, has remained on a growth curve to the extent that foreign visitors to our country have diversified. Although the arrival of European tourists has slowed, this has been more than offset by new tourists from South America, especially from Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina. On the other hand, the stability of the Dominican peso has benefited from the certainty of the macroeconomic stability associated with the implementation of sound economic policies. Additionally, the CBDR has carried out exchange intervention operations in order to mitigate any volatility that could potentially affect the inflation target of this institution, given the persistent high level of pass-through from exchange rate to inflation.</p><div class="quote">“At the end of 2012 it is expected that economic growth will stand at around 4%."</div><h4>What recent developments have there been in interest rates and what are your projections for the 2012-13 period?</h4><p>From 2009, in an unfavorable external environment and under low inflationary pressures, the CBDR applied a counter-cyclical monetary policy, generating a significant reduction in market interest rates. One point to note is that if one takes into account the level where the market interest rate was at the beginning of the monetary stimulus, one could even say that the Dominican Republic was the country that achieved the highest reduction in rates in the region. The lending rate, in weighted average, declined by 14.43 percentage points, dropping from 25.17% in January 2009 to 10.74% in August 2010, thereby benefiting the private sector, which had access to historically low-interest loans. Toward the end of 2010, low interest rates caused an acceleration of private credit, generating strong momentum in domestic demand. In the context of rising international oil prices and other commodities, it became clear that higher credit growth could lead to excess demand in the economy, bringing economic growth above its potential. In this regard, in order to avoid large deviations from the inflation target and maintain sound macroeconomic conditions, the CBDR determined to begin withdrawing monetary stimuli implemented during the crisis, and so adopt a more neutral monetary policy stance, reflected by the gradual increases process in the MPR. These measures are gradually transmitted to market rates, which increased in stages, although below the levels of pre-crisis period. However, as of May 2012, with the reduction of the MPR, market rates began to show signs of reduction.</p><h4>What are your inflation targets and what challenges are there to price stability in the country?</h4><p>As of January 2012, the CBDR formally began operations under inflation targeting in order to give certainty to economic agents and make further institutional progress in the operation of monetary policy. This decision was not impromptu. For years the movements in money supply in the economy were almost entirely reflected in inflation, so we could achieve the policy objective by controlling the money supply. However, after the domestic banking crisis of 2003-2004 there was a weakening of the relationship between money supply and inflation. Additionally, the Dominican financial market's development resulted in a wider range of products such as debit and credit cards and other forms of electronic payments, which made the amount of money supply demanded by economic agents less predictable. Given these structural efforts and based on a process of analysis of the best practices of modern central banking, we were determined to prepare the CBDR to adopt a new monetary policy strategy based on inflation targeting. In effect since 2005, and with the valuable assistance of experts from the central banks of emerging and developed economies as well as the IMF, the CBDR incorporated the technical changes necessary to operate under the new scheme. As a result of these efforts, macro econometric models were developed to project key variables and simulate policies, and studies were conducted on the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Based on these studies, the CBDR's overnight rate was adopted as the monetary policy rate, the main policy signaling instrument in the inflation targeting scheme. In the Dominican Republic the overnight rate is the reference rate signaling to economic agents the policy stance of the CBDR. Decisions on the policy rate have been taken monthly since January 2008 in a monetary policy meeting, in which the balance of internal and external risks on compliance with the inflation target are discussed. After each meeting, a statement that briefly describes the macroeconomic reasoning behind each monetary policy decision, especially with regard to the policy rate, is published on the CBDR's website. In addition to technical advances described herein, it was decided that the CBDR meet several of the initial preconditions suggested by experts to adopt an inflation targeting scheme. In this regard, since 2002 the CBDR has a legal mandate, the main objective of which is price stability, which is also contained in the new Constitution of the Republic. This legal mandate also states that the CBDR has autonomy to determine its purpose and independence in the management of its monetary policy instruments. Dominican monetary law also establishes the absence of fiscal dominance by explicitly prohibiting the CBDR to finance the government. Finally, the country now has a stable financial system that allows monetary policy to focus on the inflation target without being diverted by issues related to the health of the financial system. The decision to adopt an inflation targeting scheme has led to a process of preparation for years. It was the result of a long internal reflection and intense debate of ideas aimed at providing sustainability in the long term to macroeconomic stability. Clearly, the current external environment poses an enormous challenge for policymakers. The volatility of oil prices and other international commodities, as well as the evolution of the European crisis, pose risks that should be carefully monitored. The CBDR is closely monitoring these events in order to react in time when the balance of risks points to possible deviations from the inflation target.</p><h4>What is the role of the CBDR in expanding the country's capital markets?</h4><p>The CBDR is the leading securities issuer in the Dominican Republic. This has been the result of its involvement in the rescue of the financial system after the domestic banking crisis of 2003-2004, through open market operations for sterilization to bring liquidity under control in the economy. The CBDR' s securities have driven the secondary market in the Dominican Republic, together with securities from the Ministry of Finance, by offering at auction a range of government securities with competitive performance and zero risk.</p><h4>What is the CBDR's stance regarding the new agreement with the IMF?</h4><p>In the last decade the Dominican Republic has had two Stand-By Arrangements with the IMF. The first was in 2005 to restore macroeconomic stability and the health of the financial system after the local banking crisis of 2003-2004. The second agreement was in 2009, in order to try to mitigate the impact of the international crisis and allow the country greater access to international credit. In both agreements, significant progress was made in terms of the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, the strengthening of the financial system, and the restoration of economic growth with low inflation and various structural reforms. In current times of significant restrictions on public finances due to an expansionary fiscal policy implemented since late 2011, combined with falling tax revenues and higher energy subsidies, it has generated deviations in fiscal deficits in 2011 and 2012. The Dominican authorities, including the CBRD, are aware that the external environment and the current fiscal conditions pose a huge challenge. That is why they favor a new agreement with the IMF to support the government's efforts to stabilize the fiscal accounts through a set of long-term measures to sustain macroeconomic stability. In this regard, they have been working on the design and implementation of an economic program, accompanied by the IMF, to address these issues. In addition, the current government has an important structural reform agenda, especially in the fiscal sector, where it has been setting up a comprehensive reform incorporating revenue increases, spending cuts, and institutional strengthening elements. This reform would ensure fiscal sustainability over time, as well as a downward trend in the public debt levels as a ratio of GDP. The program also includes a series of government measures that will help improve the financial conditions of the energy sector and reduce overtime transfers to this sector by the central government. In addition, the development of a comprehensive social inclusion program to strengthen poverty reduction and to create jobs, favoring social spending, especially in education, has been proposed.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of the group's operations in Mexico?</h4><p>The origin of the relationship between Heineken and Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma (CM) can be traced back to the late 1980s and early 1990s when Heineken provided technical assistance to CM. Later, at the beginning of the 2000s, Heineken became the US distributor of CM's brands. At the beginning of 2010, Heineken acquired 100% of CM from FEMSA. The acquisition of CM had a huge relevance for Heineken. CM has an excellent reputation built over more than 120 years in Mexico. Heineken and CM share values on creating economic and social value. We take care of our employees, communities, and the environment, and we have a shared passion for quality. We brew great products and we have a focused agenda centered on our customers.</p><h4>How did the acquisition broaden Heineken's access to higher-growth markets, and how important is the market to the wider group?</h4><p>European markets are very mature, and we expect growth to come from emerging markets in the following years. This is why investing in Mexico was obvious for us; we are talking about the second largest economy in Latin America and one of the most attractive and competitive beer industries in the world. The Mexican beer market is expanding. The share of beer in the alcoholic drinks market is around 70%, and 2 million people reach legal drinking age every year. CM's volume is very important to Heineken as it represents roughly 15% of the company and we expect to continue outpacing the overall growth of Heineken.</p><div class="quote">“Our plans are to continue to grow in Mexico and amaze our consumers with our product offering."</div><h4>How much of your production is sold domestically and what are your main export destinations?</h4><p>About 90% of our production is sold domestically. Our main export market is the US, but we are experiencing interesting growth rates in Europe, Latin America, and Asia.</p><h4>How would you characterize the Mexican market compared with other regional markets? Is the market for premium beers like Heineken increasing?</h4><p>There are strong regional differences in Mexico in terms of consumer habits, branding, and packaging preferences. In Mexico the traditional off-premise retail segment continues to be extremely relevant for the beer industry. However, modern channels are also experiencing accelerated growth. The premium segment is underdeveloped compared to other countries, but we have seen excellent results with Heineken and our domestic premium brands, particularly in cities like Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. We are confident that this segment will continue growing at an accelerated pace.</p><h4>In what ways are regional consumer demands evolving?</h4><p>Evolution in beer demand varies dramatically from region to region. However, the demand for light beers, which was high in the north, is now increasing in the center of the country.</p><h4>What expansion plans do you have for Mexico?</h4><p>Our plans are to continue to grow in Mexico and amaze our consumers with our product offering. We plan to increase our capacity if the demand for our products continues to grow at a relevant pace.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2013?</h4><p>We plan to further accelerate our growth and to continue leading the innovation agenda of the industry and further develop our brands. Most importantly, we want our brands be the preferred choice of the Mexican beer consumer.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecopetrol established Cenit in 2012 to meet the growing need for oil transportation. How would you assess the pipeline infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>The oil industry has changed significantly in Colombia in the last few years; previously, there used to be only a small number of players, all of them large companies that were developing infrastructure as they needed. Now, there are an important number of SMEs, and not that many large companies. This change has affected the pace of the development of new infrastructure, as the sector is growing quickly and more infrastructure is needed. Therefore, Cenit is committed to meet the demands not only of Ecopetrol, but also the entire sector. Ecopetrol has grown immensely over the years, and Cenit will contribute to focus on the logistics area. In this regard, we aim to further promote transparency within a clear regulatory framework in order to attract FDI into Colombia's oil industry, especially in our segment. Finally, Cenit aims to create more synergies within Ecopetrol's group, optimizing resources and making our activities more efficient. In terms of assets, Cenit is the second largest company in Colombia, and we expect that our company's turnover for 2013 will reach over $1 billion. As for our activity in the near future, we aim to contribute to the development of the right regulatory framework to attract foreign companies to the sector, as well as implement expansion projects. However, we need to do this step by step, and right now we are recruiting people both from Colombia and abroad.</p><h4>What are Cenit's main investment plans in the short term?</h4><p>Over the last three years, Ecopetrol's group has invested around $4 billion in the mainstream segment, and we planned an initial investment of $2.2 billion for 2013. We foresee three priorities in terms of projects: the finalization of the bicentennial pipeline, the expansion of the Colombian and Ocensa pipelines, and the strengthening of secondary pipelines that transport oil to the trunking pipelines. It is important for the company to target between three and four large projects in its first year of operation, and we aim to achieve that through our strategic plan.</p><div class="quote">“Over the last three years, Ecopetrol's group has invested around $4 billion in the mainstream segment."</div><h4>What will be the future impact of the bicentennial pipeline in the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>It is one of the most important expansion projects in the sector, and we are developing it along with Petrominerales, Cepcolsa, and Pacific Pipeline Supply, among others. It will produce up to 160,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) in its first stage of development, and we expect to finish its construction by the beginning of 2013. One of the greatest advantages of this particular project is the possibility of future expansion. I believe that the next few months are very important for the development of the project, because it has yet to be decided whether we will fully implement the second stage. As of today, the projected second phase will add some 60,000 barrels more to the production mentioned above with an initial investment of around $60 million.</p><h4>What are the specifications of the project to expand the Ocensa pipeline?</h4><p>We are developing the project along with several partners such as Total, Petrominerales, and Cepcolsa, and at the moment we are in the process of changing some structures of governance in the company due to the difficulties and slowness of the decision-making processes. The Ocensa pipeline expansion project consists of two stages; one of them is designed for the long-term, which is two years. We are talking about a low-risk project with a relatively low level of investment, which makes it a very attractive proposition. We are not closing our doors on further expansion in the future, as I believe it will continue to be the most important pipeline in the country.</p><h4>What steps should be taken in order to further promote the development of Colombia's pipeline network?</h4><p>There are some regulatory issues that should be addressed. Today, many producers transport oil through tankers instead of lines connected to the trunk pipelines due to the regulatory framework around prices and the transport capacity of these lines. In addition, we need to boost activity in the secondary market of the sector. These two elements will contribute to attracting FDI. Finally, I believe that we need to turn expansion projects into effective and profitable business activities for companies, because that would encourage them to implement pipeline expansion projects.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of the development of security issues around pipeline networks?</h4><p>Although there have been security incidents in the Arauca region as well as in other areas, we cannot generalize, and the government is taking the right steps to strengthen security via patrolling and supervising with units of soldiers that have already proven to be very successful. There is also a long-term strategy to start security flights along the main pipeline areas.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the sector for the next five years?</h4><p>The challenges the sector faces can be categorized into the following areas: environmental licensing, social responsibility with minority communities in the region, and security. The sector has a strong and stable regulatory framework and profitable activity, and that is generating high levels of interest among foreign investors. Over the medium term, we foresee the arrival of specialized players, and at the same time the companies already operating in the sector will consolidate their positions and activities. I believe that there are plenty of opportunities in the sector, as there are important investment projects such as new pipelines. That could lead to the creation of synergies between different companies in the near future.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Ron Barceló become an international brand?</h4><p>BEICA came to the Dominican Republic some 12 years ago. At that time, we were based in Spain, and thanks to our vast experience in the rum industry as a group of entrepreneurs, we reached an agreement with the Barceló family. Back then, we were present in five countries: Spain, Honduras, the US, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic, and we were exporting an average of 170,000 cases per year. To put these figures in context, the company today exports 1.7 million cases per year and we are active in 55 countries. The main markets are Spain, where we sell around 900,000 cases, and Chile, where we sell another 350,000 cases. The Dominican Republic represents a small percentage, but it is growing fast and we believe there is big future potential here, as well as in the US, Russia, and China.</p><h4>What type of agreement did you reach with the Barceló family?</h4><p>We set up a joint venture (JV) in order to expand the company at the international level, and we ended up buying the brand. In fact, the negotiations took between five and six years, and we did not purchase any facilities from the family, just the Barceló brand. In this regard, some members of the family stayed with us after the purchase, as well as the Garcí­a family, who were co-founders of the brand. A total of 92% of the company's capital belongs to two Spanish families, 5% belongs to Dominican families, and the rest is spread between minority shareholders such as staff.</p><div class="quote">“We believe that in the next three to four years the US will become one of our main export markets."</div><h4>Why did you decide to externalize the marketing and distribution processes to Cervecerí­a Nacional Dominicana for the local market?</h4><p>Our policy is to have either an importer or a distributor in each country where we export, and we believed it was the right move also in the Dominican Republic. This is a very complex market. There are over 50,000 selling points in the country and it requires a very large sales force. In this regard, the agreement with Cervecerí­a Nacional Dominicana was very advantageous for us because it holds vast experience and knowledge in the market. It has well-developed infrastructure and its logistics network is large and very efficient. It also distributes other brands. The move has enabled us to compete in a better position in the local market.</p><h4>What percentage do local sales represent in your business activity?</h4><p>Sales in the country are around 400,000 cases. However, we have seen huge growth in the last few years. Three years ago we were selling 100,000 cases. In this regard, our estimations are quite optimistic for the local market, and we expect to approach 1 million cases within three years. Our high-end products represent 70% of our sales in the Dominican Republic, and sales of our lower-end products are minimum. That gives us a privileged position in the market, because there is still plenty of room to grow in the latter area.</p><h4>How much did BEICA invest in the current rum distillery and other facilities?</h4><p>When we purchased the Barceló brand, we did not obtain any of the facilities the family was using. In 2002, we developed our first production facility, BEICA, which currently employs 150 people and produces 40,000 aging barrels in three different types of bottling. Recently, we built Ron Barceló Historical Center, a sort of museum that aims to attract many of the visitors that come to the Dominican Republic. Since we had a few problems with the delivery of some alcohol we were buying from other companies, we invested in our own distillery along with Alcoholes Finos Dominicanos (AFD), a Venezuelan investor, and two sugarcane producers. It is the only distillery producing alcohol from sugarcane juice in the country. We also produce our own electricity from the remaining sugarcane. At the moment, we are developing a third facility in the San Pedro de Macorí­s free zone that will produce rum and manufacture bottles only for Spain. Overall, the company employs 400 people directly, and 2,000 indirectly, and the investment we have made in the country, along with our partners, totals around $70 million.</p><h4>What is your plan of action regarding exports to the US in alliance with the US-based Shaw-Ross?</h4><p>When exporting to the US you need to have an import partner, which at the same time has to have a distributor in each state. Every state is completely unique in terms of tax and alcohol-related laws. Recently, we signed an agreement with a sister company of Southern Wines and Spirits, the largest distributor of alcohol beverages and wines in the US. We believe that in the next three to four years the US will become one of our main export markets with great growth rates.</p><h4>What is the aging period of Barceló Imperial Premium Blend and what are your current production figures for this rum?</h4><p>The aging period of this type of rum is between eight and 10 years, and we currently produce over 50,000 cases per year. However, we see the highest growth rate in Añejo rum, which varies from this one only in the aging period, which is between three and seven years. I would also like to say we do not tend to add the year to our bottles, because, among other things, if you compare the aging processes in the Dominican Republic and Scotland, you will see that it is much faster here due to weather conditions.</p><h4>How significant is to be included in the Elite Brand list of International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR) for the fourth year in a row?</h4><p>In order to be on such a privileged list, you have to comply with certain requirements. You must sell 1 million cases and export to more than 16 countries. Additionally, 40% of your sales must be exports. In this regard, we have complied with all these requirements for the last four years. We started in 22nd position and today we rank seventh. The Chicago Beverage Tasting Institute awarded us the “World's Best Rum" prize after scoring 97 out 100 points—the highest score ever. Also, we are certified as producing “Authentic Caribbean Rum," and we possess other international certificates such as ISO 9001 and ISO 4000 related to security and environmental friendliness. We are constantly seeking to strengthen our international brand.</p><h4>How does Barceló compete with larger multinationals in the sector?</h4><p>We strongly believe in the need to invest in R&amp;D, as well as look for international partners who share the same passion and business philosophy. I would not say we are an aggressive company, but rather we invest in innovation at all the levels, including products, packaging, and presentation.</p><h4>In your opinion, what regulatory steps should be taken to improve the sector?</h4><p>In my opinion, the sector does not need governmental help, but rather room to maneuver, as well as more legal and tax security that can be addressed through a long-term strategy for the industrial sector. Policies and national strategies should not change like the color of the government. Also, I believe that the country needs to update some of the key laws such as the Alcohol Act, which dates from 1951.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[making-a-toll]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background story of Coconal?</h4><p>This is a company with 62 years of history behind it. Throughout this period, we have developed our business activities in Mexico by building substantial infrastructure projects including roads, bridges, dams, and airports. There are seven companies within the Coconal Group. In addition to Coconal, which is the construction company, we have three special purpose vehicles (SPVs). One of them manages road-infrastructure concessions of between 20 and 40 years, one operates and maintains these concessions, and the final one deals with the transport of materials and machinery. The last element of the group is Compañí­a Contratista Nacional, Coconal's holding company. The company can trace its origins to Compañí­a Contratista Nacional's establishment in 1950. Coconal has come a long way over the years. Today, we have about 3,500 employees and our turnover is approximately $400 million per year. Also, we operate and maintain 1,000 kilometers of highway, 550 kilometers of which we built. Along the roads for which we are responsible for operations and maintenance, we are installing security cameras every 3 kilometers. We have also installed emergency telephones for drivers. On weekdays, some 4,000 vehicles per day use our roads under concession, while on weekends the figure goes up to 12,000 vehicles per day.</p><h4>How are your operations balanced between construction and management?</h4><p>Construction is our main business activity today, with around 70% of our activity in the construction of public infrastructure projects. The remaining 30% are road concessions. We are presently the second most important company in terms of the overall number of road concessions.</p><h4>What are some of the most important projects the company has carried out in the last five years?</h4><p>The Toluca-Valle de Bravo Road, which is 70 kilometers long and had a budget of Ps3 billion, is one of the most complex and significant projects we have developed, because it is located in a protected natural area. In addition to that, the construction of the access road to the Manzanillo thermoelectric plant was also very important. It was about seven kilometers in length, and we finished the project in seven months. Finally, we are currently developing the 42-kilometer “Laguna beltway," an 18-month-long project with a budget of more than Ps2 billion.</p><div class="quote">“The economic capacity of the country will depend on the price of oil and, above all, on future fiscal reforms."</div><h4>Since 70% of your business activity relates to public infrastructure projects, how do you anticipate the new public-private-partnership (PPP) law will affect the industry?</h4><p>In Mexico, there are three types of contracting: public, where there is a very extensive regulatory framework; the concessions regime, which is well-structured; and the PPP model, which was quite vague before the introduction of the new law. The new PPP law, which is modeled on the PPP structure of the UK, is attractive for the sector because it gives solidity to private investments. In addition, public infrastructure projects will continue growing as the price of oil rises. In terms of road concessions, Mexico is at the limit; the country has 9,000 kilometers of toll roads, and I think we are one of the countries with the highest number of toll roads in the world. In this regard, the new PPP law will give fresh air to a very mature market. However, the impact on the sector is yet to be seen, especially because it still needs to be fully developed. The issue of public private partnership is in fact a very complex matter, and up until this point it has to a large extent clashed with the national regulatory framework.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing the further sophistication of infrastructure within Mexico?</h4><p>I think the economic capacity of the country will depend on the price of oil and, above all, on future fiscal reforms that would enable the government to collect more taxation revenue. Additionally, the full implementation of the PPP regulatory framework and an upgrade of the out-of-date laws regulating the infrastructure segment are much needed. Finally, security is another challenge Mexico faces. However, I would also like to point out that the country has huge capacity and potential for growth; for example, there are about 250,000 kilometers of unpaved roads.</p><h4>What is Coconal's growth strategy looking ahead?</h4><p>Coconal is well positioned in the road infrastructure segment, where we are a leading company, and we have gained the trust and confidence of Mexico's population and business network. One of my top priorities is to expand our client portfolio because we have not reached many large clients, and we have much room to grow. In addition, we aim to start developing projects in the water and sewage treatment segment, which in fact is a very important segment for the whole country nowadays, as well as in solid waste, high-speed rail, and harbor infrastructure. These two areas offer a huge growth potential in Mexico. Finally, I think we have room to strengthen the logistics and machinery areas of our business.</p><h4>How well developed is the wastewater management industry today, and how much competition exists?</h4><p>Nowadays, there are only three companies that possess their own advanced technology and machinery for the sector. The company, therefore, aims to establish partnerships with leading foreign companies due to their broader and greater experience in the sector. We need to attract foreign companies within the wastewater management industry to come to Mexico. In order to do this, we need to improve the regulatory framework as well as security. Mexico needs foreign technology to improve the wastewater management and solid waste industries and make them more competitive.</p><h4>What strategy is Coconal implementing to establish international partnerships?</h4><p>At the moment we have business agreements with a couple of Spanish companies, and we are negotiating a potential deal with a company from Israel. However, we need to strengthen our international profile by making Mexico more attractive. I remember traveling to Europe about 10 years ago, and I found that European companies were very hesitant to come to Mexico at all, mainly because they did not believe in the country's growth potential. This is changing, however, and the government should really invest more resources in promoting the country as an FDI destination.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for Coconal for 2013?</h4><p>The company is on the right path to continue growing and expanding its business activity in the near future. Our strategy is one of stretching our arm no further than our sleeve will reach, and that approach has always paid off for us. I believe we ought to continue this way by offering very competitive prices, producing high-quality finished projects, and providing excellent results for our clients.</p><p>© The Business Year - October 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sticking-to-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the infrastructure and housing sector in Colombia evolved in the last few years, and what impact is that having on the cement industry?</h4><p>If you have to select a sector in which to invest, it should be housing and infrastructure, followed by the oil and mining sector. Colombia has huge infrastructure needs. It is ranked 108th out of 140 in the World Economic Forum Index in highway infrastructure, 109th in port infrastructure, and 99th in railroad infrastructure. When it comes to housing, this is a country that has about a 1.5 million-unit quantitative housing deficit plus another 1 million-unit qualitative deficit. Probably half of the population is also under 25 years of age. Cement consumption is at 225 kilograms per capita per annum, while the average in Latin America is 330 kilograms. This means that in order for Colombia to catch up with Latin America, it needs to grow by 50%. The sector will lead economic growth in the near future, and the government is taking some steps in order to close the gap. At this particular moment, there is probably more of a focus on housing, and that's why the authorities have just launched an initiative to build 100,000 houses per year. There are also a lot of regulations that need to change in Colombia in order for that number to grow much faster. For example, in Colombia there is no program for people not formally employed. The government needs to deliver regulations to provide housing, or facilitate housing, for that population group. In infrastructure, I think it has been taking the right steps in recent years. It has faced some problems with corruption, which has created a slowdown in the development of new infrastructure projects, but I think the country is quite clear about what it needs. Officials are trying to position Colombia as a country for safe investment. FDI has been growing tremendously over the last couple of years. Several free trade agreements (FTAs) have been signed and more are planned. That, however, will require more infrastructure. In this respect, housing and infrastructure will lead to economic growth in the country. In the cement industry, in particular, growth over 2011 was tremendous, at some 14% overall. That has not happened in decades. Over 2012 it is still expanding, though not quite at the same rate. However, I see the industry growing in double digits over the medium term.</p><h4>You were appointed president of CEMEX Colombia in 2011. What have been the main developments at the company since?</h4><p>We have entered into a transformation process. Our previous vision was quite arrogant in my view, and very pragmatic in the sense that we wanted to be the best ready mix and aggregates producer. We changed our vision to one that is probably more philosophical. And that is to contribute to the development of the country with solutions that provide for the people's welfare. We believe that if we are able to provide a solution in lower-income housing, for example, we are not only creating jobs, but also welfare for the population. We are also able to provide solutions for highway infrastructure. Then, we decided to change our vision from products to solutions. CEMEX began to offer four different kinds of solutions, including for housing, infrastructure, distribution channels, and contractors. As a company, we launched six different initiatives to develop new products and services. In housing, for example, CEMEX participates across the whole chain. If you have land, we help with the permits and develop technical and construction solutions, as well as financial solutions. We started the project in early 2012, and now have a commitment to build 16,000 houses.</p><div class="quote">“We believe in this country, as it is the second most significant country in CEMEX's portfolio."</div><h4>How does CEMEX work with its partners?</h4><p>We are trying to make things happen, and that is why we get involved in the whole process. While we want houses to be built, we do not want to create a housing construction company. We want the projects to happen independently. If we were to build projects, we would ask one of our clients to do the work. On the infrastructure side, we have signed several agreements with consulting and contracting companies that possess knowledge that we at CEMEX do not have. For example, we do not design bridges or highways. We signed an agreement with Esteyco, which is a very prestigious firm from Barcelona that provides us with engineering services. In that particular solution division, the idea is to approach mayors, governors, or the central government and ask what they want to do. We then get together and decide how to develop ideas.</p><h4>How is your product portfolio evolving, and which part of the business has more potential for growth?</h4><p>You may perceive cement as a commodity, but it is not. It has different formulas that provide different performance levels. Therefore, we have created a portfolio of products based on what consumer products do. Our products have different functions depending on what you want. For example, we produce a product for coastal structures. You may have seen a port where the concrete has fallen away and revealed the steel. That happened because it is an environment full of sulfur, so you need specific cement that can withstand the elements. At CEMEX, we produce such a product. CEMEX offers five different types of cement, five different types of mortars, and more than 3,000 formulas in our concrete system. We are trying to tell the market to use whatever is specific for their needs, and we will charge according to that because it has an added value.</p><h4>CEMEX is present in over 50 countries. What does Colombia represent for the company and what further expansion plans do you have?</h4><p>Colombia is number two after Mexico in CEMEX's estimations, and we believe that the country will continue to grow at double-digit pace. In order to catch up with that vision, we have to invest. For example, in our aggregate business we have doubled our capacity. In our ready mix business, a year ago we had just 16 plants, and now we expect to finish 2012 with 38 fixed plants and 24 mini plants, which we did not have in the past. If you add it up, it totals 62 plants. We are also bringing in 200 new trucks for the ready-mix business. For the cement business, we brought in 350 trucks and increased our cement capacity by 20% over 12 months. Equally, we are also planning to invest in two new plants; one in Antioquia and one on the north coast of Colombia. This will allow us to increase our production by 50%.</p><h4>Where is demand mainly coming from, and how do you see it changing in the medium term?</h4><p>Right now it is coming from housing. Approximately 70% of cement is sold in bag form. This is sold in small quantities and used in the construction of informal housing. However, after 2013 I believe the main driver will be infrastructure. I see Colombia growing over the next 10-12 years in order to catch up with the big gap that it has in infrastructure.</p><h4>How are plans progressing to list the company on the Colombian Stock Market?</h4><p>We believe in this country, as it is the second most significant country in CEMEX's portfolio. We are planning to create a holding in Colombia called CEMEX Latin American Holding, where most of our Central and South American operations will be based. We are then planning to sell a minority stake in that new holding in the very short term. It will be a huge transaction for the Colombian market. It is very important for the country as it is the first time a foreign company has done something like this. It is also important for CEMEX because it is the first time in our history we have decided to do a listing like this.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Contecon obtained a concession for the Port of Guayaquil in 2007. Why did your parent company decide to invest?</h4><p>Contecon Guayaquil is a subsidiary of International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI), which handles port operations around the world. The company began operations in 2007, when the bidding for the lease of Guayaquil took place. ICTSI decided to invest in Guayaquil because the group follows a growth policy for its global operations. In the Americas, there are many opportunities to expand business thanks to the performance of economies like Ecuador's. In 2011 its economic growth rate was 8%, and this year it is predicted to be around 6%. The opportunity to improve the economy, carry out projects, and design new plants and facilities comes with the need to attend to cargo and maintain good port infrastructure. Contecon's mission is to be ready for increasing demand and to accompany Ecuador on its growth path.</p><h4>Does Ecuador have a promising economy in terms of trade volumes and growth?</h4><p>The government is handling the economy in a way that opens up new opportunities for the country. To complement an increasing number of imports, the proper equipment needs to be brought in for production purposes; heavy machinery and raw materials for the construction of new infrastructure such as hydroelectric power plants and oil refineries, among other projects, are required. This is also the case for the private sector. As the economy grows, new business opportunities appear on the horizon for the entire country. Moreover, there is increasing participation from Ecuador in terms of exported goods and international trade. Economic growth has long supported the importance of port operations, and our mission is to grow side by side with the country and seize these opportunities.</p><h4>How has Guayaquil's main port changed since Contecon won the concession?</h4><p>When Contecon was awarded with the concession for the Port of Guayaquil, we received a 50-year-old terminal, which in many ways did not meet contemporary international demands. Since we took over, we have had to invest over $250 million to expand the port's capacity and be able to handle new cargo and projects. Therefore, we were eager to invest in new infrastructure and more advanced equipment. We have also been investing in technology, security, training, and environmental issues.</p><h4>What are Guayaquil's advantages over the ports of Manta and Bolí­var?</h4><p>The Port of Guayaquil is close to the commercial, industrial, agricultural, and economic production areas. It is also located toward the center of the country and can handle cargo from other main cities that view Guayaquil as the most convenient place to receive and dispatch cargo to  and from international destinations.</p><h4>The port is about to invest $70 million to increase its capacity. How has Contecon financed this expansion?</h4><p>Contecon Guayaquil SA is expanding its infrastructure and handling capacity by almost by 50%, which includes the reinforcement of berths, yards, and new handling equipment. Contecon saw an opportunity to finance and participate its growth via the issuance of debt in the national stock market, in which the main investors were public finance institutions, private banks, private funds, and particular individual investors. In two months, 100% of the securitization was placed on the market. This also reflects the confidence that the local investors have in Contecon's ability to manage its activities.</p><h4>Why did the company choose to expand the port over the coming year?</h4><p>The reason behind the expansion of the port was primarily because of the growth in Ecuador's economy. This made us accelerate the investment plan forward by a year in order to accommodate cargo volumes. Our mission is to accompany and go along with the country's growth, and that meant pushing investments forward. We expect that in 3Q2012 our expansion projects will be in use.</p><h4>Is the port of Guayaquil a reference for any specific sector or market?</h4><p>As port operators, we are focused mainly on containers, bulk, and project cargo. We have the infrastructure to attend to these segments. Ecuador has been moving toward the refrigerated cargo business, and I believe that Contecon has an interesting capacity to handle reefer (refrigerated) containers of this type. By the end of 2012 we will have a supply of over 3,500 electric sockets and plugs for reefer containers. These containers will carry a variety of goods, including bananas, fish, fruit, shrimp, vegetables, and flowers.</p><h4>What are the challenges for this year of expansion?</h4><p>We will continue to operate as efficiently as possible and search for alternative investments when and where possible. Contecon Guayaquil SA will also continue evaluating how the country needs high-quality port services and infrastructure. We are aiming to engage in discussions with the government regarding the dredging of the port's access channel. It is a very interesting project that will require heavy investment, but offer the country alternatives to service larger vessels. The Port of Guayaquil is always reinventing itself to meet growing  incremental needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market factors led this Colombian company to expand its regional reach to Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador was clearly experiencing an economic boom during the 1990s, and it borders Colombia. Therefore, it was a natural move for the company. Also, the Colombian market had already matured and we needed new challenges.</p><h4>What business strategy has the company implemented in Ecuador over the years?</h4><p>When we first arrived in Ecuador, we saw that the main strength of the leading company in the logistics sector was strong brand positioning. However, the company was very much out of date, especially in terms of new technologies and coverage. Therefore, after extensive market research, we focused on covering the gaps and needs in the market, offering high-quality standard services; something the country lacked. Since then, we have grown in capacity and business volume, and I think one of the hardest challenges over the years has been to recruit people with a business philosophy close to the company's standards and values. In this regard, we are a very important provider of jobs and training opportunities in the country; we currently employ over 1,370 people directly, and indirectly it is at least twice this figure.</p><h4>How has Servientrega contributed to bringing innovation and technology to the sector?</h4><p>Servientrega has its own corporate software that has been developed over the years. When we first arrived in Ecuador, we were already able to offer tracking services to all our clients, controlling parcels at every moment through our system. In addition, our entire administrative branch was already very developed from a technological point of view. These factors gave us a privileged position in the Ecuadorean market, optimizing resources and offering very competitive prices. In addition, we have always been a pioneering company in terms of our vehicle fleet, which at the end of the day has given us another plus compared to our competitors.</p><h4>What is Servientrega's volume of operations in Ecuador?</h4><p>Our product and services portfolio is very wide and diverse; we have the largest office network in Ecuador, covering all 24 provinces. Servientrega currently offers services for corporate clients, who represent 72% of our overall business activity, and the remaining 28% of our activity is related to the natural logistics market. Our annual revenue in the country is around $24 million.</p><h4>What are Servientrega's competitive advantages within the corporate segment as compared to its competitors?</h4><p>This is a business very much dependent on trust and confidence in the companies that offer logistical services. Therefore, reliability is one of our main strengths, otherwise we wouldn't have become a leading company in the sector, and by that I mean timing, transport capacity, storage facilities, and quality standards. We established Servientrega Solutions Center to demonstrate that reason, reliability, efficiency, and trust are key words for us. Another of our main strengths is our knowledge and coverage of the local and neighboring markets, something multinationals operating in the sector lack.</p><h4>What are some of your most relevant corporate clients?</h4><p>We provide logistics services to almost the entire automotive sector. We also work with the pharmaceutical companies, as well as research laboratories. Furthermore, we do a lot of work with finance and banking companies, and provide services to multinationals.</p><h4>How many countries is Servientrega operating in?</h4><p>Today, Servientrega has very active operations in Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, and the US. We are currently implementing a strategic project to enter Costa Rica.</p><h4>What is Servientrega's transport capacity?</h4><p>Ecuador is a rather small country, and most of our transport is done by road. We have a large vehicle fleet—over 380 vehicles—and its transport capacity ranges between 1 ton and 15 tons. We also do air freight, but this is basically related to fragile parcels and products. At the international level, we operate through our extensive network, especially in countries where we have a presence; for other countries, we have agreements with the most important multinational companies. At the end of the day, what matters the most is client satisfaction in our services, and that's what we aim for, regardless of whether we have operations in that particular country or not.</p><h4>How many international agreements does Servientrega currently have?</h4><p>Today, our company works with three different multinationals from the logistics sector, because we do not want to sign exclusivity agreements that would make us dependent on a particular firm. In addition, each one of these companies is stronger in different fields, which allows us to approach them depending on the transport service we need to provide.</p><h4>What level of investment has Servientrega allocated to Ecuador, and where has such investment focused?</h4><p>In the last few years, and once the brand was totally consolidated in the market, we have focused strongly on establishing an international center of logistics in each one of the countries we operate in, providing these centers with all the necessary technology and tools to offer the best service possible. At the moment, the company is investing around $8 million in its centers in Quito and Guayaquil, which are expected to be fully operational by 2014. Once these two centers are fully operational and consolidated, we aim to open a new center in Cuenca, the third largest city in the country.</p><h4>What are your strategic goals for 2012?</h4><p>We expect to grow at least 20% in terms of revenues during this year. Such growth will be based on the further diversification of our product and service portfolio in Ecuador, and the aggressive process of expansion we are currently undergoing across the country; we have 208 service points in Ecuador. It is a very important moment for us, because we want to strengthen the position of the brand throughout the entire country. For example, we have recently introduced a new service called micro marketing, and it offers large multinationals in the mass consumer sector the possibility to reach remote areas of the country through our extensive distribution and office network, so they can reach new population targets in Ecuador. Micro marketing has given us very positive and promising results, and we believe it will continue to be very successful during this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's the background story to Grupo Hospitalario Kennedy?<br></h4><p>Clí­nica Kennedy (HCK) opened its doors in October 1978, and we formed a very qualified and skilled team whose main aim was to develop high-quality clinical scientific services at the forefront of today's medicine. Back then we believed that the private health sector was not doing enough to attend the demands of the Ecuadorean population, and at the beginning it was hard to put together enough capital for developing my idea of health care. Fortunately, everything turned out fine, and we can proudly say that ours is a very successful story. In October 1999, Kennedy inaugurated the Clinical Hospital Alborada (HCKA), the first private hospital in Guayaquil, proving that our services were highly valued and appreciated within Ecuador. We have always been a pioneering institution with the most modern infrastructure and equipment and prominent professionals in medicine, engineering, and administration. All that sums up what Grupo Hospitalario Kennedy (GHK) is; moral standing, professionalism, and high tech. During the presidency of Lucio Gutiérrez between 2003 and 2005, I was named Minister of Health, and my sons and nephew took over the management duties. During this period, we opened the Clí­nica Kennedy Samborondón (HCKS), which serves major towns settled in the area and the area surrounding Guayaquil providing scheduled and emergency health care. These health centers form the GHK today, and we employ around 600 doctors.</p><h4>What factors have led to the expansion of the HCKS?</h4><p>The hospital was opened in 2006, and during the first year of activity the center treated over 4,000 patients and more than 250 babies were born; HCKS maintains high levels of technological advancement and has a diagnostic imaging center with multislice computed tomography of 16 cuts, digital X-ray, echocardiography, a maternity ward, seven cubicles within the intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care, clinical laboratories, and 24/7 emergency services. The HCKS is totally integrated within the group, which facilitates the managing of medical records of patients regardless of the center they attend to, allowing immediate access to all services of the hospitals of the group. At the moment we are undergoing expansion works; we are constructing the third stage of the project, the Delta tower, which will allow the incorporation of 48 doctors' offices and 35 additional hospital beds, which will also ensure the development of the hospital for the next 15 years. The health needs of the population of the area, as well as the need to keep the same standards the same as in other hospitals, led to the expansion of the HCKS.</p><h4>How has GHK sought to establish international agreements with foreign hospitals?</h4><p>Over the years, we have reached international healthcare agreements with centers from Mexico, Colombia, and the US, and through these agreements we have also tried to boost scientific research as well as know-how transfer.</p><h4>How has GHK specialized its services over the years?</h4><p>We have a very strong transplant unit run by my son, who got his higher education qualifications in Spain, specializing in heart transplant. Today, we do a lot of transplants: heart transplants, marrow transplants, bone transplants, and so on.</p><h4>How close do you work with the Ecuadorean Institute of Social Security (IESS)?</h4><p>The IESS checks on us for the quality of our services; we need to report to them about our work and standards. We are classified as a Level 3 hospital, which means that we are a very specialized and high-quality health center, and they certify us with the credentials to offer such services. At the same time, and as a part of a bilateral agreement, we provide health services to its patients.</p><h4>What percentage of your patients comes from the IESS?</h4><p>Up until 2009, we were a 100% private hospital in terms of patients. However, the overall number of patients coming from the IESS is growing, for every year there are more and more workers joining the social system. As of today, I would say that 60% of our patients come from the IESS. GHK always has been characterized by its openness to society, and we aim to attend to all the stratas of society, even the poorest communities, for whom we have two foundations operating.</p><h4>What challenges is the health system in Ecuador facing in terms of development?</h4><p>I believe there's still a lot of work to do in terms of bringing epidemic diseases like tuberculosis, dengue fever, and AIDS under control. In this regard, we have to carry on our commitment at all levels of the national health system, to bring health care to the Ecuadorean population, regardless of their social and economic status or their geographic location. The public health system needs to be upgraded in order to reach out to all the population with solvency and efficiency. However, this situation needs to be addressed at the international level, not only in Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nevado produces a total of 60 varieties of rose, among which the Red Intuition, Pink Intuition, and Gigi can be found only in Ecuador. What is the development process?</h4><p>There is a difference between a mutation and a special rose. The Pink Intuition is a mutation of the Red Intuition. Say you have a greenhouse covered with red roses and one suddenly emerges sporting a different color; that is a natural mutation. Gigi is a mutation of another flower that we found on our farm. Mutations can occur in many different ways. Roses define themselves over the years. When Gigi started seven years ago it was a normal rose, but it has been improving over the years. It is an unpredictable process, and we leave it to nature. It took five years before we had a greenhouse dedicated to this plant. It is a very slow process.</p><h4>What does the quality of Nevado's roses rely on?</h4><p>The key issue for growing flowers is to have the highest possible luminosity in the best climatic conditions. In Ecuador, at an altitude of 3,000 meters, the conditions  mimic those of a greenhouse, where it isn't too cold or too hot. In that respect, we get our quality from nature. However, there are particularities and we have the help of the sun and the altitude here. That is the main issue and that is 90% of the product. The rest is something you learn over time, but you cannot reproduce natural light intensity for free or generate altitude artificially.</p><h4>How has gaining international accreditation from institutions such as the Fairtrade Foundation helped Nevado?</h4><p>Certification is something that started about 15 years ago. It has changed the mentality of farmers. We have had fair-trade certification for 10 years, but we are starting to develop our own accreditation systems. Today we have very strong local certification, and the main markets have suddenly realized that it is something that should be performed domestically. We don't need the Europeans or the North Americans coming here telling us what to do. We should perform inspections ourselves as it is our responsibility to do things our way, according to the law. All certifications are based mainly and principally on local regulations. The national certifications will be stronger internationally in the next five years.</p><h4>How important is innovation in the rose business?</h4><p>Ecuador has well over 3,200 hectares of rose farms, the highest number of hectares in the world. We have 500 different varieties of roses, which is more than any other country. The importance of this is that you are always the one that brings new ideas to the market. The eyes of the Russians and high-end markets are on Ecuador to get the newest ideas, the best innovations, and the most spectacular products to the market. We have a rose that opens as a carnation. These things happen here. Why? Because of the strength and quality of our produce. If we have 500 varieties it means that we have 20 rose breeders with their eyes on Ecuador because they know that we are the biggest, the strongest, and we have the fastest development of new varieties. We have to give them new things constantly. Breeders have invested a lot in Ecuador over the last few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the some of the major projects Etinar has been involved with?<br></h4><p>We have built the most important projects in Guayaquil, such as the Malecón 2000, Puerto Santa Ana, and Metrovia, which is a public transport system. Etinar built the main highway entrance to Guayaquil from the coastline, Avenida del Bombero. Currently, we are working on one of the terminals of the Metrovia, building most of the stations in the system. We have operations in Quevedo, and are building a new malecón (boardwalk). We are building the first important highway in Machala, and Etinar is also working in Manta on the new Refinery of the Pacific. The company has done many projects for both the government and private entities. For the private sector, we built City Mall, which is the second largest shopping facility in Guayaquil. We also constructed the Mall Del Sur, which is one of the largest. We built the Duran Outlet, which is a small mall in a city near Guayaquil. We have also been very innovative—we were the first constructors of a project with integrated residential space. Until 1992, nobody in Guayaquil would buy a finished house. Etinar completed the first residential complex with houses, clubs, swimming pools, and soccer fields. That was the first time in this city that somebody built that style of development. We were also the first company to build and develop a complex for lower-income families with security guards at the entrance, which was previously considered a luxury, even for the wealthy. We are now building complexes in Machala and Manta with around 1,800 units.</p><h4>What has been the key to remaining competitive?</h4><p>The most important factor is that we never spend money on luxury items. We devote a lot of money to savings and spend the funds we saved two years ago. Etinar has also been aggressive when the country goes into crisis. During the last crisis in 1998 and 1999, we were just beginning a building in Samborondón. We were up to the third or fourth floor, and had sold just one or two apartments. When the crisis hit the country, a lot of construction activity stopped, but I did the exact opposite. I started to work on Saturday and Sunday. I sold the entire building in less than five months during the crisis. All of the market came to us because people were afraid of buying in any other place. Etinar finished that building in approximately one year; while rival buildings that were under construction finished up to five or six years later. One of the keys is to be aggressive when you have to be aggressive, but also be very conservative when you have to be conservative.</p><h4>What are the advantages of being based in Guayaquil?</h4><p>In terms of housing units, Guayaquil represents around 40% of the entire country. This is higher than Quito and other cities. It does not have as many projects, but there are more units here. There are developments here that contain 5,000 houses, while in Quito the largest sites have just 500 units. The real estate sector is currently in a honeymoon period, which will eventually pass. That is why we have to be conservative.</p><h4>What is Etinar's position regarding international partnerships?</h4><p>We have strategic partners from the US, and we are working on a project in which 50% of the project is funded by US investors. This country is now very attractive for investments. It is very profitable and time standards are very high.</p><h4>What kind of investors would you be interested in partnering with?</h4><p>The people that are here investing money are usually retired couples that are coming to live in Ecuador. They have their money in banks in the US, but they do not feel comfortable leaving their money there. As a result, they are investing here in short-term investments. One of our projects is for two or two and a half years maximum. They like that kind of real estate.</p><h4>What level of growth do you expect over 2012?</h4><p>Ecuador is going to grow around 6%, and this is the first or the second highest growth rate in Latin America. The construction sector is going to grow 10%. It is lower than the growth rate for 2011 of 16%. I expect that the real estate market is going to do very well in the next two or three years, registering very high growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>José Paulo Netto, Country Geographic Leader of PwC Ecuador, on the company's activities in Ecuador.</h4><p>PwC is a global network of separate and independent firms working in Ecuador to provide quality services in auditing, business consulting, technology, operational processes, executive search, accounting, and tax matters. The firms composing this global network operate in 158 countries and bring together more than 169,000 employees and partners throughout the world. The knowledge, expertise, and ability of our professionals enhance value through solutions delivered to our clients, shareholders, and stakeholders.</p><p>Our presence in Ecuador dates back to 1969. We count on a select team of more than 300 professionals operating in Quito and Guayaquil. The expertise and academic excellence of our human talent are the key factors that assure the efficient delivery of services, making us a significant player and leader in this industry nationwide. In addition, the profound commitment to ethical and transparent principles included at the heart of our activities turns PwC into a symbol of quality and reliability for its clients and the authorities.</p><p>The volatile global economic environment, constant changes and uncertainties, regulatory provisions, economic strategies and models, laws issued by regulators and public officials, as well as the modernization of government assistance are a permanent source of opportunities that have allowed PwC to contribute to the economic actors and regulators in the accomplishment of their objectives. Therefore, we continue to implement an aggressive strategy of growth and support to entrepreneurial and Ecuadorean government undertakings through the innovation and development of products, business models, and simplification of the application of best market practices, coupled with an advisory service for the enforcement of accounting and tax rules and regulations established by the corresponding authorities.</p><p>The firm's solid growth is linked to the sustained development of the Ecuadorean economy—it has presented some of the most important indicators in South America—and to the permanent investment in human capital and technology. Our development is the direct result of commitment to the country, encouraged by PwC values and a corporate responsibility culture. On January 2012, we experienced an 18% increase in our professional team compared to last year, and this growth rate has turned into the benchmark of our practice.</p><p>Our professionals are permanently challenged to maintain ongoing learning, reach their full potential, and develop an enthusiastic and ambitious mindset, thus giving their all in any circumstance to themselves, their clients, their community, and their country. Furthermore, in accordance with diversity and social inclusion policies and legally binding regulations, we count on the collaboration of 10 employees with special needs, who receive our unwavering support. As far as social participation is concerned, in recent years we have developed some activities in order to encourage the active sharing of our partners and collaborators each year, such as painting schools in urban slums or planting trees in public parks.</p><p>We aim to offer not only a job opportunities but a career plan. Each year, we invest 1% of our income in human talent through post-graduate programs, language courses, and other training programs. We count on the collaboration of partners and directors with a large professional background in different areas.</p><p>At PwC, we are aware of the mission to be the ultimate firm providing professional services throughout the world. The market is constantly demanding us to work toward the highest standards, with a positive attitude and passion in our undertakings. It is a mission that requires constant dedication, effort, investment in our people, and an unwavering commitment to our clients and our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[peaks-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since you are one of only 10 people who has completed the “eight-thousanders" without oxygen support, what are your main strengths?<br></h4><p>I am a very optimistic person who always sees the glass half full. Also, I am very disciplined and committed to achieving my main goals. Organizational skills are always a must when facing the challenge of climbing such demanding mountains. And last but not least, I have been very fortunate to connect with the mountain at a spiritual level to a degree that I would have never imagined, and I believe that has been a plus for me.</p><h4>What are the main psychological challenges when facing the ascent of an “eight-thousander" without oxygen support?</h4><p>The lack of oxygen at high levels affects you very badly, and at such high points with very bad weather—including storms, snow, and avalanches—you have to be very careful. Also, I think when setting off from the base camp, you have to know what you are about to do and not to risk too much because of your selfishness. Finally, when taking up such a big challenge as the 14 “eight-thousanders," you have to keep in mind your family, as you won't see them much and that can be very hard and certainly takes its toll.</p><h4>How many expeditions did not end in success?</h4><p>To be honest, I have lost track, because I am not a big fan of statistics. Fortunately, only a few of my expeditions were unsuccessful, but I learned from the experience. In fact, the mountains have taught me many things over the last 30 years and helped me to overcome my divorce in 1996. Going back to the question, I made the summit of some the 14 “eight-thousanders" after several attempts. For example, I did Kangchenjunga on my fifth attempt, and Dhaulagiri on my third. However, I have been very lucky because of all the “eight-thousanders" I have climbed, I made the summit of many them on my first attempt.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the future?</h4><p>When you are on top of any of the “eight-thousanders" looking at the horizon, you realize that there are countless mountains surrounding them and you have achieved only a very small amount of success. Therefore, I will always have challenges ahead of me. Once I completed the 14 “eight-thousanders," I set up a very ambitious project, entitled “Ecuador on the World's Mountains," which brings together the most talented Ecuadorean mountaineers aged 20 to 30. Our aim is to climb as many mountains across the globe as possible, and we have already been to Alaska, Patagonia, Bolivia, Russia, and the Alps. Also, we are planning to climb one of the “eight-thousanders" in 2012, in order to prepare for the Nanga Parbat, which we are planning to climb in 2013.</p><h4>What prerequisites does any aspirant need to meet?</h4><p>They have to be technically good, possess a great deal of creativeness to solve problems up in the mountains, and they also have to have great capacity for suffering. In addition, they must be kind people, because for me it is pointless to be a mountaineer if you do not have a good handle on emotional intelligence.</p><h4>Since you are an entrepreneur as well, how can your personal experience help other entrepreneurs?</h4><p>When I give conferences at universities I always stress the importance for us to dream big and not to put any more hurdles in our path, which would make it difficult for us to achieve these big dreams. You should not let others to put you off your dreams, and you have to work hard in order to achieve them, being confident in yourself and never surrendering, because things do not come to you, you have to go after your dreams. In addition, you have to be passionate about what you do.</p><h4>What has Ecuador given you?</h4><p>Ecuador has given me everything in this life, and I have always felt privileged by having been born in this wonderful country. With this new project, I want to start giving back as much as I can to my country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Bananas in Ecuador]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bananas-in-ecuador]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main markets Ecuador exports to, and what other countries are you targeting for exports?<br></h4><p>Nowadays, banana exports represent about $2 billion, and 40% of our production goes to Europe, 21% to Russia, 20% to the US, 7% to the Southern Cone of South America, and the rest is divided between the Middle East and Asia. In the past, China was one of our main markets, but we lost market share due to customs tariffs and final product prices. In this regard, we are aiming to open up new markets like Iran and Turkey, which offer huge potential for Ecuador, for we could easily export some 1 million extra boxes of bananas every month. In order to expand our activities in these markets, we would need to reduce customs tariffs. Finally, I think we can also start exporting bananas to Brazil in the near future, although Brazil is a very important producer of bananas itself.</p><h4>How has the economic slowdown in Europe and the US affected Ecuadorean banana producers?</h4><p>The economic crunch in these two regions—our main export markets—has had no negative connotations in terms of volume of exports to these markets. However, it has negatively affected the price and the payment, for we used to receive payment within weeks of delivery, and now it takes up to three months. Therefore, the economic flow within the sector has been affected and exporters have needed to appeal for external credits in order to pay producers, who by law have to receive their payment within eight days of having made a shipment.</p><h4>How significant are the latest trade agreements with the EU?</h4><p>Ecuador is the main supplier of bananas to the entire EU, and we have recently signed two trade agreements with the bloc. For example, we signed an agreement regarding banana prices; ‚¬148 per ton during the first year, and ‚¬114 per ton until the 10th year. However, I regret that Ecuador walked out of the FTA between the EU and several South and Central American countries, which clearly does not benefit our sector and puts us at a disadvantage to our competitors. The AEBE would like against ask the government to reach an agreement with the EU so we can enjoy the same customs tariffs as Colombia, Peru, and Central American countries, because by not doing so we can easily lose around 100 million boxes of bananas per year.</p><h4>What is the trade situation with the US and Russia?</h4><p>As for the US, the banana enjoys zero customs tariffs because several US companies dominate the market. In Russia, the situation differs from the one in the US; there used to be four large companies that were taking up almost the entire market. However, during the economic crisis, three of these companies went bankrupt, and that opened many doors to international producers like us, because a wide range of buyers were established and they are now coming directly to us. However, the crisis did affect the price of bananas and related payments.</p><h4>What are the main strengths of the sector?</h4><p>Ecuador, which straddles the world's equator, enjoys banana production all year long thanks to its fertile soil and perfect weather conditions. In addition, over the years we have become a very recognized and well-known producer of bananas, and all the main brands in the world buy bananas from Ecuador. On the other hand, I would say that the political aspect of the banana is one of our weaknesses, and we lack a medium- to long-term vision, as well as suffer from unfair competition.</p><h4>What business opportunities does the sector offer investors?</h4><p>It offers a lot, because at each stage of production a return on investment can be secured. The AEBE can advise any investor interested in entering the Ecuadorean market by offering information about players and their reliability as a company. Also, since 70% of the exporters belong to the association, it is a very large and professional network.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind the opening of Hospital Metropolitano in 1985?<br></h4><p>Several Ecuadorean doctors, most of them having studied their sub-specialty in the best clinics and hospitals around the world, realized upon return to Ecuador that there was no hospital infrastructure up to international standards. Therefore, a few of them came together initially with that dream in mind. They asked American Medical International (AMI) to evaluate the project, based on its experience owning hospitals around the world, and its management concluded there was the potential for a hospital with high-quality standards in Quito. AMI joined the doctors interested in the project as a major shareholder of Conclina C.A., the group that owns Hospital Metropolitano. It is the reference point in the health sector of Ecuador in terms of hospital management, quality patient care, cutting-edge technology, and professionalism of the medical, technical, and administrative staff.</p><h4>In 2001 Hospital Metropolitano began a technological restructuring plan. How would you evaluate the hospital in terms of technological advances?</h4><p>Since the beginning, to differentiate itself with cutting-edge technology and infrastructure was the main goal of the hospital.</p><p>From a technological perspective, we have attached special importance to the renewal and acquisition of new equipment in order to address highly complex services. Thus, for example, in 2009 the first liver transplant was carried out in the country at Hospital Metropolitano, the only authorized health institution to carry out this procedure. In 2010, we acquired a linear accelerator for radiotherapy. It is cutting-edge technology for cancer treatment.</p><h4>How successful has your transplant unit been?</h4><p>Hospital Metropolitano has been characterized by the development of its professionals and the incorporation of new complex procedures. One of the most complex procedures is organ transplantation. We performed 60 transplants during 2011, such as kidney, liver, cornea, and bone marrow transplants. Hospital Metropolitano is the only institution that has obtained accreditation to perform liver transplants in Ecuador from the government through the National Agency for Organ and Tissue Transplants (ONTOT), considered one of the most complex procedures in the world. We have performed 36 hepatic transplants since 2010. Based on our morbidity rate, our success is comparable with other hospitals that are capable of performing this complex procedure around the world.</p><h4>How have your relationships with international institutions helped the development of the hospital?</h4><p>In order to keep up the improvement of our quality indicators, Hospital Metropolitano has a large number of agreements with different healthcare institutions around the world with which we share experiences.</p><p>In our daily goal for excellence, Hospital Metropolitano has managed to obtain several certifications from recognized institutions worldwide, which guarantee the high quality of its processes and maintain its international service standards, which are applied in different areas, motivating the improvement of internal processes and training for our employees.</p><p>These efforts allowed Hospital Metropolitano to obtain accreditation from Joint Commission International (JCI), in March 2011. I'm proud to say that our hospital is the only one in Ecuador to have this recognition on excellence in safety and quality in patient care.</p><h4>Hospital Metropolitano is expanding. What medical areas are going to benefit from this?</h4><p>In Ecuador, Hospital Metropolitano has the largest healthcare facilities in the private sector, with 106,000 sqm of space. An investment of more than $25 million in three new buildings expanded the medical offices, where specialized physicians attend to their private practice. We will increase the hospital's capacity by up to 50%, which means we will have 60 more beds, and we will also expand the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in order to separate the pediatric ICU from the adult one. The expansion is also needed in emergency and cardiology, coupled with oncology, an area where improvements will continue.</p><h4>How do you assess the quality and role of private health care in the country?</h4><p>The private sector is an important part of the national healthcare system. As a part of it, we need to distinguish ourselves in what we offer. Quality, safety, and warmness are essential. The private sector competes in these areas constantly. Hospital Metropolitano has always positioned itself as having the best doctors, a differentiated infrastructure, cutting-edge technology, and quality standards in the attention given to its patients. The whole healthcare system faces the challenge of increasing quality standards despite the rising costs in technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does tourism play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>Ecuador offers a unique lifestyle model that is gathering worldwide recognition. In a time of economic contraction in many countries around the world, people are questioning the traditional economic model. French philosopher Edgar Morin recently declared Ecuador an alternative model of socioeconomic development in the world. Tourism obviously plays a key role in this development. Simon Bolí­var declared that people from Latin America were a new race, for it is a continent with wide diversity in terms of culture and population, with the highest rate of biodiversity per capita in the world. For that reason, Ecuador has developed a new slogan; “Ecuador loves life!" It is a proposal for a new civilization, a new human age, in which love and the defense of life are the key elements of society. These ideals underline our tourism industry, as the country seeks to be an example to the world by developing a conscientious tourism. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) talks about three types of tourism: ethical, responsible, and sustainable. Conscious tourism brings together these three elements but goes one step further in terms of loving life and becoming better human beings at both ends of the service chain. For example, the Ecuadorean people decided through a popular referendum that casinos have no place in a strong society, and therefore this is a casino-free country. For all these reasons, Quito will host the next WTO Congress on Ethical Tourism in September 2012, as well as a meeting of the ministers of tourism organized by the Organization of American States (OAS). The government of Ecuador aims to promote tourism as a key instrument for the development of the country, for we have a rich and wide tourism heritage that summarizes what Latin America is: the Brazilian jungles, the Peruvian and Chilean mountain ranges, Mexican and Guatemalan indigenous markets, the Caribbean coast, and, of course, the origin of the evolution of species; the Galapagos Islands. Ecuador and its tourism sector are already attracting worldwide interest. For example, investors from Qatar have already visited the country in order to implement large projects in Ecuador. Our country is aiming to develop a sustainable, ethical, responsible, and conscious tourism model.</p><h4>How has the sector evolved over recent years?</h4><p>Ecuador has only developed 15% of its tourism potential in the last few years; therefore, there is plenty left to be discovered. At the moment, we are building up a tourism brand that is attracting more interest throughout the world every day.    Such a process has enabled us to experience important growth rates at a sustainable and responsible pace. We do not aim to grow for the sake of growing. For example, in the first quarter of 2012, tourism in Ecuador grew by 15%, whereas the rest of the world grew by 4.5% on average. For that reason, I believe Ecuador offers the best competitive advantages for foreign investors right now. Our country currently offers 12 touristic products such as cultural tourism, eco-tourism, sun and beach tourism, medical tourism, and even retirement tourism, which has grown considerably in the last few years, thanks partly to Ecuador being voted the best place to live in the world in a poll carried out by International Living Magazine, considering the country's security, healthcare accessibility, and beautiful weather. In addition, the US Tour Operators Association (USTOA) ranked Ecuador as the third most important new destination to be discovered within the tourism sector. I would also like to say that there is  still a long road ahead of us; we need to learn a lot in terms of training and capacity. However, I truly believe that the events we are hosting here in September 2012 will help us to take a step forward in these fields. Finally, I would also like to mention that we are promoting tourism agreements with our neighbors Colombia and Peru, as well as Cuba, to implement tourism routes involving all four countries.</p><h4>What strategies is the Ministry implementing in order to attract FDI?</h4><p>We personally invite private businessmen here so they can experience first-hand what Ecuador offers. Apart from Qatari investors, we have welcomed delegations from Singapore and other Middle Eastern countries. At the same time, we are inviting large international multinationals to come over and develop large projects in our rich territory. The Ministry of Tourism has increased its budget 10 fold in the last six to seven years, which proves the increasing international exposure of our country. We are aiming to conclude business agreements with airlines, large international businesses, and also anybody interested in investing in the tourism sector in Ecuador, which offers a high return over the medium to long term, and a great sector growth margin. Ecuador is a unique country in the world, and as one of our last campaign slogans remarks, we are the “Best of South America."</p><h4>Is Ecuador also looking into business and MICE tourism?</h4><p>This is a segment we are very interested in strengthening in the near future in our country. At the moment, two convention centers are being built in Quito and Guayaquil, and Ecuador is hosting a number of important conventions and conferences in 2012. As for business tourism, this is a segment that has considerably grown at the Latin American level, and as we keep attracting foreign investment into our country, this type of tourism will also continue grow. In fact, the business segment experienced the most important growth during the first quarter of 2012.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the tourism sector in 2012?</h4><p>This is going to be a very important year for the tourism industry in Ecuador. There are private projects in the sector worth $600 million, and an airport project in Manta, which could become the most important transcontinental infrastructure in the region: an open door into the region for Asian countries. We are also developing the most spectacular journey by train—the Quito-Guayaquil route—that will be inaugurated at the end of 2012 and even boast a steam train like the Orient Express. Investment in this project is around $300 million. Our growth predictions for 2012 were around 7%-8%, and we closed the first quarter of the year with 15% growth, a prelude of the importance of 2012 for the sector. In terms of markets, we are focusing on increasing the number of visitors from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and especially Brazil, because at the moment there are no direct flights between the two countries, and we are currently holding talks with different airlines to establish direct flights. This will also be an important year to open up Asian markets for Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-event-horizon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Guayaquil Convention Center is located in the city's former airport. Why did you decide on this location, and how was it possible to turn it into a convention center?<br></h4><p>It was possible due to the infrastructure that has been developed over the last 20 years in the city. Guayaquil is a very modern city, with many interesting places to visit, as well as several historical spots. Guayaquil thus attracted private investment within the tourism industry, including new hotels and restaurants.</p><p>Guayaquil used to have a small but successful trade show and fair venue. In 2005, several businessmen started to think that it was about time for the city to have a convention center that met international standards. Afterward, the mayor started to look for entrepreneurs, and these few decided to invest. That is how the convention center was built. We opened our doors four and a half years ago. Becoming an important, regional international hub for conventions and corporate tourism takes a while. In the meantime, we have tried to expand local demand. If you look at our competitors, they have not decreased their sales. However, we are number one in market share for all kinds of events, and our share of the market overall is 40%. However, none of our competitors have decreased their volumes. That means that overall demand has expanded no less than 25% per year over the last four years. Conventions have more than doubled in the last three or four years. Meanwhile, we have been working toward becoming an important hub for conventions.</p><h4>Which markets do you target as a priority?</h4><p>Instead of countries, we target sectors. For instance, logistics is a very important sector. That's why we created the Logistics and Foreign Trade Exposition &amp; Conference. Besides being a convention center administrator and operator, we are also an event promoter. We have been trying to promote the kind of events that were non-existent in the city. The first two years we promoted and invested in live concerts on our own. This was due to the fact that Quito had 70% of the musical shows in Ecuador, whereas Guayaquil had 15%. We have achieved the role of increasing that percentage in the last three or four years. This year we have booked maybe 150% more concerts than last year. Over the last two years we have been focusing our efforts on creating and selling trade shows and conventions. Why and how we decide what sector to develop an event for is due to our competitive advantages as a company and as a city.</p><p>Logistics is a sector that has grown tremendously in Guayaquil in the last decade. In 2000 we had one public port with 10 piers, and now we have more than five ports, almost all of them private. Altogether, we have 20 piers.</p><h4>Is there any international event that you dream can someday be organized in Guayaquil?</h4><p>Our dream is to have one international world convention every month, meaning a convention of no less than 1,000 to 1,500 people. That is our vision for 2015.</p><p>One of our strengths is diversification. Our biggest customer represents less than 10% of our total sales, and not one single type of event represents more than 30% of our total sales. Trade shows are up almost 20%, congresses are up 10%, and conventions are also up 10%. We want to keep it like that.</p><h4>Do you plan to expand your facilities or make investments in the near future?</h4><p>We have not stopped investing since we opened. We started with trade show facilities. Then, we built a convention room. We developed an office facility within the building a couple of years later, building 9,000 sqm of offices, and targeting companies related to our industry. That strategy was intended to bring in business allies and potential partners. For example, there is CORPEI, an agency that organizes trade meetings and commercial missions. It has become not just a customer but an associate. We also have audio and video companies in our office building, as well as event organizers, among others. That's how we fulfill our service promise to our customers to be a one-stop-shop facility. Last year, we invested heavily in technology. The latest investments included state-of-the-art software for rooms, spaces, inventory, as well as other sophisticated software and hardware. From June 2012, we will be able to tell a customer how many people are in attendance, at what time they entered the trade show, at what time they left, and how many minutes they stopped at particular stands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did POSCO decide to invest in Ecuador and SANTOS CMI?</h4><p>Group is interested in expanding its presence in world markets with high potential and currently one of the most interesting regions is Latin America. POSCO already had important presence in Latin America; it invested in a steel production facility in Mexico, in addition to joint ventures with US Steel Corporation and Valle in Brazil. The engineering and construction branch of POSCO—POSCO E&amp;C—has a successful track record in this part of the world, including Chile, Peru and Brazil, where the company recently executed a large steel mill project. The leaders at POSCO understood the potential of the region and decided to strengthen the group's strategic presence by acquiring a regional engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company in Latin America. SANTOS CMI is a company with more than 12 years of international experience working in EPC projects in 19 Latin American countries; therefore, it was a good fit for POSCO E&amp;C. In February of 2011, POSCO E&amp;C acquired a 70% share in SANTOS CMI. It was the first acquisition of a Latin American EPC company by an engineering and construction firm from South Korea.</p><h4>What projects is the company working on currently?</h4><p>In Ecuador, we are working on the overhaul of the Esmeraldas Refinery as a sub-contractor of another South Korean company, SK E&amp;C. We are pursuing other work at the Esmeraldas Refinery and several projects for Petroamazonas EP, which is a valuable client for us in Ecuador. We are also monitoring with interest the Refinery of the Pacific project, for which the Ecuadorean government is still seeking a strategic partner and the required financing. However, I believe that if the government succeeds in this venture, it will generate significant opportunities for engineering and construction firms in Ecuador. We will certainly be very interested in participating in such a project.</p><h4>What are the main projects that the company is involved in internationally?</h4><p>We are participating in three important projects in Peru, which will generate approximately 2,200 MW of electricity. These are thermal-electrical generation facilities, and these projects make SANTOS CMI one of the largest EPC contractors for electrical work in Peru. We are also participating in important projects with POSCO E&amp;C in Brazil, which is building a steel mill in the state of Ceará in Brazil's northeast. We recently completed two power plants in Chile and a 200 MW thermal-electrical facility in Costa Rica.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations in terms of growth and turnover for Pronobis in 2012?<br></h4><p>The budget framework approved by the board includes investments of $70 million over 2012 alone. We have 12 major projects underway in Guayaquil, Manta, and Machala, which enable us to have a very diversified portfolio, including housing, offices, industry complexes, shopping centers, and tourism facilities—all in line with current market requirements. The Puerta del Sol, Torre del Sol in Machala, and the riverfront suites in Guayaquil are some of the unique and exclusive projects we are finishing. These are projects that we are very proud of, as they are magnificent in form, as well as sustainable and environmentally friendly. Finally, we are also working on a three-year strategic plan to optimize the capabilities and operational models of our company to make it more efficient and innovative.</p><h4>What is Pronobis' expansion strategy?</h4><p>We are strongly focused on development projects in Quito, where we are working on the Ciudad del Sol, an initiative that includes public-private partnerships and is intended to boost the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute's (IESS) portfolio. It is a mega project of over 25,000 sqm and $250 million in value that includes six towers; one will be a hotel, another will be dedicated to provide health services, three housing blocks, and one building for offices.</p><h4>What is the state of the sector?</h4><p>The dollarization of the economy served as a great catalyst for both supply and demand in the real estate sector. Lower inflation and interest rates, and a greater availability of credit to finance medium- and long-term housing generated a favorable situation for the construction sector. Buyers with growing purchasing power and higher demand are becoming more common. The breadth of choice available in the market is very broad and the bargaining power is gradually shifting from the developer to the buyer. This is a sign that points to a mature market, which forces us to be innovative in our product offering, while  remaining very efficient in our design and construction processes.</p><h4>How would you assess the urban renewal project Guayaquil is implementing?</h4><p>It is a complete success, as it has been recognized both nationally and internationally. It has positively contributed to the development of tourism and the resurgence of services associated with this industry; only in 2011, the number of foreigners visiting our city grew around 7% as compared to 2010, exceeding 300,000. Thanks to the actions implemented within the urban renewal plan, Guayaquil is today a benchmark in the region not only in tourism but also in security, as well as in the collection and disposal of solid waste, all very important aspects in the process of the integral transformation of a city.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the construction sector for 2012?</h4><p>The construction sector grew 6.7% in 2010 and 14% in 2011. Although 2012 brings lower growth rate expectations, we believe that we will close the year with growth above 5.5%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is the model of pre-paid health care so successful in Ecuador?<br></h4><p>Ecuador is a country with a population of 13 million people. Although we are not an official insurance company, we call ourselves a private health insurance company because we follow a similar business model. No more than 700,000 people are insured in the country, which is a very low percentage. From that point of view, pre-paid health care has not been extremely successful, but it has been very good for our company. Currently, we have a 40% market share, and we continue to develop several other segments of the market.</p><h4>What are the company's competitive advantages against regular insurance companies?</h4><p>There are similarities and differences. Our 40% market share is a result of our experience in the business; we have been in the market for 18 years, and Salud S.A. was born as a health insurance company. In the 1990s, health insurance companies only offered coverage to corporates, and our clients were companies that needed coverage for their employees. Now, we have developed a new branch of business for individuals. Even though we provide services to a large network, we give the customers the freedom to choose whatever doctor, hospital, or laboratory they wish. We offer advice, but they make their own choices.</p><h4>Salud S.A. also has medical centers and doctors. How have you developed this?</h4><p>We discovered that the provider business was very interesting, and that it would be profitable for us to have our own clinical centers available to customers. Sauld S.A. launched its first clinic in Quito eight years ago, and now has 10 centers. We direct about 50% of customers using ambulatory services to these centers, and when we give customers options, many choose us. In our network, there is more control in terms of medicines and examinations. In Ecuador, some doctors prescribe to patients using too many tests that are not necessary to explain symptoms such as a simple headache. Our strategy was to target the middle of the spectrum, and we answer to the needs of customers belonging to lower socio-economic levels. We have insured 300,000 people so far.</p><h4>How large is your network and how is it expanding?</h4><p>We have about 1,000 doctors in the country, but our network is not growing very much annually. There is certainly room for growth, which is good for the businesses in the sector. We do not seek to attract new providers and doctors to the network because there is simply not enough demand. Therefore, we are very selective and are even considering reducing the network. Approximately 80% of the patients are seen by 400 of our doctors. It our job to manage this issue.</p><h4>Do you provide services countrywide?</h4><p>Our clients can seek healthcare services from any location in Ecuador, and they also receive reimbursements if they are treated overseas. For example, if a patient receives medical attention in the US and the consultation fee is $300, our plan will reimburse the patient for $50. We also offer products that cover everything. In terms of income, 70% of our business comes from individuals, and 30% is sourced from companies.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the evolution of the market over the past few years?</h4><p>The most significant element is the Social Security Institute (IESS). Three or four years ago, people were very upset about the poor social security coverage, which opened up opportunities for us. Social security was so unsatisfactory that people began to seek private health insurance. Over time, this shifted to opportunities in hospitalization coverage, and now we are developing products that address this segment of the business. Four years ago, IESS required patients to receive treatment at specific centers, but now coverage has expanded to almost any hospital in the country. The middle and upper classes do not view IESS as an alternative to private insurance, so Salud S.A. has not lost any clients. However, in the future some individuals or companies might question how necessary it is to have private insurance, when by law the IESS provides fairly good coverage. In any case, the private sector is growing, registering a 6% increase sector wide. Our business grew by 10%, and we are seeing new hospitals and investments.</p><h4>Since your model has been successful in Ecuador, do you plan to export it?</h4><p>We have been analyzing businesses in different countries, and began investing in Costa Rica two years ago. However, we were tackling highly regulated and complicated markets. The investments required were too large and the returns were too small. Salud S.A. also focused efforts on Houston. We attempted to sell our model to the Hispanic community, but due to the disproportionate amount of illegal immigrants, it was nearly impossible. We have recently made the decision to launch operations in Peru, and will be opening our business geared toward the lower socio-economic segment. Our first product will cost roughly $3 per person. Through a joint venture with an Ecuadorean bank, we will test our model in Peru.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Semaica different from its competitors in the civil engineering field?<br></h4><p>We are a very unique company that specializes in many areas. We are a civil engineering enterprise that operates in many different divisions such as tunneling, hotels, high-rise buildings, and water treatment plants. Most of our projects have been carried out in Ecuador. If you travel to Guayaquil, you will go through a tunnel built by Semaica. Our largest tunnel was built in Colombia. We focus on private and public construction, such as water treatment plants, hospitals, and hotels. We built the Hilton, the Sheraton, the Marriott, and the Dann Carlton in Ecuador.</p><h4>Which other countries is Semaica active in?</h4><p>We have built a number of bridges in the northern region of Peru. It was very convenient for us to establish operations there. We are also interested in working in Venezuela, in addition to Colombia and Ecuador. However, it is not easy to export our work style. We manage each project as if were a different firm.</p><h4>Does Semaica have a set model for its operations?</h4><p>The head engineer on each project is in charge of the operation. For example, we do not purchase materials centrally. It is a unique model, but we firmly believe that each manager should decide how to present their project. This system is very different from other companies. It may not be driving profits, but we feel this style has helped us become more efficient with our clientele.</p><h4>Was it difficult for your partners to adapt to your philosophy?</h4><p>We have been involved in huge projects that we carried out with many other companies, and they used their own systems for those projects. Previously, many of the international companies from Spain, Brazil, or Canada, for example, thought that they needed to bring their engineers and specialists to Ecuador. Since then, they have realized that only the general manager, technician, and the accounting staff are necessary. The rest of the workforce is Ecuadorean, because our engineers are very skilled. I am proud of the fact that we have managed to operate with very little outside help.</p><h4>What does Semaica offer to its partners?</h4><p>We can contribute invaluable expertise in terms of labor availability, government regulations, and engineering. Semaica boasts very talented staff.</p><h4>What is the nature of working with the Ecuadorean government on large projects?</h4><p>In order to work on government projects, a company must be dependable. Previously, government projects could be delayed without any negative consequences. That outcome has become impossible. Companies are obligated to keep their promises to a government that has begun to emphasize faster growth. International companies will be surprised to find that the government is very strict. The public sector has grown to be stricter than the private sector.</p><h4>What large projects is Semaica involved in?</h4><p>Semaica is currently carrying out a hydroelectric project, scheduled for completion in 2012. It was designed and built by Ecuadoreans. Although the turbines were imported from Spain, the manufacturing and construction was carried out domestically. Another project underway is a dam in Tungurahua. It will be the second dam in the area. The dams have provided water to the whole province, which is very industrialized. We are working at 4,500 meters, and it is very difficult.</p><h4>What projects is Semaica working on in terms of housing?</h4><p>We are leading a private project that was bought by the government. It includes 49 sqm of housing per unit sold for $12,000. The residences are located in a strategic area, and the project will house 8,000 families. Currently, we are working on the first 2,000 units.</p><h4>What is Semaica's strategy for decreasing prices while increasing quality?</h4><p>The system we use makes efficient use of the available labor. There are many models we can import from the US or Europe, but they will not offer labor to the people purchasing the houses. In Guayaquil we are offering work to the people who will live there. The advantage is that the employees are eager to produce a high-quality output, as they are building their own houses. It is a very interesting and effective strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas will the company invest, and how will this improve production?<br></h4><p>The investments will be made between 2011 and 2012, and about $35 million will be used for increasing the grinding capacity and the cement dispatch. This work will consist of a complete installation from the raw material hangar, a pozzolana drying and dosage system, a 200 tons-per-hour tubular mill, a cement storage silo with five compartments of 15,000 tons each, an automatic 12-slot baler, and an ultra modern pallet system. The installed capacity is 800,000 tons of cement annually, and we can currently produce 330,000 tons a year. By eliminating some obsolete equipment, our capacity can triple to reach 1 million tons per year. Other investments are geared toward the construction of a new technical-administrative center with intelligent operations for $2.2 million, since the previous facility was demolished to make space for new installations. The remaining $6 million will be invested in the adaptation of roads and access networks, process control, lighting, and services, such as energy, compressed air, and water.</p><h4>Chimborazo looks to join the public company Cementos Guapán to improve market participation. How will your market share improve after this process?</h4><p>In 2011, the cement market was divided as follows: Holcim with the largest market share reaching 63.5%, followed by Lafarge with 22.4%, Guapán Industries with 7.8% and Cemento Chimborazo with 5.9%. Evidently, the two smaller companies that have a combined market share of 13.7% should unite to be able to compete by creating synergies. It is more necessary for Guapán since it doesn't have a nearby limestone source, which is the main raw material; therefore, its high production costs make the company less competitive. With the production improvements projected for both companies, we expect to surpass a 20% market share by 2013.</p><h4>Cemento Chimborazo is the main employer in the province. How has the company's restructuring affected employment?</h4><p>It will definitely improve the employment situation of the province. In stage one alone we will be requiring 250 additional workers. Because we will maintain production, we will maintain employment. For the second expansion stage, the demand for labor during the 3-year period construction will be larger.</p><h4>In 2012 the government will start the construction of eight hydroelectric plants. How would you describe the opportunities for the company and the sector?</h4><p>It is an exceptional moment for the industry due to sustained growth in the demand for cement in the past years, at 6.9% annually between 2001 and 2011, and 12.25% between 2007 and 2008. To illustrate this growth, August 2011 sales figures jumped 10% compared to 2010, which was a historical record for monthly cement sales in the country. To emphasize the demand peak, the monthly average of delivery in the first six months of 2011 was 441 million tons and in August we delivered 531 million tons, which means an increase of 25%.</p><h4>What new innovations and projects do you plan to introduce to the market in the near future?</h4><p>We invested $12 million in the Fábrica Ecuatoriana de Prefabricados de Hormigón, and in the beginning it was designed to manufacture one product only—concrete sleepers for the rehabilitation of the Ecuadorean railroad—a project that will be completed in September 2012. A personnel restructuring was carried out in order to adapt to the demand. Therefore, a reconversion of the production unit is an urgent requirement, which will be separated from Cemento Chimborazo to be constituted as an independent entity in 2012. The long-bedplate adopted technology allows a degree of reconversion from the current production unit. The shed with the cement mixer will be kept, and new molds will be installed for the production of pre-manufactured elements for construction, particularly for port panels destined for public buildings such as schools. We are working with the Instituto de Contratación de Obras (ICO) to define the constructive elements that will surely constitute an innovation for the country. We expect to have this reconversion done by the 4Q2012, aiming to deliver the first pre-manufactured elements in October.</p><h4>What are your forecasts and main objectives for 2012?</h4><p>We are working to finish the first stage of the cement factory expansion and consolidate the profitability levels of the company, which have been improving spectacularly since 2008. We also aim to implement synergies with Guapán Industries and settle the inclusion of a strategic partner for the second expansion stage. Meanwhile, we expect to separate the pre-manufacturing unit and settle its reconversion to manufacture construction elements, as well as increase the company's socio-environmental commitment in the region and the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[la-victoria-de-guayaquil]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has TAGSA brought to José Joaquin de Olmedo International Airport?<br></h4><p>On August 1, 2004, TAGSA began the operation and management of Guayaquil Airport, which at that time was named Simon Bolí­var International Airport. In July 2006, we completed its new facilities and initiated operations in the new 50,000-sqm national and international terminals that, prior to the opening, was renamed José Joaquí­n de Olmedo, an important historical figure for Guayaquil. The new facilities allowed us to offer higher quality and better customer services. Since then, we have won several international awards, including a distinction from the Airports Council International (ACI), ranking us as one of the top airports in Latin America and in the world.</p><h4>What makes José Joaquí­n de Olmedo International Airport competitive?</h4><p>When we took over the airport in 2004 it was handling approximately 2.3 million passengers per year; we ended 2011 with around 3.9 million passengers, although this increase is not associated only with the airport, which is one of the main gateways to the country. It is also because the city council and the mayor have made efforts to encourage the flow of more international and domestic passengers to the city. Guayaquil is now being recognized as a tourist destination. We do our work to serve our customers with safety, security, and quality while respecting the environment and considering the local community in terms of social responsibility.</p><h4>How extensive have upgrades to the cargo terminal been?</h4><p>The cost of the project was $4.7 million, financed by private investment, and it has completely transformed the existing terminal. The cargo terminal, according to the law, is under the control of the customs authorities and handles import cargo. The cargo went from a 6,000-sqm facility to a modern 14,000-sqm facility with a supporting structure building of 3,000-sqm next to it. We also built an 800-sqm office facility for the customs authorities to run import operations as smoothly as possible. We work closely with the authorities and private companies, allowing them to perform their activities and duties as well as possible. We also recently opened a new 48,000-sqm concrete platform for cargo planes, with a further investment of approximately $5 million; it provides easier access and allows the entry of larger aircraft, such as the Boeing 747-800.</p><h4>How is the opening of the new airport in Quito going to impact Guayaquil's facilities?</h4><p>The airports of Quito and Guayaquil are complementary because both provide services in the same country, but serve different markets and customers. Air transportation is a business, and business takes place where there is a market for it. As long as there is a market in Guayaquil, people will continue flying here, and the same is true for Quito. It is a mistake to assume that because the airport at Guayaquil is at sea level all airplanes have to go through it only to refuel, and it is also incorrect to assume that because the airport in Quito will have a longer runway and airplanes can take off from it with more weight capacity, the airlines will fly directly from Quito to Europe or other destinations and they will not fly to Guayaquil anymore. Everybody has to understand that the markets are different. For example, a passenger in Quito does not necessarily come to Guayaquil to travel to the US or Europe, and someone who lives in Guayaquil is not going to go to Quito to fly to Europe just because the runway is longer. It is the passenger who decides where to fly, but it is the airlines that decide the route to fly based on commercial issues. For example, at the moment, two different companies that fly from Guayaquil to Europe use different routes. Therefore, there is no technical grounding to say that the construction of the new airport in Quito will affect Guayaquil's international flights. An issue we would face is a drop in passengers in domestic flights between Quito and Guayaquil, because of the location of the new Quito airport. We believe this could cause a decrease of 15% to 20% in passengers. This will not be a cause of a lot of concern, since national airlines landing in Guayaquil pay approximately one-sixth of the amount international airlines pay to land and for other services, giving domestic operators a huge advantage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps is the Andean Nations Community (CAN) taking to achieve global social, political, and environmental integration?<br></h4><p>In the past five years, CAN has faced various challenges and difficulties due to inherent factors in our own region. In February 2010, the Andean Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers and the Commission approved the orienting principles that guide the sub-regional integration process through the “Andean Strategic Agenda," which includes 12 areas. In addition to commercial and economical issues, we discuss social affairs, science and technology, safety, the environment, indigenous issues, tourism, drug trafficking, and culture. Following the Andean Strategic Agenda, and with a boost from the presidency of Bolivia between 2010 and 2011, the “New Andean Strategic Agenda Implementation Plan" was oriented toward the achievement of short-, medium-, and long-term results, in a way that facilitated issue prioritization and the measurement of results. The obtaining of established objectives was grouped, classified, and organized into a hierarchy of general guidelines and orientations; the activities, mechanisms and/or required means, and the expected results from the execution are specified. That's how the work of the General Secretariat has been channeled, with a more purpose-oriented role and with better follow-up tools for the agreements reached by the countries, preserving the gains of the institutional community heritage.</p><h4>What is your opinion about the efforts made by Ecuador to reduce poverty inside its territory?</h4><p>In the years prior to the recent financial crisis—and even during its peak—Ecuador demonstrated solid and responsible macroeconomic management, which has been translated into targeted investments that close the social gap and build infrastructure. In Ecuador's case, the challenge of improving the population's social conditions is even greater than facing restrictions in terms of economic policies, due to a lack of a native currency and no monetary or exchange policies. Moreover, our exports are mainly destined for countries that are in recession, which limits foreign investment. Ecuador's programs against poverty have allowed the country to rank among the top five among nations in the region that have significantly reduced poverty between 2002 and 2010. Both the economic growth of the country (in 2010 it was 3.6% and in 2011 it is estimated to reach 8%) and a variety of public transfer mechanisms have influenced falling poverty rates. With these programs, we emphasized school breakfasts, free tuition and books, support programs for Ecuadoreans with handicaps, and socio-productive programs for people that can overcome poverty based on their own effort.</p><h4>What regulatory framework improvements can be made in regard to energy exchange between members?</h4><p>CAN depends on the “General Framework for Sub-regional Interconnection of Electric Systems and Intercommunity Exchange of Electricity," which has provided a judicial community framework to boost the development of the electricity issue among member countries. In the context of this decision, in March 2003 the electrical interconnection between Colombia and Ecuador was inaugurated, with important benefits for both countries. In November 2009, the application was suspended for a two-year period and an integral revision of its content was instructed, with the objective of establishing a new general framework for electricity exchanges between Andean countries. Because the Andean regulation was the framework through which the electricity exchange between Colombia and Ecuador was based, we established a transitory regime for these exchanges. Recently, Peru and Ecuador asked that through the Andean framework the faculties granted to Colombia and Ecuador were extended to them to subscribe electricity exchange agreements, with a transitory regime character. The Andean authorities that coordinate the electricity interchange in CAN are the Regulatory Organisms Work Group and the Andean Committee of Regulatory Organisms of Electricity service.</p><p>These forums operate with the participation of Chile. In August 2011, these authorities agreed on the terms of a new decision, designed to replace the previous regulations. The rule includes a temporary regime for electricity exchanges between Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and facilitates electricity exchange in the region, in the perspective of a general framework for the sub-regional interconnection of electrical systems in which principles and general rules are established to include every Andean country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main challenges has the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) faced since its establishment?<br></h4><p>We experienced several challenges while laying the foundations of UNASUR, including the drafting of a treaty to be approved by every country, structuring a budget, and building a network of officials. These were the first steps of a very ambitious political project shaped in the style of the EU—the concept of establishing UNASUR was based on the creation of a union that would include every South American country. It was very important for us to keep in mind this initial goal and the ideas that were developed by the leaders of the region almost eight years ago. In fact, I would like to mention that our previous General Secretary and former President of Argentina Néstor Kirchner contributed heavily to the organization. In general, 2012 will be a year in which we focus on establishing agendas, working committees, and economic and social priorities for the organization and region as a whole.</p><h4>How does UNASUR complement other regional treaties and processes such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and Organization of American States (OAS)?</h4><p>UNASUR was born at a different political conjuncture, and organizations such as the Common Southern Market (MERCOSUR) and the Andean Community primarily deal with the commercial and trading union of the states. In this regard, UNASUR aims to summarize the political and social union of the South American states, something that was already in the minds of our ancestors, such as General Simón Bolí­var. I am confident that over the next few years the organization will take decisive steps toward handling issues of defense, economy and finance, infrastructure, energy, and health for the social union of South American states. I believe that this is what makes us unique and able to perfectly complement other organizations such as CELAC, which includes all Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p><h4>What has been Ecuador's main contribution to UNASUR?</h4><p>Ecuador has positively contributed to the establishment of UNASUR, especially during its term as president from 2009 to 2010, when Ecuador importantly contributed to institutional strengthening and the promotion of a constituency treaty that was approved at a regional level. Ecuador set a very positive example in terms leadership at all levels of the organization, especially when the region was affected by problems in locations such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Haiti. Ecuador focused its efforts on making our dream possible, and I believe the organization took a vital turn after Ecuador's presidency. To demonstrate the country's leadership and key role in the development of the organization, UNASUR's headquarters are currently located in Quito.</p><h4>What is the state of development of the economic and financial union in the region and the establishment of the Bank of the South?</h4><p>Due to the global recession, regional political leaders called for the unification of economic positions in order to preserve the interests of the continent, starting with foreign exchange reserve management, which has enabled the region to raise more than $750 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Regarding the Bank of the South, though it does not belong to the institutional body of the organization, it will be a key element to further promote the economic and financial union of South America, and we expect that it will begin operating in 2013.</p><h4>What are UNASUR's greatest achievements since it came into operation one year ago?</h4><p>Over the last year, we have established several committees regarding defense, drugs, health care, society, economy, infrastructure, energy, education, and technology. The institutionalization of the organization and its committees is one of the main achievements of UNASUR. These committees are formed by ministers from relevant portfolios, which facilitates the implementation of the measures agreed upon at the international level. Personally, I believe that the South American Council of Defense is UNASUR's greatest achievement thus far; its establishment has contributed to the development of many common and joint strategies in a field where South America previously lacked unity. I think that it is important to mention the South American Council of Infrastructure Planning, an organization that has enabled the region to prioritize infrastructure projects that will boost development and integration. We also need to strengthen our work regarding the very important issue of poverty, because 30 million South American people still live in dire conditions. However, we have achieved a lot and the future is brighter for South America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the US play in Ecuador's foreign policy agenda?<br></h4><p>First of all, Ecuador is interested in promoting a positive and constructive relationship with all countries around the word. The US is a key Ecuadorean partner in many issues. The first issue is human mobility. Many Ecuadoreans decided to emigrate to the US after the Ecuadorean financial crisis of 1998 and 1999, looking for jobs and opportunities. The first wave of immigrants attracted other Ecuadoreans, and now there are about 1.5 million Ecuadoreans living in the US. This has led to a real economic, cultural, and social integration between Ecuadoreans and the US communities that have welcomed them. In this group of immigrants, we also see vulnerable groups that deserve our special attention. Therefore, immigration, reform, family reunification, and the protection of migrants' rights are important aspects of the bilateral agenda with the US. Ecuadorean immigrant remittances used to be 8% of GDP and were a strong boost to the Ecuadorean economy, a factor that has changed since President Correa took office. Because of the international crisis, this figure declined to 4%. This is due to the strengthening of the Ecuadorean economy, whose revenues have diversified and multiplied by improved efficiency in oil production and tax collection, and because the private sector's contribution has grown, fostered by public policies implemented by the Ecuadorean government. In addition, there are many US citizens who have chosen Ecuadorean cities as their retirement destinations, attracted by benefits the Ecuadorean government has put in place for seniors. Many students travel to Ecuador as part of university exchange programs, and many US companies also operate in Ecuador. This situation has generated strong ties that unite the people of both countries.</p><h4>What are the terms for a future trade agreement between Ecuador and the US?</h4><p>Bilateral trade is the second most important element in the relationship. The US remains Ecuador's largest trading partner. Growing this market is a central issue in our bilateral agenda. The US market, with over 300 million consumers, has great potential to absorb Ecuadorean export diversification and support government programs to incorporate new, productive sectors—especially those designed to include the vulnerable economic groups and generate better employment opportunities, investment, and development. One important element is to strengthen cooperation with academic institutions and the US private sector in order to attract research and investment programs that seek to foster change in our production matrix and leap technologically to add value to our production and services. I think we can develop important strategic alliances. Ecuador exports to the US market through a most favored nation (MFN) understanding, covering 77% of total non-oil exports, the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), a unilateral tariff preferences program covering 22% of non-oil exports, and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), another unilateral tariff program that covers the remaining 1%. ATPDEA has been extended until July 2013. In the short term, my job is to find an alternative trade mechanism or agreement for the products covered by ATPDEA. It should be noted that many items contained in ATPDEA are also covered by the GSP. In the medium term, Ecuador has expressed its interest in signing trade agreements for development with its major trading partners, which take into consideration the asymmetry of development, allow us to implement our industrial policies, and consider the vulnerability of certain economic sectors that may be affected by an immediate liberalization of commerce. The Ecuadorean government believes that a strong economic inclusion policy should accompany the process of trade liberalization.</p><h4>What is the potential for the further development of technology transfer from the US?</h4><p>Ecuador has great potential in several sectors such as software, biotechnology, tourism, oil, mining, and logistics, among others. Besides being competitive, we have recently implemented several fiscal incentives to attract foreign investment and technology transfer to these sectors. Also, the government has invested very important resources in modernizing our infrastructure and human resource training and has also invested in science and technology. The government has invested in major infrastructure projects to further integrate the country with a modern network of highways, airports, ports, and bridges, as well as hydroelectric plants. We have also implemented policies to enhance the quality of education from elementary until post-graduate programs, and implemented programs to attract researchers to our universities. Regarding fiscal incentives, new investment in key sectors will take advantage of a tax holiday haven for the first five years. We are also implementing new economic development zones with an emphasis on technology transfer, exports, and industrialized products and logistics. These zones have additional fiscal incentives for up to 25 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have propelled Ecuador's economic growth beyond initial analyst estimates?<br></h4><p>Ecuador's trade balance for 2011 surpassed even our own initial forecasts. The economic growth was 7.8% for 2011. This level of growth is very important for the country, and it reflects the global trading conditions that have favored this region, especially in terms of primary exports. The behavior of the oil market was of course important, but our analyses show that public and private investment accounted for 46% of the growth figure. Increased private consumption was definitely a factor; however, the dynamism of the non-oil sector and investments made in the real economy also helped support growth. In 2011, the non-oil sector grew 8.8%. Public investment has helped boost the economy in a counter-cyclical style as a medium-term solution to maintain growth in the face of international uncertainties. As a result of our proactive policies, Ecuador's economy was less affected by the pressure of the global financial crisis.</p><h4>What is the government's strategy to make this positive growth trend sustainable?</h4><p>There are two main policy lines regarding expenditures. The first is the income redistribution process, through which we carry out proactive policies to boost education, health care, and other welfare initiatives. This line of policy is sustainable because such expenses are recurrent. To support this process, we have implemented an active fiscal policy, involving both income and expenses through a redistributive focus that aims to make long-term investments in society through our own means. Therefore, financing policies have gone hand-in-hand with all of the fiscal reforms we have implemented, and these help guarantee the sustainability of recurrent expenses over the long term. The second main policy line concerning expenditure is that of investment.</p><h4>How much public investment are you looking to devote to economic development in 2012?</h4><p>Investment in the non-finance public sector will total around $9.7 billion, which is a significant level for an economy of this size. Ecuador has never seen this level of investment before, and it represents an important bet on changes to the energy matrix, road network, logistics, and social services infrastructure. This will entail a public investment of over 13% of GDP, which is significantly higher than the average for other Latin American states. Other sectors that will be directly affected by these investments include construction, electricity, transport, and oil and gas. The government aims to make large investments in the oil and gas sector that will target the development of refineries, oil wells, and alliances with the private sector in order to develop service contracts.</p><h4>What are the government's expectations for foreign investment in 2012?</h4><p>Foreign investment increased significantly in year-on-year terms over 2011, though we expect FDI to expand even more rapidly in the near future. We closed the year with over $300 million in FDI, and we expect a continuation of the historic trend of such investments being directed toward the energy sector. Foreign investments are typically allocated toward large strategic projects, and this year we will develop several programs to satisfy the needs of investors. We expect a significant increase in foreign investment over the medium term, although it is difficult to make solid estimates at present owing to the state of the global economy. Multilateral organizations that provide the financing for large-scale projects include the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the La Caixa Foundation (FLAC), and the Latin American Development Bank (CAF), and Ecuador is opening up new lines with these institutions in 2012.</p><h4>Which markets have the most potential for expansion in order to support economic growth?</h4><p>We are experiencing a moment of absolute openness in the exploration of new markets. Ecuador demonstrates very traditional behavior in terms of its commercial relations, and we are very open to the world and our own region. We have to actively begin developing new markets. Outside the region, we have maintained an open attitude. In fact, more than 20 trade offices have been opened, and we have transformed the profile of consular staff in order for them to be more active in commercial terms, in addition to their diplomatic and political duties. We are proactive in terms of conducting market research, promoting our country, selling our products, and seeking smarter options for our exports. We also expect to continue negotiations with Europe, as the government is open to negotiations, though there are certain red lines we cannot cross. We defend our sensitive currency system, which requires a lot of care and seriousness in the management of our balance of payments and trade balance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What should be the role of multilateral organisms such as CAF?<br></h4><p>At a time in which the global economy is going through a period of uncertainty, Latin America still shows good results in terms of growth and macroeconomic stability, despite the external vulnerabilities of the European crisis, the slow US recovery, and the deceleration in China. This is due to a combination of factors, both external and internal, and the sensible macroeconomic policies implemented in most Latin American countries. This situation suggests large challenges for the region that require the construction of integral agendas that include four crucial issues simultaneously: macroeconomic stability, microeconomic efficiency, social equity, and environmental balance. The region must reach growth rates higher than the current ones, for which an accelerated productive transformation process, higher levels of investment, and more solid institutionalism are essential.</p><h4>What are the essential elements that both Ecuador and Latin America need for development in the medium and long term?</h4><p>Among the challenges that the region will face in this new situation, it is vital to give up the concentration of raw material exports and diversify the economy. This demands that the region doesn't fall into a contented mode and focuses on an ambitious agenda to overcome the structural weaknesses that it still faces. Particularly important is the productive transformation that is going on through sustained increases in productivity and profits. In this direction, a fundamental challenge is the addition of value to the natural advantages that the region possesses through technological development and human capital training. Another no less important challenge is the adaptation and development of infrastructure for regional integration, in order to boost the advantages that growing commerce with Asia is offering. For that, the challenge is to channel resources by increasing savings and domestic investment, and strategic incentives in foreign investment. To achieve these objectives, the region must keep working on improving the business environment for the private sector and the quality of their institutions. Although the reduction of poverty is one of the biggest accomplishments that Latin America has achieved in the past years, and a product of favorable economic performance, there are still important issues, mainly in terms of income distribution. In that sense it is indispensable to work on a wide and innovative social agenda that helps in reducing the high inequality levels that can still be found in the region.</p><h4>What strategies do you plan to implement in 2012 to promote productive activity and SME support in Ecuador?</h4><p>The CAF's contribution to SMEs is through projects that help promote the development and competitiveness of the sector and at the same time promote export diversification and generate employment—both direct and indirect—in rural communities that are below the region's poverty line. An example of this in Ecuador is the promotion of the Program of Local Productive Crowds, the objective of which is the creation of competitive advantages for the development of SMEs in the productive sectors of Cuenca. This will strengthen the electric appliance and wooden furniture industries, which draw together a significant amount of developing companies, through articulating work between national and local government, the entrepreneurial sector, and the academic sector of the city.</p><h4>How does CAF plan to facilitate the development of the stock market in Ecuador?</h4><p>The CAF support policy for stock market development is framed by regional integration and market efficiency, through supporting its country members in the design of public policies, its formalization and implementation. CAF, together with Quito's Stock Market, and with the institutional sponsorship of the Financial Analysis Unit, recently presented the documents generated in the framework of the project for the modernization of stock markets: Module: Asset Laundering Prevention. To conduct this study, prominent national and foreign consultants were selected to carry out research about the laws in different markets and the practices and reports demanded by financial intelligence entities. On this basis, two documents were elaborated as references in the prevention of asset laundering for the stock market. Additionally, CAF has promoted other projects in Ecuador to modernize the stock market such as the creation of the Corporate Governance Academic Unit, with the objective of deepening the stock market development through the implementation of processes and mechanisms that improve efficiency and effectiveness as well as generate investor trust. The program has also allowed the creation of an academic network of corporate governance and the promotion of a stock market culture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute Bank (BIESS) achieved in the last 12 months of operations?</h4><p>The last 12 months have been very positive; we have not only achieved all of our planned goals, but surpassed them. Our operations in 2011 were 60% higher than the previous year. We have generated an increase in construction through mortgage loans and consumer credit. We have allocated a total of $1.6 billion in mortgage loans, starting in June 2008 with the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute (IESS), and now as BIESS. Our portfolio of unsecured loans is close to $1.2 billion, which makes us one of the most important players in the market.</p><h4>How was the transition process from IESS to BIESS, and why was the decision made to change from one type of institution to the other?</h4><p>The IESS is a tremendously large institution with a lot of responsibilities and unlimited requirements, because it has to attend to one of the most basic human needs, which is health. Years ago, the IESS health service was inadequate, and the improvements that have been implemented over the last four years are helping people to trust the IESS again. This has generated more pressure on those services, which have already been improved, to keep improving, and it is very hard to close the gap. An institution with such a large operating budget has to invest time in the management of its finances, but all of the IESS' time was taken up with the managing of health services. Therefore, the need arose to separate the financial part and house it in a dedicated financial institution, hence the bank.</p><h4>To what extent are you involved in investment banking?</h4><p>We are very active and firm believers in the stock market. We expected to end 2011 with funds amounting to $7.8 billion, of which 40% is dedicated to the public sector. These are investments that have been made in the public sector, especially in bonds issued by the Ecuadorean government. We have invested a total of $3.3 billion. Our trend has been to decrease investment in bonds and increase our investment in strategic government projects such as the oil project in Pañacocha, in which we invested $135 million. Another is a thermoelectric project that will help to produce electric power in the drought season so we won't suffer any more blackouts; we have invested $130 million in that project. There is also the hydroelectric project at Toachi-Platón, which will demand an investment of $250 million, of which we have already disbursed $100 million.</p><h4>What is your investment plan for 2012?</h4><p>We plan to continue growing our mortgage loan portfolio, but not at the 45% growth rate we saw in 2011. In 2012 we plan to grant $900 million in mortgage loans; in 2011 we granted $750 million. The other important item is consumer credit; we plan to allocate $1 billion in 2012. We also have a very small portfolio of pledge loans having to do with jewelry and gold items, which is a service we provide for the entire community. I actually see it as a social responsibility issue, because we attend to people that are not necessarily affiliated with social security but who require emergency loans of small amounts, $400 on average. They come and leave their jewelry, and they receive a six-month loan at a 20% annual interest rate, which is lower than the ones usually found in this type of businesses. We also plan to invest $300 million in the stock market in 2012.</p><h4>Do you always invest in sectors you consider strategic?</h4><p>Even though we aren't dependent upon the general government budget, we are aligned with President Correa's policies. Therefore, we don't invest in sectors that increase the budget deficit, such as the automobile and electronics industries, because these products are mostly imported. We invest in companies that generate employment. For example, in 2011 we invested in Industrias Ales, which is a 40-year-old Ecuadorean company, we have shares in La Favorita, and recently we purchased a stake in Industrias Lácteas TONI. In 2011 we invested a total of approximately $260 million, and in 2012 we plan to invest $300 million.</p><h4>Do you have a vision for the future of supporting international investment in strategic sectors?</h4><p>We work with some foreign companies indirectly; for example, we invested $25 million in Nestlé's operations. We do have a vision of supporting foreign companies that operate here. We are working on a $600 million portfolio of commercial documents from companies with AAA ratings. Our goal is to allocate it outside, in international markets, as a way of attracting international resources to the country.</p><h4>What has your non-performing loan (NPL) rate been?</h4><p>In order to answer that, I first need to explain how the bank operates, because if I were to tell you, you wouldn't believe me. Our rate of delinquency is zero. We have granted 42,000 mortgage loans and of those, we have only had problems with nine. Of those, eight have found solutions; there has only been one mortgagee who said, “Keep the house." Why does this happen? First, the defaulters have been unemployed, because as long as our clients have a job the payments of the loan are deducted directly from their paychecks. This is an advantage that no other bank offers. For our consumer loans the delinquency rate is also zero, because if a client doesn't pay for three months we take the payment out of their reserve funds or severance funds. This is the way all our loans work.</p><h4>With that advantage, as well as the advantage of being able to offer loans at such low rates, how can the private banking sector compete with you?</h4><p>We function to complement the private banking sector. For example, we don't finance cars, although people do ask for that service; there's another sector that specializes in that. Years ago, it was very difficult to get a mortgage loan for longer than seven years in this country. If you got one for 10 years it was because you had a lot of influence inside the financial sector. So, we launched 10-, 15-, and 25-year mortgage loans, which private banks cannot offer. It's true that this bank offers a lot of benefits, but it has to look for market niches in which to operate. Another factor is that most of our loans are for amounts of $35,000 or less, something that the private banks don't offer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the FDI environment developed recently?<br></h4><p>There has been a slowdown in terms of new FDI because of various policies. However, there are some transactions happening elsewhere, through a different kind of FDI. We have seen investment in some mature industries. For example, there have been several high-level acquisitions, and, despite being worried, Canadian and US companies are still investing in the mining sector. There is also a housing boom in Ecuador because of government spending.</p><h4>How is the financial sector responding to the country's situation?</h4><p>The financial sector is responding well. Before dollarization we had a big crisis—a banking crisis—and the reason was because there was so much money in circulation and the banks became used to making more money on foreign exchange trading than actually lending. In the first quarter of 1999, the banks made 85% of their profits on foreign exchange. Then, when the crisis hit, 70% of the banking system went bankrupt. Dollarization was then imposed in Ecuador and adopted by the Ecuadorean people, who didn't want to have their savings in the sucre, the former currency. The banks then couldn't play in the foreign exchange trade anymore, so they had to adapt to borrowing and lending, and making money on margins. Right now the banking system is much more professional than it used to be.</p><h4>How do you assess the new laws regarding competition and the capital markets?</h4><p>Ecuador needs a competition law and antitrust law. There are many businesses that are vertically integrated that can get away with murder. The problem is that there is too much discretion, so the government has made a law that can be better interpreted. Ecuador is also desperate for a real capital markets law. One of the problems in the Ecuadorean capital markets—in addition to economic policies—is that there has been overregulation.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities for investors in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador is an exotic country where the risks are higher and so are the returns on investment, if you are able to manage the risks. There are many opportunities beyond oil and mining, such as in industry and commerce. We have recently seen the entrance of Sherwin-Williams, Arca, and QBE. These are interesting times, and prices are low, which means that many assets are undervalued. For big multinationals, the risks are not that large. People focus too much on oil and mining, where the investments are huge, but in Ecuador there are other opportunities.</p><h4>What has led to growth in the insurance sector?</h4><p>There are several reasons. First of all, the Ecuadorean market has grown and today it is worth $1.3 billion, which is one of its main points of attractiveness. Secondly, the sector has benefitted from dollarization. There are not yet many multinationals, and the ones that decide to enter now will find a clear landscape and many opportunities. There are opportunities to enter a market that's not saturated and make big profits. New products can also be introduced, especially in life insurance.</p><h4>How would you describe Analytica and its strengths?</h4><p>Analytica is the only investment bank in Ecuador. We do debt restructuring, research, M&amp;As, and trading. We are independent and don't belong to any financial group, and this fact allows us to work with everyone. Analytica is a financial institution with the best research department in the country. It is private and very profitable. We are becoming the main advisors in restructuring, securities, and securitizations, and we are still experts in Ecuadorean external debt, though this is now a very small focus.</p><h4>How do you gain the confidence of your clients?</h4><p>We have to convince boards of directors about the reasons why Ecuador is a good investment. We did a study on Venezuela that demonstrated that despite the left-wing government, Coca-Cola is still the leader in that market. Here in Ecuador, if we take the example of the mining sector, we see new regulations in place that can be taught over time, but at least they exist, and the investors know what to work toward. In that regard, the perceived risk in the country is bigger than the real risk. This is what we explain to investors. Additionally, we have carried out weekly studies for over 10 years. Ours is one of the most credible economic publications that Ecuador has. We have been very honest since the beginning about external debt, and that has given us a lot of credibility.</p><h4>What can you say about Analytica's team?</h4><p>When Eduardo Checa, former Country Manager of ING Bank Ecuador and Analytica's CEO, joined in 2006, he helped us to grow, institutionalize the company, and make it more professional. We have an excellent young executive group of people, as well as directors with a very good reputation in the market. Our internships have a lot of prestige, and many people go from here to Fletcher, which is part of Harvard University. Our idea is to maintain first-rate people.</p><h4>How do you see Analytica's future over the medium term?</h4><p>We stayed in the country as an investment bank when others left, and so we are a reference in the country. We are expanding in Latin America and seeking the opportunity to do business in the US and South America. We are waiting for pending local authorization to bring mining companies to Ecuador. Also, we have enough influence and prestige, though we are extremely ethical, to get access, achieve successful deals, and manage investor risk better than anyone.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Yasuní­-ITT's project unique?<br></h4><p>Yasuní­-ITT is a 1 million-hectare area that is the most biodiverse place on the planet. In one single hectare there are more types of plants and trees than in the US and Canada put together. Animals migrate from many regions to Yasuní­, and the region is home to a variety of prehistoric animals and plants. Moreover, there are more vegetable species in Yasuní­ than anywhere else in the world. There are also communities living in voluntary isolation; Yasuní­ in itself is a unique and magical place. However, another source of wealth in the zone is the vast quantity of oil underground. This is why President Correa made an announcement to the UN in 2007 that Ecuador would begin an initiative to conserve the environment and shift the energy matrix toward renewable energy, and that the country is willing to leave the oil found in the ITT fields of Yasuní­ untapped. However, we seek worldwide support for the petition.</p><h4>How do you explain or quantify the value of this project?</h4><p>It is a very difficult idea to explain and sell. Companies can sell or market a product in exchange for a value, but how do you sell oxygen? What value can you assign to it? The gas is shapeless, but it provides life. It is our responsibility to assign values to the immense biodiversity, plants, and animals in Yasuní­-ITT, but this is not an easy task. Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dr. Eric Chivian, suggested that every medicine for the world's current diseases lies undiscovered in Yasuní­, but no further research has been conducted on the topic. Nevertheless, he has supported the initiative by becoming our ambassador, uniting 88 scientists to urge that the area be preserved in order to carry out studies regarding its biodiversity. In the US, I met with Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, to discuss how to assign value to the intangible natural resources we have. A single plant or the venom of a frog can produce medicine for a variety of diseases, and treatments for cancer could be found in Yasuní­'s plant life; there's so much to discover, but the value is indeterminable. However, what we can estimate is the value of the CO2 that will not be produced. Although we want to assign a value to the great amount of biodiversity, one way to value Yasuní­-ITT is by estimating the oxygen that the conserved trees would produce; 810 million additional tons. Someday, we aim to compile a more complete and accurate value.</p><h4>Spain and Italy have been the main contributors thus far. What has held other countries back from joining Yasuní­-ITT?</h4><p>First and foremost, the economic crisis has affected many potential contributors. In fact, Spain and Italy gave their contributions prior to the debt crisis. In addition, there is a certain lack of knowledge about the campaign, and the focus of our negotiations has been geared toward Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and France. We recently expanded the campaign to other countries, such as Turkey, Georgia, and Australia, as well as some Latin American nations. This branch of the initiative was launched in September 2011. It is not easy to make the world aware of an environmental initiative without an aggressive communications and public relations campaign, and so we are betting on social networking; young people are driving changes such as this.</p><h4>What will be your immediate investments with the collected benefits?</h4><p>We will make use of a trust fund once we hit a certain amount. The Steering Committee will be meeting in the coming months to decide where we will invest, but the focus areas are reforestation, environmental protection, and social development programs such as supporting the communities that live in the Yasuní­ area of influence without access to education, health care, or water infrastructure. The capital can also be used for investments in renewable energy. The Steering Committee can go in many directions, but the decisions we make have to fall under the umbrella of social and environmental issues.</p><h4>What is the process of making a contribution to the Yasuní­-ITT project?</h4><p>Contributions can be made through our website, www.yasunisupport.org. Small amounts receive a certificate with the person's name as proof that they have supported Yasuní­-ITT. If contributors wish to obtain a return certificate, an amount of at least $50,000 must be donated, and people can work together to collect that amount. The benefits are the same as those of buying a product for your health or well being. We need to take action now. The drawbacks of climate change will be much higher than those of an economic crisis, and could cost as much as 20% of the GDP of every country. Those who contribute are protecting both humanity and the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What market factors led to the establishment of Ivanhoe Energy in Ecuador in 2008?<br></h4><p>In 2008, Ivanhoe Energy Ecuador (IEE) signed a contract with Petroecuador to develop Block 20 of the Pungarayacu oil field. Block 20 is a major heavy oil field some 1,102 square kilometers in size, located approximately 180 kilometers southeast of Quito. During the first stage of the contract, it is mandatory for a company to conduct an exploration program, engineering work, and research in order to prepare a development plan for a block. Once we hand in our proposal, it should be reviewed and approved by EP Petroecuador, the national oil company, and then we may begin exploitation of the field. Recently, EP Petroecuador approved, as part of the appraisal stage, drilling a new well in the pre-cretaceous reservoirs, which is part of our contract with the state. If we are successful in exploring and exploiting this new well, I believe that Ecuador will enter a new phase of major oil development. IEE is taking this risk with full knowledge of the complexity of these unknown reservoirs, as part of the company's commitment to its project in the country.</p><h4>What are your production prospects for the Block 20 field?</h4><p>To date, we have carried out 2D seismic and technical studies. We expect to produce large volumes of heavy crude oil. However, this depends on the results of our appraisal and exploration work, which will be available by the end of 2013. As stated by the government of Ecuador, the Pungarayacu field could be key to further development of the oil industry in the country; the field has large reserves of some 6 billion barrels of heavy crude oil. We believe that Ecuador is gradually moving from light oil toward heavy oil production. In this regard, our current drilling of the IP-17 well (pre-cretaceous) is key, as it could open new opportunities in the pre-cretaceous reservoirs for the industry, creating new exploration and production areas.</p><h4>Who owns the Block 20 concession in the Pungarayacu field?</h4><p>EP Petroecuador owns Block 20 and Ivanhoe Energy Ecuador is responsible for specific services, operation, production, and investments in the block. Our company, using its patented Heavy To Light (HTL„¢) technology, has the possibility to transform heavy crude into a lighter product, and is also leading exploration work in potential wells. Once we begin production activities, we will transfer crude oil to EP Petroecuador as per our contract, and it will distribute it.</p><h4>Ivanhoe owns the HTL„¢ technology patent. Could you tell us more about this process?</h4><p>HTL„¢ is an upgrading process that can be located on-site at heavy oil fields and is completely integrated with upstream operations. The HTL„¢ process converts heavy oil to lighter oil, a more valuable product that can be transported by pipeline without the need for light blend oils. In addition, coke and gas—products gained from the upgrading process—are converted in situ to steam or power, which becomes available to the operator developing the field. HTL„¢ is based on the time-tested concept of thermal cracking and carbon rejection, and incorporates ultra-short processing times compared with those of conventional technology. Moreover, the process does not require catalysts, hydrogen, or significant pressure. The net result is relatively small-scale, low-cost facilities that can be located where the energy is, maximizing the benefits of heat integration. We are able to transform heavy oil into light oil, as well as gas and electricity by-products, thanks to this technology. IEE's HTL„¢ process represents the application of a commercial technology to a new feedstock, and incorporates the benefits of this unique development process to any heavy and/or ultra heavy oil field.</p><h4>Is IEE currently holding talks with potential companies that could be operating in the southern fields?</h4><p>Thus far, we have not consulted with other companies about this possibility. However, we are in the process of establishing partnerships and associations with enterprises in other countries. I believe that in the near future, IEE will take similar steps in  Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current opportunities for companies such as Schlumberger in Ecuador?<br></h4><p>The oil and gas industry in Ecuador is facing many challenges, especially in terms of the characterization and development of mature fields. We believe that the innovative technology, services, and expertise that Schlumberger can provide makes a difference and is needed.</p><h4>What is the relevance of Ecuador for Schlumberger in Latin America?</h4><p>Currently, Schlumberger is operating in more than 12 countries in Latin America. Working in these countries creates synergies and similarities in the ways we work, especially in relation to the reservoir types and operational characteristics. These synergies and similarities foster an exchange of technical knowledge and expertise from different regions. The experience Schlumberger has in Colombia and Mexico from  the development of mature fields is being transferred to Ecuador. We have developed fantastic expertise in deepwater operations in Brazil, which can be introduced to new markets in the region and globally. From another aspect, Ecuador's reservoirs present a wide variety of opportunities for technology and technical development, aimed to maximize production in mature fields, maintain efficiency, and increase the recovery factor. Having said that, this is definitely a market that cannot be ignored; it has a great potential for continued development and growth.</p><h4>What are Schlumberger's future investments in mature fields and key aspects of the contract signed with the government?</h4><p>Schlumberger is the world's leading oilfield service company, and provides technology and services to support key or fundamental processes in the exploration and production (E&amp;P) industry. Wherever Schlumberger operates, we behave as a leader in oilfield services. Our long presence and commitment to Ecuador's oil industry continues as we invest in technological applications, field studies, and the development of processes, and these are all relevant to our ambitions in the country. In other words, Schlumberger is investing in technology and will continue to support the country over the years to come. Our new contract is a fundamental element of this goal.</p><h4>What amount of investment has Schlumberger made in mature fields?</h4><p>Schlumberger has a committed investment of $1.2 billion. This amount may increase depending on the results of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects that we will pilot first. We will evaluate the results before deciding on the final investment amount.</p><h4>What is Schlumberger's role in increasing the visibility of Ecuador's oil and gas industry in the petro-technical community worldwide?</h4><p>We raise awareness by bringing in experts, organizing workshops, hosting conferences, and increasing the amount of reports created in the country that will be presented in different conferences or workshops worldwide.</p><h4>How do you attract professionals to Ecuador?</h4><p>Schlumberger has always valued its human resources. Our company believes in training and promoting from within. We recruit locally, and offer all the necessary training to develop our employees to their full capabilities. We will continue this strategy in Ecuador, and increase the amount of local talent at our company.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is CELEC EP's role in the country's mission to change the energy matrix?<br></h4><p>Over the past few years, we have changed the country's energy matrix by introducing green policies in the field of generation. Previously, fossil fuels were commonly used to generate electricity. To reverse this trend, CELEC EP began operating several hydroelectric plants, and we are currently building eight new facilities. In addition, the company is developing a wind farm. CELEC EP has also started operating a very efficient thermal power plant. Our main target is to reduce biodiesel consumption as much as possible in the generation process, due to its high cost. We also aim to exploit gas-generated electricity, because it is a cheap and more eco-friendly resource. Finally, CELEC EP has guaranteed the supply of electricity in Ecuador and created vast energy reserves, as well as reduced the cost of energy generation. We are also developing and strengthening our distribution network.</p><h4>CELEC EP generates and supplies 85% of the country's electricity. Are there any plans to encourage additional competition in the sector?</h4><p>There is always room for private energy generation. In fact, Ecuador currently has five private electricity generators, and the country's development has formed the situation today. Over the last few years, we have consolidated state-owned infrastructure and the electricity generation segment. In the process, we acquired a private company that was not performing or operating adequately.</p><h4>What is behind CELEC EP's strategy to build eight new hydroelectric plants?</h4><p>These projects fit perfectly under CELEC EP's green policies, and will make the electricity generation process in our country cleaner. Most of these hydroelectric plants are being developed jointly with Chinese state-owned enterprises and financed through loans granted by Chinese banks. Russian and Brazilian banks are also involved with the financing of a number of our projects. At the same time, CELEC EP is seeking a partner to finance and develop a gas-combined generation cycle project that has an approximate cost of $200 million. Any potential partner is expected to assume 70% of the investments in the 10-year project, whereas CELEC EP would cover the remaining 30%.</p><h4>How extensive is CELEC EP's distribution network? What strategy is the company implementing to expand and strengthen it?</h4><p>CELEC EP's distribution network currently covers 94% of Ecuador's territory; 98% in urban areas and 89% in rural areas. When compared to other Latin American countries, CELEC EP is one of the top five companies in terms of coverage and services. Our distribution system is constantly being reinforced, and currently our most important project is the development of a corridor between Quito and Guayaquil that will have the capacity to deliver 500,000 MW. In the future, this corridor will be part of a larger trans-national corridor along the Andes, from Chile to Colombia. Such regional projects will enable us to export our electricity surplus, as well as reduce generation costs at a regional level and strengthen the energy network.</p><h4>How will the company develop this trans-national energy distribution network?</h4><p>This project is key for the future of the region, because it will create a common energy market in South America. The designs for the project are already complete, and we are about to enter the tendering stage of the project. In fact, we are already participating in talks with large energy enterprises from Brazil and Colombia regarding contracts for the project, which will require the companies to construct and operate the network, as well as distribute the electricity over the first 25 years. After that, the project is handed over to us. We estimate the cost of infrastructure for Ecuador to be $400 million, and we expect it to be ready in about two years. Then, we will begin to work on interconnection infrastructure between the countries. Overall, I personally expect to have the whole network operating in four years' time, because the neighboring countries are also developing their border infrastructure right now.</p><h4>What is the level of investment CELEC EP expects for 2012?</h4><p>CELEC EP's budget has been set for several years, and the projects we are involved in require comprehensive plans. However, the investment budget for 2012 is $1.2 billion, which is covered largely by the government of Ecuador. I would like to note that this figure is just an estimate, because after the first six months of the year, the government checks on our performance and investment plan and may introduce changes.</p><h4>What are the main demand patterns in your network area in terms of users?</h4><p>In the last year, the country's energy demand has increased by 6%, and power demand has grown by 5.5%. Ecuador experienced blackouts between 2009 and 2010 due to the inability to cope with demand and the weaknesses of the distribution network. However, CELEC EP has accomplished a lot in the past few years to address the situation, and today we can say that both energy and power demand are steadily growing without problems. Today, the Ecuadorean energy authorities are aiming to boost the presence of electric cars in the national automobile fleet, which could even boost both demand and consumption. In this regard, we expect a steep rise in consumption levels in the future, something we are capable of dealing with.</p><h4>What role do joint projects with foreign companies play in the future plans of CELEC EP?</h4><p>When it comes to large projects, CELEC EP is open to the market. We believe that our role is to identify relevant projects, and choose an international tender to be in charge of the construction and operation of the project. This model is very convenient for us, because we do not need to make large investments and we can pay the tendered company back in 20 or 25 years. This positively contributes to the development of Ecuador and the economic development of foreign companies, which seek to implement long-term strategies for their business activities in the country. Therefore, we can offer CELEC EP's economic reliability to our foreign partners, because our annual turnover reaches $1 billion.</p><h4>What's your general outlook for the sector over the medium term?</h4><p>In my work in the sector and for the past 37 years, I have never been as motivated and excited as I am now, because we are actually transforming the country. Distribution was one of our main weaknesses, with losses of up to 23%. Fortunately, we have addressed that; today's losses are around 13%, and we can observe qualitative changes in terms of management. We still need to strengthen the distribution process, but I believe that the future is bright because the sector is very healthy and we do not see the risk of new blackouts. Most importantly, we have significantly reduced generation costs and the cost of electricity for the population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main axes of Ecuador's industrial development strategy?<br></h4><p>The government of Ecuador favors investments that will be profitable while adding value, generating social inclusion, and respecting the rights of nature, consumers, workers, and the state. Ecuador is the first country to recognize these rights as a legal body. Under these axes we are generating a productive economic model that contributes to economic growth and incorporates elements of sustainability.</p><h4>How is the current administration improving the country's competitiveness?</h4><p>We are working hard to improve our efficiency and productivity alongside strong public investment to guarantee the best levels of competitiveness. Approximately 13% of GDP was dedicated in 2011 to public investments in ports, airports, and road infrastructure. Public investment in 2011 totaled $8.45 billion, and in 2012 we forecast an investment of over $10 billion. Estimated GDP growth will be between 13% and 14.18%. In roads, ports, airports, and agriculture the initial investment will be $1.22 billion. In terms of commercial policy, Ecuador is making big strides toward Asia, and many of the new investments in the country originate from there. China, South Korea, and Singapore are assisting us technically to improve our levels of development and competitiveness. We want to overcome the model that characterized Ecuador for decades, based on the extraction of non-renewable resources. Now we want to transform that model into a value-added one based on knowledge and high technology.</p><h4>What are the goals of the government's economic development model for the country?</h4><p>Our model for industrial development, on top of generating value-added, will create opportunities for the development of new businesses. In the country's last census, small enterprises were clearly identified as the engines of growth. During President Correa's administration over 90,000 small enterprises have been created, employing between one and nine people each. In the long term, this is a development model through which the government co-finances innovation using several mechanisms in order to reinforce the productive capacity of the country. Also during the Correa administration, employment has grown by 7.59%, while the unemployment rate has been reduced to 2.19%, and underemployment to 4.71%. We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the region.</p><h4>What has the government done to incentivize private investments?</h4><p>We have implemented some specific policies. The Organic Code of Production and Investments (COPSI) establishes specific incentives for investment. Through the Productive Transformation Agenda, we have selected 14 sectors that have major potential and could benefit from more incentives. The new legal body includes a general tax stimulus, such as the annual reduction of a percentage point on the corporate tax rate, which this year is at 25%. All imports made by investors, either of capital goods or raw materials, can be exempted from the payment of customs taxes. Investments that include innovation, the training of human capital, or the implementation of alternative energy resources to improve efficiency and relieve pressure on our energy matrix can also benefit from tax breaks, including a reduction for the expenses associated with the international promotion of a company and its products. Up to 100% of expenses for the acquisition of clean production facilities or the implementation of renewable energy systems (solar, wind, and others) are also tax deductible. Incentives also exist for investors in run-down zones, including the deduction of 100% of expenses for the first five years when a company is creating new jobs in an under-developed area. These incentives are in addition to sector-specific incentives already available to 14 identified sectors, including the agribusiness, automotive, chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, technology, plastics, timber, transport, software, and tourism industries.</p><h4>What do the prioritized sectors have in common?</h4><p>These sectors offer potential for value-added generation, taking advantage of the natural resources of the country. In addition, they are high generators of productive employment. They can also contribute to improving the levels of productivity and competitiveness in the country's productive sector. We have the capacity and the primary resources to be able to incentivize these sectors, and on top of that they offer opportunities to the market, both national and international. Every province has a productive transformation agenda, which identifies the potential business lines, clusters, and players in the productive chain. These prioritized sectors are part of the strategy of the national logistics agenda and the national innovation agenda.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did you start running fast food restaurants and developing the entertainment division?</h4><p>In the beginning, it was called the cinema division. It was opened with three cinema complexes; there were 35 screens and two fast food restaurants. After that, the concept changed.</p><h4>What opportunity for growth did you see at that time?</h4><p>From a cinema point of view, Multicines had just with two complexes in Quito and 30% of the market. Cinemark had 50% of the market in Ecuador. They ran minimal operations for almost 10 years. They did not invest in the market, and I saw that as an opportunity. In the beginning, I wanted to make a lot of changes to the cinema industry because I had a different vision of how it should be. This is when we started to build new complexes, but under a new, more modern logo. This is when I began developing cinemas with new concepts in different countries as well. I developed the GT-MAX concept, the VIP concept, and the digital concept. Ecuador was the first country with digital cinema in the region. We started on par with Mexico and Brazil, which were the first countries with digital projectors in Latin America. Now we have 160 screens in the country and have a 65% market share. We are continuing to grow with 30 screens per year and I think in the next two years we will have more than 200 screens.</p><h4>What is behind this massive growth?</h4><p>We are going to open cinema complexes in cities that have no cinemas, such as Daule and Latacunga. We will increase the number of screens in malls and we will open another complex in Samborondón, a commercial city. Quito will also gain another complex in the south of the city. We have many ongoing projects . In other countries, companies are beginning to invest in the interior, whereas in Ecuador this will be done in three or four years.</p><h4>Why has the GT-MAX concept been so successful?</h4><p>It is unique in the world. The concept of GT-MAX revolves around huge screens. We wanted to develop a concept that can maximize the capabilities of the 35 mm projector. We went with a special German projector that can project onto a huge screen called Chemtone. It is expensive and costs about five times the price of a normal projector, but it makes a difference with a very special sound model and design. There are 600 seats and you can see the film from anywhere in the cinema. The screen is 24 meters by 17 meters.</p><h4>How important has innovation been to staying ahead in this industry?</h4><p>We have received awards and many people have asked about the GT-MAX concept and now it is digital 3D. We also developed the VIP concept in 2004. At that time, not a lot of cinemas offered a VIP concept, and we started with digital cinema and invested a lot of money into it. After a year we started to screen open air and run digital 3D operations. We have an agreement with an opera house in London and we screened the final of Wimbledon in digital 3D as well as other live sports events. We started with Super Educa, which is an educational concept that we have in the cinemas. We try to stay ahead of the game in terms of cinema innovation. We have also worked with Warner to change the release date of movies, because in the past they came very late to Ecuador. After they were released in the US, a film typically took six months to come to Ecuador. We started to bring in new copies and release the movies on the same day as in the US. That was a huge change and after us, all of the other studios started to do the same. We have also had birthdays and weddings in our cinemas. A registrar marries the couple, and afterwards they watch a movie.</p><h4>You are now entering the cinema production business. How is this progressing?</h4><p>In 2011 we co-produced a movie called Prometeo Deportado. It is a dramatic topic, but it is a very significant film for Ecuador as well as for other countries as well. The vision of the Ecuadorean immigrant is a very difficult one.</p><h4>Do you plan to develop this this part of the business?</h4><p>This was the second time that we invested in a movie. The first time we invested in Crónicas with Sebastián Cordero, and the second time we participated more with Prometeo Deportado. It keeps coming up, and we often have enquiries.</p><h4>How do you fight the illegal distribution of music and films?</h4><p>We are working hard and moving forward. In the cinema division, I am convinced that our biggest competitive edge is technology, such as huge, high-definition screens. We always need to be working at reinventing the experience.</p><h4>Do you feel that Ecuador is an attractive place for making films and how would you attract filmmakers to the country?</h4><p>We have many places suitable for making movies. There are the highlands, Latacunga, and Riobamba, which are all places where beautiful footage can be shot. There are many places that can be adapted to films.</p><h4>What opportunities do the Galápagos Islands offer?</h4><p>The Galápagos Islands are a great place for shooting a movie. I wanted to do a movie about the Galápagos, because the only movie there is is very old and I think there is a place for a new 3D movie about the Galápagos.</p><h4>You own the distribution rights for Apple, Sony, and Bose. What is the extent of your role in technology distribution?</h4><p>We started with the Apple Stores. It was difficult to create a business model that can support only music and movies. This is difficult everywhere in the world and I wanted to bring in some brands that could attract more people. Apple was very unknown here in Ecuador. I wanted to open an Apple Store that not only sells a few Apple products, but is an exclusive Apple Store. It is only the iPhone that we do not have, mainly because the telecommunications companies here do not support it. We started with one store and now we have six. We sell a lot of iPads as well, because this is a place where people really use technology. We also have exclusivity on Bose products.</p><h4>How have you worked to develop the Carl Jr.'s chain of restaurants?</h4><p>It has a different concept for a fast food restaurant. McDonald's brings kids in with the happy meal concept, and Burger King has its own concept. We try to cater to young adolescents with Carl Jr.'s. Young people are our target, and you can see this on our web advertisements. It is very nice and really different. We had to make a decision as to what we were going to do with the brand; it is very difficult for a local brand to compete with a big chain. We have five restaurants right now, but by the end of the year we will have 13 Carl Jr.'s restaurants.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be some of the main trends in the telecoms sector over 2012?<br></h4><p>In Ecuador, we are facing many challenges. Nowadays, the central issue is broadband, as this is where we see the biggest opportunity for growth in the next few years. We are also going to see additional services allowing providers to reach clients using the convergence of multiple services that are currently sold separately. That's the essential issue in telecoms. If we look at the numbers, Ecuador started 2007/08 with 160,000 broadband ports. The expectation is that by the end of 2013, we will have around 900,000, to which we can add wireless connections from mobile operators. We hope mobile broadband penetration rates will increase with more strength and better quality with cutting edge technology as well.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to providing better broadband services?</h4><p>The challenge in developing broadband connectivity is breaking the vicious cycle. Demand doesn't grow because it is still costly and prices don't go down. In order to break this, it will be necessary for one of the operators to launch a very attractive promotion in the market. In this way, it will be able to capture a good number of clients and generate a virtuous circle that increases demand rapidly and drives prices down. In fact, the arrival of new elements to compete in the market and access to systems based on IP present a challenge for established operators with traditional technology to rethink their business and increase client trust.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the level of competition in the telecoms sector?</h4><p>In mobile telecoms, there are three operators. The primary is Conecel, which holds an almost 70% market share and its brand is Claro. On the other hand, Otecel, which belongs to Telefónica and is sold as Movistar, holds just over 28%. Finally, CNT holds just under 2% and is sold as Alegro. Ecuador has a mobile penetration rate of more than 100%. Although the number of mobile devices surpasses the population, the figure is skewed as some people have more than one line. On the other hand, landline telephony is headed by CNT, the state operator, which has more than 2.1 million lines. CNT holds around 92% of the market. ETAPA, municipally owned by the city of Cuenca, holds around 5%, and the rest is distributed among seven operators. Regarding internet, around one-third of the population has access to this service and CNT is the provider of just over 20% of the market, although CNT had only 9% of the market in 2008. We can conclude that there has been significant growth, but it is still not enough. The provision of portability services for data transmission, which is done through the fiber-optic network, is managed by CNT. However, Telconet, another competitor, has experienced growth as well.</p><h4>What role are you going to play in the implementation of the new “mobile wallet" service?</h4><p>We are responsible for ensuring that transactions over the networks are safe, to avoid fraud, identity theft, and risk. SUPERTEL's new project for 2012 is the development of a computer incident response center (CERT). Our intention is to avoid fraud, not only relating to money transfers but also identity theft, hacking, and incidents and vulnerabilities on networks. This is the role we will play in the development of the mobile wallet. We have to highlight that we have not experienced many problems with those issues in Ecuador as yet.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Ecuador's software companies?</h4><p>More than 10 years ago Ecuador was number one in the production of banking software, with leaders such as COBIS. Unfortunately, we did not maintain this status. However, there is great experience in that area. There is no need for great physical spaces or complex machinery to develop such technology. Ecuador's geographical location and its production costs are also another competitive advantage. Ecuador is a peaceful place overall compared to other countries, which means that firms can work without major problems. People are friendly and cordial, and these are some advantages we could make the most of to start exporting. However, one of the biggest challenges is to prepare good professionals with perfect language skills other than Spanish. Also, companies need funds to develop innovative products and the government has to create a program for IT sector development such as was done in Jalisco, Mexico. Companies do not get finance because their assets are codes and not property, plants, or equipment. Ecuadorean IT companies have been developing with a CAGR of 30% over the last three years, but the government has been one of the biggest clients. Now, these companies have to find new markets in the region because they cannot depend only on the public sector for their growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What technology has Huawei introduced in Ecuador?</h4><p>Our first big contract was in 2002, for fiber-optic SDH rings in Guayaquil. We have always worked to introduce the latest technology in Ecuador. Since 2004, we have introduced broadband and DSL, DWDM fiber-optic transmission, and next generation networks. In 2007, we introduced 3G technology to Claro. The entire Claro 3G network is using Huawei technology. We also introduced code division multiple access (CDMA) in 2008 to CNT and ETAPA. This CDMA network provides very wide rural coverage. The government can now provide telecommunications and internet to many rural areas. This is part of the government's effort to close the digital gap. We offer more bandwidth to the user with WiMAX, IPTV, and fiber to the home (FTTH) systems. In 2012 we will continue to promote some new technologies in the local market; for example, Long Term Evolution (LTE), 4G mobile technology, and cloud computing.</p><h4>What are the challenges of entering the smartphone market?</h4><p>The main challenge is that we lack experience in the consumer market. Over the past 20 years, we have focused only on the carrier business, and we haven't directly dealt with consumers. Even though we started our handset business in 2003, we only dealt with carriers as OEM and ODM suppliers, such as Vodafone or T-Mobile. In 2011, Huawei set up its Global Design Center for handsets in London. Some design masters from Germany and Japan joined the company as well. Our product capability has rapidly reached top class. We have introduced the slimmest smartphone in the world, just 6.68 mm thick. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March 2012 we also announced a new smartphone, equipped with a self-developed quad-core 1.5GHz CPU, which is the most powerful handset in terms of hardware performance. However, we still need to learn more about public branding and marketing. Similar to the whole company, we have organized three business groups in Ecuador and have promoted them, especially in 2012.</p><h4>What are the advantages of your service and product portfolio?</h4><p>The advantages of Huawei are mainly in technology and solutions. We have a very broad portfolio. There are some leading technology companies in three major telecoms network areas: mobile, fixed, and IP. Among them, Huawei is the only one ranked in the top three in all three areas. For enterprise solutions we have the widest scope in ICT technology. Our customer-oriented R&amp;D capability can rapidly respond to requirements from the market.</p><h4>What are the applications of the cloud computing model for Ecuador?</h4><p>Huawei's cloud computing solution was launched in 2010. Since 2011, the Ecuadorean government, enterprises, and telecoms operators raised a lot of requirements. We are currently working on that to explore the opportunities in this field. For cloud computing, data centers are the most important infrastructure to develop. In the Chinese market, every Huawei smartphone user gets 160 GB space in the cloud for data backup and for storage.</p><h4>Will Huawei be implementing 4G in Ecuador?</h4><p>In 2011, we signed Latin America's first commercial LTE contract with UNE EPM Telecommunications, a Colombian company. Huawei is a leading LTE vendor in essential patents and commercial applications. We are ready to offer LTE solutions, and it simply depends on the operators and the spectrum allocation.</p><h4>Are you involved in the mobile content segment?</h4><p>We do provide some mobile content in addition to the platform itself. We provide the Service Delivery Platform (SDP) to both Telefónica and América Móvil for all of Latin America. We don't do too much developing, and generally the operator itself organizes content, though we have global agreements with music and newspaper companies. The content is based on the requirements of the operators. In some countries they want to form a joint development with Huawei to deliver content, but in others they prefer to design their content alone.</p><h4>What is Huawei's strategy in Latin America, and what does Ecuador represent in this plan?</h4><p>Our strategy is very clear. We would like to gain leadership in the ICT market. Similar to the whole company, we have organized and promoted three business groups in Ecuador, especially in 2012. Huawei has already become a major ICT player in Latin America, including in Ecuador. We have seen the Ecuadorean government make efforts to promote local ICT infrastructure and offer universal services. Huawei is willing to work with operators to continuously increase the network connectivity in the country.</p><h4>How much will Huawei invest in Ecuador in 2012?</h4><p>For the carrier business, I don't think there is a lot of space for growth. The operators' investment in the network is stabilizing. But I hope our enterprise business and consumer business will be growth areas. We have seen some opportunities to introduce new technologies into this country like LTE, FTTx, and computing.</p><h4>How many employees are there at Huawei in Ecuador and how do you assess the quality of human resources?</h4><p>Huawei has around 350 employees here in Ecuador, and I'm very satisfied with the quality of human resources we have. Of the 350 employees, only 30 are from China. The majority of jobs are performed by our Ecuadorean employees. We have been here for around 10 years, and there has been a solid knowledge transfer, not only within our own company, but also to our outside partners and contractors. Almost 2,600 engineers have been trained by Huawei and introduced to the latest technology. We will start a new technology certificate program in Ecuador in 2012 to strengthen our skill transfer policy.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans in the short term?</h4><p>We're hoping to expand the enterprise market, especially in the government, education, and healthcare sectors. In the consumer market, we will increase the smartphone share and keep our solid market position in broadband modems and data cards. Now we have a full smartphone portfolio covering high, medium, and low requirements. Smartphones are the key for traffic and revenue generation for operators.</p><h4>What opportunities are present in Ecuador?</h4><p>Mobile internet traffic has already exceeded the fixed connection market worldwide now. There are a lot of customers using social network services (SNS) and enjoy music on their phones, for example. The growth has been explosive. People don't have enough time to sit at home to chat or use the internet, but with the mobile broadband service customers can enjoy the fragments of time when they are somewhere such as an airport or waiting room. We firmly believe that more and more broadband will be demanded and available in Ecuador in the near future. Mobile broadband has begun to drive the entire ICT sector. If wireless and cable broadband access grows, we have to bear in mind that infrastructure must grow too. When AT&amp;T first introduced the iPhone, for example, the infrastructure crashed periodically because of the high volume of data traffic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-outlook-abroad]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Ecuador's global exports in the context of the economic slowdown seen in the US and Europe?<br></h4><p>In general terms the Ecuadorean economy—like most Latin American economies—is in quite good shape, even though we just passed through the first global crisis. Ecuador was able to pass through that crisis without much of an impact on its macroeconomic equilibrium, and there were no significant effects felt on exports in sector terms. Currently, Ecuador is growing. In the first half of 2011 it recorded GDP growth of 8.7%, which is very good, and we think that this will be sustainable. We estimate we'll be able to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year for the next 10 or 15 years. Besides having oil and gas, we are now going to develop the mining sector, and we think that this will herald a second boom for the economy. The first boom was when we discovered oil in the 1970s and developed that industry. We have now discovered significant reserves of gold, copper, and other important metals like titanium and silicon and are looking for foreign investors to come in from different areas of the world, such as Australia, South Africa, Canada, Europe, and the US, so we can develop that sector. This should ensure economic stability for the upcoming years, and also positively affect the export side of the economy.</p><h4>Is this positive growth trend also being seen in the non-oil export sectors?</h4><p>When you break down our export figures and take out oil and gas, then you see that Ecuador has shown an increase in its non-oil export sectors as well, which we tend to divide into two subgroups. First, there are the traditional products that we have exported historically, such as bananas, seafood products (particularly tuna and shrimp), coffee, and cocoa, and they have continued to increase both in terms of volume and value. Second, there are the new sectors that we have been developing, especially on the agro-industrial side. We have become one of the main providers of these products to the world, such as is the case for cut flowers, but this is also increasingly the case for tropical fruits like mango and pineapple, as well as products from temperate climates such as broccoli and other fresh vegetables.</p><h4>The US Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) has recently been extended until July 2013. Do you have any plans for the post-ATPDEA era in trade terms?</h4><p>In the case of the ATPDEA program, the range of goods we could export through that mechanism is very large, but in practice there are very specific products we export. Most of our products enter under “most favored nation" status, under the same conditions as everybody else. And the main products we export to the US go via this route, including oil, bananas, cocoa, coffee, and seafood. Of course, there's an effect on those sectors that are covered by ATPDEA. Products like broccoli have been negatively affected, and also mango juice and products using mangos, quinoa, and pineapple exports, but in broad terms there hasn't been much of an effect. Our intention is to have an agreement on trade with the US. We have told the Obama administration that we are interested in reaching an agreement, but the Ecuadorean government is not interested in signing a classical free trade agreement. The type of agreement Ecuador is currently promoting includes three pillars: a trade pillar, a political pillar, and a cooperation pillar. That doesn't imply that we want to negotiate all three pillars at the same time; we could do it separately at different times. However, we should always maintain a certain relationship between political matters and cooperation matters, especially on the economic and trade side.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in trying to gain access to markets in Asia?</h4><p>Asia is a critical market. Ecuador needs to be in Asia, the Asia-Pacific basin, and India. Southeast Asian nations as well as Northeast Asia nations—especially China—are important for us. Everybody is looking to the Asian market because it's the fastest-growing market, and the only market outside Latin America that will continue to grow. That won't be the case for Europe and the US over the next few years. Our main problem is logistics; we're too far away from key markets, and we don't have the right logistics to reach them. We have to go all the way to Los Angeles or to the Atlantic, or go around Africa. Latin American countries are generally not very competitive due to transport costs. Specifically talking about Ecuador, we have a very similar export offer for Southeast Asian countries. Bananas are one good example. Ecuador was once the main provider to China and Japan for many years. Now we export almost none. This is because China developed its own banana industry, and because the Japanese have switched to buying them from the Philippines. It's very difficult for us to compete on price terms in part because of the cost of transport. We are seeing a similar trend in coffee, with Vietnam developing its own coffee growing industry. Malaysia and Thailand have excellent shrimp industries, while Malaysia and Indonesia are the biggest palm oil producers in the world. In the field of wood products we see a similar trend, with construction materials and furniture produced in the region at competitive prices. So it's very difficult for us to export from here and remain competitive. The other problem is the fact that we have very similar offerings, and most of these countries have no tariffs on trade because they are part of ASEAN, and they basically have a free trade zone in the region. On all the products we export, we have to pay tariffs.</p><h4>How do you plan to overcome these challenges?</h4><p>First we have to see where we can become more competitive on pricing and transport, and we're working on that. However, in the short to medium term the solution is simple. We have to go and market our products as being the highest quality of their type in the world. We have to tell consumers in that area of the world that if you buy Ecuadorean bananas, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, broccoli, shrimp, tuna, flowers, and others, you are buying gourmet products. These are products that are considered the best of the best in Europe and the US. We have to invest in marketing and try to obtain a premium on the price by selling products as the best and attack those segments of the economy that have high purchasing power. That's what we're working on now. We have been able to position a lot of our products based on this strategy, though not in big volumes, and obtain a better price. And it's true that most of these products are considered to be among the best of their type in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Taking the Leap]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[taking-the-leap]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the productive sectors perform over 2011?<br></h4><p>It was a highly positive year, with a very good growth rate of over 8%, and in the third quarter of 2011 we saw an 11.2% growth rate. We have experienced sustained growth over a few periods that reflects our healthy economy. I can qualify 2011 as a highly positive year owing to continued growth, and anticipate a similar forecast for the years to come.</p><h4>What specific accomplishments has the new Code of Production achieved after one year?</h4><p>The Code of Production has two categories of incentives: general and specific. There are many incentives for new industries, innovations, and people who want to invest in the country. One of the most important aspects of the code is the tool to guarantee FDI. Another positive aspect is that the tool acts as a contract with the Ecuadorean government, stating the incentives an investor is entitled to, and confirming where arbitration will take place. Following this agreement, the investor signs a contract for up to 15 years. Within the code, we guarantee investments and protect foreign investors.</p><h4>Has the investment level been measurable since the Code of Production came into effect?</h4><p>It cannot be measured because of the fact that these incentives are tax related; they are applied when investors pay income tax. The code came into effect in 2011 and the income tax for 2011 was paid in April 2012. However, there has been interest from certain companies waiting to sign investment contracts that add up to $400 million. These are companies interested in investing in the country in compliance with the code. We are using this as our first result in terms of investment. We will begin to see the fiscal impact of the 2011 tax incentives by the middle of 2012.</p><h4>In which ways has Ecuador's competitiveness been reinforced?</h4><p>We have increased our competitiveness in two ways. Firstly, we have been able to reduce the trade balance deficit, despite being mainly an import-reliant country with limited export offerings. Under this government, we have been working to improve our range of exports, and we have accomplished this. As a government, we have created policies favoring national production, aiming to become more competitive. In other words, we have reduced tariffs on raw material and capital goods to 0%, in order to lower company costs. Secondly, we have carried out a significant amount of export promotion, which has increased our export levels and reduced the trade balance deficit.</p><h4>How will your Ministry implement the new trade procedures?</h4><p>We will transform the way foreign trade is done in Ecuador into a “single-window" model. The single window is set to start functioning in April 2012, and will be a model for the whole region. In Ecuador, the system will be very specific. The single window consolidates all the procedures and paperwork necessary for export and imports, and can be done anytime, anywhere, and from any electronic device.</p><h4>How will companies benefit from the new single-window system?</h4><p>The program is aimed at creating systemic competitiveness, allowing all paperwork to be done rapidly. We are also working with municipalities to accelerate the procedure, because there's no point in establishing a company quickly if there are a host of other bureaucratic procedures setting companies back six months. We are working with municipalities to carry out a project called sin trámites—no paperwork—in order to facilitate the procedure of establishing a business.</p><h4>What will be the investment of the Ministry to implement those programs?</h4><p>The Ministry of Production Coordination has a budget of $20 million, mainly because we are coordinators rather than executors. More that 50% of our budget, or some $12 million, is destined to improve our competitiveness in all sectors.</p><h4>Why is Ecuador focused on exporting raw materials rather than finished products?</h4><p>Currently, the trade balance issue is driving us to strengthen the export of traditional products such as bananas, shrimp, coffee, cocoa, and flowers. Although we are currently not adding any value to those products, it is one of our main goals for production. Through public-private synergies, as a government we entity aim to create the necessary incentives to improve productivity, packaging, promotion expenses, and much more; these elements are contemplated in the Code of Production. However, the government is not necessarily the main investor. Instead, we work toward designing policies that inspire the private sector to take the investment leap.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been PRO ECUADOR's greatest accomplishments in its first year of operations?<br></h4><p>We have worked mostly on the creation of a database of exporters, and have the support of a public institution called SENAE, the customs services operator, which provides us with information about who is exporting. Not necessarily everyone in that database is a constant exporter, and so that information needed to be validated. PRO ECUADOR has done that, and now we have more than 700 validated contacts. We have launched our website and are now able to provide statistics and commercial information to exporters and reach them with our services. We have also worked hard to associate ourselves with other promotion institutions, joining RedIbero, an export organization that links the activities of trade promotion organizations in 21 Latin American states as well as Portugal and Spain. We have to work fast and learn quickly, as we don't have long to improvise.</p><h4>Where has PRO ECUADOR looked for inspiration?</h4><p>We have worked a lot in Latin America because we feel that the models under which other institutions were created are similar to ours. We have been to Chile, Colombia, and Peru, and that has allowed us to learn from their experiences and implement some of their ideas. I think this international positioning has been interesting for us and has allowed us to stay up to date with what's happening in Latin America and create possibilities for cooperation. In March 2012, we hosted the first Andean Entrepreneurial Meeting in order to strengthen the commercial relations between these countries, given that the Andean Community of Nations' goal is to generate trade possibilities between these countries.</p><h4>Is diversification the main concept when talking about PRO ECUADOR's functions?</h4><p>Yes, this is another very important aspect that we work on; diversification in terms of actors, products, and markets. We are an active actor in many markets, but it also depends a lot on the areas of trade negotiation where they look for rapprochement with international markets. For market diversification we have been working a lot at a regional level here in South America and also with Asia and the Middle East. In terms of product diversification, we have tried to organize promotional events to introduce new actors who have the capacity to export.</p><h4>What budget size is PRO ECUADOR working with to achieve its goals?</h4><p>Our budget for 2011 was about $7 million, which is very limited because we were just starting, and our projection for 2012 is around $15 million. The government has a budget for current expenses, but it also has investment projects, and trade matters and trade offices are seen as investments for the government. There's a lot of investment going on in many sectors, and the government is generating possibilities and changing the framework. We had a number of issues, such as health and education, that were being overlooked, though we also can't neglect export and trade matters, which are essential for the country. We aspire to complement our work with external projects and cooperation with foreign institutions that may provide us with material assistance.</p><h4>What do Ecuadorean products offer to the international market?</h4><p>Our main component is quality. When we created the brands “Love Life" and “Made with Values," our vision as the government was to represent what our country is about. Ecuador is a small country with four different regions, and it is considered one of the most bio-diverse places in the world. We need to project these elements abroad so that our products can be related to our overall vision. The geographic and climate advantages we have need to be among the elements to project to overseas buyers so that they can relate the quality of our products to our vision. We also have to be able to represent our cultural diversity in the products that we promote externally. One possibility is to promote the products of indigenous communities in the Amazon region and from the Andes. These products have specific characteristics that can be projected abroad, as besides being of high quality, consumers are acquiring a story of the production of that specific good that involves social responsibility, community redistribution, and local development. These are the elements we want to project through our country brand positioning. Through all of our campaigns, we want to represent the diversity of our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements after 12 years as Mayor of Guayaquil?<br></h4><p>The main achievement has been to serve the people of Guayaquil, and we must have achieved that after winning three elections with over 70% of the votes. We have done much for education and health, matters in which we don't have the legal obligation to intervene. Other matters we have pursued include the sewer system, paving neighborhood roads, constructing roads and tunnels, building level crossings, and urban regeneration, which gained recognition from the UN and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) as a sustainable project. We have also promoted the construction of thousands of houses and are proud of Metrovia, a bus rapid transit system, as well as a world-class airport. We also have a clear conscience for facilitating the growth and development of the city through national and international private sector efforts under different categories, from joint ventures to concessions.</p><h4>What is the urban regeneration process currently focusing on?</h4><p>All of our programs have a permanent nature, otherwise we can't guarantee sustainable development. Urban regeneration changes people's lives, advances the economy, and drives employment. It also encourages tourism. Around 12 years ago the tourism sector was almost non-existent. People used to visit Guayaquil to study, visit friends, or do business, but we had no tourism pull, nationally or internationally. Nowadays, Guayaquil is the first city in Ecuador for tourist visits by national and international visitors.</p><h4>What is Guayaquil's budget for 2012 and the main focus for the year?</h4><p>Our budget is around $600 million, and 85% will be spent on works and services. One ongoing project is Digital Guayaquil, which will provide part of the city with free wireless. The budget for this is $2 million per year. We administrate the city with very conservative norms, for everything regarding public debts and running costs. First of all, our indebtedness hasn't gone over 5% of our annual budget in 12 years of administration, and has always been dedicated to public works. Secondly, for every $100 that comes to Guayaquil, $15 goes toward administrative costs, and $85 to works and services. This has been well reflected in our approval ratings, which are around 90% for this administration.</p><h4>How can Ecuador increase its foreign investor pull?</h4><p>There are a variety of national and international investments in Guayaquil, but being a part of Ecuador, FDI in Guayaquil depends on how the international community perceives the country. Investments respond to very clear parameters: legal safeguards, confidence, incentives, clear rules, and opportunities to make profits.</p><h4>Has the political conjuncture in Guayaquil made the difference in terms of the business climate in the city?</h4><p>The way to be successful in business is through sustainability. Obstacles have to be turned into stepping stones, and businessmen need to look at the long term, as good and bad administrations come and go. It is all about attitude. If we had started off with the idea that Guayaquil couldn't change or needed to wait to be swept up in national development, we wouldn't have achieved anything. However, we decided, in line with the idea of national unity, to take matters into our own hands, develop projects, and reach our goals.</p><h4>What other advantages does the city of Guayaquil have to attract investment?</h4><p>Guayaquil is a city with political and legal stability. Here the rules are clear, and there is respect for what has been agreed upon. There is an ideological consistency in procedures. We have an airport that operates every day of the year. We have great connectivity by air, sea, and land. Guayaquil is a logical multimodal hub from Asia, with ports such as Posorja, which sooner or later will be an intercontinental port for container transfer, with an ideal depth and location. Obviously, the city needs to fit into the national framework. For example, this isn't an area to invest in mining or oil, but it is perfect for investments in industry, agribusiness, tourism, construction, and trade and maritime areas. This is a city that is continuously evolving.</p><h4>How have the municipality and the private sector worked together?</h4><p>Cooperation has occurred on the new airport, the expansion of the current airport, the ports, the Metrovia system, shopping malls, and urban regeneration. The private sector is an important partner for us. This is a part of our autonomy. The local community this way has its own development model. Other cities, such as Quito, Cuenca, and Machala cannot be administered in the same way, as every city is unique. Here, we respect everyone, and we also demand respect. We are responsible for our successes and failures. This is the philosophy that has been implemented in this city for a long time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges you have faced as Mayor of Quito?<br></h4><p>Quito is similar to many cities in Latin America, in that it has experienced aggressive growth. By the mid-20th century, Quito's population stood at 250,000 or 300,000 people; in the last census we counted approximately 2.3 million. This means that over the course of 60 or 70 years the population has multiplied by 10, which is a very sharp increase. In the 2001 census, Quito recorded 1.8 million people, which means we are registering growth of 50,000 people per year. These demographics present a challenge in terms of the demand for public services, but we have overcome many obstacles. Quito has an extensive water network, covering close to 97% of its area, and sewage systems cover over 91%. Our domestic garbage collection covers 96% of the population. In service supply, we exceed the national average with numbers closer to those seen in European cities. Quito is a capital city with a strong political debate, important government presence, and 23 universities, and we are observing a demographic transformation process. In Quito, we enjoy a deeper notion of modernism, culture, and architecture, and the city has also grown economically over the past few years owing to investments in social mobility.</p><h4>What impact will the new airport have on the city's tourism and commerce?</h4><p>We have huge expectations, as the city has demanded the airport for many years. Quito plays an important role as a tourist destination and an exporter. Quito and the surrounding region have become the largest exporters of flowers, for example. The airport will have an impact on passenger traffic and cargo. We aim to strengthen the export capacity of flowers and traditional products such as handicrafts, as well as non-traditional farming products, which will have a major impact on the economy and the dynamics of the market. In 2011, we served 5.4 million passengers at the Mariscal Sucre International Airport and received almost 500,000 tourists to the city, demonstrating our growth and expansion. The largest transformation of the city has yet to be seen, as the current airport will feature an exit in the north of the city, where tourism will expand. Currently, the airport functions as a virtual barrier between the west and east, and the new exit of the airport will allow us to build a 150-hectare park, reconfigure the city, offer denser services, and make the city more compact.</p><h4>What will the subway's main characteristics be, and how will it affect the city's mobility?</h4><p>We are working on the structure of the transport corridors. Over the past two years, we have doubled the transport capacity of buses and trolleys. The spine of our system will be the subway, which is in the final stages of analysis. The first stage measured the feasibility of the project, presented in July 2011. The project was proposed by the Metro of Madrid and the analysis offered clear conclusions. We have to install a high-capacity system, structured with the physical unification of the transportation network. We determined that Quito is the ideal city for a subway due to its long shape and the limitation of operating conventional bus services. Currently we are involved in a two-part stage, which includes finishing our detailed research on engineering and the location of stops. We are hoping to formally announce the specifications of the system. Our preliminary figures suggest that the subway will be 22 kilometers long with 15 stops and 106 wagons, and it will take 24 minutes to travel from Labrador to the Quitumbe station, and transport 370,000 people daily in its first year. The construction of two multimodal stations will be put to the test in mid-2012. We will start construction work in the third quarter, as the conceptual stages of the project will be completed in August.</p><h4>What are the main advantages that Quito offers to foreign investors?</h4><p>There are several advantages. Currently, much of the foreign investment is geared toward the airport and subway projects. Quito boasts excellent competitiveness, with an educated population, trained professionals, and excellent services. We also have a strong legal process with clear laws; there is legal security because our regulations are respected, which is key for investment. We are also developing a process to set up key investment factors. Through the program, companies can earn what we call a “Seal of Prioritized Investment," which is designed to accelerate the bureaucratic processes. A number of investments have this seal, which makes them agile. We are organizing the city by industrial areas, which is also key for investment. Many of the risks people face when they make investments involve sustainability and the environment, and we are reconfiguring these areas to increase security. Finally, we have an outstanding cultural agenda. We are the perfect size, with the advantage of a metropolis that is centrally located without the complexities of a huge population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main strategy does the new Social Security Law envisage?</h4><p>Ecuador is in the process of reforming its social security system. This is a very significant step for the country, taking into account that in the past Ecuadoreans perceived the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute (IESS) as the sole provider of social security. The new law will involve every aspect of the system; taxpayers as well as both semi- and non-contributive members of the population. The semi- and non-contributors represent people who are unemployed or retired, which comprise 50% of the population in Ecuador. Therefore, it is important to ensure we have the right welfare system in place. These will be the main pillars of the new law we are expecting in 2013. At the moment, Ecuador has pension benefits for unemployed people, senior citizens, and housewives; these citizens historically depended on the government, not on the national pension fund. The new law will create a sustainable fund system that will offer benefits for retired people independent of the government administration.</p><h4>How have the laws for Ecuadorean taxpayers evolved over time?</h4><p>A few years ago, there were 1.5 million people affiliated with the social security system in Ecuador, which covered the employed members of a family and their children for one year. As of today, there are 2.5 million affiliated people, covering 50% of the economically active population in Ecuador. If we include retirees and rural social security workers, there are over 3 million people. In addition, we have extended the coverage of the system to include children under the age of 18 and a taxpayer's partner, as long as they contribute 3.41% of their wages. I would like to emphasize that one of our greatest achievements was the ending of a vicious cycle; there were a lack of affiliates because there were almost no services, and the social security system couldn't offer many services because there weren't enough affiliates. In this regard, the IESS Bank has significantly invested in the health system over the last few years, which has brought us a great deal of recognition and success at all levels. For example, we appealed to the private sector to increase the number of public hospitals and clinics, and now the IESS has 295 private healthcare centers at the service of the social security system. In 2011 alone, private healthcare institutions treated 603,000 patients. Furthermore, we have established 33 new hospitals, with eight more under construction. We are planning to develop 15 new hospitals in the near future.</p><h4>How does the IESS invest its resources?</h4><p>Social security is the main domestic savings scavenger in every country, and Ecuador, a country thirsty for financing, kept those economic resources in the Central Bank. Much of the monetary reserves were funneled to foreign countries, and the IESS was only paid 0.7% annually. We have now reversed this situation, allocating social security funds for the development of the country. We invest through our mortgage and unsecured loan portfolios of about $3 billion, and through strategic development projects in the oil industry (Pañacocha), electric power (Toachi-Pilatón and Coca Codo Sinclair), and in healthcare infrastructure. In addition, we have invested $750 million in the securities market and the manufacturing sector. Today, the IESS has a variety of investments in 87 private companies, and we are shareholders in 18 of the 20 top national companies. We turned the IESS into a significant player in the development of Ecuador, stimulating the national economy.</p><h4>How would you assess the competitive level of the public healthcare system in Ecuador?</h4><p>I firmly believe that the IESS' participation in the development of the public healthcare system has been a key part of its overall improvement. We have encouraged private institutions to invest in both staff and infrastructure. In my opinion, the public healthcare system should focus on primary health care, which represents 80% of the overall medical treatments. In this way, specialized and more complex treatments are the responsibility of the private sector, which leads the way on investment in new technology and innovation.</p><h4>Ecuador has recently raised its pension levels by 14%, the highest in the region. Are the needs of future members met?</h4><p>The investments made over the last few years have enabled the IESS to diversify its portfolio. I believe that the social security system has a bright future within the region, thanks to the young population. The average age of an affiliated member is 35, and we currently have 8.5 economically active people per retired person, and expect to reach 10 by end-2011. To put these figures into context; the average number of economically active people per retired person in Latin America is 5.4, and in Europe it is 1.8.</p><h4>What are your main investment lines?</h4><p>Our investments have been and continue to be consistent with the government's macroeconomic policies. Ecuador is experiencing serious problems with consumerism, and we do not invest in imports, neither cars nor household appliances. Instead, we believe that we must reduce the current trade balance. In the future, the IESS will further invest in construction in order to develop the 200 hectares of available land we own in Quito and in other cities like Guayaquil and Cuenca. We will further strengthen our ties with private companies in the construction sector, in order to maintain reasonable construction prices. Construction will definitely drive our investment lines in the near future, because the sector offers great opportunities. The IESS is seeking partners for the development of large construction projects, especially those that address the demands of the lower to middle income population. In this regard, I also see the mining sector as a potential recipient of investment, both local and foreign, because the sector is taking its first steps in the country. The government is also heavily promoting the development of ICT, creating many investment opportunities.</p><h4>What is the significance of the agreement signed with Spain to help the economically active Ecuadorean population in that country?</h4><p>Such an agreement is very important for Ecuadorean migrants at retirement age who have worked in both countries. We agreed to implement a pension portability system that will facilitate the accumulation of workers' pensions, regardless of the country they worked in. For example, this agreement allows someone who worked for 14 years in Ecuador and 17 years in Spain access to their pension in either country after retirement. This is also reciprocal for Spanish workers in Ecuador. Furthermore, we have signed agreements with other South American countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Peru, and Chile. In the future, we want to focus our efforts on our emigrant community in the US, where a great number of Ecuadorean workers lack permits and do not have access to health care. We are also providing primary healthcare services to this community via a network based in Ecuador. The only requirement is to enroll in social security on the internet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main function of the Central Bank of Ecuador (CBE)?</h4><p>When Ecuador became dollarized, the central bank assumed the role of a control agent that monitors the flow of currency in the economy. The CBE cannot issue money, but instead verifies the monetary stability of the country. It analyzes the monetary supply that is circulating in the economy, implements mechanisms that make monetary supply more efficient, and protects the economy from external shocks.</p><h4>How does the CBE ensure that monetary supply control is efficient?</h4><p>The CBE affects the velocity of circulation. We are working toward the modernization of national payment systems in order to make all transactional mechanisms similar to the modern methods used in developed countries. In many countries, you can enter any business point and make payments using magnetic technology, such as a debit card or mobile payment systems. We haven't achieved this level of efficiency in Ecuador, and the objective of the CBE in 2012 is to accelerate the penetration of electronic transactions so that people from both urban and rural areas have access to electronic and mobile payment methods. The CBE has a strong capacity to manage the economy by controlling the flow of money.</p><h4>What does the freely available monetary fund consist of, and how does the country utilize it?</h4><p>When we used a local currency, the freely available monetary fund was a protection mechanism against crises. In a dollarized economy, the freely available monetary fund cannot be a control mechanism to cover external shocks. During the most recent crisis, complex accounting management took place. When the economy shifted to dollarization, four balance sheets were created for the CBE, and included within these documents is the concept of the freely available monetary fund. According to the law of the CBE, the IMF is still mentioned, in addition to national funds. In practice, we have to manage a general reserve and understand how much money supply we can depend on to respond to external shocks.</p><h4>What is the amount available to cover a possible crisis?</h4><p>We manage the currency flow in the economy adequately. Adding up every fund we have available amounts to over 30% of GDP, which corresponds to all the currency that is circulating in the economy. This currency would be readily available in a time of crisis. In terms of the freely available fund, it contains more than $3.5 billion on average; in circulating currency there is $26.5 billion. These resources are more than enough to control an external shock. However, no amount would cover a calamity as severe as the crisis in Greece. In 2008, we had enough maneuvering capacity to use roughly $1.2 billion to control the economy, and currently we are enjoying favorable rates of growth. During the crisis, we experienced a 1% growth rate, followed by 3%, 4%, and 8% in 2009-2011, respectively. We have learned that managing a crisis is not related to the size of the fund, but rather to the efficient use of resources.</p><h4>What is your forecast for 2012 in terms of the trade balance?</h4><p>Our predictions for 2012 are positive, and we firmly believe we will maintain excellent growth rates of around 5%. Our growth depends on the depth of the crisis in Europe, which can easily affect the global economy. Regardless, we believe that 2012 will be a year of growth. In terms of our trade balance, we believe that a certain deficit level will continue, as historically the economy has registered trade balance deficits. The gap of the trade balance is covered by investments in high-yield projects and the increase of exports. There has been important growth in exports from the country and a considerable reduction in imports, and for the first time sectors such as textiles and metallurgy are growing at rates higher than 5% or 6%. Sectors that were historically importing products are now manufacturing locally and conserving the currency outflow. The concern regarding the trade balance is not the deficit itself, but the quality of the deficit that is determined by the types of products we are importing.</p><h4>What expectations do you have for the introduction of mobile banking in Ecuador?</h4><p>Mobile banking is a payment method that facilitates financial inclusion. We, however, are also creating a much more powerful scheme that will allow people to carry out financial transactions using various methods of interaction. Through this integrated system, people will be able to utilize banking or non-banking agents to make withdrawals, complete payments, receive and send remittances, and check balances. The mobile wallet is only an additional payment method. What we are creating is a very powerful transactional system that will include cooperatives and specialized banks. We hope that non-banking agents and other non-financial institutions will participate so we can provide financial transaction solutions to people in urban and rural areas.</p><h4>For what reasons is there an absence of large foreign banks in Ecuador?</h4><p>The big international banking groups came to Latin America over 15 or 20 years ago. The Spanish banking groups have the widest presence, as they bought banks from Mexico to Chile. However, these were investments made in the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s. Unfortunately in Ecuador, the position of the interested powers that controlled the banking industry prevented the entrance of international banks in a major way. Ecuador was thus left behind as these groups began to make inroads into Latin America. In terms of the future, I don't believe they will make an entrance in the short term, because these banking groups are concentrating on surviving the crisis and they are not investing in any new regions around the world. Our expectation is that other kinds of groups will come from neighboring countries, such as specialized banks. However, this also won't happen in the short term because of the international juncture. We do believe that there are opportunities, thanks to the anti-monopoly law passed last year, as it limits banking groups and their shareholders from making investments in the real or media sectors. This has opened up many opportunities, as many financial groups with interests in the real sector have decided to sell off their participation in the financial sector. This will be an opportunity for groups specialized in the financial sector to buy these participants. The same happens with insurance companies because the law also states that banks can't own insurance companies. Therefore, the shareholders are selling their assets in the insurance sector, and this is opening up a myriad of opportunities for groups that are specialized in this sector. These facts will generate lots of opportunities, and it is also the right time as the regulatory framework is incentivizing development in this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main responsibilities for the coordination of Ecuador's strategic sectors?<br></h4><p>We have been through some deep political and structural transformations over the last few years in Ecuador. In the new constitution, passed in 2008, our President rescued the role of the strategic sectors, defining them and changing their historical mission for the development of Ecuador. Previously, public companies were part of a holding called the Solidarity Fund, which I was the president of at the beginning of the new government's term. It was a shareholder of the electric and telecommunications companies that were in state hands, in which it was forbidden by law to invest because they were to be privatized. Inefficient electricity companies accumulated more and more losses due to the investment prohibition, despite the 30-year backwardness, bad service, and lack of investment. Therefore, we had to enact a constitutional mandate for the state to be able to invest in these companies. This was then consecrated in the constitution, which also includes a new legal framework. We achieved the Hydrocarbons Law, and soon we will propose a new Electricity Law. The Mining Law is new as well. There's a law project in the National Assembly for discussions in relation to telecommunications as well. Because of the mainstreaming of these sectors, our government decided to create the coordinating ministries. These ministries manage several areas. The Ministry of Strategic Sectors coordinates the National Secretariat of Water (SENAGUA), the Telecommunications and Information Society Ministry, the Ministry of Non-Renewable Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energies. Before this government there wasn't a ministry to exercise stewardship in ICT, the aspects of which are of vital importance in the development of a country.</p><h4>What are the main aspects and projects coordinated by your Ministry to change the energy matrix?</h4><p>The vision by 2016 is that 93% of energy sources in the matrix will be hydroelectric. This is a small country where there is petroleum. Nevertheless, we bet on renewable energies and not only for the sovereignty of Ecuador in renewable energy, but also to be able to export energy. In 2010, Ecuador held the pro-tempore presidency of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), and we proposed taking advantage of our hydroelectric potential to export renewable electric energy to the region, not only to Colombia and Peru, but also to Venezuela, Chile, and Uruguay. We also promoted at the Andean Community level a transversal regulation that is valid for Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. We now have eight new hydroelectric power plants under construction. We have also consolidated our thermal park through our energy sovereignty, to improve the reliability of the service. Our energy reserves have increased considerably and we have substituted a lot of the generating capacity that used diesel to fuel oil, a product available in Ecuador. The goal by 2013 is for Ecuador to consume no diesel in the electric sector. In 2012 it will already represent less than 1%, because we have been substituting it for fuel oil and natural gas. In the future, the country will have a strong hydroelectric component. By 2016 we will double the installed capacity of electric generation across the whole territory.</p><h4>What aspirations exist for the export of renewable energy?</h4><p>We want to become a center for the export of renewable energy. With all the projects that we mentioned, Ecuador won't even use 30% of its hydroelectric potential. There is a matter of economic efficiency. We haven't utilized our geothermal potential yet, which is very important in Ecuador. At least 2,000 MW could be generated via geothermal means. However, this will be a later phase because today we face a huge technical, financial, and managerial challenge with the hydroelectric plants, which are already funded in part by the national budget and partly by foreign funding. At the same time, Ecuador exports petroleum with financial assistance and we import derivatives. This affects the balance of trade and balance of payments. In 2008 we decided to implement the most ambitious project of our government, which is the Refinery of the Pacific, with a capacity of 300,000 bbl/d. We started this project together with Venezuela, and we have invested approximately $500 million. We have hired an international investment house, MizuhoBank, to set up the financial structure. Over 2012 we'll be doing some presentation rounds in Europe, China, Russia, and Brazil to promote the project and find at least a third partner for financial leverage. This is the big challenge for 2012; to solidify the interest of potential partners.</p><h4>What has been the Ministry's role in the recent changes to the telecommunications sector in the country?</h4><p>In 2006 the previous government tried to conclude a contract with mobile telecommunications operators. The vision was to get $70 million for the licenses. We negotiated with the operators for $700 million plus 1% of the raw revenues for the IT development fund. Everyone thought that rates were going to increase, that the networks were not going to be developed, that service penetration wouldn't increase, and that traffic was going to decrease, but at the end of the day the situation was the opposite. Rates actually decreased, companies paid corporate taxes, coverage increased, and penetration grew exponentially. The state will get $700 million over the next 15 years. Also, investment over the next five years will be around $900 million through the public company to improve services. Before, we had 1,400 kilometers of fiber-optic cable under the public company, and now we have almost 7,500 kilometers, while broadband prices have decreased. Public companies have managed to reduce the costs of the entire industry. For the first time in history, our 23 provinces are connected by fiber-optic cables. Before, this public policy didn't exist. Despite this situation, the profits of the public companies have increased. Almost 4,000 schools are also connected to the internet through the Scholar Connectivity Plan.</p><h4>Currently the country is looking at the mining sector as the engine for the next economic boom. Is this a real possibility?</h4><p>We are finalizing negotiations for contracts with two private mining companies. One is EcuaCorriente (copper) and the other is Kinross (gold). Foreign investment by mining companies will be at least $1.5 billion over the development periods, and I am sure that when the negotiations are done, Ecuador will receive a significant amount of mining income. After that, we are planning to launch a bid for the exploration of new areas. The constitution obliges us to keep at least 50% of mining income for the state, while maintaining a tremendous respect for nature. These resources will be invested by the government in infrastructure and in development projects in nearby towns. This is a new issue in Ecuador; we are at the beginning, but now there is a clear legal framework. The takeoff of mining in the country is going to be very important.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have things changed since the oil contracts were renegotiated in 2010?<br></h4><p>The change is very important at a global level, because there are very few contracts like the ones we have, based on rate per barrel. In the beginning, we encountered some resistance after a relatively difficult set of negotiations. We reached an agreement with 12 out of the 17 companies that work in Ecuador, and these companies are now planning to invest a further $1.4 billion over the next three years. The situation is fine and the companies are happy because the rate means a ceiling for company incomes when the price goes up, and the entire surplus goes to the state. In 2011, we obtained $1.5 billion in net profit from these negotiations. In 2012 the figure could be higher, because prices are rising. The price at the time of negotiation was $72 per barrel, and the companies have a rate of $32. The price rose from $72 to $103, which represented a huge profit for the country. The companies are now very interested in continuing with this model, though with some changes, and these were discussed during the 11th round of negotiations, which opened in May 2012.</p><h4>What are your perspectives for the exploration and production (E&amp;P) round of negotiations?</h4><p>We have a dozen national oil companies (NOCs) interested, but we have not opened up discussion yet with private companies. There are Canadian, US, and Argentinian companies. The contracts on offer will be service contracts for the provision of services at a specified rate, and the rate will be determined according to the level of risk. There will be a tender, and the company that takes the lowest level of risk will win. There will be four blocks reserved for NOCs and 10 for private companies.</p><h4>Regarding EP Petroecuador's mature fields, are there any new international companies coming in?</h4><p>So far, we have signed for two fields with consortiums led by Tecpetrol at the Libertador field, and Schlumberger at the Shushufindi field. There are still two fields, Cuyabeno-Sansaguay and Auca, which are still under negotiation with Halliburton. We are negotiating the rates and the legal composition of the consortium that will sign with that company.</p><h4>How will planned refinery upgrade work progress in 2012?</h4><p>The Refinery of the Pacific is important. The basic engineering works finished in May 2012, and by October we hope to finalize the project financing. There are several options, but the main one is to find an equity partner for EP Petroecuador and Petroleum of Venezuela (PDVSA) to reduce the capital outlaw of direct investment. At the Esmeraldas Refinery, works will cost around $900 million and should be completed by the end of 2013. The upgrade program basically involves a refurbishing and restructuring of the refinery's facilities. In addition, we have a project to develop improved products, which involves a further investment of around $600 million. There is also another project to double the capacity of the Shushufindi Refinery. In total, refined capacity will increase to close to 450,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) by the end of 2016.</p><h4>Regarding mining activities, the government just signed a completely new contract model with EcuaCorriente. How are the negotiations with other mining companies continuing?</h4><p>Contrary to what happens with oil, where we have extensive experience and capacity and have signed contracts for service provisions with two state companies, we are beginners in the mining sector. We can't sign contracts that demand maturity. We have a classic contract for mining exploitation rights, where we only request the tax system conditions regarding income, and international standards of mining exploitation are followed in the form of a concession agreement. We have signed with EcuaCorriente, which is the first company, and we hope to reach an agreement with Canadian company Kinross in 2012. Apart from the negotiations, there is an administrative procedure that could take a bit longer, but we hope that by the middle of the year everything will be finalized. And there is a third small contract for the Rí­o Blanco field with another Canadian company, International Minerals. In 2013 we intend to sign two more with EcuaCorriente in Panantza-San Carlos, another copper deposit, and with International Minerals in Quimsacocha. They are now in the advanced exploration phase, and they will move on to the exploitation phase by next year.</p><h4>You have recently found new offshore gas reserves in Ecuador. Is it a substantial discovery?</h4><p>We have produced gas in small quantities for over a decade, at a rate of 30 million cubic feet per day, or around 5,000-6,000 bbl/d. However, our exploration activities gave us hope that we could triple this production within a year. The estimated reserves nowadays mean we could produce 10 times more than we do today. However, to achieve that, we need to make certain additional verifications. With SIPEC from Chile and the additional exploration performed by EP Petroecuador, we will probably achieve levels of production equivalent to 50,000 bbl of oil in the medium term.</p><h4>What impact will increasing oil prices have?</h4><p>In terms of private production, if the average price is around $100/bbl, it means that we will earn $30 additionally on what was renegotiated in 2010 for every barrel. If we multiply this by 50 million bbl, this is an additional $1.5 billion. According to contracts, we expect to export around 125 million bbl in 2012, totaling $12.5 billion.</p><h4>How much could mining activities represent for the country's GDP in the years to come?</h4><p>EcuaCorriente should start producing by the last quarter of 2013, with 30,000 tons of processing, which is one-third of its total potential, and then start increasing until it reaches 60,000 tons. By the end of 2014, we estimate a benefit in royalties of around $45 million per year plus taxes, meaning around $300 million per year. The same is true regarding Kinross and Rí­o Blanco. So, as a whole, we will receive around $500 million per year by 2014.</p><h4>What will be the role of the national mining company ENAMI?</h4><p>ENAMI is becoming very strong in the gold industry. It already has eight concessions in Esmeraldas, and will enter the exploitation area strongly and be a remedy for illegal mining activity. We will start collaborating with companies in mining services that will provide high-tech machinery and working methods. It also has, at this moment, three concessions for non-metallic minerals, which will rise to four in the future. The strategy is to create mixed economy companies, and in the first phase develop ENAMI before it can fly alone, because it demands a lot of resources and time. We hope that within a single generation the company will be able to become what EP Petroecuador or Petroamazonas EP represent in the oil sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After 25 years in the country, how significant is Ecuador for the company?<br></h4><p>Ecuador has been and remains a cornerstone for the company's international operations. During these 25 years in Ecuador we have been bilateral trade promoters in the export of engineering and construction services from Brazil to Ecuador, developing projects worth over $1 billion, most of them with official financial support from Brazil. Ecuador's importance for the company is further reflected in the more than 700 Ecuadoreans currently working for the organization both in Ecuador and abroad. Odebrecht is a global company with a local presence. We strive to act like a local company in every country we are present, thus providing global know-how and resources to address local needs, while adapting to local conditions, seeking and training qualified and motivated individuals, and becoming part of the countries we are in.</p><h4>In what sectors has Odebrecht been involved since it entered the country?</h4><p>Every developing country presents considerable challenges and opportunities for construction companies. Ecuador is no exception, especially in the areas of energy, water, wastewater treatment, and intermodal infrastructure projects such as roads and harbors. Our previous projects in Ecuador have been related to water management and flood-prevention infrastructure, as river basins experience extreme flooding and drought cycles almost every year. The importance of flood control and the potential benefits and impact of these types of projects on the economy and well-being of the population and the environmental importance of proper water management practices motivates us to stick to these types of activities.</p><h4>What are the main projects Odebrecht is working on at this moment?</h4><p>We are currently working on the rehabilitation of the Pucara Hydropower Plant, which provides 73 MW of capacity to the national grid, on the construction of Manduriacu, a hydropower plant of 60 MW, the first of seven hydropower plants that will be installed along the Guayllabamba River basin, and on the construction of the road Rua Viva in the city Quito. Besides those three contracts we were recently awarded the contracts for the construction of the Daule Vinces irrigation project and for the preparation of the Refinery of the Pacific project site.</p><h4>How has the company's semi-autonomy from its headquarters in Brazil allowed you to develop relationships with local firms?</h4><p>We strive to act as a local company with global expertise, and thus we tend to establish partnerships with local firms as much as possible. However, any partnership is like a marriage, where the parties have to know each other well and share the same principles and goals. Therefore, we seek companies with similar standards of excellence and performance and which have a genuine commitment to fulfill our clients' needs. During our years in Ecuador we have developed a very solid network of local construction partners, banks, insurance companies, and others. We have grown with our partners and look forward to future opportunities together as well as establishing new partnerships with other firms.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for diversification?</h4><p>Odebrecht is always looking for new opportunities in construction and in many other areas, such as energy (whether as a contractor or as a concession operator), oil and gas, petrochemicals, industrial water and sewage treatment, and ethanol production. If opportunities arise we are willing to venture into these areas.</p><h4>How competitive is the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p>It is very competitive as it includes local companies with considerable resources and experience and international firms from Brazil, Italy, Spain, and China. Despite being a small country, Ecuador has recently embarked on an ambitious infrastructure development program. So far, significant portions of these projects have been financed by China. In that respect, the availability of financing coupled with high construction standards provide a competitive edge.</p><h4>What is the extent of Odebrecht's environmental and community programs in Ecuador?</h4><p>During our almost 70 years of history we have developed and implemented an enormous number of programs in all the countries we are present in, always seeking to respect the society we are working in, the people we are working with, their cultural traditions, and the environment to ensure the sustainability of our projects. Our sustainability policy considers human beings pivotal for a multi-dimensional concept of sustainability, which includes economic, social, environmental, political, and cultural aspects.</p><h4>What are the future prospects for the company's activities in the country?</h4><p>We feel we are part of Ecuador's past and future. Odebrecht is thus well positioned to participate in future infrastructure projects driven and financed by the Ecuadorean government. We can also obtain Brazilian resources to finance public projects and we are definitely interested in private endeavors. We structure projects in their entirety and we believe we can continue bringing great quality to the construction industry with integral solutions. At Odebrecht, we dream the dreams of our clients. We know how to make them happen. This is our daily challenge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are contracts with the oil companies delimited today?<br></h4><p>Through a ministerial agreement, a single-contract model was designed for the provision of services. Qualified companies compromise with the Hydrocarbons Secretariat of Ecuador (SHE) to use their own economic resources in the exploration and/or exploitation of indicated areas, investing capital and providing the necessary equipment and machinery to fulfill the contract. The contractor that is exploiting a field is thereby entitled to payment. We have new blocks, and when a contracted company discovers oil, it then presents a development plan outlining investment, costs, and expenses.</p><h4>How did the government come to a consensus with the companies involved?</h4><p>To agree on a price was very difficult. Oil companies have a variety of operation costs and investments. However, the Secretariat decided upon an average operation cost using references from large oil companies such as Petroamazonas. Additionally, sub-companies have investment costs for drilling, pipeline construction, and production facilities, and those prices had to be negotiated. Moreover, we discussed the increasing production curve, which we determined using the history of reserve behavior. The negotiated average price was $32 per barrel, and we observed that many companies' benefits were based on the oil price. Currently, the country obtains a share of the benefits and companies are compensated with a fair price.</p><h4>When will the next round of tenders start?</h4><p>The 11th oil round is planned to take place in mid-2012. We have all the necessary technical information and the basis of the contracts ready. This round, a new type of contract will be prepared, and a reformed economic model for the round is pending. We continue to study the possible models, as we wait for the Minister of Energy and Mining and President of Ecuador to finish the final analyses and economic evaluation. The round is hosting a bid for exploration; this is the first time that a fully exploratory contest has taken place for participation contracts. The service provision contracts will be given when oil has been discovered and successfully exploited. We are seeking a model that can be adapted to this situation, which will also be unique.</p><h4>Will the contracts stipulate exploration exclusively, or lead to exploitation carried out by the same company?</h4><p>Because it is an exploratory round, the 21 blocks we have assigned are based on information gathered from geologists and geophysicists. The contracts specify exploration simply because we have very little information on a number of these blocks in terms of reserves. There are other blocks that have been drilled unsuccessfully, and there are some on which we have no information whatsoever. We are seeking companies that are interested in investing in Ecuador, and if they make their investment during the exploratory stage and are successful, we are open to receive development plans that include further investments and a tentative production curve. Based on these factors, we will negotiate the tariff and compensate the investments made in exploration. This compensation would present an IRR higher than those blocks that have no risk and are already producing oil.</p><h4>What benefits does the Secretariat expect to obtain from oil activities in 2012?</h4><p>We expected an income of around $1.6 billion for the government in 2011, and we registered almost $3 billion. This was largely due to the changes in the contract and the rapid increase of oil prices and production. The production of private companies surpassed what we expected by 4%, delivering almost 142,000 barrels more than the average. This demonstrates that the companies are motivated and eager to invest. Our ambition for 2012 is to increase production by 20,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) to reach an average of 520,000 bbl/d. We are working to surpass expectations, which will happen as long as the price of oil stays the same and our relationships with the involved companies continue to work beautifully. We are very strict when it comes to contracts, and we also handle payments very carefully. In fact, 30 days after a company presents its invoice, it will receive compensation from us. In conclusion, I firmly believe that we will continue growing as we did in 2011.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led EP Petroecuador's growth to exceed expectations?<br></h4><p>We accomplished the plan proposed at the beginning of 2011, to drill new wells with a large number of towers. Our strategy was successful, and the wells we've added have been very productive. We also launched a successful and productive new oil field, the Drago. The Drago is currently producing 10,000 barrels a day (bbl/d), and we hope to double this figure in the coming years. We were successful in completing our program and in the discovery of reserves. This has allowed us to achieve our targeted level of production and exceed the prediction of 6% growth. We planned to produce 52 million barrels per year, but we obtained 55.3 million. Thanks to our subsidiary Rí­o Napo, we were able to produce an additional 50,000 bbl/d. In 2011 we produced approximately 200,000 bbl/d. We maintain an investment fund, and in 2011 we were able to add $500 million more to our investment capabilities in the areas of exploration and production (E&amp;P). Regarding gas, we assumed the platform that belonged to US-based EDC in 2011. We have also incorporated reserves of 18 million barrels of oil in 2011. On the E&amp;P side, we are finishing negotiations to hire well-known companies such as Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes so as to integrate new technology, optimize the production of oil, and develop enhanced oil recovery techniques for reserves that will allow us to increase the retrievable resources through methods of secondary and tertiary extraction. We have been carrying out this project since 2011. EP Petroecuador is more than an oil company, because it is present in every link of the value chain. In the refineries, we have achieved 100% of our goals. The most important refinery in Ecuador is called Esmeraldas, and it is under renovation. This refinery is substantially damaged, and under risk of collapse. At the moment, the refinery is operating at 90% of capacity, and the process of renovation will continue until 2013. Regarding our industrial activities, we have installed a new plant to liquefy natural gas on the Ecuadorean shore, so we can incorporate a new product—liquid natural gas (LNG)—mainly used by companies in industrial applications.</p><h4>What factors will characterize the merger between EP Petroecuador and Petroamazonas EP?</h4><p>In partnership with Deloitte, we began submitting information and determining the existing options for restructuring the company in March 2011. EP Petroamazonas is an oil company that manages a number of fields in the Amazon region; the idea is to unify our efforts, form a synergy, and be more efficient than we are separately. Petroamazonas will manage the transportation of oil and gas through pipelines, the international commercialization of oil, and the refining and commercialization of derivatives. EP Petroamazonas will take care of all upstream activities. This means we are completely changing our structure as we incorporate new technology, systems, procedures, business culture, and human resources management. The merger will help to avoid mistakes and unnecessary redundancies. In that sense, we are trying to incorporate new IT systems to connect all of our segments. Petroecuador EP already has excellent technology regarding the engineering of pipelines, but our departments are operating in an isolated way. We are working toward an integrated system. Furthermore, we aim to improve our training to achieve better results from our employee base.</p><h4>EP Petroecuador plans to invest over $2 billion to modernize its refineries. How much capacity will be added?</h4><p>The renovation of the Esmeraldas Refinery will cost $750 million, and we have been working on the project since 2008. Apart from refinery renovation, we began a program to improve the quality of our fuels at the end of 2011. The program consists of developing the production of diesel and gasoline. In diesel, we have reduced the content of sulfur to 500 parts per million, but we aim to reduce it to 250 parts per million by mid-2012. Regarding gasoline, we will increase the octane level to 87 as an initial step. Simultaneously, we are carrying out industrial projects to build new plants for the improvement of fuel quality. These projects are at the Refinery of the Amazon, and the cost will amount to $800 million. In total, we will invest $1.4 billion to improve the quality of our fuels. Moreover, we have a project to build a new Refinery on the Pacific, with a budget of around $1.2 billion. Our goals are twofold: export crude oil and begin exporting high-quality crude oil derivatives while filling the gaps in the country's demand. Currently, we are importers of large volumes of diesel, naphtha, and LNG. Finally, we want to improve the quality of fuels to achieve the highest standards in the world. Our goal is to have fuels that meet Euro-5 standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How were your results in 2011?<br></h4><p>Petroamazonas EP supported the Ecuadorean economy by producing 33% of all processed oil, which is the country's main income. The oil income generated by Petroamazonas EP in 2011 was $4.3 billion, and this is a very important income source for Ecuador. Petroamazonas EP has been growing quickly over recent years. In 2012, we will be the major upstream company in Ecuador, producing over 300,000 barrels per day (bbl/d). This represents 75% of the country's total oil production.</p><h4>What were the factors that led to the company's rapid growth?</h4><p>In 2006, Petroamazonas EP received the operations of previous private operators that were in charge of blocks in the Oriental Basin in Ecuador. We have been growing because, thanks to our procedures, processes, and business model, the government decided Petroamazonas EP was the best company to take onboard more responsibilities in the upstream oil business in Ecuador. Petroamazonas EP has a very modern business model, giving us great competitive advantages in comparison to other national companies in Ecuador.</p><h4>Regarding Petroamazonas EP's operations in mature fields, are there any plans or strategies to advance production recovery?</h4><p>Most of the regions under Petroamazonas EP are mature fields, and some have been exploited for 70% of the estimated reserves. We are working on enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. Currently, it is an internal project for Petroamazonas EP, though we are now thinking of contract possibilities. We have also been working very hard to secure reserves for next year. Petroamazonas EP has pilot projects under development in Block 15, Block 12, and Block 7. We are also working with companies that have experience in EOR projects.</p><h4>During 2012 you are also preparing to merge with Petroproducción, a part of EP Petroecuador. In what phase of the process are you?</h4><p>The process is expected to be finalized in 2012. We are aiming to start 2013 with two companies, one upstream and the other one downstream. We are in an accelerated process. Petroamazonas EP already has people working in the exploration and production department of EP Petroecuador, and we are working directly within the company. The idea is to see the merger take no more than eight months. We have started certain control over operations and we are expecting to have total control by mid-2012. Certain aspects should be achieved in the next eight months in order to be in good shape for a final absorption. We will be absorbing only the upstream operations. At the moment, Petroamazonas EP is upstream and EP Petroecuador is upstream and downstream. The idea is to have one company for each sector of the industry.</p><h4>What will be the lasting impact of the merger?</h4><p>This is the third merger that we are doing. The first one was with Brenco, from France, which was operating Block 7 and 21; the second one was with Petrobras, which was operating Block 18, and now EP Petroecuador. There will be a lot more jobs available in 2012. Petroamazonas EP has demonstrated that it has a fine business model that can provide the skills required to manage the merger process successfully. The staff at EP Petroecuador will also have a lot more work due to the resulting additional activities. Everything has been planned to the finest detail.</p><h4>What will the main challenges and advantages be for the merger of these two companies?</h4><p>The advantages are that we will increase efficiency, share resources, and implement new technologies and modern procedures. Petroamazonas EP has demonstrated that it is a high-standard upstream oil company, not only in Ecuador but also in the region. We are very well known in the UK and other countries. The idea is to have a company that has all the skills and power to confront the new challenges of the future. We are also looking at the possibilities of going abroad with our operations, with Colombia and Peru representing two possible targets.</p><h4>How has the company developed in general?</h4><p>All the strengths that we had as a public company in the past have remained, and have even been reinforced. Working as a public company we have to deal with all the regulations, but this is normal and we are now a sturdy company that has grown and improved. We are very proud of how Petroamazonas EP has developed.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Repsol is the largest private oil company in the country. How significant is Ecuador for the company's overall global activities?<br></h4><p>Ecuador is very important; we are producing on average 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) as a consortium. The consortium owns 100% of the production, and Repsol has a participation of 55% in that. Thus, just over half of the volume of production is for Repsol. According to the contract signed by Repsol in 2010, the production belongs to the state and the state pays a fixed rate to the company. That's the reason why I say that if we look at the situation in relative terms, the production that belongs to us, as Repsol, is very small for our capacity and of what we are able to manage when compared to other countries like Argentina, Venezuela, and even Bolivia, especially given the increase in gas production that the latter country is experiencing.</p><h4>For what strategic reasons does the company maintain a strong presence in Ecuador?</h4><p>Logically, we have a historic relationship with Ecuador; a relationship that nowadays is limited to the exploitation of Block 16, but we expect that in the future new growth opportunities will become obvious. We would like to have the opportunity to develop in new regions. There are some new areas that will be bid on, and we have an interest in studying the possibility of participating, and that will come in handy with the growing investments we want to make. We also have some other areas that we wish to develop such as to the south of our block, which is a new area that we are studying in order to develop it. It's a small area, but it could prove interesting.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the oil and gas sector in Ecuador over 2012?</h4><p>Fortunately, with the investments we made in 2011 and the future investments we will make until 2018, we will try to make the current production decline as harmless as possible.</p><p>In 2011, we had a few wells that provided better results than were initially estimated, and that has helped us to improve initial production estimations. Exploration can be tricky, and you never know what you will find 3,000 meters underground. For that reason we hope to be lucky in 2012 and explore areas with more potential than originally estimated. We may be able to maintain or improve our current production levels.</p><h4>What is the value of the deals you have made with the government?</h4><p>The new contract of service provision signed with the government in 2010, valid until 2018, comprises a total amount of investment of $320 million. That is the amount of investment we have planned until 2018. Most of it will be used in the first three years of the project, which is when we stage the biggest drilling campaigns. We will also analyze new options. If the government opens up new areas and we are able to obtain them, then it could lead to $50 million or $60 million in additional investment.</p><h4>What challenges has Repsol faced in terms of remaining a leader in a sector crowded with foreign investors?</h4><p>As in any country, a company like ours, which is involved in the extraction of natural resources, has to make its decisions in partnership with the government. We do have a full disposition to work with the government by participating in any new event that may appear in the future, such as the new areas that may open up in the south of the country. We are studying them because they are also close to some areas in the north of Peru that we are working in. On the government side, there has to be trust in the companies that can achieve this kind of development, and it does exist. It is also present at the ministry level, where we work very closely. However, all of this depends on what conditions the government will tender these areas under. Such a close relationship with the government will allow us to continue working here successfully.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have allowed Ómnibus BB (OBB) to become the market leader in auto sales?<br></h4><p>The Ecuadorean automotive market is very competitive in every segment, and the world's major brands compete locally. Historically, a few points have set us apart from the competition. Our leadership is based on our experience; since OBB assembled its first bus in 1976—the “Blue Bird Botar"—it has revolutionized the industry. For more than 30 years, we have invested in strengthening our production capabilities for national assembly and in developing local spare parts suppliers. The last decade presented one of the most significant investments in our history with figures that approach the $100 million mark. In addition, I am really proud of the fact that Ecuador and Russia are GM's best complete knock down (CKD) plants in the world. This strategy has given us a competitive advantage in comparison with imported vehicles, as we are able to offer prime, quality products at affordable prices. The second key to our success is our commitment to customers. Every day we work to build long-term relationships based not only on words, but on actions—we promote a real service culture. For us, it is very important to be part of the vehicle's life cycle, offering the best after-sales services. In Ecuador, Chevrolet has the largest service network and our customers know that no matter where they buy or drive a Chevrolet, they will find support and service facilities. Finally, we are a corporation committed to talented human resources and the community. We believe that our responsible behavior is a business priority and, of course, a part of our company's DNA. We are a company that promotes corporate responsibility programs in house with our employees and also focuses on our dealer and supplier network. I am convinced every employee who works at our company believes in sustainability. Some of the most important programs we lead locally include the Designated Driver Program, which seeks to educate the population through the promotion of responsible driving in order to prevent traffic accidents caused by drunk drivers; MGC, a program through which we transfer good management practices to our parts supplier network; and “Gente Chevrolet" and “The Apprentice Program," which are after-sales education initiatives with our dealer network and employees, aiming to reward and motivate our employees. Finally, we run the “Chevrolet Siempre Conmigo" program, which includes several activities that reinforce our values and cultural priorities among our employees.</p><h4>Which GM models have historically been well received?</h4><p>A number of our models have become icons in the Ecuadorean market. In the 1980s, we introduced the Forsa, a very well-suited vehicle for middle-income families, and the Chevrolet LUV, which is still on the market and leads its segment. Other successful models include the Trooper and Rodeo SUVs, introduced in the 1990s, and the Corsa, in the passenger vehicle line. Over the last few years, the Aveo has also become a major trendsetter, and today, along with the LUV and Grand Vitara, they are part of the Ecuadorean car family.</p><h4>What has been the history and success of the Chevrolet Sail in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are proud to be the first CKD plant in the world to assemble the Chevrolet Sail platform. Today, it is the bestselling car in Ecuador, even though it has only been in the market for two months. We were planning to sell between 800 and 1,000 units per month; we have surpassed our sales expectations by 20%. We ran a successful launch campaign that started on November 23, 2011, and within 15 days we had sold 1,500 units. To date, we have waiting lists exceeding our current supply. The key behind Sail is the three years we spent developing a product adapted to local roads and habits, and a massive marketing campaign that went beyond offering product features and offered a lifestyle. The Sail launch demonstrates our ability to market iconic, leading products in every segment. We are present in every segment and niche—that is why our brand has achieved such success in Ecuador.</p><h4>How have Ómnibus BB's exports evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>Exports are very important for our business. Our main clients have historically been in the Andean region, Colombia, and Venezuela. In 2011 we exported approximately 10,000 units to the Colombian market, representing around $200 million. For 2012, we are planning to return to the Venezuelan market. One of our strategic objectives is to maintain a positive trade balance, so what we export to Colombia is higher than our import volume. That is the trend in which we believe.</p><h4>In which areas will the company invest its proposed $72 million budget?</h4><p>This very important investment demonstrates our commitment to Ecuador and its growth. We are convinced our investment contributions and technology will transfer value to the community. Most of the investments will be allocated to the development of new technology for our cutting-edge products. We finished the first part of the project, which involved improvements in the electrodeposition (ELPO) area, and in 2012 we will finish the construction of a new paint shop for plastic parts and a new base and clear-coat paint shop for vehicles. We are also investing in tools and equipment, new product lines, and logistical improvements. For the Chevrolet Sail alone, we have allocated $10 million for equipment.</p><h4>What is Ómnibus BB planning to launch in 2012?</h4><p>No matter the segment, company, or country, it is almost impossible to talk about the next launch. However, I can tell you that we have been investing heavily, building a very strong team, and working to develop new products. We are committed to producing innovative vehicles that will be made in Ecuador.</p><h4>Are you planning to introduce more ecological cars, such as electric cars or hybrids?</h4><p>The government has been aiming to promote ecological awareness with its regulations on hybrid cars. However, electric cars will play an important role in the future, as will the Chevrolet Volt. There are many technical requirements to put electric cars on the road, such as the appropriate infrastructure, maintenance availability, recycling programs, and the proper fuels. Today, our focus is to raise the awareness in the community and contribute our knowledge. In February, we presented Future Path 2012, which is an education program led by the Chevrolet Volt, which won numerous prizes in 2011. Although it would not be productive to introduce the Chevrolet Volt to the Ecuadorean market now, we want to highlight its features and showcase the technology, aiming to educate the population. Future Path is not a commercial initiative; it is geared toward universities, public technical centers, and academies. Our schedule of Volt exhibitions began in 2012 and will last a year. We will use the electric cars for learning purposes so that students can dissemble, examine, and study the technology of the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Executive Vice-Chairman of what is now one of the largest airport retailers in the world, what can you say about the development of the duty-free industry?<br></h4><p>The duty-free industry was born in Shannon in 1947, because that was the first refueling stop for flights crossing the Atlantic and going on to Europe. In the first year the industry brought in something like $20,000, and today the industry is worth $40 billion. Half of that money comes from airport operations, the other half comes from border shops, cruise liners, and the like. The governments in Dubai and Ireland entered into a six-month contract in 1983, and a team of people was sent here to set up Dubai Duty Free. I was part of that 10-man team. The plan was to write a procedural manual, set up the operation, and then leave. During that time, myself and a couple of other people were asked if we would stay on, and we agreed to stay for two years; we're still here 28 years later. We started with 100 staff, and we still have 52 of those 100 staff working for us. In total now we have 4,000 employees. In the first full year of business in 1984, we had sales of $20 million. In 2011 we had sales of $1.46 billion, and we are the single biggest airport retailer. That has been helped along the way by the fact we have been growing, our penetration has increased, and of course the traffic through the airport has been increasing. We currently serve 51 million people through here yearly, and the projections for 2020 are for this to hit 95 million.</p><h4>The majority of airports lease retailing space. What was your motivation in taking a different approach when establishing Dubai Duty Free?</h4><p>In Dubai we operate all the retail activities at the airport and we have 18,000 sqm of space. We think our model suited Dubai better than the concessionaire approach because 28 years ago Dubai was very small. It needed marketing, it needed promotion, and also it needed input into the community. Dubai Duty Free was one of the first companies in Dubai to take on that marketing role and position Dubai as a growing and important stop-over and destination for international travellers. Our famous advertising strapline of “Fly Buy Dubai" and our tentative steps into sports marketing way back in the 1980s helped raise the profile of Dubai, the airport, and, of course, the duty free operations. Our model has also worked extremely well for the development of the airport, and we work closely with Dubai Airports and other stakeholders on rolling out development plans. Concessionaires would not have the same overall objectives that we have, such as the long-term promotion of Dubai or the setting up of a charity foundation that we established in 2004. We think that our model has been successful and it has worked out better than the alternative would have done. Around 75% of everything we sell we buy from local suppliers and distributors, many of whom were the original shop owners at the airport. So from the point of view of the Dubai economy, our contribution is significant. Although we buy everything locally and can get speedy deliveries, we still need to have a logistics and distribution center here which covers 27,000 sqm. The handling of our stock is 70% automated, otherwise we couldn't cope with the quantity of stock that we deal with. We sold 17 million pieces of merchandise in 2011. In November we registered 62,000 transactions every day at our points of sale. That's fairly average for us. We deliver between 500 and 1,000 pallets to the duty free area every day from here, all of which are shrink-wrapped, x-rayed, secured, put into sealed trucks, and delivered.</p><h4>Dubai Duty Free invests a huge amount in developing infrastructure. What challenges does the business face in this respect and what further developments are underway?</h4><p>We invest a lot in Dubai. We built a head office, where we have 6,000 sqm of space. In addition to this, we have a 27,000-sqm distribution center. We are in the process of finalizing a five-star hotel here in Dubai that will be managed by Jumeirah Hotels. We're owned by the government, but we are given a great deal of freedom to make our own commercial decisions. I am very privileged to report directly to HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who is the President of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and Chairman of Dubai Duty Free. His Highness is also the head of Emirates Group, and heads up several important entities here. He is a fantastic boss to have and has always been incredibly supportive of our operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Canon Middle East sit within the global Canon network, and how important is Dubai strategically in terms of your regional operations?<br></h4><p>Canon Middle East contributes close to one-third of Canon Europe's emerging markets' business volume and manages sales, marketing, and technical support activities across 45 countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the UAE, as well as East and North Africa. Canon has been doing business in the Middle East for more than 40 years, enabling us to establish a very powerful brand with strong local roots. Within the context of our regional operations, Dubai serves a very important role. We set up a representative office in Dubai in 1998 to help channel partners with additional on-the-ground support and from there Canon went on to establish a full subsidiary with extensive logistics facilities in 2001. Subsequently, we chose Dubai as our Middle Eastern headquarters as it enjoys close proximity to the regional markets we operate in. Additionally, Canon Emirates was also established in 2007 to consolidate and reinforce Canon's position in the region through an integrated structure. The company is responsible for Canon Business Solutions in the UAE and all related activities, including direct sales, marketing, and services, which will bring Canon's global strength to the UAE. Canon Emirates' presence is an important step towards the realization of Canon's potential in the UAE.</p><h4>Why did you choose Dubai Internet City as a base for your operations and what are the main benefits of operating within this location?</h4><p>Canon Middle East moved into its head office at Dubai Internet City (DIC) in 2002. As the region's largest dedicated ICT cluster in the MENA region, DIC was a natural fit for us. DIC has big ICT and multinational companies that provide state-of-the-art technology and solutions and it was fitting for us to join like-minded companies. The move allowed us to consolidate our market stronghold and bolster our reputation further. Over the years, we have developed a great relationship with the DIC team, and share with them our vision for innovation and sustainable growth. Canon has partnered with DIC on several environmental projects, including our combined celebrations for Earth Day.</p><h4>What indicators are you watching to observe how the global economy will develop?</h4><p>There is a wide spectrum of generic macro-economic indicators that we constantly monitor to analyze the economic environment where we operate. This includes gross domestic product (GDP), growth of GDP, rate of inflation, and per capita income. Broadly speaking, the outlook for demand across our different business segments is positive. If we were to look at the print industry as one example, globally the print industry is estimated to be worth $640 billion and drives $3.8 trillion in related services. Here, in the Middle East, the region's printing industry is expected to grow 5% just in 2012, according to the Printing and Publishing Group (PPG). This is on the back of technological advancements and the high contribution of over $2.3 billion by the UAE print industry alone. In addition, according to Canon's fourth Insight Report: The Bigger Picture 2012, 70% of buyers view print to be as effective as or more effective than any other media in the communications mix. To take another example, the global digital cameras market is expected to reach 155 million units by 2017, according to a report by Global Industry Analysts. Some of this growth will be driven by the MENA markets. Another trend that we observe is a demand for increasing convergence of technologies. For instance, we used to have separate machines for faxing and calling, and now there's the tele-fax. Just a few decades ago, a photocopier was just meant to photocopy. Today's photocopiers are multifunctional workhorses that can copy, print, and scan. There is rarely a medium- to large-sized enterprise that does not have a multifunction device (MFD), reflecting the competitiveness and flexibility within modern business environments. Moreover, consumers and corporates are demanding more added value such as document security and internet connectivity that are driving a new breed of all-purpose office equipment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai Industrial City has more than 150 companies operating in the zone, including some of the biggest names in industry. What strategies have you initiated to attract such large players?<br></h4><p>Dubai Industrial City ranks very high when it comes to responding to the supply-chain needs of our business partners. Within its 55 square kilometer precincts, the city has leading industrial names such as BASF, IKEA, and Al Marai, which is a regional dairy manufacturer from Saudi Arabia. We are the second largest non-real estate project in Dubai, which consists of six zones dedicated to key industries: food and beverage (F&amp;B), heavy machinery, mineral products, chemicals, and base metals. Organizing industries into their own zones brings obvious, inherent benefits of symmetry, specialization, and safety. There is strong synergy between the chemicals and minerals industries, since companies working in the mineral sector and producing building material such as cement rely on chemical-based products. Some other factories recycle water and the excess is passed to construction firms. These zones are further complemented by other services such as 10 million square feet of state-of-the-art warehouses, labor accommodation, dedicated power substations, modern office buildings, and viable commercial area, in addition to a number of municipal amenities. To date, Dubai Industrial City has invested more than $1 billion to create this infrastructure. Dubai Industrial City is adjacent to the Al Maktoum International Airport and within a short drive from the Jebel Ali Sea Port. Both factors have been pivotal to the growing popularity that the zone enjoys, among companies that are looking to expand their industrial operations out of Dubai.</p><h4>In which sectors are you seeing increased interest and growth?</h4><p>We are experiencing good growth across all six industrial zones, but I would particularly mention that our F&amp;B, base metals, heavy machinery, and chemical zones are receiving considerable attention. The F&amp;B zone lends itself very well to the unique set of infrastructure and logistic requirements that go into the manufacturing, packaging, and movement of food products across the region. Our business partners in the other zones support activities in the construction sector, including the mechanical, electrical, plumbing and air conditioning industries. Our warehouses are also registering significant interest. In January 2012, we launched our second phase of state-of-the-art warehouses across 3.5 million square feet of land. These include facilities for cold storage, which are especially suited for F&amp;B and the pharmaceutical industry. We also have warehouses for general use, others for light industrial activity, and retail showrooms equipped with back storage. Already, 30% of the new phase of warehouses is booked.</p><h4>What makes Dubai such an attractive logistic hub, and what is the growth potential for the re-export sector here?</h4><p>Historically, Dubai has enjoyed prominence as a harbor for international trade between East and West. The pivotal part played by Dubai Creek is also of special interest: this natural waterway is where Dubai began trading with the world—and the world with Dubai—more than a century ago. Personally, I find it fascinating that even with the appearance of mega ports like Jebel Ali, the Creek has retained its commercial appeal, in particular with regional traders. Besides the ports, the government of the UAE has put priority on the development of world-class urban infrastructure, streamlining various procedures that make the UAE the top country in the Middle East in terms of ease of doing business. Additionally, the government has made sizeable infrastructure developments; the Emirate is located within few flight hours from the large markets in South and East Asia and the modern European markets. Dubai also enjoys excellent sea and port facilities, as well as a modern road network that facilitate the land transport of goods across the GCC.</p><h4>Would you say there is any need for further regulatory change in the industrial sector to help the market open up further?</h4><p>Generally speaking, industrial projects are by nature very capital intensive. The government of the UAE has taken stringent steps to boost the nation's industrial sector. The industrial sector grew to 16% of national GDP in 2011, becoming the second most valuable sector in the UAE after the hydrocarbon industry, and there are plans to further increase the contribution of this sector to reach 25% in the future. The creation of Emirates Development in 2011, with its mandate of supporting short- and long-term development requirements, is an excellent step forward as it will help fuel the local industry further. Commercial banks are also realizing that industry offers significant long-term returns and are now more willing than before to support worthy industrial  projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key elements that have led consistent profit year after year?</h4><p>The 2011-2012 financial year was a challenging one for Emirates. To have achieved a profit in spite of record fuel prices and unprecedented economic pressure is testament to our tenacity. Our success is governed by our long-term strategy of reinvesting our profits directly into our product. In the last financial year alone we invested heavily in new products that will help us maintain our position as one of the world's fastest growing and most innovative airlines. In addition to new on-board and on-the-ground innovations, Emirates received 22 state-of-the-art aircraft last financial year; a wide-bodied mix of A380s and Boeing 777s. Each of these new aircraft is already playing a key role in our future growth and expansion plans.</p><h4>How interconnected is the Emirates success story with Dubai's own as an aviation hub?</h4><p>The incredible success of Emirates and Dubai are intricately linked. Dubai is a dynamic and vibrant city, and it has played a key role in shaping Emirates into the carrier that it is today. In the last 27 years, Emirates and Dubai have grown alongside each other. With its vast network of global destinations, all connected via its Dubai hub, Emirates has helped to showcase the unique vitality of the city. Dubai is centrally located between East and West, with access to two-thirds of the world's population via a maximum eight-hour flight. This geographical positioning has served to provide us with a unique advantage and one that we have certainly capitalized on.</p><h4>The ever-increasing development of local airlines, as well as global giants, has created a highly competitive environment, and Emirates attracts its fair share of envious glances. How has the company's strategy adjusted to deal with the increased competition?</h4><p>At Emirates we believe that competition is good for the industry, and importantly, it is even better for the customer. Competition between airlines serves to stimulate demand. It keeps airlines on their toes and ensures that they work harder to win a customer's patronage. Emirates operates from Dubai International Airport, which operates under an unconditional open-skies policy. This policy has ensured that we remain competitive. Emirates does not benefit from any form of government subsidy, and this has proved to be a key measure of our success. Standing on our own we continue to thrive, remaining profitable through challenging times and remaining the carrier of choice for the 34 million passengers that travelled with us in the 2011-12 financial year. Our strategy for success remains the same, no matter how many competitors there are. We continue to stay true to our proven business model, growing organically with new, modern aircraft and carefully selected destinations that we know will provide a strong return.</p><h4>Rising fuel prices, regional political unrest, and global economic woes are creating challenging times for the airline industry. In what ways are these factors impacting the airline?</h4><p>Business conditions this last year have been challenging for the entire aviation industry. Emirates is fortunate enough to possess an excellent product line that has helped shield it from the brunt of last year's difficult operating climate. Our young fleet of aircraft, growing network, world-class service, and competitive prices have helped to ensure that we continue to attract new customers as well as retain those who already fly with us.</p><h4>Emirates lifted the fuel surcharge from the price of tickets last year. What was the driver behind this, and how long do you see it remaining in place?</h4><p>Unfortunately, like all airlines, we are reliant on fuel to operate our business. With no sign of oil prices decreasing, a fuel surcharge was implemented on tickets in February 2012 to help mitigate these increased costs.</p><h4>The first flight landed into Al Maktoum International Airport in 2010. How will the development of the second Dubai airport change the dynamics of the city?</h4><p>Dubai World Central—Al Maktoum International Airport—is being developed in Jebel Ali to cater to the future aviation and logistics needs of Dubai. There is no doubt that the new airport will play an increasingly important role in the Emirate's long-term aviation goals. Emirates aims to move to the new Dubai World Central airport between 2022 and 2030, and with plans to add hundreds of aircraft and destinations over the coming decades, we are the main driver behind its construction and will be the principal customer.</p><h4>You are currently establishing the world's biggest fleet of A380s. How large will the fleet be, and what is the plan for its deployment?</h4><p>Emirates is currently the world's largest operator of the A380. We have 21 in our fleet today and a further 69 on order, more than any other carrier. The A380 is an excellent aircraft, and feedback from our customers continues to be incredibly positive. Premium and overall seat factor for our A380 aircraft sat even higher than the rest of our fleet in the 2011-12 financial year, highlighting a continued demand in the product from passengers. Every single one of the A380s we have ordered is carefully planned for Emirates' present and future requirements. Our A380s are specifically deployed on high-density routes where extra capacity is needed. The A380 can carry more passengers further, thus maximizing the use of slot-constrained infrastructure and reducing the number of required take offs and landings. In the coming months we have several new A380 destinations that will be launched, including Tokyo, Amsterdam, and Melbourne. In total we now fly to 17 A380 destinations across our network. The A380 sets a new standard for aviation and the environment and it plays a key role in our mission to operate an internationally renowned airline while maintaining a high degree of social responsibility. Based on fuel and emission efficiency, Emirates' A380s are some of the most environmentally advanced aircraft in the sky. The A380 is quieter than any other aircraft, both inside and outside the cabin.</p><h4>What is the airline's ongoing strategy in the quest to establish a robust global presence?</h4><p>Our passengers' expectations only continue to get higher, and it is imperative that we continue to move forward with them. Growth is an important part of any company's survival, and for Emirates our growth is directly attributable to the number of passengers that choose to travel with us. It is for this reason that we invest billions of dollars each year in expanding our service offering by way of new destinations, new aircraft, and innovative, customer-focused products. In the last five years Emirates' route network has grown by nearly 40%, and in the 2012-13 financial year we have already announced new services to four destinations, including Ho Chi Minh City, Lisbon, Barcelona, and Washington, DC.</p><h4>What were the main lessons learned during the global liquidity crisis, and to what extent would you say the economy is recovering?</h4><p>There has been a marked shift in business travel movements from East to West. We have witnessed incredible growth throughout Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent and we continue to capitalize on this with new links, additional frequencies, and upgraded capacity. The global economic situation has improved, but it is not uniform across all markets and is again showing volatility in the eurozone. Our development plans for all areas of our business remain on track and we are confident that our robust business model will continue to reap rewards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) been developing its strategy in recent years?<br></h4><p>The strategy we prepared will allow us to separate service providers from the regulator. After having several meetings with all stakeholders, this strategy was prepared and approved by the Executive Office. We are planning to go through with this policy, which defines the expansion of facilities and infrastructure to meet the projected growth in the Emirate of Dubai. It has been designed to ensure the hub status of Dubai and to make it the aviation capital of the world. Emirates Airlines is purchasing a larger number of “superjumbo" A380s, and we are building Concourse 3 and 4 to accommodate these aircraft. Dubai Airport will reach a capacity of 90 million by 2018. Al Maktoum Airport, with five runways, is being built to accommodate us to operate from both airports giving us a capacity of 160 million passengers an year.</p><h4>What factors have led to the successful rapid evolution of Dubai as an international transit and travel hub?</h4><p>Since the beginning, Dubai Airport has applied an open-skies policy. The main obstacle was in persuading other states to adopt it. Many airports in the Gulf are now applying this policy, and we have agreements with almost all of Europe. We have something even more with the US; the “seventh freedom" has allowed cargo carriers to fly without returning to their point of origin. This means companies can do business and travel on. This is very good for cargo carriers like FedEx and DHL. They are both coming to Dubai without going back to the US. National carriers can do the same when flying to the US. We have an open-skies policy with almost all of the Pacific and Asian civil aviation groups and agreements with nearly two-thirds of the countries in Africa. Every country is working to implement policies such as ours. In order to build businesses, an open-skies system should be embraced. By the year 2018 we aim to handle 90 million passengers. That is when we will have to move to Al Maktoum Airport. Currently, we handle over 50 million passengers per year, and by the end of 2012 we expect 56 million people to pass through our airport. Looking at the statistics, we are fourth in the world in terms of carrying international passengers. Some of the largest airports are very heavy in handling international passengers; we, on the other hand, handle international passengers exclusively. Our contribution to Dubai's GDP is 28%, creating 250,000 jobs. By the year 2020, the aviation sector is expected to create 375,000 jobs directly and indirectly, contributing 32% of GDP.</p><h4>What is the next step in terms of expanding the Emirate's reach to different destinations?</h4><p>We already have connections from East to West and North to South and currently our reach extends to over 200 destinations with almost 160 aircraft, growing by two planes per month. The major players are Emirates and flydubai, and through them we have connections to and from almost every city and country in the world. We offer 18 flights per day to the UK, excluding services provided by British Airways. We also have 85 flights per week to Australia. Every two or three months we open up two new destinations in response to growing demand. Emirates Airlines has been expanding very rapidly, and the team operating the company is very dynamic. In Dubai, it is your responsibility to succeed. The leaders here are very flexible, and they always give people a chance; anyone who fails has only himself to blame.</p><h4>Why was the role of the DCAA realigned to remove responsibility for managing the airport?</h4><p>As a government establishment, we had no limited liability. The DCAA was obliged to handle and deal with these issues. We felt there should be an agreement with a different party to secure a limited liability, “just in case." We are part of the government, and the system was presenting a conflict of interest between being a service provider and a regulator. Moreover, European and US airlines did not appreciate that system. Previously, I felt I was wearing two hats; one was running the airport, and the other was monitoring the regulatory side. Now I am not involved in the operations side or service providers' work. Instead, we are now a regulatory authority making sure everything is operating in compliance with international standards, which is working smoothly.</p><p>We have also been entrusted with the task of formulating a strategy, which was drafted in collaboration with other companies and organizations such as flydubai, Emirates, duty-free zones, customs, immigration, Dubai Airports, and the police. Everyone is a partner and a stakeholder and the strategy has now been approved. We hope that by 2020 Dubai will be the number one aviation capital of the world—second place is not acceptable.</p><h4>What are the main challenges you face for the further development of the industry?</h4><p>The challenge that lies in front of us is in air space design, where we face many internal and external obstacles. Congestion in airspace is the biggest threat to our growth. The DCAA is working to overcome these challenges through discussions with the other emirates. The internal problems are simply technical issues that need to be addressed. The DCAA has a committee in place to look into this. We also maintain very good relations with the other emirates. The external issues may take a little more time as it they need to be resolved at the federal UAE level. However, working together is the only way forward to solve this issue. We are optimistic that we can attain a European-style control that will function in the Gulf and Middle East. We hope that in the near future we will be able to unify our air space, which is very important as we seek to evolve.</p><h4>How have you continued to attract airlines to Dubai?</h4><p>We may be the first airport in the world that responds to a request for landing and operations within half an hour, while other airports take a month or two. According to bilateral agreements, we are required to reply within 60 days. However, we need only 30 minutes to scrutinize the required aircraft documents and to approve a request. We work 24 hours a day to serve our customers. This is very helpful, and airlines have no excuse not to come to Dubai. This has been a standard operation since I joined in 1966.</p><h4>How is the shifting political landscape in the Middle East impacting the local aviation industry?</h4><p>The political circumstances in the region have affected our industry for the better. There were only a few governments that had accepted an open-skies policy, but we always promoted the concept to Middle Eastern politicians when they discussed unity and nationality. These leaders talk about unifying and becoming brothers, and I largely agree with these ideals. However, if am not allowed to enter their country, why should I join any unions or region-wide organizations? In the wake of the Arab Spring, I believe that this mentality is changing.</p><p>There are many advantages and opportunities waiting in the wings. Many governments are protecting their own airlines, but we recently engaged in negotiations with Egypt and saw encouraging progress. We came to an agreement faster than ever, and I am sure that once the dust settles we will see more and more open skies in the Gulf. I believe that this is a very positive thing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led to the successful creation of this international hub in just a few decades?<br></h4><p>Maritime trade has been at the heart of Dubai for generations upon generations, and it was only natural that the Emirate focus its energies on this core strength, fueled by the trust, support, and encouragement provided by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Both he and his father realized very early that Dubai could succeed by leveraging its geographical location at the crossroads of East-West trade and offering outstanding supply chain services that would ensure it became a hub. Focusing on customers and investing to ensure that their growing needs are met has driven our international expansion. To date, we are operating more than 60 marine terminals around the world with a global team of 30,000 personnel.</p><h4>What is the focus of DP World's 11 new projects, and what do they represent for the future of the company?</h4><p>We invest in markets where we see the potential to contribute to economic growth. With an average concession of around 40 years, we invest for the long term. Around 75% of our business comes from emerging markets, which have proven resilient during the global recession. Currently, three-quarters of the cargo we handle originates from or is destined for the markets in which we operate, known as origin and destination (O&amp;D) cargo. We will continue to focus on these two areas in the future, investing in direct response to our customers' needs. In 2011, we saw volumes in the UAE region rise to 13 million TEUs. This means that utilization is extremely high at our flagship Jebel Ali Port, which has continued to deliver strong volume growth and handled 3.2 million TEUs in the first three months of 2012, 8.5% ahead of the same period last year. It was clear from listening to our customers that growth in demand would mean Jebel Ali would soon be under considerable capacity. It was this that led us to announce plans last year to add 1 million TEUs to Terminal 2 to take its capacity to 6 million TEUs, and to develop a new terminal, Terminal 3, at an investment of $850 million, with the capacity for 4 million TEUs. Together they will take Jebel Ali's total capacity to 19 million TEUs by 2014. The new Terminal 3 will be capable of receiving the next generation of mega container ships that can carry as many as 18,000 TEUs, support the continued growth of Dubai and the UAE, and enhance the country's status as the trading center of the Middle East. Al Maktoum International Airport is just 20 minutes away from Jebel Ali Port, providing the supply chain sector with one of the most efficient multimodal platforms anywhere. While we are adding significant capacity to Jebel Ali over the coming two years, building a new terminal in Brazil and expanding our capacity in China, we are also pushing ahead with London Gateway and the new Maaslvakte 2 terminal in the Netherlands.</p><h4>How is the development of the London Gateway port project progressing? What makes this market attractive for DP World?</h4><p>London Gateway is progressing extremely well and will be open for business by 4Q2013, with an initial capacity of 1.6 million TEUs. Like all of our projects, we are investing for the long term. London Gateway is set to become Europe's largest logistics park, situated on London's doorstep and located at the heart of Europe's largest economic zone. It will benefit businesses in the UK immensely by allowing both importers and exporters to take advantage of a more cost effective and greener way to transport the nation's goods as well as saving hundreds of millions of pounds a year.</p><h4>How key are strong security measures in DP World's daily operations?</h4><p>We regard security as a baseline service for our customers. The nature of our operations exposes us to various operational, health, safety, and security risks that can impact our people, our customers, and our business operations. To mitigate such risks, we have implemented stringent security, safety, and health measures, including rolling out the independently audited ISO 28000 security management standards throughout our network. Currently, 38 of our facilities are certified. We are the only global marine terminal operator to be invited to become a member of the US Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), and we have 15 terminals participating in the US Customs Container Security Initiative—the largest number among the other operators. We are also a Principal Partner in the US Integrated container-scanning pilot projects. Furthermore, we adhere to European security measures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai International is the fourth largest airport in the world. What have been the key factors that have let to Dubai's tremendous success and growth as an aviation hub?<br></h4><p>Dubai's geo-centric location, high-caliber infrastructure, quality home airlines, and an aviation model that features a liberal regulatory system, a tax-free business environment, and close coordination and collaboration within the sector are the key factors in our growth story. Thanks to Dubai's open-skies policy, the airport is connected to more than 220 destinations across six continents through 150 airlines, and continues to attract more airlines. It is a model that is paying big dividends. According to Oxford Economics, direct and indirect aviation, in total, supports over 250,000 jobs and contributes over $22 billion to the economy, which represents around 19% of total employment in Dubai, and 28% of Dubai's $80 billion. On the basis of these strengths and the forecasts for passenger growth from Boeing and Airbus, Oxford Economics expects the economic contribution of Dubai's aviation sector to rise to 32% of Dubai's GDP and about 22% of its employment by 2020.</p><h4>The aviation industry as a whole has been through some tough years. In what ways do you believe airports and airlines should be pulling together to support greater commercial growth in the industry?</h4><p>Greater collaboration is needed across the entire aviation value chain. Although there have been some improvements over the years, globally there remains fundamental mistrust between the various members of the sector, namely airlines, airports, control authorities, and retailers. Each closely guards customer data. And each creates processes and applies technology without considering the entire travel experience for our mutual customers. All these activities take place in separate, vertical silos, while our mutual customers bump roughly across the joins between them. And those links involve something we all hate: queues. The time wasted not only frustrates our passengers, it drives up costs, reduces dwell time, and limits revenue generated in airport shops and food and beverage outlets. And let's not forget the role of government. Policy makers in most of the mature aviation markets worldwide fail to recognize the vital economic role and contributions of aviation and logistics, especially in the face of worldwide financial turmoil. A healthy aviation sector facilitates trade, commerce, and tourism. Governments need to wake up to the fact that unnecessary taxation regimes and protectionist policies place a drag on growth and in turn stifle economic expansion. Dubai's aviation model is a shining example of the success of an approach that flies in the face of this legacy, thinking both in terms of aviation policy and collaboration across the value chain.</p><h4>How are the plans for Dubai World Central (DWC) progressing, and how will operations there change the market in Dubai as a whole?</h4><p>We opened our second airport, DWC, in June 2010 for cargo operations followed by general aviation in 2011. Since its opening the number of cargo airlines has grown to 36. Cargo volumes during the first calendar year of operations totaled 90,000 tons, and monthly traffic continues to grow at a rapid pace. The first phase of the project also includes a passenger terminal that will be undergoing operational readiness testing in the coming months. Passenger operations are not yet planned and will depend entirely on the commercial needs of our client airlines. Providing capacity where it is needed is our immediate priority, and that happens to be at Dubai International. Over the next 10 years we will be investing $7.8 billion in the expansion of Dubai International to boost capacity from the current 60 million passengers per year to 90 million to accommodate anticipated traffic growth. The additional aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue generated by this increased traffic will fuel the funding of the next phases of DWC, which will ultimately become the world's largest airport with an annual capacity of 160 million passengers and 12 million tons of cargo. In the interim, DWC will play an important role in accommodating cargo, general aviation, and passenger airlines that will find the airport an increasingly attractive option due to emerging slot constraints at Dubai International. DWC is a long-term project and work on it will continue through this decade.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of this market in terms of the company's global operations?<br></h4><p>The Middle East has in many ways become a leader in global aviation and has always shown a strong desire to grow its aviation footprint, not just regionally, but globally as well. At Airbus, we strongly believe in the region's strengths, which is why we established a fully fledged subsidiary here—Airbus Middle East—in 2006, and our global market forecast predicts that the Middle East will take 7% of the world's aircraft deliveries between 2011 and 2030.</p><h4>Dubai has become a hub for the entire aviation industry, and the company's regional headquarters is located in the Dubai Airport Freezone (DAFZ). What are the main strengths of the Emirate?</h4><p>Dubai's main strengths are in its perfect geographical location between East and West, which enables it to act as a vital passenger and cargo hub between Asia and Europe, and its rich aviation history—everything from the original airport in 1959, to the opening of the Middle East's largest airport—at the time—in 1971, and the founding of Emirates Airlines, now one of the largest airlines in the world. Dubai also has some of the best transport logistics systems in the region, making it a natural place for Airbus to maintain both a commercial office, as well as a material and logistics center, and training team.</p><h4>A high demand for Airbus's lower-cost, single-aisle aircraft were to thank for such sales figures at the airshow. Will you be ramping up the production of wide-bodied aircraft?</h4><p>Each Airbus aircraft has its unique place in the market, and with the recent expansion of many short-to mid-range carriers, we've seen excellent sales of the A320neo, which offers more than 15% fuel savings with its new generation engines and large wingtip devices called “sharklets." However, mid-to long-range flights are also growing in number, which is why the A380 has remained so popular with larger carriers, and why the new A350 XWB program, which will offer 25% fuel savings compared to the competition, is a success, with over 550 of the aircraft ordered to date. The A350 XWB entry into service will be in the first half of 2014, with Qatar Airways as the launch customer.</p><h4>What impact do Boeing's development plans for the next decade have on Airbus' strategy?</h4><p>When developing a new aircraft, we must think years ahead to what technology might be available not only at the new aircraft's entry-into-service (EIS) time, but also within its 40-year lifetime. Predictions are not always easy. We have to carefully evaluate when exactly is the right time for a game-changing aircraft. We currently foresee a game-changing aircraft of this type with an EIS between 2030 and 2035. This timing is largely dependent on an engine breakthrough with a 20%-25% reduction in fuel burn, which, at this point, would probably be an inducted fan type being developed by NASA. Current technologies simply cannot provide significant improvements over what is already available today, beyond what we're doing with the A320neo and A350 XWB. In terms of competition from countries like China and Brazil, which are currently showing a great maturation in their industrial capacities, including aircraft production, our current global market forecast predicts that the world will require almost 27,000 more commercial aircraft by 2030. Given this, we feel there's lots of capacity within the market for Airbus to retain its lead across all sectors regardless of any new competition.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Airbus, and the industry as a whole for 2012?</h4><p>Things are looking good for 2012. While we don't anticipate another record-breaking year like we had in 2011, we still predict strong sales in the 600-650 order range for commercial aircraft, and around 570 commercial deliveries, and we will be spending the year continuing to work hard in both our A380 and A350 XWB production programs, with the Final Assembly Line start for the A350 program imminent, the certification of the sharklets for the A320 by year-end, and the recruitment of at least 4,000 more employees during the year as some of our key targets for 2012.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Dubai Health Authority was established in 2007. What was the vision behind the establishment of the authority at that stage?<br></h4><p>In 2007, the Ruler of Dubai decided to create the Dubai Health Authority (DHA). His vision was that the healthcare sector was growing, and that there was a need for a regulatory body to lay down a strategy for the whole of Dubai, not only for public hospitals. We had to establish the Dubai strategic healthcare plan, and we had to establish a partnership with the private sector through our regulatory arm. We also had to prepare a funding model that would be suitable for Dubai. The Emirate needed a plan regarding regulation, funding, strategy, service provisioning, expanding services, and partnerships, and we needed to focus on educating the new generation. Prior to this, the Department of Health and Medical Services (DOHMS), which was created in 1973, was the functioning authority that almost exclusively focused on health service delivery. Therefore, the DHA was created, in June 2007, by Law 13, with an expanded vision to include strategic oversight for the complete health sector in Dubai and enhance private sector engagement.</p><h4>How would you say the healthcare market has evolved in Dubai over the past few years?</h4><p>The UAE, and Dubai especially, is striving to reach higher standards in security, health, education, and business. The expectations of people moving here to live, work, or just visit are high, and we have to make sure that our health services meet those expectations. In 2007 we began a lot of projects, and we are still planning many more. We have realized that we need public-private partnerships. It is not only with money that you can develop hospitals; you also need knowledge and experience. We are expecting two new hospitals to open in Dubai in 2012. In the beginning of 2001 there were less than seven private hospitals, and today we are talking about a total of 20 new hospitals. Clinic numbers are rising, and professionals are moving to Dubai. We have an excellent talent pool of healthcare professionals in Dubai. The people of Dubai deserve the best quality, and this is an aim we are realizing through our regulatory arm to make sure the industry is regulated to benefit the people. We have very good communication with the private sector and consult with it directly regarding new regulations. We need to give the people of Dubai the ability to choose and compare services. We also want to create a new market for insurance companies. Health care is a huge business when it comes to insurance. I believe that health care has tremendously evolved over the years, and given all the existing parameters and our future plans, I see more progress in the years to come.</p><h4>What projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>One major project involves electronic medical records (EMR). This project will digitize all medical records, and any doctor will be able to see a patient's medical history via computer. We will be able to control our medical stocks, facilitate a paperless environment, and provide patients and healthcare practitioners with complete online access to medical records. You will be able to walk into a clinic, input your information into the system, and your complete medical history will be displayed—this will be applicable even when you travel abroad. In terms of other projects, we are very happy with the progress on the Al Jalila Children's Specialty Hospital, which is the first specialized pediatric hospital in the country. It is a fully dedicated, unique facility for children below the age of 16. In addition to focusing on such specialized projects, we will continue to pay attention to primary health care. We believe that primary health care is our frontline. We have an annual plan to add one health center each year to our existing network of 14 primary health centers spread across the various geographical areas of the Emirate. These are just a number of the things we have in the pipeline.</p><h4>What are the key investment opportunities for partners looking to come to Dubai?</h4><p>There are a lot of opportunities in Dubai in healthcare investment. The challenges that investors sometimes face with regards to ownership or regulation have been resolved here. The DHA works closely with Dubai Healthcare City to assist investors. We are also working with DuBiotech, which is a lucrative project regarding pharmaceutical company research. The pharmaceutical industry is very promising, and it is a big business. With the infrastructure and services that Dubai has in hand, we need to work with it to see what challenges need to be faced, because we believe that Dubai is the best place to be a hub for the distribution of medicine in the region. To achieve this we have to work very hard to make sure that we are enacting the right regulations for the registration of drugs and other similar issues. When it comes to clinics we are very happy that we have among us top professionals from Europe, the US, and the region. They are happy with the environment here both professionally and personally. Access to Dubai allows people to fly in on a daily basis to do business and then fly back. For a lot of people in the region, the best point for them to meet is Dubai.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the healthcare industry in 2012?</h4><p>In 2012 our focus will be on primary health care. The plan is to make sure that we improve the quality and support our people and family physicians in the primary healthcare sector. If we can reach people in the early stages and take care of them, then that is the best thing to do. We have to go and reach people before the problems start. We have to look at our young children and make sure that they are protected, not waiting until they get sick. We are going to help them focus on their lifestyle, and we are going to be lobbying for new regulations to protect students, especially the youth, from unhealthy food habits. We are working with the Dubai Municipality, which is doing a great job to make a healthy lifestyle more accessible. This is very important. Our focus is on the frontline, on primary health care. In addition to primary healthcare, in 2012, we are also going to focus more on outpatient services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you decide to establish a free zone dedicated to health care, and how has Dubai Healthcare City Cluster developed since it first opened in 2005?<br></h4><p>Dubai Healthcare City Cluster (DHCC) falls into Dubai's overall plan. It's very much a part of the strategic plan of making Dubai an international city, and the key to that is education and health care. DHCC was the brainchild of HH Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and DHCC was launched in 2002. We spent a few years building the infrastructure, and we became operational in 2005. The first clinic opened in mid-2005, and since then we've grown into a community of over 90 medical centers, two Joint Commission International (JCI) accredited hospitals, and we have several other hospitals under construction. The goal is mainly to make sure that people in the region and those that go abroad for medical treatment choose to get treatment in the UAE. The concept is a public-private partnership (PPP) model in which the government has generously invested in the infrastructure, and we have invited the private sector to come in and set up shop in the cluster. We've been very successful in that we've attracted a lot of top-notch healthcare providers globally: Samsung Medical Center from Korea, Moorfields Eye Hospital from the UK, and Dr Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group from the region to name just a few. In the past six years, we have seen the number of patients coming to DHCC increase, and I think we're doing a good job of keeping people at home. About 15% of the patients we currently see come from outside the region. Predominantly they come from the GCC region, but we also see patients from other Arab countries. The goal in the long run is to be in a position to keep all of our patients at home as well as attract patients regionally that usually go abroad. Key to that is finding out what those patients are going abroad for and then providing those treatments here, so from the very beginning we have understood that health care is an industry that is based on trust and quality is of paramount importance. For that reason, we set up the Center for Healthcare Planning &amp; Quality (CPQ), which is the regulatory arm of DHCC. We have very stringent requirements for the licensing of professionals. We look into the design of our buildings because we believe a healing environment goes hand-in-hand with treatment.</p><h4>Dubai has experienced tremendous economic growth in a wide range of industries over the past two decades. How has the private healthcare industry evolved?</h4><p>Historically, health care was always an area that was dominated by the government across the Middle East. Over the past five to seven years, we've seen a shift in that emphasis, and we are seeing more and more healthcare providers coming in as they see the region as a growth area because the population is increasing, the population is aging, and aging is linked with more healthcare needs. The projections for growth in the coming year in the Middle East look really strong, and so the private sector has been growing, and we are seeing this trend across the board both in this country and in the GCC region.</p><h4>You also have an active role in the management of DuBiotech. How do DuBiotech and DHCC work together, and what is your joint vision and strategy for the coming years?</h4><p>DHCC and DuBiotech operate within the whole spectrum of life sciences; everything from R&amp;D to actually creating the drugs and then providing patient care. Within that spectrum there are a lot of synergies as well as overlaps between the two clusters. Many clinical providers and some pharmaceutical companies operate in DHCC, while in DuBiotech there are a whole range of operations, including fragrance development. We have specifically designed the DuBiotech headquarters as a laboratory.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was the Real Estate Regulatory Agency established, and what is its role in the Dubai real estate market?<br></h4><p>Real estate is an important part of the economy in any country. In Dubai, the real estate sector became part of the economy in 1960, when the Land Department was created to begin regulating and safeguarding private property rights. The idea behind the Land Department was that to have a functioning real estate market, you need a body to ensure that the the private property system is secure, safe, and independent. Until 2000, the Land Department dealt only with Emirati nationals and selected international investors who had been granted permission to own land in Dubai. In 2000, we began to open up the real estate market to foreign investors by creating a designated freehold area for foreign investors, and in 2006 Law No. 7 concerning land registration in the Emirate of Dubai was issued. That law allows foreigners to own properties in certain freehold areas. This provided a lot of Dubai residents with the option of buying their own property and began a shift for many people from a tenant mindset to an ownership mindset. Sheikh Mohammed's vision has always been to make Dubai a hub for business and attract foreign investors. In 2000, the Land Department began establishing a strong system to enhance the services we provide to foreign investors in terms of registering title deeds. Our strategic plan is now to continue enhancing our services. That said, we have already achieved two critical things. First, we have been ranked fourth in the world for land registration systems in terms of speed and value. This year, for speed we were ranked first globally. It takes you only 25 minutes to get your title deed registered in Dubai. In terms of transparency, we are number one in the Middle East. This is an important factor for investors. Creating a real estate environment that is attractive to foreign investors requires legislation that is clear and easy to interpret. So far, we have more than 14 real estate laws in Dubai. We go to great lengths to ensure that any investors who come to Dubai are adequately prepared to participate in the market. We take investors through four stages of preparation: Know, Act, Manage, and Grow. First, Know: Before an investor even comes to Dubai, he can visit our portal to familiarize himself with the Dubai real estate market. The portal provides information on rules and regulations and statistics as well as lists of approved real estate service providers, such as agents and developers. Second, Act: Once an investor decides to go about acquiring real estate in Dubai, they  will already know that all real estate service providers in Dubai must be licensed and trained by the government and will have official documentation to show that they are registered and approved. Third, Manage: After you have bought a property in Dubai, and you want after-sales service, you will also be able to contact service providers that have been licensed and approved by the government. Finally, Grow: Once you have begun to make money and want to expand your Dubai real estate portfolio, we will work to keep you up-to-date on changing regulations and new developments.</p><h4>When you were developing the laws for the freehold land registry system in 2000, where did you look to for examples?</h4><p>We have a saying in Dubai: “Knowledge is weightless, so go and take it wherever you can." Initially, we looked to Australia, Germany, Singapore, Japan, and Jordan for our inspiration. We took a number of ideas but adapted them to meet our specific circumstances in Dubai. After enhancing the system, we wanted to continue to improve it, so we then looked to Norway, which is first globally for real estate transactions, and New Zealand, which uses electronic real estate transactions. Because of the way we have used best practices, Dubai has the best investment environment in the world.</p><h4>Who are the main foreign investors coming to the Dubai real estate market?</h4><p>There is an investment option to suit every foreign investor here in Dubai. Any investor who comes here would be amazed. Some small investors might come to invest $200,000 in a small apartment. Other larger investors might spend $2 million on a villa. There are options for everyone. Our priority is just to encourage long-term investment—investors who want to stay in the market for at least five years.  Today, we have more than 235 nationalities in Dubai. We have a huge number of investors from all over the world. The return on investment is one of the highest in the world. At the time of the peak, just before the crisis, you could get a 35% return on investment. That was not sustainable, but now you can get a sustainable return of 8-10% on your property, tax free.</p><h4>You mentioned the crisis. What about the oversupply that remains in the market following the downturn?</h4><p>When the economic boom started, it was led by real estate. That was one of the problems with the economy initially, because you can't lead economic growth with real estate. That was in the old days before RERA. RERA was founded in 2007 when we began to realize that the real estate growth was not sustainable and needed to be regulated. Our role was to encourage a sustainable, healthy real estate sector. I think we played a big role in helping to shield Dubai from the worst of the crisis and to facilitate a soft landing. Before the crisis, when we talked about sustainability and long-term investment in the real estate market, no one paid attention. After the crisis, suddenly people realized that proper planning in the market was necessary. In the wake of the crisis, we reassessed the real estate market, and we have stopped any projects that are not useful for Dubai or investors. We've cleared them and restructured them, and this has helped us to cut out a lot of the excess supply that was in the market. Now, from 2010-2011, we've had an increase of 24% on the volume and 20% on the value of real estate transactions in Dubai. This shows that the real long-term investors are still here, but the speculators have left. The strength of our real estate sector now has been the result of our strategic planning post crisis.</p><h4>Dubai has changed so much in the past seven years. How much do you think it will change seven years from now?</h4><p>We have a lot of international talent and creativity coming to Dubai. Now that we are giving people the ability to have real ownership in the economy, I think they are more likely to contribute to sustainable long-term growth. I also expect to see more green buildings, cities, and hubs. Our future is in sustainability and creativity. This kind of growth will ensure that the new generation in Dubai can enjoy and contribute to the continued wealth and prosperity of the Emirate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CBRE is a global leader in real estate management. What are some highlights from its experience in Dubai? What steps have you taken to attain your current position since your entry into the market?<br></h4><p>CBRE came to the UAE in 2004 to establish businesses in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We had for sometime been servicing the requirements of businesses based in both cities from elsewhere, and we felt the time was right to provide these professional services in the home markets of our clients. We chose the UAE because it appeared to provide the best platform for CBRE, and internationally we acted for more people from Dubai and Abu Dhabi then other cities within the region. Our revenue is now split one-third government entities, one-third local businesses, and one-third international corporates. In 2008 we saw an opportunity to create a business in Bahrain, and despite the recent difficulties in that market, our office is going from strength to strength. We are now looking for further expansion through the region as our current operations reach stability and grow naturally.</p><h4>Vis-í -vis other real estate companies, do you consider yourself a latecomer? If so, what strategies have you conducted to establish such a strong presence in such a short time?</h4><p>Prior to establishing our initial businesses here we spent considerable time analyzing why other businesses in our industry have failed or performed badly, and we concluded that the key to our businesses being successful was a deep understanding of the way the markets worked. We consequently and immediately established a strong, market-leading research capability that continues to collect, collate, and analyze market evidence so that we have strong anecdotal records.</p><h4>How does Dubai compare to other markets in the GCC?</h4><p>A very important component of our global business is our relationships with corporate clients, and CBRE tries to provide the best advice in all markets into which we expand. Dubai has a big advantage over other regional competitor cities in that a significant majority of our corporate clients have their regional (MENA) headquarters located here. This stems from the outstanding infrastructure and in particular air transport and airport facilities, which are world class. On top of this, our corporate clients report that Dubai is also the easiest market in which to recruit, and so the opportunity to expand businesses is stronger here than elsewhere. For us therefore Dubai provides a level of activity that is not currently present in other cities of the GCC and also provides an example of best regional practices. I do not therefore see Dubai being usurped as our regional headquarters.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the real estate sector in the post-crisis period?</h4><p>Dubai and its participants in all sectors of the property market (investors, developers and occupiers) have learned an important lesson over the last three years: the market, like all other markets around the world, is cyclical. Dubai's property markets have experienced significant declines in value across all asset classes, but many landlords have adapted well to changed circumstances, and so CBRE transacted more occupier activity in 2011 than during 2007 and 2008. Changing regional circumstances have compounded Dubai's advantage, but the quantity availability of quality stock have all been contributory.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the market? What changes are you expecting in the coming years?</h4><p>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the Dubai market over the last year or so is the lack of capital transactions that have taken place at arm's length. Dubai has the current advantage of significant investment flows seeking to enter the market, but the activity that this demand should operate is being hampered by the lack of available stock. The level of liquidity in Dubai is therefore interpreted to be low. What is needed to unlock this revenue stream is willing sellers bringing appropriately priced buildings to the market. We are also seeing, for the first time in two or three years, overseas institutional funds actively researching the Dubai market as they seek to achieve better returns than in home markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When and why was the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) established?<br></h4><p>KHDA was established in April 2007, with a local decree from the government of Dubai. An education council had been in place for about 18 months prior to this. The government realized that education needed to keep pace with the demands of modern society. The government commissioned the KHDA as a local authority to monitor and improve the delivery of education, particularly in the private sector and the key stages of schooling. We also have a remit to look at the growth of early learning, higher education, and training centers. Our role is basically as a regulator for the sector; we work with other departments to ensure that education keeps up with the pace and demands of development in Dubai.</p><h4>How do you work in collaboration with other entities in the Knowledge Village and Academic City?</h4><p>In 2002, there were very few private universities. The government had the idea of creating an Academic City cluster, where regional branch campuses of international universities could be set up in the free zones of Dubai. Dubai-based students would initially attend these universities, to be followed by students in the region. The plan is that we will be able to provide locally educated talent to meet the needs of the labor market, rather than bringing in people from abroad. Students do leave Dubai after high school, whether for social or financial reasons. Between 2003 and 2005, there was not a great impetus to improve higher and further education—there was a real need to set up these small cities and centers to advance the cause of academia and professional training institutes. Since then, these cities have expanded to house many branch campuses. Our role at KHDA is to quality assure these institutions and encourage them to provide courses that meet the diverse demands of Dubai's future labor force.</p><h4>What work are you doing to promote international education in Dubai?</h4><p>The history of private international education here goes as far back as the 1960s. At that time, a group of Indian traders requested to set up a community school for the Indian expatriates who had settled in Dubai. The government provided land, and this was the birth of the first private school in Dubai. After that, the British who had settled in Dubai requested a British school be built. In the 1970s, US citizens expressed an interest in building an American school. Historically, private schools were set up for business reasons, geared toward certain communities. As more people came to Dubai in the 1980s and 1990s, the number of private schools continued to increase. However, the real turning point occurred in the 2000s with the establishment of free zones. Also around that time, operators were legally entitled to own properties. As a result of these government decisions, many expatriates chose to stay in Dubai for a longer time, and the population grew by more than 10% per year. As a result of these initiatives, 87% of all education in Dubai currently takes place in the private sector. Over 50% of Emirati nationals also attend private schools. About 13% of students in private schools (25,000) commute to Dubai from other emirates. Driven by national and expatriate demand, Dubai currently boasts the greatest number of branch university campuses in the world.</p><h4>How do you foresee the growth of the education sector in Dubai?</h4><p>Schools in Dubai are very diverse. There are 13 different international curricula operating, with most students attending Indian, UK, and US curriculum schools. We have to bear in mind the business models of each school. There are community schools, embassy schools, and philanthropic schools; some are non-profit while others are operated for profit. We also have to understand the different sizes of schools. The KHDA oversees schools of 50, 500, 5,000, and 10,000 students. The fees are also very diverse. From 2001-2008, there was an average of 7% growth in school enrolments each year. Between 2008-2011, we registered 4% annual growth, mainly in the private sector. We are also seeing a consistent increase in the number of students enrolled in higher education. Fundamentally, our education system differs from many places in the world in that it is not mainly provided by the government. In the face of the global financial crisis, many countries have greatly reduced their education spending. But because our schools are privately run, the school system was not hit too hard. More people came than left during the economic crisis, maintaining a natural growth. In the region, the demand for private education will rise. As GDP grows, more people will want to enroll their children in private schools.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has Dubai been paving the way for the region as a center of educational excellence. What role has GEMS played in the growth of the sector?<br></h4><p>Very early on the Dubai government realized that it needed to diversify the base of its economy. Whenever you are looking at diversifying the base of an economy, you are talking about bringing in a class and a pool of investors and a diverse range of sectors. The underlying labor market in Dubai is very much expatriate driven. In that kind of a scenario, diversification of the economy in terms of building something that will truly secure the future of a nation cannot be done without building underlying world-class infrastructure, especially around education and healthcare. It is a thing of pride for the Emirate that the largest privately held K12 education company in the world has grown its roots out of Dubai.</p><h4>What factors enabled GEMS education to go from overseeing the education of 600 students to 100,000 in just over four decades?</h4><p>I think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the culture that has been created in Dubai and the UAE. The reality is it has always been a place that has rewarded people with passion, commitment, and an underlying drive to make something more of their lives, and Dubai has been incredibly welcoming of that kind of family and that kind of person. The environment it created, whether from a regulatory perspective or from a governmental perspective, has always had the visibility and predictability of the investment climate in mind. All of those things have allowed us to build a truly global multinational that has its roots in Dubai.</p><h4>The private educational sector in the GCC has been predicted to grow three fold in the next decade. Do you predict that applying to the UAE specifically?</h4><p>I think if we are looking at the macroeconomic factors, I do not know whether it is going to be three fold, but what is certainly the case is that within the rim of North Africa and South Asia there are the youngest populations in the world. If we look at the underlying education gap that exists, that also means that you simply cannot put up schools fast enough. So the reality is that, certainly in the context of growth more generally in the Gulf, Dubai will continue to see the pace of growth because it is still the only hub that any multinational foreign company can look to in order to bring in great people. Relative to everything else in the region, it is still the hub of choice, so from that perspective Dubai is unlikely to see a saturated education market for some time.</p><h4>How important are public-private partnerships for the growth of the industry, and how active is GEMS in this regard?</h4><p>They are very important. It is certainly a tried and tested model in many parts of the world where the value, efficiencies, accountabilities and, certainly in our case, over 50 years of educational experience can be brought to bear in order to reform and improve the education system of a country. It is something we have experience of in other parts of the world, specifically in Abu Dhabi, but less so in Dubai. Dubai is probably the best example of a private education market; it is likely the most developed private sector education market, certainly on the K-12 side.</p><h4>What kind of trends have you seen in the demographics of student enrolment?</h4><p>We have 151 different nationalities in our schools in Dubai, so there is a lot of diversity. Are we seeing a significant shift in terms of the nationalities that are coming through? Not necessarily any specific nuances, but there is still pretty consistent growth. However, over the last three-year period from 2009 until 2012, our international curriculum schools grew 52%, from 21,000 students to 32,000 students. Our Indian curriculum schools, which are more affordable generally, grew by 13% from 42,506 to 48,233, and they could have grown more if not for the fact that we were at capacity. Even in the year of the global downturn we increased enrolment by 5%, so the whole perception regarding people leaving Dubai in great numbers was unfounded. What happened during the downturn was just netted off, so it just equalized.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key strategies are in place to achieve the aim of making the ICT sector the second largest in Dubai?<br></h4><p>Future trends are very promising in the ICT sector, and world economies will be measured through ICT implementation and production. Modern communications, as an example, started with connecting people to people. Then it developed from connecting people to serving them in all aspects of life. Hence, the future favors the ICT sector transforming developing economies into developed societies. Therefore, the ICT Fund's key strategies are to create a skilled workforce through funding scholarships, to support R&amp;D in ICT, and to enhance knowledge acquisition through funding incubators and start-ups. This is due to the fact that the increase in ICT dependency is exponential and growing rapidly to the extent that technology will be a necessity if a society wants to keep up with the changes. ICT will be the main economic driving force for the future of those who want to sustain economically and catch up with the trends. Nowadays, the world spends more than $3 trillion annually buying technology, and the trend is strengthening exponentially year after year. Future technology will play a large role in every aspect of work, business, industry, health, environment, security, and more. This will require trillions of dollars to be spent yearly. Thus, producing technology will control the larger portion of the world's economies, comparing it to the oil and gas industry, which could have nearly the same share.</p><h4>How large a role does the ICT sector currently play in contributing to Dubai's economy?</h4><p>The ICT sector is playing a very important role in Dubai and the UAE's economy. However, it is mainly contributing to the economy on the infrastructure and services side. The UAE has yet to acquire the know-how of technology and transfer the knowledge into society to create an ICT knowledge-based economy. Thus, through the technological initiatives already in place, the ICT sector will be playing a very important role to contribute to the economy of Dubai and the UAE. The day will soon come when the UAE will be producing knowledge and exporting it to the world.</p><h4>What areas will the ICT Fund's budget be focusing on for development in 2012? What are your considerations when allocating funds to organizations for R&amp;D?</h4><p>In 2012, the ICT Fund will mainly focus on creating the required skilled workforce by supporting scholarships to universities in the country and abroad. It will also support schools as they create awareness of new technology available and the ways to utilize it, as well as deal with the basic elements of ICT technology for the benefit the country. Secondly, we will focus on funding R&amp;D in ICT to localize know-how and create knowledge. Thirdly, the ICT fund will support ideas and concepts from those innovators in order to be foster their skills and generate innovative ideas to deliver products that are “Made in the UAE, sold globally." Finally, the ICT Fund will support ICT National Interest Projects by funding them, in order to fill the gap and connect the missing link needed to create an ICT eco-system.</p><h4>Promoting an entrepreneurial culture among the young people of Dubai is of great importance to you—in what ways are you fostering this culture?</h4><p>An entrepreneurial culture already exists in Dubai. However, the ICT entrepreneurial culture still needs to be looked at. This is the missing link that needs to be connected. The ICT Fund is striving to create this culture through supporting ICT incubators in the country. These incubators produce graduates as start-up companies, which will form the nuclei of the local industry. The ICT Fund will also establish its own incubator to help the country establish technology companies and achieve our goals.</p><h4>Innovation is an inherent part of media in an ever-changing world. How do you see Dubai as a hub for innovation?</h4><p>Dubai is well known for its innovative initiatives, even though it has very limited resources. It is the creativity of Dubai that has led it to progress so rapidly and compete with much more mature economies. Since ICT is the future for those who want to keep up with the vast advancements in technology, it is natural to enter into the field of production. ICT companies can contribute to the sector and create the eco-system we envision in the UAE through supporting technology transfer. The results of the success stories will help Dubai contribute to the overall development of the ICT industry worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Real estate development has played a pivotal role in shaping today's Dubai. What role has Emaar Properties played in this?<br></h4><p>The most significant contribution of Emaar to Dubai is in supporting the city's social and economic growth through the creation of prime real estate assets that add to the civic pride of the city. We provide the residents of our integrated communities with a sense of belonging, creating thousands of new jobs across the property, hospitality, and leisure segments, as well as in shopping malls through retail development, thus driving the growth of ancillary industries. Since its inception in 1997, Emaar has been a true partner in Dubai's growth, led by the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. With the government of Dubai owning over 30% of the equity of the company, it makes sense for us to grow in our home market. Our development approach complements the growth outlook of Dubai, and through our projects we have contributed to further strengthening the traditional growth sectors of the Emirate—especially in retail, hospitality, and tourism. This is underlined by strong visitor numbers to The Dubai Mall, which welcomed more than 54 million visitors in 2011, contributing significantly to Dubai's retail sector. Visitor numbers to the mall were over 16 million in 1Q2012, an increase of 22% compared with the same period in 2011, highlighting the strong growth in retail and leisure that contributes to Dubai's economy. Our hospitality business, through our Address Hotels and other leisure assets, also complement the city's tourism sector, having recorded robust occupancy levels through 2011. It achieved a 92% occupancy rate in 1Q2012. In the property sector, Emaar brought a new dynamic to the city by pioneering the concept of integrated lifestyle communities. Since 2001, we have handed over more than 33,500 residential units that are today part of established and sought-after integrated lifestyle communities. A highlight of Emaar's approach to developing integrated lifestyle destinations is Downtown Dubai, a 500-acre mega-project described as “The Center of Now."</p><h4>Emaar works closely with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) to improve corporate governance in the sector. What recent developments have been made in this regard?</h4><p>Emaar works closely with all governmental authorities including RERA, the Dubai Municipality, and other related departments. We pioneered interim owner associations in our communities, with the residents themselves taking an active role in enhancing the long-term welfare of their neighborhoods in association with Emaar's Community Management Department. Emaar has been one of the first companies to comply with all RERA regulations for the launch of our recent project—Panorama at The Views. The development has been registered with the Dubai Land Department, and all units are listed on the Land Department's registry. Emaar also set up a dedicated escrow account for Panorama at The Views, with 20% of the construction value deposited as a bank guarantee. All sales proceeds will be deposited in this escrow account, which will be used only for construction purposes. Customers will pay based on the percentage completion of construction, providing significant protection to investors and financial flexibility. Emaar also works with RERA and is handling various customer concerns and developing superior policies and regulations to safeguard investor interests.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Emaar in 2012, and the sector as a whole?</h4><p>This year, we will also roll out our new value creation strategy for our stakeholders, taking into account current market realities, the evolution of new markets, and potential growth opportunities to drive tangible value-creation propositions. Our outlook for the year and for the property sector is robust, as highlighted by our new project launches and our focus on further strengthening our retail and hospitality and leisure businesses. Developing recurring revenue streams that add to the long-term value of our stakeholders has been a key pillar of our development strategy. This is reflected in our group revenue model; in 2008, 90% of our revenues were accounted for by Dubai-based property developments, and the rest came from leasing and hospitality. In 2011, 41% of our revenues were from the recurring streams of shopping malls and retail and hospitality, 22% from our international operations, and the rest from Dubai real estate operations. Today, we have recurring rental revenue generating assets of over 6 million square feet, and 12 hotels and resorts offering over 1,870 rooms. We will continue to strengthen our hospitality and retail business subsidiaries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the private healthcare sector in Dubai evolved?<br></h4><p>Our institution has been around since the beginning of the development of large private sector companies. There were some small physician's offices and clinics, but we were the first full-service, complete hospital with permanent staff. We started with outpatient services  and performed a small amount of surgery. We then opened up our inpatient units and performed more surgery, and added more physicians to our staff. It evolved over time. It was not a get-rich-quick deal; it took a lot of vision and resources to get it up and running. Building a first-class hospital isn't something that can be done fast—the tradition, staff, and the building processes are all very important.</p><h4>What are the main defining characteristics of the local healthcare industry?</h4><p>In the US, many of the hospitals are charities, either public or private, and as part of their missions they are non-profit organizations. At the end of the day, however, they need turnover to reinvest in people, buildings, or new technology. We see an awful lot of that in the US, but you don't find that here in Dubai. There's a government sector, and a private sector, and we don't see any charitable-type institutions here. Health care and technology is expensive, and there are extensive operational costs associated with it, and somehow people need to be paid. There's a balance that you have to have, but it's a little different here in Dubai.</p><p>If you look at the national health insurance groups around the world, they are beginning to realize that they need mechanisms for accountability. People can't come into a hospital and stay forever, using all the services. Abu Dhabi has been leading the way, with its accountability schemes. In Dubai as well, people are signing up for insurance, and the companies are asking more questions. They didn't ask as many questions before. People have high expectations; in the past everything was done basically for free. There is a huge value in the services we provide, and more places with insurance are starting to institute copayment schemes. It's a natural gatekeeper. If you have to pay for it, hopefully people will think before running to the doctor or emergency room for every little thing.</p><h4>What are your current expansion plans?</h4><p>We mainly want to finish the commissioning of our new building, which will involve relocating our intensive care unit (ICU) in the original building to the new facility here. We have 19 beds now, but we'll move up to 25 beds in ICU. The original building needs refurbishment, although it's only 16 years old. It's not old, but it has been used constantly, and we need to renovate. We would like to move the patients into our new building, keep them here, and if we find that we still want to expand, we can renovate our old building to meet demand. Currently, we only operate here at our facility in Dubai, but in the future we would  consider expansion outside of this area. We have been invited to many locations in this part of the world, not only in the UAE.</p><h4>How is information management involving in this market?</h4><p>We are being very careful to maintain a high standard of professional care and to continue managing information. The documentation of our product is our medical record, which contains all the patient information. We are spending a large amount of time and money on the computerization of these records. It's necessary for patient care so we do not lose charts or x-rays, for example. If everything is digitized, we can transfer everything quickly or put it on a flash drive in seconds. One issue is the security of information. We have to be careful in terms of connectivity. Another issue is that the internet service is not reliable in every part of the country.  We can send bills digitally to our insurance company, and we get paid online, too. The money moves appropriately and safely, and if we move to another part of Dubai or the UAE, we want to ensure that any of our physicians can review one of our patient's medical record from any location in the region. This is extremely important for many reasons.</p><h4>How much of a challenge is it to attract talented staff to the hospital?</h4><p>We are seeing a significant number of physicians from Germany, the UK, and the US who want to work here. Many who visit are returning to this region of the world. The way we organize our hospital structure is exactly the same as it is done in the US. It was easy for me to be here as a CEO, because it is operated in a similar way, with only a few minor differences. The staff and patients are from many different countries, but they recognize the procedures here. Even some physicians from the US are choosing to move here in the midst of a confusing reimbursement program there. Other people just want a change. Although I've been in the business for many years, I wanted to do something different, and this hospital provides it to me. Many young nurses come here for a couple of years. Young people from the US come here and love it. German staff are especially eager to experience a different working atmosphere. I feel lucky to be in Dubai.</p><h4>What sort of steps need to be taken to develop the local primary care market?</h4><p>Primary care is extremely important, and everyone needs a primary care physician. From a health point of view, it's better to see people on a routine basis and screen them, as opposed to just going to the doctor when you are sick. I applaud those who depend on primary physicians and focus their energy on the sector, calling upon specialists only at appropriate times. A lot of insurance companies have begun to demand that patients are referred from their primary care physician, and they can't go straight to the specialist. Screening saves lives and money. If we have primary care physicians that have long-term relationships with their patients, we can take better care of them. There's always a balance between quality and money. For example, looking purely at saving money, you could ban insulin. Frankly, you could just get rid of the diabetic population if you wanted to save money. If you accept the fact that you have to give people insulin, you must also accept the fact that there are other issues you will have to deal with concerning that patient, such as their eyes, exercise, kidney functions, feet, and diet. Diabetes is a gateway disease because it opens up all kinds of other diseases. If we permit insulin, we have to recognize that there are costs associated with that. Part of controlling costs is having a well-informed and motivated patient population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Abbott Laboratories in the region?<br></h4><p>Abbott has a long history in the Middle East and has been in the region for many decades. Abbott is considered among the first few pharmaceuticals that came to the region and maintained its goal to advance medical science to help people live healthier lives by addressing important health needs from infancy to the golden years. We work closely with our partners across the Middle East, with a presence in every country.</p><h4>What is the significance of the UAE in terms of your Middle East operations?</h4><p>Our Middle East and Africa office is based in Dubai, which hosts all of our divisions, ranging from nutritional products, laboratory diagnostics, medical devices, and pharmaceutical therapies. We are the market leaders in most of our divisions, working passionately and thoughtfully translating science into lasting contributions to health.</p><h4>What is the focus of your product development in the region?</h4><p>In the UAE and the region, we ensure availability of our best products. We have been pioneers in introducing many medicines that are first in their categories. One such latest introduction is Humira, the first fully-human monoclonal antibody for the treatment of immune mediated inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Previously, we have introduced first in class products in neonatology, anesthesia, and HIV/AIDS therapy areas. We also have several innovative products in the pipeline for chronic kidney disease and hepatitis C. The company supports disease awareness and educational activities with the public, through our partnerships with government, specifically the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other major institutions. We have realized that the public lacks disease awareness, and many times the delay in diagnosis allows the disease to reach an advanced stage where its management becomes a challenge to the healthcare providers. Our three main focuses in the UAE and the region are to register new products as early as possible, educate the healthcare providers through training, seminars, and workshops, and help the public by designing programs in association with healthcare professionals who address disease education. On the other hand, we bring many opportunities to the residents living in the region, by offering and creating job opportunities.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in the past five to 10 years in terms of the services and products you deliver?</h4><p>In the past five to 10 years the market has expanded rapidly leading to firstly, a volume increase of companies, and secondly, to a more customer-centric approach. For example, doctors are satisfied with the professional educational services they are receiving from companies, however they would like to see more patient education programs, since an empowered patient would lead to a better patient outcome. Thirdly, we've begun to see increased government participation in building healthcare structure. The government has taken aggressive action to restructure the system through privatization, compulsory insurance implementation, and changing the medical coverage from the government into a model closely aligned with social security.</p><h4>What are your growth plans for the UAE and wider regions?</h4><p>We're seeking to expand globally and regionally to improve our focus and support to patient care and services. The existing Proprietary Pharmaceutical Division (PPD) of Abbott Laboratories will be separated by 1Q2013 to begin independent operations under the name of AbbVie, a new research based pharmaceutical company. In the past, we hired many overseas expatriates from the US, Europe, and Canada, but this is no longer the case. We are employing residents of the countries from the region as part of our effort to build a base of local talent. We have been very successful in this endeavor, and we hope to continue in the future. The company aims to expand in terms of introducing new products as fast as possible. The Middle East is on our list of emerging markets, with good growth opportunities. This country is a hub that has a large pool of talent from across the globe, and we are keen to invest in the right people and build a brighter future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[an-open-mind]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the local healthcare industry evolved over the history of Gulf Drug?<br></h4><p>The country is still young. If you compare the UAE to other countries of the same age, the UAE is far ahead of the game. However, if you compare it to the Western world, there is still a lot of room for improvement. There have been investments from both the government and private sectors, but the investment is not enough. You can get the best equipment and have the fanciest hospitals, but you still require the people to manage them and the doctors to provide healthcare. There are two aspects: one is the products and devices a medical professional uses, and the other is the knowledge. The knowledge base takes time to build and will take a few more decades to be solidified. A knowledge base cannot be acquired through money; it has to be built over time.</p><h4>What are your core services?</h4><p>We are in the top 10 pharmaceutical distributors in the UAE. We are in the top three medical equipment agents and service providers in the UAE and also the top three medical consumables providers in the country, including one of the largest turnkey project providers in the country. From the moment a hospital is planned, the contractor builds the basic infrastructure for the hospital, which is the cement and steel, and we do the rest; pretty much everything from communications to the operating theaters, recovery rooms, and even the waiting lounges.</p><h4>As a local company, how do you compete with huge, multinational enterprises offering the same services?</h4><p>There are two factors. First we try to understand the local market. Second we aim to fully understand the agency laws, which protect local companies. This legislation is good and bad at the same time; the country is not that large, and the law protects local businesses from being overtaken by the globalization movement and international ownership, which local companies have no chance to compete against. The law is bad because many newcomers in the market have a difficult time, although those who have a good concept or product usually succeed. In the medical field, the investments required to bring a product to the market are usually very high, and the competition is so fierce that the returns are limited. In pharmaceuticals, we gross anywhere between 8% and 10%. Our margins are set by the Ministry of Health and are pegged once every year or two. In this way, we absorb the currency fluctuations. This means that at certain stages it is possible to lose the whole gross margin, and we would have to pay from our pockets to provide medicine to the market. Out of social concern, this is one good thing about being a local company; we have a social responsibility to make sure this medicine is available on the market because it can save lives.</p><h4>What are the benefits of controlling the cost of pharmaceutical products?</h4><p>One aspect is for the expatriate community not to pay too much for their medication, but at the same time it is for those UAE citizens who choose not to go to the government hospitals, where UAE citizens get their medication and healthcare for free. Otherwise, UAE citizens have to acquire medication at a higher cost if they do not carry private healthcare insurance. Price controls help the consumer. However, certain medications are not worth bringing to the market for multinational companies, since the margins are very slim, and the competition is tough. Most of the medication in the country has a generic version, and it is up to the consumer to choose which he or she wants to use. With branded medicines, the customers knows that the product is 100% what it says it is, but generics could be made in Asia or Eastern Europe; we do not guarantee their effectiveness.</p><h4>How does the market in the UAE compare to the surrounding markets?</h4><p>Every country protects its own pharmaceutical market by default. The UAE is more open-minded than most GCC countries. For example, in the UAE a Qatari can own a pharmaceutical drugstore. A UAE citizen may not own a drugstore in Qatar, so the UAE is much more open-minded when it comes to business than most of its counterparts in the region, and its laws are ahead of most other countries. The only country that would be comparable would be Oman, but it's not a large market compared to the UAE or Kuwait. The medicine in UAE is 30% cheaper than in Kuwait, on average, although Kuwait is on the same level as the UAE when it comes to oil exports and GDP.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[over-the-barriers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Coca Codo Sinclair project evolved over the last five years?<br></h4><p>The Ecuadorean Institute of Electrification (INECEL), which today does not exist, started developing this project back in the 1970s. The organization conducted studies on the Coca river valley, as well as a pre-feasibility study. Later on, in 1985, ELC Electroconsult of Italy, with several other consulting firms, carried out feasibility studies in order to develop a potential hydroelectric plant project. It took seven years for the companies to carry out their studies, which ended in 1992. In the late 1990s, INECEL disappeared, and the project fell by the wayside. It was of great satisfaction that President Correa decided to revive the Coca Codo Sinclair project. In 2008, the Coca Codo Sinclair EP enterprise was established as a joint stock company, and one year later it became a state-owned enterprise. In addition, the project got a boost; the same Italian company, ELC Electroconsult, updated all the studies that support the technical feasibility of the project, increasing the initial power of the plant to 1,500 MW, and a contract was signed with China's Sinohydro Corporation in October 2009. A year later a financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China was signed, which financed 85% of the entire project, or $1.68 billion. The government of Ecuador financed the remaining 15%, or some $300 million, which was disbursed between 2010 and 2011.</p><h4>What is the current state of development?</h4><p>In 2010 we started constructing the project, and over the last two years we have relocated a section of a heavy crude oil pipeline running through a vital area for our project, and in 2011 we began developing the engineering works, starting construction on the water intake area, powerhouse, and conveyance tunnel. As of today, around 20% of the initial works have been completed. The first tunneling machine is also on site, and we expect a second tunneling machine to arrive soon. Such equipment has an approximate cost of $70 million. The Export-Import Bank of China has already provided $110 million for the project, which is clear proof that it is gaining speed. In addition, all the machinery designs are being prepared right now, and as soon as they are completed, they will be sent to Europe and China, where the machinery for the project will be manufactured.</p><h4>What challenges did the company face when tendering the project to Sinohydro and negotiating the financial agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China?</h4><p>The biggest challenge was to close the deal with Sinohydro from a technical point of view. The talks, which lasted for six months, were very tough due to the language barrier. In fact, communication difficulties are still an important barrier to overcome. The Ministry of Finance was in charge of coming to an agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China, and those were also very tough negotiations, especially regarding sovereignty and payment issues. Fortunately, we can say that, as of today, the project is fully financed, and it will be a reality very soon. One of our main duties is to check the strict compliance with technical specifications and deadlines agreed between all the parties in the contracts. Also, I would like to add that the project will have a payback period of 10 years after the plant starts operating.</p><h4>What will Coca Codo Sinclair's grade of responsibility be once the plant becomes operative?</h4><p>In the future, we will be integrated within CELEC EP's activities, and Sinohydro is obliged by contract to train our operators' employees, who in the future will be part of the company. This is part of the technical transference clauses agreed to in the contract. We are mostly talking about engineers in charge of operating and maintaining the plant.</p><h4>What are your views on the criticism the project received?</h4><p>When we updated the studies on the project's technical and economic feasibility back in 2008, we proved that we are developing a very attractive, sustainable, and economically profitable project for Ecuador. This is a so-called “run-of-river" project, and the environmental impact is minimal, for it is not a water impounding dam. Therefore, the project has been developed to generate electricity according to the flow of the river, so we can reach the 1,500 MW capacity when the river carries large flows, which are present for six months a year. During the other six months, the plant will not generate at maximum capacity. All the studies carried out over the years prove that regardless of the season and rain variation over the year, the average production of the plant will be around 8,600 GWh annually. Coca Codo Sinclair is the largest hydroelectric project in Ecuador, and will have one of the lowest levels of environmental impact in the entire country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, Canada and Colombia are celebrating 60 years of full diplomatic relations at a time when our bilateral relations are stronger than ever before. In Colombia, Canada has a friend and a key partner spanning the three goals of Canada's “whole-of-government" engagement in the Americas: increasing economic opportunity, addressing insecurity, and advancing freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, as well as strengthening our relationships and partnerships in the hemisphere. Our links with Colombia are many, from our recent bilateral free trade agreement to Canadian peace and security programs in Colombia, defense cooperation, an agreement to undertake joint anti-narcotics capacity building in Central America, and cooperation in multilateral organizations.</p><p>I have personally had the privilege of visiting Colombia twice since becoming Minister of State of Foreign Affairs responsible for the Americas. For his part, Prime Minister Stephen Harper has undertaken three official visits to Colombia. What we have consistently encountered is a strong and committed partner that is building prosperity by embracing open markets. At the same time, I can see Colombia working to overcome the remaining hurdles on the path to peace as it addresses the challenges of the long-standing internal armed conflict.</p><div class="quote">“As Canada's presence in Colombia grows, we are actively engaged in promoting corporate social responsibility."</div><p>Our two countries are building mutual prosperity through trade, investment, and closer commercial relationships. Since 2011, Canada and Colombia have benefitted from a modern free trade agreement that goes far beyond trade in goods and services, with commitments on the environment and labor. Two-way merchandise trade reached a record high of $1.6 billion in 2011 and is poised to post significant gains in 2012. Canadian investors are flocking to Colombia, not only in the oil and gas sector and mining exploration, where Canada is the largest international investor, but also in other areas, such as financial services.</p><p>As Canada's presence in Colombia grows, we are actively engaged in promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR). Since 2009, Canada has employed a CSR Counselor for the Extractive Sector to review the practices of Canadian companies operating abroad and to advise on the implementation of performance standards. Furthermore, the Canadian embassy in Bogotá is actively promoting the implementation of Canada's CSR Strategy for the International Extractive Sector. For its part, the Canada-Colombia Chamber of Commerce has an active committee on CSR.</p><p>There can be no question; Colombia is an emerging market with many advantages: high levels of education, a strong sense of entrepreneurship, abundant natural resources, and a robust financial sector. We are confident Colombia is committed to taking the appropriate steps to sustain an environment conducive to economic growth. We know Colombia is working to develop its infrastructure both to serve its people and for commercial reasons, and is committed to maintaining the security gains made during the past decade, all of which should not downplay Colombia's ongoing challenges, particularly with regard to human rights and the security situation. While much progress has been made, much work remains to be done. However, I have been continuously encouraged by the Colombian government's commitment to addressing its challenges and by its openness to seeking support from civil society and the international community in these efforts.</p><p>This is why Canada is pleased to support these endeavors through funding and programming supplied in partnership with the Colombian government, representatives of civil society, the international community, and multilateral organizations. Since 2006, our government has provided over C$100 million to Colombia on development programming focusing on the rights and humanitarian needs of indigenous groups, internally displaced persons, and children and youth, as well as C$30 million to support initiatives on transitional justice, protecting the rights of victims of the internal conflict, supporting mine action, and enhancing security and stability. We firmly believe that increased cooperation with Colombia, including through our free trade agreement, enables us to share our values of respect for freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, while enhancing economic opportunity both in Colombia and in Canada. It is upon strong economic foundations that responsible governments can build strong democratic governance and security.</p><p>Five years after Prime Minister Harper first made the Americas a foreign policy priority, Canada's engagement in thehemisphere has never been stronger. Colombia is at the forefront of this effort. Looking to the future, I am confident that Canada and Colombia will work ever more closely to increase economic opportunity in both our countries through trade and investment, and at the same time continue to support the pursuit of peace, security, and respect for human rights.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of the Iranian petrochemicals sector and how would you assess product quality?</h4><p>The quality of petrochemical products in Iran is fully compatible and competitive with national and international standards. Thanks to the quality of our petrochemical products, I should bring to your attention that our international customers have a huge demand for our range of products. In the last six months, the National Petrochemical Company (NPC) successfully managed to meet all the requirements of the REACH Regulation—the qualification test for European standards—and now we have confirmation to export all of our products to the European market. This is proof that the quality of Iranian petrochemical products is very high, and serves as a good reason why there is such a high demand for them. In order to produce these products we utilize state-of-the-art technology, which improves our output. Iran started producing petrochemical products more than 50 years ago, and over this time we have been able to develop a skilled workforce that is positively affecting our production.</p><h4>The value of petrochemical products is expected to reach $26 billion by 2015. What strategies is NPC taking to contribute to achieving this goal?</h4><p>We have a vision for 2025 that will make us the number one producer of petrochemicals in the Middle East in terms of the value of products. According to this plan, we have formulated several different five-year plans. There are three more five-year plans at an industry level to carry out until 2025. We are currently implementing the fifth five-year development plan at the national level. Within this framework, we are financing 73 new petrochemical projects. When these 73 projects are implemented, we will have an extra 66 million tons of installed capacity. The requirements to implement this plan are finalized and ready. The required feedstock has been allocated, the private sector has been attracted, feedstock agreements have been signed in order to grant investors access to long-term supplies of raw materials, and the implementation activities for all 73 projects have been initiated. We have local and foreign investment for some of these projects, and for others we are working to secure and attract both local and foreign investors. If we can secure these investments, we can finish all these projects in accordance with the timetable. Our expectation is that by the end of the fifth five-year development plan, we are going to have an installed capacity of over 100 million tons of petrochemicals. We have a large and growing domestic market of 75 million people, but annual per capita consumption still remains below international standards. That is why we are trying to increase the existing per capita consumption rate. At the same time, the country's population growth rate is healthy and Iran could reach a population of 150 million people. This means that there is a huge local market waiting for us. People all over the world are facing dramatic lifestyle changes. All things considered, petrochemical products are going to dominate the market. It is expected that petrochemical-based products will replace products made out of wood, aluminum, and metal, as well as those made out of minerals, in many sectors. Petrochemical products may also replace certain construction materials. We are looking at different markets, such as those in Asia. According to our research, the demand in that market is growing, and we have access to it. At the same time, we have experts at NPC that do market analysis, and we are directing our production capacity to be able to supply the demand of our neighboring countries and our national market. As an example, we are currently producing 5.5 million tons of urea per year, of which 2.2 million tons is used locally and the remaining 3.3 million tons is exported. Still, the demand is high, and customers often demand 10 million tons of urea—we cannot meet that level of demand yet. Another example is polypropylene output capacity, which is 600,000 tons per year, and domestic consumption actually exceeds our production capacity. This is the reason we import some products to satisfy our increasing domestic demand.</p><div class="quote">“We have a vision for 2025 that will make us the number one producer of petrochemicals in the Middle East."</div><h4>How are NPC and the government assisting foreign investors to enter the petrochemicals industry?</h4><p>Iran possesses the world's largest reserves of oil and gas combined. In terms of feedstock diversity, Iran has the most diversified resources. We have access to natural gas, gas condensates, LNG, and naphtha. Given these resources, the strategy is to implement and avoid selling crude products, and instead create value-added products for export. We believe that creating this value-added will attract investors, both domestic and foreign. In order to attract and facilitate foreign investment, we have to protect these investments by guaranteeing the highest profit margins. The benefits we offer are access to long-term feedstock supplies, the availability of cheap and abundant land, and infrastructural facilities located in special economic zones that enjoy advantages such as tax exemptions. The other available advantage is that exports can be made without limitations. The security of investments made through the National Fund allows investors to use the financial resources of the banking sector, which grants them the possibility to use the local capital markets. NPC and the government will offer guarantees so that investors gain access to the market. Of course, investors will benefit from a skilled workforce with managerial experience, as well as qualified companies active in the fields of engineering, manufacturing, and implementation. In addition, investors will have access to government-built infrastructure, such as the port in the South Pars Special Economic-Energy Zone. This port, for example, has facilities that allow the export of different kinds of gaseous, liquid, and solid petrochemical products.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the petrochemicals sector?</h4><p>I am very optimistic, and my optimism is based on facts and figures, as well as the 25 years of experience that I have in the petrochemicals sector. Given the potential that Iran has and the plans and efforts that the government is making to create a lucrative investment environment, I believe that Iran's petrochemicals industry will boom. Any investor looking to invest in the coming period will enjoy a fruitful return on his or her investment.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>DUBAL celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2009 and is one of the flagship industrial powerhouses in the UAE. What developments has DUBAL witnessed in the industrial sector over the last three decades, and what factors have been instrumental to its success?</h4><p>The industrial sector in Dubai in particular has become very attractive and extremely solid. The aluminum industry is the biggest non-oil industry in the UAE today. Aluminum is a commodity, and banks are using metals as a reserve, even as an investment. We currently sell to almost 300 customers worldwide in about 45 countries on six continents. We manufacture products in three main forms: extrusion billets, foundry alloys, and high-purity aluminum. We are focusing on four different sectors: construction, packaging, transportation, and also now aerospace. A decade ago, we accounted for 7% to 9% of the industrial sector. This has changed slightly with a lot of new companies now contributing to Dubai's GDP. Today we are producing 1.03 million tons. Currently, 10% of our production is used locally, while 90% is exported. When 90% of your production is exported, you need good facilities, good transportation, and a good port to handle 900,000 tons of metal exports. We are very fortunate to have DP World, which has contributed to DUBAL's success because of the technology and services that it provides. We, in turn, contribute to its income—about 25% of DP World's income comes from DUBAL, through transportation and handling, plus storage, because we store our products at its facilities. From there we also supply five to six downstream destinations in the UAE. We work closely with downstream businesses in the UAE and have been doing so successfully for the last 33 years.</p><h4>Which are the key markets for you, and where are you witnessing increased growth and international demand?</h4><p>In the 1980s, we used to sell 80% of our products to Asia. However, after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, we shifted our focus to other parts of the world. Asia and Southeast Asia nevertheless remain important markets for us. The Moroccan, Tunisian, and Egyptian markets are important also, as well as Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. About 17% of our total production is sold to Europe, and that is a major market; not so much from a revenue perspective, but from a strategic one. In the EU, a 6% tariff is applied to all of our products, and this duty has been imposed for almost 15 years. When this tariff is reduced, the market will become far more lucrative for us. The newest market for us today is South America. We started selling there last year, with 10,000 tons being shipped to that market. We aim to sell 25,000 tons there in 2012. By 2015, we expect to sell more than 50,000 tons to South America, mainly in Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela.</p><h4>How was the price of aluminum affected by the global crisis?</h4><p>Before the crisis, aluminum prices were close to record highs. During the crisis, prices dropped to close on $1,300 per ton. Despite this, 2009 was a good year for DUBAL as we adopted a different strategy to the other players. While many companies cut production, made staffing cutbacks, froze salaries, halted projects, and stopped supplying certain customers, we did the opposite. The company actually increased its production, and continued its capex projects. The most important thing to DUBAL is our people, and we ensured that no one would be laid off. Throughout the crisis period we invested in our people, and we invested in our companies. We have people from over 45 nationalities working for us, and we pride ourselves on our international and highly skilled workforce.</p><h4>In 2007 you entered into a joint venture with Mubadalla to create Emirates Aluminium Company, and together you launched the EMAL Project. What were the strategic motivations behind that move, and can you tell us a little bit more about the project and other projects you have ongoing at the moment?</h4><p>In 2005 we saw the potential to utilize our business model. After 25 years of growth DUBAL had a great deal of potential in terms of people, labor experience, and technology. In 2006, Abu Dhabi officials expressed an interest in aluminum production, because its government had the energy, the site, and the desire to diversify the economy from oil into industry. Also, they wanted to build a downstream industry plus sub-downstream businesses. Being a large manufacturer of aircraft maintenance items, aluminum production made sense. We teamed our interests and by 2020 are planning to produce close to 2.5 million tons from both companies. Synergies are now being studied between DUBAL and EMAL in terms of sales purchasing, training, and equipment, and we are trying to optimize as much as we can. EMAL Phase I was completed at the end of 2010, and it produced 724,000 tons in 2011, which DUBAL has successfully sold. EMAL now has 200 customers in 30 countries. EMAL Phase II has just started. This will take the total production capacity of EMAL to 1.3 million tons, using technology that was developed by DUBAL here in the UAE.</p><h4>Turkey is one of your target destinations. What makes Turkey so attractive to you?</h4><p>Turkey is a very big market, it is close to us, and we believe that the aluminum industry in Turkey is booming. It is a very encouraging market as we don't face restrictive trade tariffs. We have started selling more products to Turkey, and once we are fully comfortable with the Turkish market we may invest in additional technologies. We sell only one product to Turkey: foundry alloys. Our Turkish customers used to buy 25,000 tons per year, but are now taking up to 75,000 tons. We sell our products to larger car manufacturers and are able to provide the quality of backup support that such companies require. We are also looking into extrusions in Turkey. As the extrusion plants are scattered around the country, the logistics are difficult, so we are working with an agent to find the best way to reach these extruders. We would like to sell through Turkey to other countries close by, using it as a hub.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Exclusive Experience]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-exclusive-experience]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the essence of Al Nabooda's success?<br></h4><p>We sell cars starting from the AED100,000 range up to AED3 million. If you want to succeed in this market, you have to give the buyer an experience that is unique. He is not buying an ordinary car; he is buying an exclusive experience. What we have learned is that you have to put money into infrastructure, high-quality workshops, facilities, and showrooms, as people want that after having paid this kind of money.</p><h4>What does your future roll out strategy look like?</h4><p>In Sharjah, we are building three showrooms and workshops. They will be opened three months after the opening of our Fujairah facilities. The Audi showroom will be ready by the end of 2012. Currently we have 800 employees, and by the end of 2012 we will have more than 1,000.</p><h4>How do you compare the micro markets under your dealership?</h4><p>All of them are growing, especially Fujairah. We have seen tremendous growth in the past six or seven months. A huge city center built by Al-Futtaim Group is coming up, and a new road is being built. Starting from February 2012, driving time from Dubai to Fujairah takes just 35 minutes. Abu Dhabi is building an oil and gas pipeline direct to Fujairah to pump out oil and gas for export directly from there instead of coming around the Gulf. A lot is happening in Fujairah. Sharjah has always shown good expansion, too. We have a large customer base in Sharjah. We already had a center there, but it was a small showroom. Now we are building a proper facility.</p><h4>How do you compare your brands vis-í -vis your competitors?</h4><p>We have done a little better than most of them. In 2010 the Japanese had an over-stocking problem. We never had such an issue except for the first few months of the crisis. We sell all of our cars, and all our customers are on a waiting list. You cannot walk into my showroom and buy a car. In both middle and premium classes the demand is all around. The automobile industry has been extremely strong in 2011, and we have seen tremendous growth. The industry was set back a little because of the earthquake in Japan, as the Japanese automotive industry caters to the global automobile industry. The entire car business has grown tremendously. We set a record in August by selling 217 Porches in a month, which has never been done in the history of Porsche.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the regulatory framework in Dubai?</h4><p>There is a regulatory framework called the GCC Regulations, which define the requirements for automobiles in the GCC region. This is a standard applied Gulf wide. Any manufacturer or dealer operating in the GCC automobile sector needs to comply with them.</p><h4>From where do you receive your products?</h4><p>We receive cars from various manufacturing facilities around the world. It depends on the model. For instance, VW has 30 plants around the world. We get the new Jetta from the US, Beetle from Mexico, Amarok from Argentina, Touareg from Bratislava, and Golf from Germany. Essentially, we deal with VW Germany. What is more, Dubai's import procedures are fantastic. We all have accounts with customs, and nothing waits at the port. If a car lands at 11:00 am, it is in my workshop by 12:30 pm in the afternoon.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the short term?</h4><p>We are extremely surprised with the buoyancy of the market. We did not assume that we would be in a position where we would have no stock. On December 31 we ended 2011 with virtually no stock. In the car market we see that the Korean brands are growing very aggressively. They are eating away the market share of Japanese cars.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the biggest achievement  of the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) since its inception in 2003, and was it in line with what you originally set out to achieve?</h4><p>The vision of the TRA is an optimal enabling environment in which the UAE's ICT sector will emerge as a leader in the global marketplace. Since its inception, the TRA has at all times worked toward this vision whilst respecting government policy and the aspirations of the leadership. The TRA's vision has been supported by four strategic objectives: organizational excellence; the e-readiness of government services; the promotion of shared infrastructure between government entities; and a world-leading environment for ICT services. In accordance with its vision, the TRA is working closely with all stakeholders to undertake the necessary projects to secure the TRA's vision for the sector. Since introducing competition in mobile services in 2007, the TRA has been very happy with the way the mobile market has developed. We have two very innovative operators with advanced networks offering low prices by international standards. Competition works very well in that market. The TRA is in the process of introducing a range of measures to enhance competition within the market such as, for example, bitstream interconnection and passive infrastructure sharing (ducts, cables, and exchanges) for high-speed data markets. In terms of consumers, the TRA recently undertook a number of surveys within the UAE that revealed, among other things, that there is generally a high level of satisfaction amongst businesses and consumers with the ICT services delivered in the UAE. Finally, a number of international bodies collect information from around the world in order to rank countries across a wide range of different telecommunication sector indicators.</p><h4>What role does the evolution of the local telecommunications industry play in the wider 2030 vision for the UAE? What are the strengths of the UAE as a regional ICT hub?</h4><p>The overall health of the UAE's economy is intrinsically linked to the state of the telecommunications sector. This is because telecommunications is a vital business input. If we want a strong economy, we need a strong and sustainable telecommunications sector. Without a robust telecommunications sector in the UAE, businesses would not be able to compete effectively in the global markets and they would be less likely to move to the UAE. Telecommunications also plays a very important role in the day-to-day life of our residents, so it is important from a social perspective that we continue to focus on safeguarding the future of the sector.</p><h4>How large a role does the ICT sector currently play in contributing to Dubai's economy?</h4><p>Dubai's economy is strongly ICT based and matches the TRA's vision of becoming a global leader in the region for ICT services. In the free zones of Dubai (and, to a certain extent, Abu Dhabi) many of the world's leading ICT companies have established offices or partnerships with established ICT companies locally. The TRA has a key role to play in ensuring the continuation of a strong and sustainable telecommunications sector. The TRA has put in place policies ranging from the prevention of anti-competitive practices to cyber security to improve the functioning of the telecoms market in these zones. It must also be recognized that the TRA's role is not just to assist in the development of industry—it is also to protect the end-users of telecommunications services. But, overall, we strive to ensure that we achieve an internationally competitive telecommunications sector that supports the growth ambitions of the UAE's economy and at the same time meets the needs of both business and consumers in Dubai.</p><h4>The entry of du into the market in 2007 changed the market from a monopoly to a duopoly. What challenges were faced in effecting this change?</h4><p>The main challenges the TRA faced during the introduction of du into the telecommunications sector was to ensure the appropriate policies and practices were in place to allow competition to develop. Since the introduction of du in 2007, both UAE operators have invested heavily in fixed and mobile infrastructure, with each having very advanced 4G mobile networks, and in high-speed fixed fiber networks. Both mobile and fixed networks in the UAE are very advanced when compared to those in most other countries around the world. The operators are also continuing to invest in developing innovative product and service offerings within the market and the TRA works hard to ensure that the regulatory environment supports this continued investment through being stable, transparent, and based upon internationally recognized best-practice principles.</p><h4>You recently updated your methodology for collating local telecommunications statistics. Did the most recent report reveal any new trends?</h4><p>The latest data published by the TRA is for January 2012. This showed that subscription levels for fixed, mobile, and internet services have continued to grow. For example, the total number of mobile subscribers at the end of January 2012 was 11.94 million. This represents an increase of 213,000 total mobile subscribers since the end of December 2011. The apparent decrease in penetration of all the telecommunications services was due to a change in methodology of how the TRA estimates the population of the UAE. For example, for mobile services the penetration fell from 199% in December 2011 to 149.1% in January 2012.</p><h4>How advanced is the UAE, and Dubai specifically, in terms of fiber-optic connectivity?</h4><p>The UAE has an extensive fiber footprint, not only in the densely populated areas but also in the less populated areas, with a strong commitment to roll out the fiber networks nationwide in the coming years. The fiber networks are a mixture of GPON-based FTTH/FTTB combined with intra-building copper cabling with ethernet topology. A variety of services is provided over fiber from residential services like voice, internet access, IPTV, business services, symmetric and asymmetric high-speed data connections, and MPLS-based VPN services. The two operators, Etisalat and du, are both rolling out their respective fiber networks in the UAE, although du has a historic footprint in certain areas in Dubai, whereas Etisalat covers the rest of the UAE.</p><h4>What approach is being taken to establish a strong regional internet exchange?</h4><p>The TRA has conducted extensive studies on Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) from technical, regulatory, and economical factors. The TRA recognized that establishing a regional IXP in the UAE would boost its position as an ICT leader and hub. The TRA has identified this project as one of the strategic projects for the industry. The TRA is working with the industry to establish the IXP in the UAE. The objective of this project is to promote public peering on internet traffic between carriers and operators based on international best practices. The establishment of the IXP will benefit the ICT industry and the consumer in terms of diversity in internet connectivity, performance, and price. The IXP technical setup is currently in the testing phase and will be launched soon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the creation of du, and what were the challenges to entering the market?</h4><p>The creation of du was the first step in opening up the telecommunications sector in the UAE to competition. It was the first time in UAE telecoms history that the market was opened up to secondary players after 100% penetration had been attained in the mobile segment. That, in itself, was a great challenge. Another challenge we faced was that it was the first time that a telecoms start-up was offering the full range of telecoms services right away. Usually, start-ups begin with only mobile voice services and then move on to offer fixed broadband services and so on. From the very beginning, we had a mandate to offer services in mobile, fixed telecoms, fixed broadband, home TV services, IP TV services, and broadcasting. That was a very exciting challenge. The third challenge, and probably the most important, was that this is the first telecoms start-up in the Arab world that was created without support from an existing and established operator.</p><h4>What have been the most instrumental factors in the exponential growth the company has witnessed in its short five-year history?</h4><p>We should be very proud of what we have achieved in just five years of launching our services. Today, we are a company that has a significant market share in the mobile sector in the UAE—over 46%. In the most penetrated market in the world for mobile services that is remarkable by any standard. We are now getting close to having 6 million active mobile customers. We have managed to reach close to AED9 billion in revenues in 2011. We have very good profit margins, as evidenced by our ability to distribute our first dividend to our shareholders just five years after launching the service. We are very proud of these results, of our position in the market, the value created for our shareholders, and the pool of talented people that we have. We worked hard to get this talent on board and create a strong corporate culture, and today I believe that we have one of the strongest brands within the Arab world. We have excellent infrastructure. Our mobile broadband network has recently been ranked the best in all of Africa and the Middle East. We also have solid foundations in our governance. We are very passionate about the brand, which is not just about having a nice logo or campaigns; the brand is about everything that this company lives and breathes, interfacing with its customers, employees, and shareholders.</p><h4>What trends have you seen in the growth of mobile data in the UAE, and what percentage of total revenue does mobile data comprise at the moment?</h4><p>Today, data revenues represent about 15% of our revenues. I expect that in the coming five years it will exceed 30% or 40%. Less than 20 years ago, mobile telecommunications empowered the concept of mobility that transformed completely almost everything we do. Mobile data and broadband capabilities added a completely new dimension. It came with incredible power; the power of the internet, the power of  new freedom, enjoyment, efficiency, and prosperity, especially in emerging economies. Now, we are contemplating the moment when, in just a few years, the number of mobile devices will be higher than the number of human beings on this planet. The internet itself was a breakthrough, and later gave birth to social networking. I strongly believe that being connected is a basic human right. It is an idea that I am passionate about.</p><h4>Broadband internet in the UAE is still working on becoming more competitive in terms of speed and cost. How do you see this evolving?</h4><p>In terms of speed, I think that broadband internet in the UAE is already very competitive. The UAE will probably be one of the first countries in the world to have fiber-optic cables running into all homes and offices. In terms of cost, things have evolved a lot, especially in the residential market over the last three years, driven by competition. However, fixed broadband for business probably needs some more attention. It is becoming increasingly competitive, though. All over the world, telecoms operators are looking at how to price it properly. I think that enterprise customers are willing to pay for a premium service. Capacity is going to become more vital. This is why we are going to spend billions investing in the right infrastructure.</p><h4>Looking at the UAE as a hub for potential innovation in the IT market, how is du leading the way?</h4><p>The idea of the UAE as a hub is a very important one. Things evolve, and depending on the pace of change, you feel the progress of evolution. The UAE first became a hub for goods and merchandise in this part of the world, helped along by the right infrastructure. It then began to transform into a hub for people through the creation of the right enablers: themed free zones, tourism, airport infrastructure, airlines such as Emirates, Etihad, and Air Arabia, as well as flydubai more recently. These developments are responsible for turning the UAE into a hub for capital inflow and investments. I am convinced that the next phase will see the UAE becoming a hub for the digital space. It is a natural step. This part of the world generally missed the industrial revolution of the previous two centuries. We did not create the infrastructure for big factories that could drive innovation—we were buying and using. I believe that the digital age is a great opportunity. It does not require all the infrastructure of factories and R&amp;D centers. Dubai, over the last 15 years, has been through a brainstorming process and put all the right aspects in place to attract investment flows. In the digital age, we have the opportunity to cement the UAE's place on the map. Awareness at the level of decision makers, policy makers, regulators, industrial leaders, and the community to incubate entrepreneurship could create the right ecosystem to continue attracting these flows in this digital space.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012 for du and the wider communications industry?</h4><p>I think that at the end of 2012 we will be a bigger, more profitable company that will be able to delight its customers a little more. We will continue to get better at attracting the best talent from across the UAE, and create more value for our shareholders. We will be able to play a bigger role in the construction of the telecoms sector, and play a little bit more of a role in the development of the economy of the UAE. We will do this with ambition and determination, but also with a lot of humility in this fast-changing  digital space.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Thirst for Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[thirst-for-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the business expanded since it was first established?<br></h4><p>Dubai Refreshments is over 50 years old, and we were one of the first industrial companies in the UAE. The company has the license from PepsiCo to manufacture and distribute products in Dubai and the Northern Emirates. Dubai Refreshments is a public shareholding company with over 100 shareholders. Generally, our shareholders do not sell their shares. Many of our investors have been with us since the very beginning, and our shareholders include many of the UAE's most well-known business families. We are outgrowing our current facilities, and we are anticipating a move to our new factory in 2013. Dubai has grown very rapidly, and our business has grown in the same way Dubai has.</p><h4>Do you produce a full range of Pepsi products?</h4><p>Dubai Refreshments has a contract with PepsiCo, one of the leading companies in the world with a large portfolio of food and beverages. The range of products that we produce depends on what the market needs. If there is significant demand, new products can be sourced from the PepsiCo portfolio for local launch, but this is done after a careful feasibility study. Our featured products from PepsiCo are carbonated beverages such as Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7-Up, Diet 7-Up, Mountain Dew, Miranda, and Shani, as well as products such as Aquafina and Lipton Iced Tea, which we import and distribute. We are also looking at a variety of other products that could potentially be distributed or manufactured in Dubai. In 2011, our turnover was about $270 million, and we are constantly seeking opportunities in the market. However, it is difficult for us to operate in small niche sectors. We are looking for categories where we can leverage our vast manufacturing and distribution capabilities.</p><h4>How have the prices of commodities such as sugar and plastic affected your operations?</h4><p>Although we managed to keep the price of Pepsi the same for more than 30 years, we were forced to increase it in 2011. This choice was driven largely by increases in commodity prices, particularly sugar. International sugar pricing is led by Brazil. The Brazilian economy has grown tremendously in the last 10 years, and the local currency became much stronger as a result, which has helped drive sugar prices to historically high levels. Sugar is a significant element in our total production costs. Other elements such as energy and basic metals are also witnessing cost increases. These factors have contributed to the rising cost structure, which we eventually had to recover.</p><h4>Where will your new operations be located?</h4><p>We have a plot of land in the Dubai Investment Park, which is roughly 1.4 million square feet in size. Our current facility only has about 18,000 square feet of space, so we are expecting a large improvement in space. This transition is driven by the future expected growth of the UAE and of Dubai Refreshments, as well as our desire to be able to continue providing our customers with quality service and to offer our employees a healthy working environment. The move is also based on our aim to enter new markets, which will require additional production facilities and logistics space. We are working to become a regional player, and we want to have the infrastructure that allows us to operate on a wider basis.</p><h4>How well placed are local FMCG companies in competing with global giants entering the market?</h4><p>People have grown up with Pepsi, one of the oldest and largest brands in the UAE. We have a large market share in the carbonated soft drinks category, and Pepsi-Cola is perceived as a local company with an international flavor. Few companies can match Dubai Refreshments in this regard, but we do see an evolution in the market, with many smaller producers becoming serious players. There were very few products in Dubai 20 years ago, with carbonated soft drinks dominating the beverage category. Today, there are hundreds of products including flavored water, juice drinks, sports drinks, flavored milks, and malt beverages. There are a multitude of flavors, packages, and different concentrations of juice content for each product. In today's market, the consumer has a wide range of choices and that is where we see competition. This variety of drinks led people to experiment with new products. We must evolve with the market if we want to continue to be successful.</p><h4>Have local consumer tastes changed over the past decade?</h4><p>Consumer tastes are evolving with people trying new varieties of beverages. Many consumers are cola drinkers that venture out into other categories once in a while. Around 20 years ago, consumers may have tried a different product three times every 10 times they purchased a beverage. Today, consumers are experimenting much more frequently and are trying products such as tea, juice, and flavored water drinks, simply because of their wide availability and variety.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Dubai in terms of your regional operations?<br></h4><p>Nestlé's first official presence in the Middle East was in 1934 in Lebanon. Since then, we have grown in the entire region, and we have opened operating companies in every country of the Middle East, with the exception of Yemen and Iraq. In these two countries we work with agents selling and distributing our products on our behalf. In 1997, we established our regional head office in the Middle East in Dubai. We currently focus our activities on 13 countries of the Middle East.</p><h4>In 2010 you opened a new factory in Dubai—a $136-million investment. What made Dubai the choice for such a large investment?</h4><p>There were many factors, including the ability to attract talent, the overall economic, political, and legal environment, and the existing infrastructure. It is indeed important that we are able to ship products across the region easily, bring in raw materials, and export finished products. We took into consideration other factors as well, such as schools for children of all ages and investment and tax incentives. In the end, Dubai was selected to build a NIDO plant, followed by a KIT KAT factory. The overall environment in the UAE has been very supportive, and our employees very much enjoy living in the UAE.</p><h4>In terms of retail and distribution, how would you characterize this market compared to others?</h4><p>We distinguish between three trade clusters in Middle East. The first includes countries like Qatar, the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait, where the top-10 retailers account for more than 50% of our sales. In this environment, business is much more skewed toward key accounts, supermarkets, and hypermarkets. In our second cluster, the top-10 retailers make up less than 30% of our business including countries like Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon. The third cluster consists of countries where the top-10 retailers account for less than 5% of our business with countries like Palestine, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The UAE are very much a part of what we call a developed trade environment, where key accounts, hypermarkets, supermarkets, typically Carrefour, Lulu, the Coop, and Spinneys represent the majority of our sales.</p><h4>What challenges are there for FMCG companies operating in this environment?</h4><p>There is one key issue; the fact that there is increasing price control activity by the UAE authorities. It is a real challenge, and to a certain extent it threatens Dubai's competitiveness in the future, both from a retail perspective and from an investment point of view as well. If a company is not free to price its products, decision makers will start to ask themselves if it is really the right place to invest. It can be a drawback and this is something that the UAE has to manage more carefully.</p><h4>What products and strategies are you implementing to lead the local market?</h4><p>We are gradually establishing what we call a “multi-tier portfolio" with products and brand propositions for different price points, from premium to popularly positioned products (PPPs). We are responding to the diverse needs of our consumers by adding more products in the premium and in the more affordable segment to our assortment as well. Recently, we have launched our MAGGI bouillon powder that is even more affordable than our MAGGI stock cube in countries such as Syria and Iraq. In addition, we have introduced NESCAFÉ 3in1 Matinal, a different blend, which is more affordable than our standard NESCAFÉ 3in1. In Syria, we have brought a variant of KIT KAT to the market that is smaller than in the rest of the region in order to reach a specific price point. In the premium segment, we have just launched NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto—a coffee machine with capsules—in the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait. NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto is the new way to have a coffee shop experience at home at a more affordable price. Two years ago, we introduced a range of premium soup called MAGGI Excellence, which has transformed our consumers' experience in terms of quality and convenience. NESCAFÉ Ready-to-Drink in cans is another successful product positioned more on the premium side. Our own factory in Dubai allowed us to re-launch KIT KAT last year with a taste that has been adapted to the preference of the Middle East consumers. We have a winning formula because we are manufacturing here, catering to the more specific needs of the region and using the latest technology available.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Currently, our production capacity is approximately 1.5 million tons, and we export our products to nearly 40 countries. Our primary markets are GCC countries with an additional focus on Iraq and the MENA region. For centuries, Dubai has been a strategic hub and trading point; it offered us an ideal location to build our refinery. Dubai also offers world-class infrastructure and gives us a unique advantage to interact and conduct business with various organizations and business interests from around the world.</p><h4>Have there been any recent changes to the source markets for importing sugar to the region?</h4><p>We are a value-added business. We import raw sugar predominantly from Brazil, and then use our facility here to produce a refined product that we export to the manufacturers of consumer products. We serve as a bridge between the raw producer and the consumer. We occasionally use suppliers from India when they produce a surplus. Our relationship is reciprocal. When Indian suppliers are short we sell back to them too. However, 60% of the world's raw sugar originates from Brazil, so it remains our primary supplier.</p><h4>What are your plans to expand the company?</h4><p>Our expansion plans are currently on hold as we are now in a market saturation stage. In basic terms, you can only produce as much as the market can consume. Therefore, our current focus is on optimizing production costs and improving our value-added services. We are additionally seeking to further develop our relationships with producers and consumers. In terms of new construction, we have built a new warehouse in Dubai with a storage capacity of 1.5 million tons in order to cope with fluctuations in the market and to increase our white sugar storage capacity to increase supply efficiency.</p><h4>What have been the major recent trends in the market?</h4><p>Sugar is not on the front line of food production. Sugar generally plays a supporting role based largely on consumer preferences. Lately, we have been producing various types of sugar to cater to different product line needs. Our clients range from food and beverage producers to cooked food to direct consumers. When we first commenced operations, our clients were 20% industrial and 80% consumers. Now, we have reached a stage where these figures are 40% and 60%, respectively. The industrial side of the business is growing rapidly, much faster than the direct consumers.</p><h4>What challenges is the industry currently facing?</h4><p>Sugar does not carry any duty or protection tariffs in this region, so whenever a manufacturer has excess sugar, this region is the place to dump it. Our business suffers from this trend, and our key strategy is to reduce our production costs. Currently, the major short-term challenge we face is an oversupply from India in the market. In the long-term, the challenge is to be more efficient and closer to our customers. It's absolutely crucial for us to identify trends and respond quickly. Anticipating consumer demand is vital.</p><h4>You have made some significant steps in implementing sustainable business practices. Why is this important to you?</h4><p>We desire to be as environmentally conscious as possible. The added benefit to us in implementing energy conserving measures is a continued reduction in our energy expenditures. This is a source of pride for us, as we currently consume only half the energy of similar manufacturers. Reducing energy costs is one effective technique for companies looking to reduce costs and maximize revenue potential.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the industry in 2012?</h4><p>Currently, we are assisting companies entering the market, and persuading them to use Dubai as a hub to implement value-added services in the food supply chain. Companies can efficiently import raw products, add value, and then re-export. We benefit by supplying sugar. Personally, I don't foresee any major trends in the sugar market in 2012. I think the trend will continue to be steady growth as food and beverage demand increases.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>IMCA represents some of the world's leading machinery brands in the Dominican Republic. How did it achieve this position?</h4><p>IMCA was founded in 1945, and the founders of the company wanted to help grow the country after the end of World War II. They opened IMCA with the idea of representing machinery that would help create infrastructure for the country, such as roads, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as grow the agriculture sector in order to feed Dominicans. Over the years, we have mainly provided services to the mining and construction industries. Caterpillar and John Deere also develop products that serve the agriculture market. As Caterpillar builds smaller machinery, we also work with local contractors to build apartments and houses in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How do you see the development of the mining industry in the country, and how significant is it to your business?</h4><p>In the last three years, mining has meant about 30% of our business. Around 30% of my employees are also directly linked to the mining sector in the Dominican Republic. Technology wise, miners are very strict with time utilization. We need to have well-trained technicians, which is why IMCA is the founder of a private initiative for technical education in the Dominican Republic. We have improved the overall level of the technicians, driven by the needs of the mining sector in the country. Most mining is carried out by Canadian companies in the Dominican Republic, and these companies also have operations in several countries around the world using international standards. In response, we have to align our level of services to worldwide standards. For the last three to four years, we have also incorporated IT into the products we provide.</p><div class="quote">“This is a country of 10 million people, and most of the infrastructure needs to be improved and adapted."</div><h4>How much has the company invested in these technical education programs?</h4><p>So far we have invested $2.5 million, and over the last five years alone we have allocated $1.2 million to train teachers and open chemistry, physics, and IT labs. IMCA has also provided technical material to help instructors teach these concepts in a contextual way. That is why we hired a company called Center for Occupational Research (CORD) from Waco, Texas. In the same technical school, we are providing this training to all students regardless of their specializations. This particular vocational school has seven specializations, but we only hire for the internal combustion specialization. For the internal combustion specialization, we made a $1.3 million investment by building a service shop inside the school. Now, when students come to work at IMCA, they have already practiced in a shop that is equal to the one we have here, with the same tools. On top of this $2.5 million investment, Caterpillar from the US donated 10 18-liter engines, a motograder, a backhoe loader, and an excavator. Before we hired graduates from this vocational school, it would take us 18 months to have them be able to perform world-class standard jobs in our company, but now it only takes us only three months.</p><h4>What are the latest technological solutions that IMCA has brought to the country?</h4><p>This is technology that is available worldwide, meaning satellite and GPS connectivity. Basically, you can perform prospecting on the place that you will mine. That prospecting is built into the equipment computer and into the hydraulics of the equipment. Rather than using a geologist to help the operator of the machinery, the machinery itself will display whatever needs to be excavated in red on a panel inside the tractor. When it turns green, the job is done. It is a more efficient process. That technology also helps notify the machinery administration when the machine is reaching maintenance time. Also, if there is an alarm on the machine for low fuel, low lubricant, or high temperature, it will also be sent to the laptop of the administrator. It will help in performing preventative maintenance on a piece of machinery, rather than repairing it after failure.</p><h4>Is the projected demand for other construction activities also growing?</h4><p>We have fantastic prospects for infrastructure. This is a country of 10 million people, and most of the infrastructure needs to be improved and adapted to the projected growth of the Dominican Republic. People think it is going to keep growing above 5% over the next decade. We also have Haiti right next to us, and we provide services and goods for at least 4 million Haitians. We send dairy products, agriculture products, plastic goods, and more. This is an economy that not only produces for the Dominican people, but also for at least 4 million Haitians and for another 5 million tourists that stay in the Dominican Republic for at least two weeks every year.</p><h4>Since last year, IMCA also sells machinery for the harvest of sugar cane. What are the prospects for this business line?</h4><p>CAMECO used to be a US-based company, and John Deere did not make any products for the sugar cane industry. It went out and purchased CAMECO, but the company is no longer called CAMECO, it is called John Deere Sugar Products. In the past, we were only selling wheel tractors to the sugar industry, but not harvesters or loaders. It is not a very big market compared to the total contribution of the rest of the markets that we serve. There are plenty of workers that still do some of the labor that is required in this industry by hand in the Dominican Republic. This is the reason why the mechanization sugar industry is not as it should be.</p><h4>What are IMCA's advantages for expansion in the region?</h4><p>We have a regional label on the company, as it provides services to both the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. Whatever we do is a standard in both countries. IMCA does not have a separate set of rules for each country. When we talk to Caterpillar, John Deere, Michelin, and Exxon-Mobil, we are clearly telling them that we want to have more territory in the region. That is the reason why we have the regional label. If we are going to be in Cuba, Puerto Rico, or Haiti, we will provide the same level of service that we provide today. Because of laws in the US, we cannot act as a dealer for certain products in Cuba. However, when it is clear that it is good to go, then we will pursue that market too.</p><h4>Why can the Dominican Republic be considered a natural market for the Michelin and BF Goodrich brands?</h4><p>In the Dominican Republic we have what we call natural markets, which means mining, construction, industry, commerce, and agriculture. It was a very good alignment to represent Michelin and BF Goodrich, because in the natural market they basically buy everything that we sell because of our credibility and the quality of the products. Michelin is number one and BF Goodrich is a company that is 100% owned by Michelin. The retail market is where we are really working on deepening our penetration of the market. In 2012 alone we have opened eight Michelin service centers. We run four of them, and the other four are concessions to independent companies. The automotive market has always been strong, but we also import double the amount of used vehicles. It is a growing market, and automotive dealers are very strong in the Dominican Republic. As soon as the buying power of the average Dominican grows, and the taxes are lowered, we are going to see more cars being sold. Since we have been representing Michelin over the last two years and BF Goodrich for the last year, we have a great deal of room to grow our market share.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Brazil has a special relationship with Mozambique. We are brotherly countries on account of historic and linguistic affinities that draw us close together. Today, both our governments seek economic development as a way to promote further social justice.</p><p>In recent years, Brazil stabilized its currency, restructured its finances, and—with the end of inflation—implemented additional measures to reduce social inequalities. We have achieved considerable success thus far. Through policies favoring revenue transfer—by means of the “Bolsa Famí­lia" program—35 million people were raised out of poverty. A new middle class flourished and began to spend more. This compelled national industry to increase production to the same extent. A virtuous cycle was created in which social investment brought along positive economic results as widespread national wealth increased.</p><div class="quote">“Brazilian technical cooperation is brought to other countries with the aim of sharing experience and improving the quality of life."</div><p>That sense of domestic justice also pervades our action in other countries—after all, we should all be entitled to prosper and advance. Benefits ought to be mutual. Cooperation with Mozambique is conceived with this vision and sense of purpose. Our investment model focuses on its people and on the legacy to be left to the country. For example, the activity of the Brazilian company Vale at the Moatize coalmine is an eloquent example of such a beneficial type of cooperation. Indeed, another 35 companies explore ore in that region. Yet a differentiating factor of Brazilian mining is its investment in local human resources. Brazil and Mozambique are bound by the same language, which makes it easier to train workers in that sector. Vale has been investing in crucial infrastructure, particularly in establishing and expanding the railway to Nacala Port. There are billions of dollars at stake. The greatest gain, however, is that Brazil is getting even closer to Mozambique as we jointly plan solutions for the future development of our countries. For that reason, we encourage private entrepreneurship to provide investment in farming production and raise cattle nearby the premises of the railroad up to Nacala.</p><p>The Nacala Fund, a private initiative launched in July 2012 during my visit to the country, is geared toward attracting resources to finance food production projects. Brazil has come a long way to master some of those techniques. We were able to develop cultures adapted to the typical climate and soil of central Brazil. The Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa) has been responsible for producing crops in the Brazilian savannah—an area with considerable similarities to the African savannah. The cerrado is where the largest agricultural production currently takes place in Brazil—a region blessed by record harvests and exports. Likewise, Embrapa is assisting Mozambique in cultivating seed species adapted to that specific environment.</p><p>Enduring economic development does require constant evaluation and commitment to improvement with social awareness. Investments and economic projects should be the result of joint effort and partnership—always placing human needs at the heart of such endeavors. These actions should thus attempt to solve down-to-earth problems. Today, Africa is afflicted by AIDS. That is why the Brazilian government is engaged in sharing knowledge about antiretroviral medication production with other countries.</p><p>I was honored to witness the beginning of activities of the first factory for such medicines on the African continent based on Brazilian technology transfer and located in Mapula next to Maputo. By 2013 Mozambique will hopefully have the means to produce antiretroviral medicines. This factory is what might best symbolize the close cooperation between Brazil and Mozambique.</p><p>Motivated by such cooperative spirit, I foresee other inspiring projects within the framework of increased partnership. Nowadays, Brazilian technical cooperation is brought to other countries with the aim of sharing experience and improving the quality of life. Brazil has shown how to exert increasing influence in today's world mainly relying on soft power and the strength of solidarity. One way of reducing disparities worldwide is by sharing knowledge and test-proven techniques with a view to enhanced food security, health, and socioeconomic prosperity on behalf of us all. Brazil and Mozambique have deepened their ties and strengthened common action, which will benefit not only their own populations but also the spirit of cooperation underlying relations among members of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>afza was established in 1985 and is one of the world's fastest-growing free zones. What is the background of its development over the last quarter of a century?<br></h4><p>The vision behind the creation of Jafza, the brainchild of the Dubai government, was to develop a leading industrial, warehousing, and distribution hub in the Middle East. The initiative was aimed at boosting Dubai's plan for economic diversification and improving the traffic of associated ports and airports. The free zone was created to be all embracing, and was designed to cater to all types of industries and business sectors. As an economy, we have always recognized the immense value of trade. Jafza officially opened in 1985 with land and standard size warehouses to provide ready-built facilities to customers, who were mostly engaged in trading activities. We started functioning in that year with 19 companies. By the 1990s, we expanded our facilities to cover industrial activities. The light industrial units (LIUs) were developed to cater to the manufacturing sector. In 2003, growing demand for industrial space from the chemical and food industry led to the development of the South Zone and hybrid clusters for these two industrial sectors. In the meantime, Jafza successfully developed and implemented a customer-focused service infrastructure and culture that concentrates on customer needs and requirements. Jafza's deep commitment to service excellence led to ISO 9001 certification in 1996, making it the world's first ISO-accredited free zone. We also pioneered the concept of a “one-stop shop" in the region. Today, Jafza offers a host of infrastructure facilities to new companies, ready-built warehouses, and LIUs on developed plots, all well supported with amenities such as food courts, pharmacies, hospitals, banks, on-site residential facilities, and much more. Through Economic Zones World, Jafza's parent company, clients have access to build-to-suit solutions (BTS), which are essentially custom-built logistics facilities that are also sustainable. We have taken the excellent infrastructure that Dubai has to offer—the port, air, and road network—and added significant value attracting thousands of global companies. Today we host over 6,700 world's finest companies, including 120 of the Global Fortune 500 enterprises.</p><h4>In 2011, Jafza won the Dubai Quality Award for Excellence. What have been the key factors leading to your success?</h4><p>Winning the prestigious Dubai Quality Award (DQA) for excellence demonstrates Jafza's commitment to best practices, something we have prioritized from the start. We received the DQA in 2003 as well, and we have undertaken a business process re-engineering exercise. Overall, our strong commitment to customer-oriented solutions, innovation, and the speed at which we execute new ideas are some of the reasons why we are one of the most favored investment destinations for companies interested in the region. Jafza has focused on two aspects that have worked as the free zone's biggest growth drivers, which are ease and cost of doing business.</p><h4>What contribution is Jafza currently making to Dubai's GDP? What growth do you forecast over the next year?</h4><p>Jafza has demonstrated consistency in its role as an important driver of the nation's economy. In 2010, companies based in Jafza generated trade amounting to AED233 billion, 25% of Dubai's total non-oil trade in the same year, which was AED902 billion. Over the past five years, Jafza has contributed to Dubai's GDP at over 20% on a year-to-year basis, accounted for more than 50% of Dubai's total exports and 40% of net FDI flow into the UAE, and sustained more than 135,000 jobs through its companies.</p><h4>Dubai is consistently applauded for its excellent infrastructure. How has Jafza enhanced technical capabilities through technological innovation and development?</h4><p>We have continuously been enhancing our IT infrastructure and introducing a host of value-added services. Today Jafza is one of the most e-friendly free zones with one of the highest customer e-adoption rates in the UAE. By 2012 we want the e-adoption rates to hit above 90%. Jafza has introduced a number of initiatives, including support services such as the e-license and e-lease programs as well as an online service for the payment of customer invoices, all geared to offer greater convenience. Our customer service facility is also one of the finest in the country. It underwent re-engineering a few years ago, designed after analyzing the services we offered and the customer experience of our clients. The facility includes an intelligent, custom-built queuing system, which, over almost a year of operation, has reduced the processing time of transactions by as much as 70%.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of new companies coming to operate within Jafza over the last year?</h4><p>In 2011, approximately 400 new companies joined Jafza, which included 40 leading multinationals such as ACE Hardware, AO Smith, Apollo Tyres, Baumer, Caterpillar, David Brown, Ford, Oracle, Pelican, MAN, and Stemcor Special Steels. Sector-wise, the largest chunk of new companies came from the machinery and equipment segment, followed by electronics, chemicals, building materials, and food. Region-wise, the largest number of new companies came from Europe, followed by the Asia Pacific, Middle East, and the Americas. The trend shows a growing focus on infrastructure development in the region and economic growth that has eventually driven demand for consumer goods.</p><h4>In what ways do you work with business councils around the world to enhance competitiveness and trade relations?</h4><p>We are proud to be supporting continued bilateral co-operation between the UAE and the world. Jafza has representatives, partners, and dedicated teams based in the UAE and overseas to target companies in developed as well as emerging economies across the world that are looking to expand their horizons. We continuously work closely with business councils and government institutions in different international markets, as well as Dubai-based organizations, on joint projects, road shows, and seminars to target various sectors to stimulate investments.</p><h4>What key projects do you currently have in the pipeline?</h4><p>The development of the Jafza South Zone has been dramatic since 2003, with its world-class warehouses and other amenities. We are still working on expanding and adding more facilities to provide a better value proposition for our customers. Under construction is the ambitious $600 million convention center complex, which will be equipped with exhibition halls, an auditorium, banquet hall, meeting and conference rooms, a hotel, world-class recreational and retail provisions, and many other business-friendly facilities.</p><h4>The Dubai government has announced a commitment to the development of sustainable business operations. How is Jafza contributing to sustainable development?</h4><p>We are certainly seeing a shift toward sustainability across industries and businesses in the UAE. Jafza on is increasingly focused on sustainability. It is now mandatory for all developments to follow Trakhees' green building standards in the free zone, and Trakhees' EHS rules are part of Jafza's standard contract documents. With regards to its new customer projects, Jafza is fully committed to incorporate sustainability features that fully comply with the US Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED rating system. Our subsidiary is Gazeley, a global provider of sustainable logistics space. The company has recently delivered a 65,000 sqm state-of-the-art and environmentally efficient logistics facility to CEVA Logistics, one of the world's leading supply chain management companies in Jafza. The facility has achieved LEED Gold certification, and is the first project in the UAE to gain this recognition. Jafza actively manages utility usage to ensure a minimal impact on the environment. It is also mandatory for the service providers to ensure that waste (paper, plastics, cans, etc) is reduced and recycled. We have introduced a CSR policy manual in Jafza that ties in with the company's policy of integrating CSR into its overall business model and honoring its social and environmental obligations.</p><h4>What was your experience like during the global liquidity crisis, and what lessons were learned during that period?</h4><p>There were definitely lessons learned during the crisis. Customers sought more value during the crisis for their investment, and we continued to build on our customer-centric model to deliver that—whether through infrastructure, more commercial options, flexible terms for building, value-added products, or services. Our agility and customer focus during the downturn has been the key reason that has kept Jafza growing since 2009, in both customer base and revenues. I believe that investor confidence in the UAE is returning. Dubai is a reliable business hub and despite everything, the Emirate has maintained its popularity as a business destination. The UAE economy has bounced back from a slowdown and is on track to grow 4.5% in 2012, driven by the oil and non-oil sectors.</p><h4>As the sole regulatory body governing businesses operating within Jafza, would you say there are any further regulatory developments needed to ease the process of doing business?</h4><p>Regulatory development is an ongoing process. The processes we have today are more efficient and investor-friendly than in the past. Yes, there is always room for enhancement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[in-the-zone]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZ)?<br></h4><p>The government established DAFZ 15 years ago within the boundaries of the airport. The nature of many businesses operating within Dubai called for an airport free zone, and the success of Jebel Ali, the first free zone in the region, prompted the establishment of DAFZ. The free zone was essentially an economic project that was designed to attract companies that add value to the market. Our focus has been on the contribution of the free zone to GDP, as well as supporting the export and re-export process from Dubai to the region and the world. Today, DAFZ contributes around 2.2% to GDP, which is almost $1.6 billion. We have nearly 1,500 companies and 12,000 employees operating within the free zone. Although we naturally aim to increase the number of businesses operating in DAFZ, our main focus is on quality, and in terms of industrial classifications, most of our companies are in Category A. Some examples of our luxury retailers include Cartier, Clarins, Mont Blanc, and Chanel. In the aviation industry we have Airbus, Boeing, and Rolls-Royce. Logistics giants UPS and FedEx also operate from here.</p><h4>How has the free zone developed over recent years?</h4><p>Originally, the Dubai Civil Aviation controlled the free zone, until the government issued a decree stating that DAFZ would be independent. After the decree, business began to grow rapidly, and we started to see approximately 100 new companies join annually. According to a study conducted in 2010 by FDI Magazine, we are ranked as the second largest free zone in the world, in terms of success. In 2012 we aim to reach number one. Achieving success drives us to improve and maintain our position at the top, and we intend to rise to the challenge of being one of the world's leading free zones. Our marketing team makes a great effort to attract companies to DAFZ, but the real challenge is to retain those companies. We foster retention by providing excellent services and facilities. Listening to feedback, really taking on board requests, and communicating bilaterally are essential to customer satisfaction. Naturally we cannot implement every suggestion, but many of our developments over the years have directly resulted from feedback we have been given, and that is a testament to our commitment to our customers. We meet with a selection of company representatives on a monthly basis to discuss concerns and encourage open dialogue to enable us to provide the best service. Dealing successfully with foreign investors is of paramount importance because they are essential to our operations, and we constantly work to improve FDI regulations.</p><h4>Do you plan to replicate the DAFZ model globally?</h4><p>With 15 years of experience, I strongly believe that we have the expertise to replicate our success in other locations. The free zone authority has been approached to launch free zones abroad, but as a policy we have decided not to invest in free zones outside of Dubai. However, that is not to say that we will not operate external free zones from a management perspective. In that instance, we will examine the political situation in the proposed countries, as well as the economy, culture, and facilities. We are striving toward being an exemplar free zone and are happy to share our experience with our contemporaries around the world. Enquires come regularly from Africa, Asia, and Europe, and there is certainly a chance that we will begin operations abroad.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of the companies that are attracted to DAFZ as an operational hub?</h4><p>We have companies from all over the world operating here, but the majority historically have come from the US and Europe. Recently, we have been excited to see that the number of companies from Asia—Japan in particular—have started increasing. Our focus has been on attracting big global brands; however, there are also many valuable companies from the Middle East, and we wish to attract those also. In terms of core operations, many different stages of product development, including distribution, consultancy, marketing, R&amp;D, packing, and assembly are represented within the free zone. We accept all categories of business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[View on the Horizon]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[view-on-the-horizon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the motivation behind the establishment of Trakhees?</h4><p>Trakhees is an Arabic word that means “permits." Trakhees was established by the Ports, Customs, and Free Zone Corporation (PCFC) in 2008 following the decree issued by HH The Ruler of Dubai with the aim of integrating licensing and regulatory compliance functions within special development zones in Dubai. Trakhees was established with an objective to handle all commercial licensing, construction and environmental permit requirements of the stakeholders and investors, to ensure community compliance within the applicable development projects.</p><h4>Where is the main focus of your work?</h4><p>We operate through three main divisions: the Civil Engineering Division (CED), the Environmental Health and Safety Division (EHS), and the Commercial Licensing Division (CLD). Prior to the formation of Trakhees, CED and EHS were traditionally supporting the development and regulatory functions for Dubai Ports, Jebel Ali Free (Jafza), Nakheel, and other developments under the umbrella of Dubai World. The CED is primarily responsible for regulating construction activities within the Special Development Zones (SDZs), which involves approvals of master plans, development control regulations, building and modification proposal reviews, and related permits. The CLD governs and undertakes the issuance of commercial licensing and governmental services to retail and commercial establishments within its jurisdiction. EHS controls, regulates and enforces rules and regulations related to all aspects of environment, health, safety, and fire protection for all ongoing and completed construction projects, supervising the ports and maritime industry projects in addition to assuring food safety and community compliance. Concession agreements are in place with Jafza, DP World, Port Rashid, and Hamriya Port.</p><h4>How would you characterize the recent progression of the private development market?</h4><p>We consider 2009 our baseline year; we do not incorporate data from the period before the recession, as the market was behaving erratically. In 2011, many new projects were developed, especially from Nakheel. I also believe that there are many promising projects at the conceptual stage. Our figures and market monitoring confirm over 10% growth when comparing 2011 to 2010. In the second quarter of 2012, we expect double-digit growth. Recently launched projects are reliable indicators that the market is picking up.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Trakhees Accreditation Program?</h4><p>The accreditation program accredits Private Client Fiduciary Services (PCFS) businesses and covers all areas from building and construction to food safety. We have released a number of detailed guidelines and code books covering all accredited areas. For a successful project, the consultant and contractor must meet the established criteria. The accreditation program was initiated to ensure the quality and performance of both design and construction in all projects under its jurisdiction. These programs are designed to move the processes from quality control to quality assurance and for accredited personnel to be well versed in the contents of the regulations so as to help them comply with the authority's requirements. This will ensure a smooth interaction that will lead to better communication and speedy construction, which would also avoid any consequences arising from violating the Authority's rules and regulations. Certificates and accreditation ID cards are issued to the participants based on certain requirements, and the companies understand our process and procedures, which in-turn greatly eases the processional relationship. Other governing authorities in the region have initiated numerous process improvement efforts and initiatives, which actually began with Trakhees.</p><h4>What do you hope to bring to your new role from your previous work with DP World?</h4><p>I had the opportunity to refine several processes here, and improvement is my priority. In the past I have dealt with the ports and shipping industry and the current line of profession with no major difference in strategy, wherein people who work in the operations are decision makers as well. I am proud of my membership in DP World and the experience I obtained at the company. My expertise is in process engineering, and currently as CEO of Trakhees, I have been meeting with key stakeholders, requesting feedback, and refining our processes to meet customer needs effectively.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the recent geopolitical and global economic events affected your operations?<br></h4><p>With the economic crisis in 2008, followed by the global recession, and recently the Arab Spring, our businesses have been affected. The financial crisis has delayed our plans for expansion. Most countries that experienced the Arab Spring are our business partners, and we have projects in Libya, Yemen, Syria, and Egypt that have been adversely affected over the last three years.  However, Dubai Investments has managed to remain profitable with a high level of liquidity, and we have been able to pay dividends to our shareholders. Even though it has taken a toll on our businesses, I think we have managed to remain robust.</p><h4>What were some of the key strategies you applied to weather the financial storm?</h4><p>As an investment company, we always have 30% of our investments available to us in liquid form, which we can tap into if the need arises. This has helped us wade through the financial storms, even when several banks shut down and tried to get help from the government instead of receiving a bail out from the private sector.  We command a unique position among other companies that have built their strategies on leverage because at Dubai Investments we have very low leverage ratios. All of our investments are managed conservatively. Now, the situation has reversed and the banks are slowly but steadily opening up. We hope that if we can get that rolling, we will be able to boost our liquidity by investing in some companies in our portfolio.</p><h4>What are some of your key future targets on the investment side?</h4><p>We have already started to go back to an open business model. We have borrowed around $200 million, and we are working on borrowing another $350 million to cope with our expansion. We are back in the market. We are returning to our strategy of acquiring new companies, and we have investors who are interested in investing in our portfolio. Additionally, we are performing evaluations and due diligence studies so as to possibly exit from the mature companies in our portfolio. In 2012-2013, we will be back to normal business practices, especially with the Arab Spring more or less settled down. There are still a few countries where the political climate is grim, and we have taken that into account. Also, Dubai's economy has given us some positive signs and has demonstrated positive trends. The real estate market is recovering and the banks are funding companies and projects. Most companies have solid business plans that are focused on business prospects as opposed to speculation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Dubai Investments Park?</h4><p>The park is one of our most successful projects and has already reached capacity. There are not many opportunities for companies to come in and just lease land. However, if customers have not been able to deliver on their promises or deliver on their lease agreements, the space can be reassigned to other clients. We have been very active over the last year to develop our own activities in the park. For example, we have just completed Phase I of a logistics project in the park. It cost around $80 million and has already been developed and leased. Around 10%-15% of Phase II has also been completed. I think by the middle of 2013 this project will have been completed and leased out. We have built a hospital and leased it to a third party at a cost of around $25 million. We have developed major supermarkets and entered into a 20-year lease with Carrefour. We are also thinking of replicating the park somewhere else and have already received invitations from Libya and Iraq. We are now developing something similar on a smaller scale in Fujairah. We will use our expertise, business plans, and networking tools to build similar facilities in other locations. Some of our clients here have already indicated that if we build another park in another location, they would be happy to invest.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012 for Dubai Investments and the wider economy?</h4><p>We can see now positive trends from all sectors of the economy, especially from manufacturing exports to other countries. On many occasions, even countries facing political upheaval have invited us to attend conferences and meetings, besides requesting us to come back with our business plans. We are now in the process of setting up agencies and representative offices in various countries, while our sales force is working hard to increase our market share in these countries. We already see positive financial rewards in the first quarter of 2012, and if the trend continues we are on the right track.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[commodities-are-forever]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) established?<br></h4><p>The DMCC was created in 2002 by the government to stimulate the flow of commodity trade through the Emirate. To achieve this, we were granted 200 hectares of empty land to develop in any way we pleased. After thorough market reviews, the Executive Chairman, Ahmed Bin Sulayem, decided to create a mixed-use free trade zone as a way of stimulating the physical presence of commodities. Ten years ago, when DMCC was conceptualized, this entire area was arid desert. Today, it is known as Jumeirah Lakes Towers (JLT) Free Zone and is a vibrant city within a city, where 50,000 people live and work in 61 towers. However, JLT is not just a property development or a community, it's actually the fastest growing free zone in the UAE. DMCC has developed significantly from its original remit and is both the master developer and licensing authority for the JLT Free Zone, as well as the region's leading commodities authority.</p><h4>How successfully has the trading hub been established?</h4><p>In terms of fulfilling our mandate, we are the region's only dedicated commodities marketplace. DMCC has become the diamond trading center for the region, and despite being such a young country, we are now among the top three diamond centers in the world. Just one example of how we have impacted the diamond industry is in the trade statistics. Before DMCC was created, the value of the diamond trade was just $5 million annually. In 2011, the value of the diamond trade was $41 billion. The previous year it was $35 billion. And for gold, another important commodity that we facilitate the trade of, has seen its traded value grow to $56 billion in 2011. We've achieved this by providing commodity companies with relevant physical infrastructure, products, services and facilities that enable them to operate at a world class level. A gold or diamond company, for example, is able to set up a business with us, buy or lease office space in the free zone, store its goods in our state-of-the-art vaults, use our boiling, polishing, refining or certification services and trade goods on our platforms. They are also able to meet with industry peers and share best practices with other industry players through our conferences, forums, and networking clubs. In terms of numbers, we have brought over 4,600 companies to the free zone over the past decade. In 2010, we registered 725 new companies, and in 2011 almost 1,400. In 2012, between January and June we had 1,000 new businesses join us. We attract around 180 companies every month, and of the companies that join us, around 85% of them are new to Dubai and many chose the JLT Free Zone as their regional base.</p><h4>Does JLT differ from other free zones in any way?</h4><p>Companies choose the JLT Free Zone because there is an availability of freehold and leasehold real estate, it is well located between two metro stations, close to the airport, as well as within reasonable commuting distance of the capital, and we are also in the middle of a large residential area with over 30,000 residents. Like all free zones in the UAE, there is no corporate tax for 50 years and 100% ownership of the business. However, as JLT is a mixed-use free zone, almost all business activities can be licensed here, which leads us to have a variety of companies ranging from retail outlets, hospitality, and IT, to marketing, consultancies, medical facilities, and of course, commodities companies. This gives us a clear advantage over free zones that only license a specific business activity. Being the region's leading commodities authority, we are clearly the natural choice for any commodities company. This is underlined by a clustering effect that various industry segments have followed. For example, we have over 600 diamond companies here. But we see the clustering effect also in areas such as petrochemicals, gold, and tea. The specifically created physical infrastructure we offer is an important contributing factor in this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Why did the IFC choose Dubai?<br></h4><p>Dubai is our second largest office in the MENA region—our largest office, which is also our regional hub, is in Cairo. We opened our office here in 2005 with the goal of building relationships and encouraging investors from the GCC who had outgrown their home markets to invest in the less developed countries of the MENA and Africa regions and beyond. Our role is to identify potential clients, build relationships with them, and invest alongside them in those less developed economies. Many of these investors have never invested outside of the GCC before, and they need a partner who can take the risk and invest alongside them in these riskier markets. The whole idea has worked extremely well. Over the past nine years, we have mobilized about $3.5 billion in the form of South-South investment from the GCC. We also do some small interventions in the GCC—mainly in projects that are highly developmental. We also aim to make it easier for SMEs to access credit. To borrow money, you need to pledge assets as collateral. Unfortunately, in the UAE, there is no asset registry, which means that only fixed assets such as buildings or property can be used. An asset registry—something that exists  already in most developed countries—would allow SMEs to use moveable assets, like equipment, as collateral. If we can develop this system and make it easier for SMEs to access credit, then SMEs will be able to grow and create more jobs.</p><h4>What recent strides have been made in the development of the housing finance market?</h4><p>The housing finance market is still very underdeveloped compared to other regions, but it has made progress. Mortgage finance has two main parts. The first part is just banks lending to consumers to buy a home. This part of the market has really begun to develop in the UAE—much more than other places in the GCC. However, banks cannot lend money this way indefinitely. After a while, they reach capacity and they need to sell off these loans so they can continue to expand their mortgage portfolios. This is the second part of mortgage finance, the secondary mortgage market, and it has yet to fully develop in the UAE, which limits the ability of banks to continue lending. We worked on a transaction to jumpstart the secondary mortgage market with a company called Emirates National Securitization Company (ENSeC). In 2007, we invested in the first Islamic securitization, providing $20 million in financing. Unfortunately, this happened right before the financial crisis, so the whole idea of mortgage-backed securities never took off. It is a market that still needs to be developed if we want to increase home ownership in the GCC.</p><h4>What are the main hurdles facing the development of the local capital markets?</h4><p>Local capital markets in the UAE are very underdeveloped. Most companies still depend on banks for financing, but banks usually cannot provide long-term finance, which means that companies are often forced to take short-term loans when they really need long-term loans. Companies with no experience in the capital markets are reluctant to enter on their own. This hinders growth in the region.</p><h4>Do you think the UAE has the potential to become a hub for green financing?</h4><p>I think Dubai certainly has the capacity to become a hub in the region for green financing. At one point, there was an initiative in Abu Dhabi to move in that direction, which proved that it can be done, but the whole green financing initiative has been progressing more slowly than everyone would like. Dubai has the geographical base, the legal structure, and the presence of international organizations to make it happen. I can't think of any other place in the region with that capacity. We are extremely supportive of this, and whenever we lend, we always try to include an element of sustainability. In Lebanon we developed a system to “score" buildings on sustainability and encourage our clients their to include “green renovations" as part of their investments. We are always interested in projects that will contribute to energy efficiency, waste management, and other sustainability issues in the GCC. If there is a transaction that includes those elements, we will take part directly or indirectly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[focused-on-a-vision]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Abraaj Capital is the only private equity group in the global top 50 with operations based outside of Europe or the US. What has been the driving force behind the success of your operations?<br></h4><p>We owe our success largely to our focus and persistence throughout our 10-year history. We have a strong commitment to the region, and beyond that, to high growth markets in general. Very early on, we recognized the entire region as a source of opportunity. When the firm was established, we identified the Middle East as a region with an interesting demographic and growth profile and saw that the corresponding opportunity for investment would be tremendous. By focusing on that vision and building teams ahead of time, we have been able to grow the business steadily.</p><h4>What did the acquisition of London-based Aureos capital bring to the group?</h4><p>This merger accelerated a plan that was already in place, which was to leverage the regional growth that we experienced by being based in MENASA. Five or six years ago, we expanded to Turkey and have experienced huge success there. A year ago, we targeted Southeast Asia and set up an office in Singapore. Leveraging the experience within the teams that we have in place as well as our understanding of helping businesses grow has been a core focus for us, and we have gradually been expanding the target investment geography. Our focus is on growth markets, and we are on a deliberate path to increasingly look at Asia and Africa, as well as other growth markets. The Aureos Capital acquisition provided the acceleration of that footprint in a very rapid manner, as it had been investing for 10 years in SMEs across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</p><h4>The healthcare sector has played a strategic role in Abraaj Capital's investments. What makes this sector so attractive?</h4><p>Health care is a sector with massive growth potential, and one we find to be extremely interesting. We have exposure to multiple aspects of the sector, from pharmaceutical retail to hospitals, medical labs, and everything in between. If you look at the demographics of growth markets, they are very underserved and underinvested in terms of health care across the board, especially in the MENA region. They are underserved right through from hospital beds, diagnostic labs, and infrastructure. Locally, health care has become one of the key priorities of the government. There is significant investment potential, especially for public-private partnerships (PPPs). It's a space that provides opportunities at different levels and is largely counter-cyclical.</p><h4>Why was it the right time to divest your interest in Turkish hospital group Acıbadem?</h4><p>We invested in Acıbadem in 2008 at the peak of the boom, and during the four-five years that we held it, which were probably some of the most challenging in recent history, the business more than tripled in size in terms of profitability along a number of other metrics, including creating more than 5,000 jobs. The number of hospitals within the group also increased from six to 13, which proves that even in times of financial uncertainty and challenging environments, the sector continues to grow. There is a natural holding period for us, however. We go into an investment with a clear view on delivering support and value to the existing shareholder, entrepreneurs, and principals, in order to take the business to the next level. We ultimately aim to deliver returns to our investors, and so at some point we have to exit and seek opportunities elsewhere. However, we believe that the opportunities for the group remain strong, and that is why we continue to invest and have remained a shareholder in the holding company, IHH Healthcare Berhad.</p><h4>What opportunities has the shifting political landscape in the Middle East created for investors with capital to deploy?</h4><p>There has been a significant short-term impact in terms of uncertainty. However, if you look at how events unfold, what it ultimately results in is increased awareness of key issues that need to be addressed. In the long term, this thinking will take on a positive acceleration, and the countries involved will begin to build a much stronger economic base. Some of these countries had been growing economically at a phenomenal pace; however, in some cases they lacked sufficient focus on a more inclusive and sustainable growth model. In the short term, we will see slightly slower growth rates, but on more solid and strong foundations. For investors who are looking long term, they will find good fundamental local businesses looking for partners to drive future growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-minority-man]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the extent of your asset management portfolio?<br></h4><p>With the global economic crisis and its impact on the region and Dubai especially, most of our focus has moved toward management. In Dubai we own stakes in a contracting company, a media advertising company, a jack-up drilling rig, an oil field services company (which we recently sold), and we also had operations in Damas, which was exited at the time of its IPO in 2008. With all of our portfolios we aim to enhance the value of the company by being an active member on the board and the various committees, most importantly the executive committee. Within this role, we work with portfolio companies through improving corporate governance, reporting standards, and putting in place the key strategy plans for the company's growth. Amwal also acts as the financial advisor to the portfolio companies by optimizing the balance sheets and the finances of the company, advising and searching for potential M&amp;A opportunities, leveraging our network to open up new markets, and introducing our clients to our banking relationships. Over the past six months, with the way the market has been improving in Dubai, we are starting to go back into sourcing mode, in which we are looking for companies to start investing in. At the same time we continue to enhance the value of our portfolio companies and to look for potential exits.</p><h4>How have your funds been performing from an exiting perspective?</h4><p>We have two funds under management, and they have been performing well. We are in the process of doing an IPO for a travel agency in Riyadh, which will be one of the best transactions we have seen in the area. Hopefully, we will have another exit sometime this year. Saudi Arabian companies have generally been doing very well. In many cases, Egypt has not been as badly hit as you might expect. However, the current political instability is putting transactions and activity on hold, though overall the performance of many of our portfolio companies there has been holding up well.</p><h4>The investment approach at Amwal is to take a minority interest in companies and not to use leverage. Why do you take this approach?</h4><p>The reason for that is very simple, and that is how we look at the region. The vast majority of businesses in the region are family owned, and they generally do not want to relinquish control. What they are looking for is somebody who can come in and help them with institutionalizing the company, put in place the correct corporate governance, and help them with the transition to the next generation, especially for companies displaying fast growth figures that suddenly need a set of skills they did not need before. We therefore generally take minority stakes and invest our energy in companies that already have the right management in place. As such, we “invest in" as opposed to “buy out" companies.</p><h4>Looking to the local capital markets, what do you think are the main challenges facing its further development?</h4><p>Dubai has grown at a very fast pace, and what we find today is that while the growth is going at a high pace, the soft infrastructure has not had time to catch up. It started to catch up recently because of the slowdown in the economy, but it still has a way to go. The authorities have put into operation the appropriate systems and infrastructure in terms of capital markets, as well as developed a solid regulatory framework. However, not everything has been tested. For example, what happens under bankruptcy? How are minority investor rights protected, and how easily can a contract be applied and enforced? Such issues are critical in terms of giving you comfort as an investor in the country. Secondly, retail investors have generally driven the markets here, and that still continues to be the case. Around 80% or 90% of Saudi Arabia's market is retail. Dubai has been picking up on volume and moved up to about $200 million a day, which is a good amount of trading volume as compared to levels of around $20 million a day during the past few years. This is critical for companies looking at the exchange, because you need to see liquidity. New liquidity would most likely bring down the price. We want to see good volumes to really reflect a more accurate picture of the value of the company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Savings on Both Sides]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[savings-on-both-sides]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How fundamental is the department's role to the Dubai Strategic Plan?</h4><p>Our role is to make sure that we provide the necessary financial resources to ensure that we are meeting the requirements of the wider plan. For example, the development of infrastructure required the development of the transport sector, for which the main project was the Dubai Metro. We had to ensure there were available resources, and that was done successfully. Even though the metro launch was in September 2009, the peak of the financial crisis, we managed successfully to support it. Similarly, we are also supporting the social side. For example, there is a housing project where a few of the projects were also commissioned during the crisis and launched by His Highness. Similarly, in the financial services sector, there were some concerns about meeting some certain obligations during the crisis. The government was also there to make sure necessary support was given. We always work closely with the other government entities to make sure they have the necessary resources to achieve the requirements of the strategic plan.</p><h4>In 2009 you established the Dubai Fund for Financial Support, which was in the middle of the crisis. What was the strategy behind the creation of the fund?</h4><p>The idea was just to support government-related entities (GREs) and also some of the strategic projects of the state to ensure there was no negative impact on these projects. We try to make sure they are able to meet their short-term obligations. Some of the GREs are in charge of very important strategic projects for the government. For example, Dubai World is in charge of DP World, which is a global port operator. Our role was to stand by and give the necessary financial support. Now, the GREs are able to manage the challenges on their own with the improved business conditions. Recently, we have seen that many of them have taken the initiative to restructure their debts and also start new projects successfully.</p><h4>How confident are you that the successful restructuring of two-thirds of Dubai's debt will pave the way for upward growth?</h4><p>The debt restructuring was mainly done because the GREs had a mismatch between their short-term borrowing and their long-term projects, which meant they would not be able to meet their obligations. The restructuring allowed them to have a longer time period for the repayment of their debts that would match with their projects, which are mostly in the real estate sector, where recovery takes a long time. Most of the major restructuring has already been done successfully, with the participation of all the major creditors. The smaller GREs are progressing very well also.</p><h4>You have established the Support Services Center. How successful has that been since it was established?</h4><p>The Support Services Center is progressing very well. The idea behind it is that it is like an incubator for new entities, to give them the right support rather than waiting on them to develop support services when they have the duty to do the core business that they should be doing. The focus on the support is being taken care of. However, with the successful progress of the center, we find many of the new entities prefer to continue with the support services even after they are well established. And the newcomers of already established entities want to join the Support Services Center. That's how both sides act. There are savings on the budget side, giving them more time to focus on their core business rather than the support.</p><h4>What positive indicators are there that the Dubai economy is back on track after the global liquidity crisis?</h4><p>If we first identify the main sectors in the Dubai economy, we find sectors such as logistics, trade, tourism, and aviation. If we review the performance of these sectors from 2007 until now, we find the performance of these sectors has been very good. There is no concern about the main sectors of the Dubai economy. The main issue is with the real estate sector, which was a newcomer to activities in Dubai at the beginning of 2007. Now, this sector is recovering. The real estate cycle usually takes a longer period for recovery, but otherwise we are very optimistic about the near- and long-term future of the main sectors of the Dubai economy. For example, with the aviation sector, the government has approved a strategy that would require the expansion of some infrastructure. We have been working with the airport authorities to make sure the required financial resources are there to meet the requirements of the expansion. If you pass by the airport you can see the work in progress there. The tourism sector has also been performing very well this year and over 2011. Dubai has been successful in attracting tourists, who used to go to other destinations, but because of what they call the Arab Spring, not surprisingly their first choice is now Dubai. We have seen hotel occupancy reach very high numbers. We used to have very quiet summers, but last year was very busy, and hotel occupancy reached record levels, so we are optimistic. The government is also giving the necessary support to the main sectors to progress well and support the economy and the strategies of the government.</p><h4>How do you prioritize fund allocation?</h4><p>It all depends on the requirements of the strategy. The Road and Transport Authority (RTA), which is tasked to look after all transport infrastructure projects created through the government, is one example. There are some key projects that require allocations that would be given priority over other projects, and that would apply also to other projects in the municipality, like the sewage plant; it comes to prioritizing the allocation. The Dubai municipality has a second sewage plant that was just commissioned. That was one of the top priorities because of the increasing volumes being sent to the existing sewage plant, which was the only one in Dubai. We work closely with all of the government departments and we don't develop the budget and allocation on our own. Once all the information has been gathered and the discussion has taken place, the summary is presented to the Supreme Committee, which is the final authority prior to presenting it to His Highness. The Supreme Fiscal Committee (SFC) will help us in finalizing the allocation between the government departments to ensure that it is consistent with the strategy.</p><h4>What about the development of the local capital markets?</h4><p>I think global markets require transparency, with more and more up-to-date information. The region has not been that active in capital markets in the past, so it will take time for the region to adapt to the requirements of the capital markets or the international investor for receiving transparent up-to-date information. We have been working on this and we have been successful. Through road shows and face-to-face meetings we have made a difference. I think the next stage is to try to make online information available to investors. I think that would be a step forward. We are working all the time to improve the quality and timing of the information, but it takes time to gather information from different sources and stakeholders. We have been successful in developing the capital markets in Dubai. After Dubai entered the capital markets, we had very successful issues in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Our plan is to improve communications with the investors in sukuks and bonds through road shows and face-to-face meetings.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the key role of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and how has that role evolved since it was originally created?</h4><p>The DIFC was created to bridge the gap between the financial centers of London and Hong Kong. This jurisdictional gap is a significant region of about 42 countries spanning a wide geographical scope. However, it also has a lot of potential in terms of wealth in individuals, institutions, and investment companies that are able to invest in new infrastructure and are excited about these opportunities. These factors were in place, but what was missing was a sound international financial center to centralize the wealth and facilitate business, and so the DIFC was established in 2004. In order to be at the level of power of other international centers, we had to get several aspects of the model right—specifically infrastructure, because we cannot simply be a free trade zone. The entire eco-system has to match other leading centers, and that predominantly lies in the soft infrastructure such as laws, regulations, and judicial authority. We have seen growth because of the institutions we covered, in terms of numbers of people working and also companies. Private developments in the free zone are also popping up. We have the majority of major businesses at the center; 21 of the largest 30 banks are with us, eight of the 20 largest asset managers, six out of the top 10 insurers, and six out of the top 10 law firms. We have been able to attract those major players and create jobs and transfer knowledge into the community.</p><h4>How important was establishing the right regulatory climate within the DIFC?</h4><p>An extensive amount of time has been spent developing the legal infrastructure, including laws and regulations through discussions with the federal cabinet of the UAE in terms of what type of independence the center could have. The UAE government entrusted the center and provided it with independence by means of applying a common law jurisdiction. This is very appealing for the international financial community because it feels at home with a familiar system, while being closer to its target audience. There are three bodies that govern the DIFC yet perform independently from each other. On one side there is the DIFC Authority looking after the master plan and strategy of the center. We develop the infrastructure and we govern all non-financial services carried out from the DIFC and provide promotion for the center. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) is the financial services regulator, and it licenses financial institutions to carry out business, supervises these financial institutions, and enforces regulations. The third body is the Judicial Authority, DIFC courts, which has independent jurisdiction over civil and commercial matters arising from the center. We also have an Arbitration Centre, DIFC-LCIA, which offers dispute and resolution services and alternatives to the courts.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind creating a micro-city?</h4><p>It is 110 acres and there is a concept of a state within a state. First, we talked about how sound and advanced the legal structure had to be. We have ensured that  world-class infrastructure was in place, as well as business-friendly laws. Another major factor, which is common in all major financial centers, is lifestyle. That is quite important for us, and we focused on creating the environment in an all-inclusive manner. The institutions that are operating here and their employees do not feel that this is predominantly just a space or an office park; we added the lifestyle component and it became a jurisdiction of choice. People can live here, enjoying their time after work at the cafes, restaurants, and art galleries. You have to create an environment where people are happy working and it is often the case that large employers find it difficult to recruit people from abroad because of where they are investing. These places have to offer good choices in terms of schools, healthcare systems, and quality of life. I think that is where Dubai excelled, as everything is integrated; everything is very advanced here and moving at the same pace. When we talk about growth and emerging markets, this is where the focus lies right now.</p><h4>How important is Dubai as a hub for other emerging markets and what role is the development of the new Silk Route playing?</h4><p>I think it is quite central; the role Dubai plays between growth markets is a crucial one. Dubai offers unparalleled value to institutions that want to tap into emerging market areas. If you look at the locale of what is between London and Hong Kong, there is Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, and the trend has been there for the past two years. Even international banks have seen their future here and are reinforcing their presence even while they have been more conservative and cutting down elsewhere. These banks understand that the future is here, whether it is in infrastructure financing, trade financing, project financing, or other projects in predominantly growth markets. The Chinese banks are following all of their clients into Africa, and banks are talking to us and choosing DIFC as their base because it is the more logical choice for them; South Asia is the same. Connecting Brazil to China via Dubai makes more sense because of the convenience of direct flights.</p><h4>How important is NASDAQ Dubai in terms of the development of local capital markets?</h4><p>Any financial center has to have active, liquid capital markets in place, and I think in that manner NASDAQ Dubai plays an important part in Dubai's strategy as an international center. But to complement the center, NASDAQ Dubai is also an international exchange because of the international listing requirements, the obligations that have been put in place, and the fact that it is also regulated by the DFSA. International investors appreciate the choice for the international exchange as opposed to local exchanges.</p><h4>How have you re-aligned your strategy since the financial crisis?</h4><p>It is ironic, because the crisis that happened in 2009 was at about the same time that we had our fifth anniversary, and we had already undertaken a plan to revise the business strategy of the center. We saw that we had met the initial goal of creating a critical mass, creating awareness, and developing the DIFC's recognition at an international level. The next step was for us to become a more mature financial center by means of scale, because if we were to compete with the likes of London, New York, or Hong Kong, they obviously have an advantage because of their age. When we look at the scale of activity, we see that more assets are being booked and more business is happening. In that respect, we need to focus on building scale, and what that means is that we not only need to focus on acquiring new clients, but we also need to focus on current existing players to expand by means of added business securities and coverage.</p><p>We have seen a significant amount of organic growth since 2009—not only new companies but existing players also expanding their footprint, adding more functions and people. Now, from a key performance indicator perspective, while that does add to the number of new companies, it also adds in terms of economic value and GDP contribution. That is also now central to our strategy. For example, we have institutions that have made the DIFC their global home; Standard Chartered started small and now has over 700 people with its own building and has moved its CEOs for all regions expect East Asia to Dubai. Bloomberg also established its 10th global office in the DIFC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tell us a little bit about the history to ASCANA's operations and the decision to establish a Scandinavian-Arabic joint insurance initiative?<br></h4><p>The decision to establish a Scandinavian-Arabian initiative in the financial sector was to support the broad-based initiatives introduced by the government of Dubai and the federal government. An insurance company protects its clients from fortuitous and unexpected contingencies and accidents over which they have no control and thereby leave them to focus on their core business and participate in nation building as good corporate citizens.</p><h4>What are the benefits of operating from Dubai?</h4><p>There are immense benefits of operating from Dubai. It is the foremost strategic commercial hub dealing in all commercial economic social and sports and leisure activities in the region. The vast growth achieved by Dubai during the past 10 years is a realistic yardstick for economic diversification. As an insurance company, we also support our clients by protecting their assets and covering their liability exposures even when they set up business establishments outside the UAE.</p><h4>How has the company performed over the past years and what is your development strategy?</h4><p>As a composite insurer created under a government decree with a paid up capital of AED140 million, we have achieved an impressive record of performance and have established a reputation of integrity, efficiency, and reliable service to our clients. As far as our development strategy is concerned, it is somewhat clouded with uncertainty due to sluggish growth concerning premium income and subdued investment returns coupled with deteriorating underwriting results. Notwithstanding the reduced growth momentum caused by the global recession, it is our endeavor to forge ahead with innovative insurance products, especially in medical and life cover. As the world is struggling hard to come out of the recession and kick-start economic growth, we are striving hard to support construction sector projects through our various engineering insurance coverage products.</p><h4>How big is Dubai's insurance market in relation to other economy sectors and how do per capita premium levels compare to the surrounding regions?</h4><p>The UAE is one of the most robust markets in terms of insurance penetration. Total premiums written by the insurance industry in the UAE are about AED25 billion, which is the highest amongst countries in the GCC region.</p><h4>What new and customized products have you introduced recently?</h4><p>We have recently introduced online services to our varied clients on a selective basis, and we hope to expand these services to embrace our full insurance portfolios.</p><h4>As a result of globalization, deregulation, and international security threats, the insurance industry has gone through a tremendous transformation over the past decade. What key effects from these factors has Dubai Insurance witnessed over the past decade and how do these apply in particular to Dubai?</h4><p>The insurance industry is not immune from the impacts of globalization. The recent events associated with the Arab Spring have resulted in increasing demand for terrorism and political violence insurance. We are also witnessing increasing demand from our clients in the shipping industry for kidnapping and ransom coverage for crews and vessels following instances of piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Somali coast.</p><h4>What has been the impact of regulatory changes on the Dubai insurance sector?</h4><p>While the insurance authority has been trying to bring in more regulations to the insurance industry, we are keen that it introduces them more in line with international standards so as to ensure the solvency of the risk carriers operating in the market and protect the public from indiscreet insurance professionals.</p><h4>How did the global financial liquidity crisis affect the insurance sector in Dubai?</h4><p>The global financial liquidity crisis adversely affected the entire global economic activities in general, and Dubai in particular, in a significant way. Insurance premiums were drastically reduced due to the impact. Real growth in premiums came down. The interest rates became low, insurers assets values diminished, and their liabilities increased. There are also concerns about the increasing quantity of receivables appearing on the asset side of the insurers' balance sheets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENOC has noted the need for a driven strategy to increase its resilience in the face of an increasingly changing and competitive market. How is this strategy being put into practice?</h4><p>The energy market is changing. The complexity of doing business has increased, especially after the global financial crisis. The government of Dubai has set up the Supreme Council of Energy to focus on the future energy security of Dubai. Growth cannot be driven without securing energy supplies. In the past, because there were different energy organizations in Dubai, there was no proper coordination. The Council has brought all the entities that are working in the energy sector under one umbrella to undertake long-term planning and develop strategies to meet the Emirate's requirements. Hence, the 2030 Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy has been adopted.</p><h4>What is the next step in developing a strategy?</h4><p>From ENOC's perspective, we are looking at being more focused on securing upstream assets. We have created a dedicated team to evaluate asset opportunities. Of course, the market has been changing rapidly, and we are closely monitoring the situation. Historically, most of our focus was on Dubai and the Northern Emirates, but with the overall market conditions, and the rapid growth in the UAE, in Dubai in particular, we have also started focusing on driving international growth and finding opportunities to build on the experience we have gathered in the past. Internationally, there are a lot more opportunities to grow, and we are working on these too. Our operations are set to spread across East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In building upstream opportunities, we are also looking for growth opportunities. In the past we have not been involved in gas activities, and we are strongly considering gas trading and supply. This could become an integral part of our business. We are also evaluating other potential opportunities in the UAE, and in Dubai. This is only part of our strategic growth vision.</p><h4>The Supreme Council of Energy has declared its commitment to reducing Dubai's dependence on gas imports from elsewhere in the Gulf. What can be done to achieve this goal?</h4><p>Identifying alternate energy sources, focusing on renewables, and promoting a culture of energy efficiency across all stakeholders are the keys to reducing the dependence on gas imports. ENOC has already developed concerted initiatives to promote the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) as a fuel alternative, and the response has been extremely encouraging. What is crucial is to roll out sustained customer and user awareness initiatives, and ENOC is supporting this through various corporate social responsibility programs. We established a long-term strategy to achieve this. The Gulf is rich in gas supplies, but today the supply of gas through Dubai comes from Abu Dhabi and the Dolphin pipeline. It is the only source today, and there is scope for expansion. Already, Dubai has established its first LNG facilities, which could address gas shortage and the Supreme Council of Energy is planning to diversify energy sources to find a good balance.</p><h4>What potential do you see for the development of the clean energy sector, and in what ways do you support its evolution?</h4><p>Promoting sustainable development is an initiative of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and is an integral part of our strategy. Apart from price volatilities, we have seen two key changes that are relevant not only for the region but also globally. The first is the increasing importance that the region's governments are placing on sustainable development. The second is the growing awareness among customers to adopt energy-efficient measures. ENOC is supporting the government's Green Vision as well as addressing customer requirements for a “greener" lifestyle through various initiatives. To promote the use of compressed natural gas, Emirates Gas, a subsidiary of ENOC, has been working closely with the Roads &amp; Transport Authority (RTA) to introduce CNG to public transport to enhance environmental protection. A unique model of pipeless natural gas fuel stations has been proposed in Dubai as part of plans to implement cost-effective and environmentally friendly natural gas transportation.</p><p>At a macro level, recently the Sheikh Mohammed Solar Energy Park was announced, which will be the first of its kind in the region. Solar power is used heavily in the Gulf, but only by smaller communities and is not very effective as of now. By 2030 we are hoping that the energy mix will contain at least 5% generated through solar panels. The vision behind this initiative is to utilize and develop the energy matrix. It is, however, very important to encourage the development of a regulatory system to handle it.</p><p>Solar power has its own challenges, but today I think it is the most viable option. Part of our strategy is nuclear power. Today, Abu Dhabi is developing nuclear power and Dubai is a part of that vision. We have been negotiating to see how we can utilize this form of power. ENOC will continue to partner in environmentally responsible initiatives and promote a culture of sustainability, which is important in addressing the growing energy demand faced by the region, as well as mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><h4>The UAE's proximity to emerging Asian markets presents numerous opportunities. What do you foresee as being the key developments over the coming years?</h4><p>I believe that a large part of the demand for petroleum products will be led by the Asian economies, and the proximity of the Middle East to the fast-growing emerging markets in Asia serves as a tremendous opportunity for the region's oil and gas companies. The increased ties between the Middle East and the growing Asian nations will drive the oil trade, which will offset any demand reduction from the developed nations that are witnessing sluggish economic activity. Demand for petroleum products is expected to rise to 90.7 million barrels per day—an all-time high. A large part of this strong demand will be driven by the non-Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, with Asian economies taking the lead followed by the Middle East. Dubai's core sectors—trade, tourism, and transport—have supported the city's overall economic growth. The aviation sector has in particular been a driving force and we anticipate it to remain one of the strongest growth pillars of Dubai's economy.</p><h4>ENOC's subsidiary EPPCO supplies lubricant products to many countries. What developments can we expect from this sector in the coming years?</h4><p>ENOC Lubricants is already expanding its market presence in the Middle East region, the Indian Subcontinent, and African markets. In the coming years, we expect the company to further strengthen its market reach, and offer the full spectrum of products, especially with a focus on improved fuel mileage, increased cooling efficiency, excellent engine protection, and environmental friendliness. This was highlighted recently with the launch of a top-tier synthetic oil, the Protec Flex Energy SN, a first of its kind in the Middle East and Africa. The new product has the highest certification in the region. It also meets the requirements of all types of vehicles—from hybrid vehicles to model vehicles from the US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does the UAE sit within predictions that energy demand may increase by 12% annually in the region?<br></h4><p>The UAE provides financial and political stability and is a hub for trade, tourism, logistics, and financial services. People prefer to base operations here to better serve the wider region and North Africa. There are other benefits such as no taxation, good connectivity, and security that make this place a preferred choice to live and to do business. It is the growth in business that will drive this growth in energy demand, and I believe the UAE is well placed to achieve the projected increase in energy demand in the region.</p><h4>What is your cooling ton capacity?</h4><p>We currently have a total capacity of 370,000 refrigeration tons (RT) spread over various prestigious projects in Dubai. To name a few examples, we provide cooling for Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR), the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), Dubai Healthcare City (DHCC), Business Bay, and the Dubai World Trade Centre Residences. We are targeting to increase our capacity to reach 500,000 RT by end-2013 by expanding and extending our existing infrastructure wherever possible and building new district cooling plants and networks where required. In the long run, we have set a target of achieving 1 million RT by the end of 2020.</p><h4>What new technology and innovations is Empower using to support its strategy?</h4><p>Empower has been a pioneer in promoting submetering solutions in the region, which the company has installed at its various projects. Higher energy efficiency can be achieved by installing submeters for district cooling services at each apartment or unit level in the building, which measure actual consumption each unit, creates energy accountability, and promote energy savings. We have installed one of the largest submetering solutions at a single location at our JBR project, consisting of 7,200 submeters spread over 40 residential and hotel towers.</p><p>Empower has also taken initiatives to efficiently utilize water resources by consuming Treated Sewage Effluent (TSE) water in place of potable water for its make-up water consumption for district cooling services. We have successfully implemented TSE plants at our DHCC and DIFC projects. Currently, Empower is working toward implementing the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) solution in our new plants, which are under various stages of construction. Such a solution would further enhance efficiency in energy and will shave off the peak demand of electricity through balancing and optimizing power requirements throughout the day.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in the Emirate since the enactment of the green building regulations?</h4><p>Buildings with district cooling services qualify as green buildings, and we are one of the companies that actively support the development of this technology. The enactment of the green building regulations will support us and encourage more buildings to adopt district cooling services.</p><h4>Is there a willingness from investors in the region to support the district cooling business?</h4><p>Investors and banks look for businesses that have capabilities to generate steady and stable cash flows. If investors can see a healthy historical financial performance, strong professional management, and predictable future cash flows, they are more than willing to invest in such companies as their investments are secured. At the same time, they can make money and enjoy a diversified risk portfolio.</p><p>Since district cooling is considered a utility business, it offers stable, steady, and long-term cash flows. Empower has been consistently delivering strong financial results on a year-on-year basis, and has therefore attracted various investors (banks and financial institutions) that have invested in the business and derived appropriate returns. As for other district cooling companies, I am not sure if this is the case.</p><h4>To what degree do you see the development of sustainable energy progressing in Dubai?</h4><p>The development of sustainable energy progressing in Dubai will depend on the overall development of the Emirate as a whole. The current growth rate is in the range of 7% to 10%, and I believe this may continue, assuming Dubai continues to be the preferred destination of immigrants moving here or by new investors looking toward Dubai as a safe haven.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012?</h4><p>We will continue to grow. We have many projects in the pipeline that are set to be delivered during the third or fourth quarter of this year. On an overall basis, 2012 will be another good year for us, following growth of approximately 10% to 12% over 2011.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins of Dubai's Drydocks World?<br></h4><p>Many years ago, Drydocks World was established as a regional business. Later on, the government decided to expand the horizons of the company, increasing its capabilities and services. Without a doubt, Drydocks World is one of the largest dry docks in the world. We cater to very lucrative markets, specifically targeting regional and international businesses. Drydocks World acquired a number of dry docks in Singapore and Indonesia, expanding actively until the misfortune of the global financial crisis struck the region. Although we had to adjust our vision and strategy, the crisis did not bring an end to our growth approach. In 2010, we launched a new strategy designed to serve the energy sector. We have consolidated our business into the categories of repair, maintenance, conversion, and modular fabrication; we also have a very successful new build operation. Maritime City incorporates business operations clusters into the Drydocks World group, and I would classify ours as a growing business.</p><h4>Where do Dubai's strengths lie?</h4><p>Dubai will always be the number one hub in the region. The Emirate has always been part of a very effective trade route, with an “easy in, easy out," policy in terms of maritime activity, which is important to create value-added in the industry. In Dubai, the right moves have been made toward developing an industry that is heavily reliant on maritime trade. The growth in the oil and gas industry in the region will certainly enhance the sector, as more and more platforms and service vessels will be required for transportation. Moreover, in the trading segment, it is well known that almost 87% of global trade in the region is handled by UAE-based organizations.</p><h4>What success have you experienced in maintenance and conversion operations?</h4><p>At the beginning of 2012, we signed an agreement for a $255 million project. In the repair segment, we have a monthly turnover of approximately $30 million-$35 million, and we continue to grow. We are still in the negotiation phase for a number of mammoth potential projects in the pipeline. The projects we have are among the best in the world; we are building the largest offshore platform for renewable wind power energy in the North Sea with Norwegian company Aibel. Sustainable energy is one of our main focuses, as it has the potential for growth over the long term. We conducted a detailed study regarding the areas of Drydocks World that we would like to see growing, and designed a strategy based on that analysis. We are developing the world's largest turret for the global gas industry in partnership with Shell, Technip, and SBM Offshore. This turret is designed to be used for a deepwater gas project off the coast of Australia. Furthermore, we are developing two modular conversions for the Gulf of Mexico and the US, and these conversions represent a remarkable achievement for us.</p><h4>Are you actively looking for joint ventures to enhance your current capacity?</h4><p>We are heavily involved in Singapore and Indonesia, and in Dubai we actively engage in international partnerships. We have participated in a number of discussions with special partners in Turkey, Libya, Vietnam, and Japan, and in different Southeast Asian countries. After signing a recent major contract, global attention was focused on us. We were forced to compete in a very difficult market against shipyards that are fully subsidized by governments and have extensive knowledge bases in the oil sector, as well as docks that have no restrictions similar to the restructuring measures we were facing. Nevertheless, we came out on top, and the situation has opened doors for us. Currently, we are involved in discussions about managing other yards, exporting our knowledge base, and promoting our brand name. Many countries would like to see our strategies implemented in their own yards. We are a following an operational excellence program, which incorporates a very extensive business management strategy with built-in efficiency, on-time delivery, and cost-effective measures that ensure quality products of the highest standards in safety. The trend is that the market seeks lower costs at a higher level of quality, and Drydocks World can offer that.</p><h4>What is your 2012 market outlook?</h4><p>We are on the right track. For 2011 we posted a profit of $125 million, and we will settle for no less than in 2012—we expect at least a 10% growth rate. We are very well positioned to be the first choice for our clientele, and plan to expand our capacity to optimize our growth potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the regulatory mandate of the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) cover?<br></h4><p>The DFSA's regulatory mandate covers all financial and related activities conducted in or from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), including asset management, banking and credit services, securities, collective investment funds, custody and trust services, commodities futures trading, Islamic finance, insurance, an international equities exchange, and an international commodities derivatives exchange. In addition, the DFSA registers auditors, ancillary service providers (law firms and accountants), and is responsible for anti-money laundering supervision in the DIFC.</p><h4>Creating a financial hub in Dubai has been part of the ongoing vision for the long-term prosperity of the city. What are the strengths of the Emirate in this regard?</h4><p>The Emirate of Dubai, through its Ruler His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has created by means of legislation a modern financial and business hub connecting the region's emerging markets with the developed markets of Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Since 2004, Dubai has been committed to encouraging economic growth and development in the UAE and the region through its strong financial and business infrastructure, such as the creation of the DIFC. For example, the DIFC offers its member companies benefits such as 100% foreign ownership and a 0% tax rate with no restriction on capital convertibility or profit repatriation. Furthermore, the DIFC has its own independent common law judiciary, namely the DIFC Courts. The Emirate continues to enhance its infrastructure. For example, it has recently enacted legislation to extend the jurisdiction of these courts to enable the benefits of the DIFC Courts to be more widely available. Combining all of these attributes, including the fact that financial institutions find that Dubai offers a high standard of living for their employees as well as modern office space, the Emirate positions itself as the appropriate and first-in-mind location attracting and retaining businesses and talent.</p><h4>What have been the most significant recent developments in terms of the DFSA's regulation?</h4><p>There have been two recent significant developments. The first development was the enlargement of the DFSA's regulatory remit to make it responsible for all anti-money laundering supervision across the DIFC rather than, as was previously the case, in respect only of firms it regulates for conducting financial and other related activities. The second development was the acceptance by the DFSA of a delegation of power from the Registrar of Companies to be responsible for investigations and conducting enforcement action in respect of breaches of DIFC laws administered by the Registrar of Companies, such as the Companies Law.</p><h4>Financial services companies wishing to obtain a license to operate within the DIFC are processed through the DFSA. What kind of trends have you witnessed in terms of applications?</h4><p>The 2011 period was a time of growth in the DIFC, with the number of authorized firms increasing by 8% after two years of consolidation and following the rapid growth experienced in 2005-2008. In 2012, this momentum is continuing with applications 80% higher than for the same period last year. The DIFC is being selected as a hub to offer products and services to clients in the GCC, wider Middle East, and North Africa and Asia. In terms of specific growth drivers, we see banks—particularly from China and India—increasing their presence and offering their commercial lending and trade finance services, wealth managers from Europe seeking to enhance and grow institutional and private banking relationships in the region, and global investment banks and other wholesale intermediaries migrating trading teams to the center.</p><h4>You have recently visited China, where the DFSA signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the China Banking Regulatory Commission and then travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore. What are the benefits of such cooperation agreements and high-level visits?</h4><p>Cooperation among regulators has always been important, but at a time where so much activity and capital flows are across borders, it is even more so. In that regard, we are pleased to have updated our cooperation agreements with the Chinese regulator. Also, as the center of global wealth and activity moves eastward, the DIFC is well placed. We further cemented our strong relationships with the Hong Kong and Singapore authorities and met with leading government and industry identities. We have much to consider from how Hong Kong and Singapore have developed as financial centers. It was also pleasing for us to hear from them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strengths of the banking system in the Emirate?<br></h4><p>Over the last 40 years, Dubai has transformed its economy to consist of international trade, banking, tourism, real estate, and manufacturing. The government's investment in transportation, telecommunications, energy, and industrial infrastructure has opened up many routes to an extensive foreign trade network. Coupled with the incredible infrastructure and the safe political environment it offers its residents, Dubai has emerged as a leading regional commercial hub and a world-class business environment. Dubai's ability to overcome the financial crisis that occurred in 2008 reflects strong government support that enables the Emirate to be a stable and conducive environment for prosperity.</p><h4>Emirates NBD is the UAE's largest lender. Do you see banks in the region increasing lending levels in the near future?</h4><p>Given recent global economic events, the outlook has become more cautious and uncertain. As a result, we are expecting lower levels of loan growth than before. For 2012, we are aiming for gross loan growth at around 4%-5%, with contributions from both retail and corporate lending.</p><h4>How is the recent takeover of Dubai Bank by Emirates NBD demonstrative of the Dubai government's desire to consolidate the banking sector?</h4><p>The acquisition of Dubai Bank by Emirates NBD signals a new phase rich in opportunities for both banks. The transaction closed against a cash consideration equal to the fair value of the entity acquired. The financial results of Dubai Bank were consolidated on October 11, 2011 without any impact on the group's net profits or non-performing loan (NPL) ratio on the date of the takeover. The recent integration of Dubai Bank ATMs within the Emirates NBD network has been a successful and important milestone in the integration process. In the coming months, Emirates NBD will complete the next phase of integration that will enable Dubai Bank customers to access new options, such as utility bill payments, when using Emirates NBD ATMs.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the creation of the Center of Operational Excellence known as Tanfeeth?</h4><p>Building on the success of Network International, the creation of Tanfeeth was a strategic decision aimed at providing world-class services to the bank as well as its external clients across many industries. The decision was of great value to Emirates NBD as it offers opportunities to reengineer our processes and introduce global best-practice tools and technology that will improve efficiency and enhance the quality of the service that we offer customers.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Dubai's capital markets in 2012?</h4><p>Emirates NBD has continued to boost its drive toward increased transparency with analysts, investors, and customers at large, enabling further business opportunities while aiding the capital markets. In recent months, the Gulf's capital markets have witnessed a surge in sukuk and conventional bond issuance as markets have improved, following the tight global conditions in 2011. Other parts of the world are seeing the value of tapping these markets, especially Asia. Other sources of finance are emerging with the development of the offshore renminbi (CNY) market, funding that is proving very attractive. Emirates NBD recently launched a CNY1 billion bond, which attracted strong investor appetite and was priced at a competitive level.</p><h4>How active is Emirates NBD in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities?</h4><p>In line with its vision and mission, Emirates NBD is committed to engaging all its stakeholders in a sustainable and responsible manner, making it one of the most active financial institutions in the community with a clear CSR strategy. Over the last year, Emirates NBD has worked to support and develop three focus areas in its community: education, environmental issues, and health care. As we are a group driven by customer satisfaction, our numerous golfing events give us the opportunity to please our internal and external customers. At Emirates NBD, we are aware of the passion and excitement one feels when golfing next to champions. Horse racing is a national UAE sport, and one that we share a passion for at Emirates NBD. As a highly competitive, pedigree sport, horse racing is aligned to our own values of success and ancestral heritage. Therefore, Emirates NBD is the Dubai World Cup official banking partner and sponsor. Having established a firm place among the top thoroughbred racing events in the world, the Dubai World Cup attracts a global audience each year. Our sponsorship also provides us with invaluable international exposure that goes hand-in-hand with participating in this high-profile event and helps strengthen our brand recognition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Almost 85% of the world's transactions still take place with cash, although MasterCard itself is synonymous with plastic. What are the key opportunities going forward for processing networks regionally?<br></h4><p>Economies around the world, as well as central banks and governments, are increasingly looking at this sphere as they realize that cash transactions are actually fairly inefficient. We have conducted global studies and found that it costs a government or an economy between 50 and 150 basis points just to use cash. This is not taking into account what banks spend in terms of just putting the cash into people's wallets. If one looks at the true cost of cash, it starts to be upward of 150 basis points. In other words, cash can cost a country about 1.5% of its GDP; this is a substantial amount of money that could be saved if electronic payment solutions replaced cash transactions. In this part of the world, only 10% of payments are electronic, while 90% are still cash or checks. I think that we have now reached the cusp where paper might give way to electronic transactions. This could not have been the case 20 years ago, in the absence of the necessary infrastructure to carry out the transactions securely, but the situation has now improved significantly to pave the way for an evolution to replace cash with a more efficient and a much more transparent system.</p><h4>What kind of new technology are you bringing to the local market?</h4><p>Technology comes in different forms. One is platform services, an example being the enablement of e-commerce around the world. This is not a new concept, but it is growing substantially and we are enhancing MasterCard's platform services as consumer preferences change and new e-commerce channels are opened. If you are booking airline tickets online, it is likely that you'll be going through MasterCard's channels whether or not you used a MasterCard product.</p><h4>In developed consumer markets, debit cards have now overtaken credit cards in terms of popularity. Are the same trends being seen here?</h4><p>Clearly, debit cards have come to the forefront in this part of the world, but debit cards use is actually determined by several factors. One of these is the savings habits of consumers. If one looks at developing markets such as India, saving rates tend to be extremely high, and consumers tend to opt for debit cards that are linked to their savings accounts. This is one reason and example why debit cards take off in some markets.</p><p>A second factor impacting the use of debit cards is the acceptance infrastructure. Some markets, such as the US, have been developing their infrastructure for 30 years, and thus every shop now accepts cards. This is not yet the case in a lot of developing markets.</p><p>Another factor is consumer habits. Consumers tend to take out cash for very small, low-cost purchases out of sheer habit. When more places accept cards, consumers stop taking cash out with them, instead preferring to spend on their cards. Of the 90% of payments made in cash, around 50% might be small-value payments. This begins to show the sheer volume of the market, and could lead to debit cards overtaking credit cards in some markets.</p><p>Therefore, the use of credit or debit cards depends more on saving rates, what sort of infrastructure is available, and consumer tastes and preferences, but we believe that both cards have their specific uses and that there is a place for both in consumers' wallets.</p><h4>How are local consumer habits changing in terms of online payments?</h4><p>A recent MasterCard survey found that 42% of UAE shoppers accessed the internet for online shopping in 2011 (this does not, however, indicate that all of them made purchases). That is an extremely high percentage, growing from 33% in 2010.</p><p>Different industries have responded to the digital age in their own ways. The airline industry is one sector that has revolutionized how it sells its products. A few years ago, consumers would book their tickets through a travel agent. Now, the airlines have gone completely digital. The same thing has also happened with hotels and holiday packages. I suspect this trend will also move into the retail side.</p><p>In summary, given the change in consumer habits and the rapidly evolving online payment infrastructure, we expect online shopping to grow at a much higher pace than traditional ways of shopping. We expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ABN AMRO has been in the UAE since 1973. What are the specific nature of this market?<br></h4><p>ABN AMRO decided that Dubai will serve as our primary platform from where we service our clients from the Middle East, Africa, and also the Asian subcontinent. ABN AMRO came to the Middle East as a trade finance bank as we followed the commercial activities of our Asian clients.  We have been active in this region since 1923 when we set up a bank in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. We then subsequently expanded over the years into corporate finance and structured finance in the region, and we were one of the largest houses bringing bonds to the local market. In 2007 ABN AMRO was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, and Fortis Bank. At that time we had almost 3,000 people working in the UAE and were one of the largest credit card issuers. In February 2010 we set up our new bank in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and have been granted a category-one banking license. We are one of only four banks that actually book client accounts in the DIFC. All other banks in the DIFC function as a mere representative office and they book their clients mostly in Switzerland or Singapore. This really sets ABN AMRO apart from the other banks operating in the DIFC.</p><h4>How did the establishment of the DIFC help your business?</h4><p>The DIFC has its own infrastructure, while the regulatory environment for us is managed by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). The DFSA has a strong team of supervisors and a clean regulatory record. It is a well respected supervisory body internationally and staffed by international professionals. The DIFC also has its own court system. Cases can be heard in the DIFC courts and hopefully resolved fairly quickly. The license application process by the DFSA and the DIFC was a very smooth one.</p><h4>Traditionally stable locations for investment have been stretched to the limit following the financial crisis. How has that forced you to redefine the quality of your investments?</h4><p>I think that Dubai has proven to be a stable location despite the financial crisis. And then if we combine the financial crisis with the sociopolitical shifts, or what we now refer to as the Arab Spring, Dubai has shown tremendous resilience and perseverance as a financial center. The DIFC has around 700 companies operating from it, including some 300 banks and wealth management firms. Dubai has derived some benefits from the Arab Spring, as people looked for a more stable place for their investments in the region and decided to come to Dubai. I have not seen any firms leave Dubai because of concerns with the current regional situation. It's quite the reverse. We've seen that a number of banks have brought people in from other regional centers in the Gulf because of the perceived political stability in the UAE. Also, our clients have made their analysis of the UAE's political situation and continue to feel that the UAE is a very solid and stable environment from which they continue to operate.</p><h4>The real estate market was one of the worst hit areas during the global liquidity crisis. Do any investment opportunities remain with high-quality dividend yields in this sector?</h4><p>I do believe so, yes. I think we also have to be bit more precise when we talk about the UAE real estate market. People who invested in UAE real estate before 2007 are likely still making money today. In the commercial real estate sector there is excess capacity, which is simply going to take time to be picked up by the market. The residential real estate sector is all about location, location, location. There has always been, and there continues to be, interest from Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East to buy properties in the UAE because of the tremendous infrastructure built up over the years coupled with its strategic location on the axis from Africa to Asia. Not to forget the safety on the streets in the UAE. I think that the residential real estate sector has found new pricing levels and reasonable yields can be made. If you expect to make a 12% return on an apartment, forget it, but if you can take 4%—7%, then the market is here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Dubai Carbon Centre for Excellence (DCCE)?<br></h4><p>Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are often painted with the same brush. There is a perception that they have no interest in the environment or sustainability, but that could not be farther from the truth. A lot of what we do does not make it into the media, but we have a solid record of success stories that drive social and economic development forward. The DCCE works under the Supreme Council of Energy as a market enabler. Our role is to identify areas of the carbon value chain that can be facilitated through market-based mechanisms—to promote the involvement of business in the low-carbon economy. We usually focus on projects that are almost ready for commercial implementation, but need a final layer of efficiency. We help to provide this efficiency, whether economic, financial, or policy-driven, by putting all the actors around the table, tapping into international markets, or creating our own mechanisms.</p><h4>What practical initiatives do you have in place at the moment?</h4><p>Our first projects were focused on developing the carbon potential of Dubai-owned assets through the clean development mechanism (CDM). The money from these projects provided us with the financial stability to continue the initiative. We now work with a range of organizations, both large and small. We are working with Dubai Electricty and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Aluminium (DUBAL) on projects as large as the DUBAL GTX project, which takes very large steam power plants and centralizes the steam distribution to improve efficiency and avoid additional fuel burn. On the less industrial side, we have projects such as a program of activities for green buildings and grid-connected solar installations. We help smaller projects access the carbon market by allowing them to register with us under an umbrella agreement. We also act as an advisor on low-carbon development, usually focusing on emissions reduction projects, which are really our bread and butter. We focus on projects where we see emissions reduction potential that the project owner may be unaware of or may not have the expertise to take advantage of alone.</p><h4>Is there the potential to develop technology in the UAE for regional export?</h4><p>Funnily enough, I've just learned of a solar manufacturer that produces solar cells here in the UAE and exports them to China. That means there is a UAE-based company that is already price- and quality-competitive enough to enter a highly developed market such as China. Emirati investors are growing more sophisticated and there is a growing appetite for this type of investment. Dubai used to be all about real estate, services, tourism, finance, transport, and commodities, but now everyone's eyes are opening up to other areas of investment, such as the energy sector and green technology products. This means that the green industry is suddenly seeing a lot of new interest.</p><h4>What about the UAE as a green financing hub?</h4><p>We are seeing new financing mechanisms that are being developed here. There is a lot of synergy between Islamic banking and green technologies. Something as simple as an ESCO model with a performance agreement to encourage energy efficiency is totally new here. That sounds simple, but putting it in place through a financial tool is complicated because there is nothing to securitize on the back end. However, if we utilize an Islamic financing approach, you can all of a sudden leverage participation in the project to mitigate some of these risks. So what was unfortunately difficult to put in place has actually turned out to be a specific fit to the market. We are focusing on developing financial markets and new investment platforms. One of the biggest barriers to getting projects off the ground has been access to finance. Not because there is no finance in the UAE, but because banks need to be motivated by raising their awareness to finance projects. We are working with some banks right now to finance very small, low-risk projects just so we can see what the banks consider opportunities in terms of know-how processes, and how we can help them develop these processes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What potential does this region have for the development of clean energy?<br></h4><p>The Clean Energy Business Council (CEBC) is actually regional in scope, and we look at the whole Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as one that has enormous potential for renewable energy and clean technology. It clearly has a comparative advantage in solar, but also wind in a few countries as well. One of the major characteristics of a clean energy program—and clean energy in general—is the necessity to have in place a strong policy and regulatory framework. Clean energy is very much in its infancy as an industry, and we are only at the beginning of the roll-out of clean energy and renewable energy solutions. If you look at how the world produces energy, and how it uses it, clean energy and renewable energy is still a very small fraction of the total—maybe 5% or 6%. But it is very promising for a large number of reasons, including climate change. Climate change is clearly the principal driver of these efforts, both public and private, aimed at reducing pollution and preserving the environment. Unfortunately in our region there is an absence of any policy or regulatory framework. Although this region has this enormous comparative advantage—particularly for solar—it has not invested in it. If you look at total investment in solar energy, renewables, and clean energy in general across MENA in 2011, it was only about $840 million or so, out of a world total of $260 billion.</p><h4>How is CEBC involved in supporting the development of a sustainable local environment?</h4><p>CEBC was set up firstly to promote greater awareness of the need for clean energy as a source to replace our use of fossil fuels, which are non-renewable. Secondly, the organization was set up to help governments and other policymakers put in place a policy and regulatory framework. Thirdly, its aim is to work with the private sector in terms of introducing clean energy and clean technology. Fourthly, and probably most importantly from my viewpoint, is that not only do we have the potential for the increased use of clean energy and renewables, but we can be major producers.</p><h4>How large a role does the subsidization of fuel play in this story?</h4><p>Regionally, we heavily subsidize the use of fossil fuels. We are the biggest subsidizers of fossil fuels in the world; in 2010 our subsidies amounted to $166 billion. That is two -thirds of the world's fuel subsidies, just in our region. The subsidies we put on fuel are greater than what we invest in education. Part of our message in the CEBC is to start a discussion on gradually removing fossil fuel subsidies. If you still want to maintain the level of subsidies, reorient them towards renewable and clean energy. In the MENA region, 80%-85% of the subsidies go to the richest 20% of the population. The people who benefit are the rich. If you look at Dubai, there is a high percentage of wealthy expatriates who are paying no taxes, yet contributing to the heavy consumption of fuel. Removing the subsidies would fix a distortion in the price system from an economic point of view.</p><h4>What opportunities are there to develop the green financing sector in Dubai?</h4><p>On a global basis, there is no center that is focused on clean energy finance, and I believe the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has great potential in that sense. Given the resources available, and given the companies that we have in the DIFC, we believe there is potential for the DIFC, and therefore for Dubai, to emerge as a clean energy and clean technology financing center, certainly for the Middle East. Anybody who has a clean energy project could then come and get the financing from the DIFC. We could list securities, we could list funds, or find financing for funds, project finance, infrastructure finance, and all the consulting related to that in terms of structuring. For example, public-private partnerships are another thing we are missing in the region that we should really put in place. One other thing we have looked at that is promising for the future is a “green sukuk" initiative, which we have launched. There are, of course, conventional sukuks being issued, but we have looked at having green sukuks that would finance projects that satisfy both international climate criteria and be sharia-compliant. That would mean the Islamic finance industry could then be using Islamic “green sukuks" to finance projects across the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes green spending such a pressing activity for the UK?<br></h4><p>The transition to a low carbon world will not be possible unless developing countries are supported in their domestic efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change and develop their own low carbon economies. Accelerating the development and deployment of low carbon technology in developing countries is key to achieving this, and this is why technology has been a critical element of international negotiations on climate change under the UNFCCC.</p><h4>In what ways is the UAE leading the way for the rest of the Arab world?</h4><p>The UAE has been taking an active role in addressing the impacts of climate change and investing in renewable energy. Beyond hosting the ground-breaking Masdar City, and its university, carbon centre, and low carbon technology hub, the UAE is the host country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). IRENA was created to promote the widespread and increased adoption and sustainable use of all forms or renewable energy. Being the host to this first truly global organization devoted solely to renewable energy technologies is a good sign of commitment and leadership of the UAE both in the Arab region and internationally. International discussion is nothing without domestic action. Abu Dhabi has created Masdar City, which is working on the 100 MW Nour and 100 MW Shams solar PV and CSP installations. It has also created a new obligatory sustainable construction index called Estidama. In Dubai, the focus has been on energy efficiency, with new targets on commercial and residential energy efficiency introduced, and the overall energy pricing structure reformed. The UAE hosted the World Future Energy Summit (WFES) for the fifth time this year. WFES is an annual event that draws major players of the renewable energy world to Abu Dhabi, from both the private and public sectors. During this year's WFES, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon officially unveiled his Sustainability for All initiative, which seeks to lay the groundwork to elevate 3 billion people out of energy poverty in a sustainable manner. The UAE also hosted the Clean Energy Ministerial in 2011, which is regarded as a key forum with the potential to monitor and drive action on the development and deployment of low carbon energy, and “Eye on Earth,"  a new symposium dedicated to sharing the best available information on climate change and natural phenomena.</p><h4>How does the UK work with the UAE government to promote dialogue on international climate change negotiations?</h4><p>We hold regular bilateral meetings with UAE government officials at all levels during the UNFCCC international climate change negotiations, both to discuss our mutual positions and ensure we are working together toward a positive outcome. For example, we are both actively involved in the negotiations on technology aimed at putting in place an international technology mechanism to accelerate the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p><h4>What's next for the climate change agenda?</h4><p>The ultimate aim for the UNFCCC negotiations is building the international climate change regime required to limit global average temperature rises to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The most cost-effective way of delivering the 2°C goal is to work toward a single, legally binding instrument, applicable to all. There is currently no plausible alternative. The UK is not letting up in its efforts to get a global legally binding agreement. The UNFCCC process moves a step at a time, but the substantial progress made at Durban conference showed what can be achieved. The outcome we want to see at Doha is one that delivers on each element of the Durban agreements. We need to adopt a second commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to begin on January 1, 2013, as part of a transition to a wider single, comprehensive, and global legally binding climate regime. We also need to further advance our work toward the adoption of a new legally binding agreement under the Convention by 2015 at the latest that is applicable to all. We need to take forward the work plan we launched in Durban to enhance the pre-2020 mitigation ambition. We also agreed some specific tasks for this year under the negotiating track on Long-Term Cooperative Action, which we agreed will close in Doha.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of GE's operations in the region, and what role does Dubai play in the region?<br></h4><p>GE has been in the region for over 80 years. We started operations by supporting the oil and gas sector in power generation. People know us as what we used to be, an appliance company. There is a lot that the Middle East region has had to offer, particularly Dubai. Over the years we have found new ways to strengthen our relationships and partnerships. Just look at the region's growth—over the last 30 years, Dubai has transformed dramatically. Though it has limited natural resources, the city wanted to monetize these resources for infrastructure development. First, Dubai built a very strong infrastructure network to help improve people's lives with electricity, clean water, and transportation systems. Second, Dubai used this monetization to build a good healthcare and education system. Third, Dubai knew that its energy resources were limited, and it wanted to diversify its economy industrially. Finally, Dubai wanted to stimulate tourism by offering many support systems. GE also has strong business functions as an oil and gas company, and we were in a position to help monetize the region's natural resources. We're a power generation company, a water company, and a transportation company with aviation and even rail. We're also a healthcare company. Basically, GE is an industrial company. Until recently we were also in the media sector with NBC Universal, and we are now in partnership with Comcast. Dubai's vision and what GE has to offer matches perfectly. That's why we increased our presence to suit the region's needs. Today's leaders see us as a partner that can help them achieve goals in every sector. They see us as a part of their vision, just as they have seen a GE refrigerator as a reliable and integral part of the home. We recently set up our headquarters in Dubai so that we could better cover the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey, and Pakistan.</p><h4>Although GE has been in the region for 80 years, the market is still considered to have huge growth potential. What changes have you witnessed in your seven years in this position?</h4><p>The first time I came to Dubai was in 1976. I came to visit my father who was working here. I remember the four-hour journey from Abu Dhabi to Dubai. Today, if you take the same road, it boasts multiple lanes each way and the journey takes just an hour and 15 minutes. It has been very fascinating to see the infrastructure grow. The education and healthcare systems have also seen great improvements. Dubai has become a hub for people to fly from Latin America to Japan due to the strength of the national airlines. I was among 30 international business representatives who were invited to His Highness' palace. He sat down with us and asked us what help we needed to grow, and what issues we were facing. This, over the years, has helped to break down bureaucracy and get things moving more quickly. The fundamentals continue to be important in Dubai, and that will keep it going strong.</p><h4>You've been very involved in infrastructure development from the ground up. What is in progress now that's exciting for you?</h4><p>Power generation and the industrialization of Dubai offer exciting opportunities. We have three facilities for water, oil and gas, and energy. We also have a wastewater treatment facility.  All these facilities use advanced GE equipment. Not only are we participating in power generation, but we're also providing clean and environmentally efficient water. We re-use the water, both for industry and waste. We are improving the health of the people and the quality and cost of health care. In the aviation sector, Emirates is among GE's largest customers. We lease aircraft, sell engines, and we have built a training facility. We have been working very closely with the Dubai Executive Council in the energy sector to make operations more efficient.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define Efes Kazakhstan's current strengths?</h4><p>Efes Kazakhstan is one of the leading companies in the beverage industry, and is a very important player in the Kazakhstani market. In terms of reputation and brand recognition, the company has a very strong position. We entered the market in November 1997 via an initial investment in Karaganda. In our first year, we were ranked fifth in the beer market with a 10% market share and an annual production volume of 8 million liters. With the right investments and strategies, we increased our position to first place by September 2010. As of January 2012, Efes has an annual production capacity of more than 280 million liters and a 52% market share. We have 11 brands in our portfolio, including international brand names such as Bavaria and Amsterdam Navigator. We also have strong local brands, such as KruzhkaSvezhego, Karagandinskoe, and Tyan-Shan. Additionally, we produce Bely Medved, which was created in Russia and made international through our group. We set a goal for Efes Kazakhstan to become the most admired company in Kazakhstan by 2020. In line with this aim, we have heavily invested in the management of both our factories. At the same time we understand the responsibility that comes with operating in the alcoholic beverage sector, and therefore we carry out strong social responsibility programs to promote responsible drinking.</p><h4>Anadolu Group and SABMiller have formed an exclusive partnership. How would you characterize the prospects for collaboration?</h4><p>In order to create synergies between the two companies and exchange knowledge, a strategic alliance between Anadolu Group and SABMiller was established. Through this alliance, SABMiller's beer operations in Russia and Ukraine, and sales rights in the CIS region and the Middle East, will be transferred to Efes in exchange for 24% of Efes' shares. Currently, SABMiller does not operate production facilities in Kazakhstan, and therefore the regional experience and presence of Efes in the domestic market will benefit both companies. We will soon incorporate leading SABMiller products such as Miller, Grolsch, Pilsner Urquell, ZolotayaBochka, and Kozel into our portfolio. Through its global strength, SABMiller offers Efes a window on the entire world.</p><h4>What comparisons can be made between the beer segments in Kazakhstan and Turkey, where Efes is originally from?</h4><p>In Turkey, there is no strong segmentation in the beer market. Customers are served Efes Pilsner at five-star hotels as well as at corner shops in low-income neighborhoods. In contrast, Kazakhstan has a very fragmented market, and each brand has its own market position. There are five segments: super premium, premium, upper mainstream, lower mainstream, and economy. We focus on the top four segments, and the Efes Pilsner brand belongs to the premium segment, which accounts for about 9% of the total market. Therefore, although Efes Pilsner is a very successful flagship brand in its own segment, it is not our main volume brand in Kazakhstan. On the other hand, the consumer base for hard liquor in Turkey—with the exception of rakı—is small and very specific. In Kazakhstan, the consumption rate of vodka is decreasing due to health concerns. This is a positive trend for beer, but it is also beneficial for consumers. Indeed, beer contains 100% natural products and its alcohol content is much lower than strong spirits by volume.</p><h4>How would you assess the tax regulations concerning beer in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>In many countries, beer is not considered an alcoholic beverage; however, in Kazakhstan this is not the case. Beer is defined as an alcoholic beverage, and all legislative limitations concerning alcohol apply to beer as well. And if we look at the taxation of drinks with different levels of alcohol content, the excise tax for beer is higher than that for vodka per liter.</p><h4>How does Eurasian economic integration affect the beer market in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>After the establishment of the Customs Union in 2011, certain issues are being handled on a supranational level. Currently, negotiations concerning many topics are in progress, in addition to decisions related to the beer market of Kazakhstan and the Customs Union as a whole. The Union of Beer Producers, of which I am the president, is making efforts to change the status of beer and establish its differentiation from strong spirits. While the Customs Union made it easier to trade among the member states, it made it more complicated to export to other countries. In fact, 100% of our exports are destined for Kyrgyzstan. The remaining CIS markets are handled by Anadolu Efes' headquarters in Turkey. With the establishment of a permanent and healthy Customs Union, we are expecting expansion to our neighboring countries and increased benefits for all parties. I see growth potential and believe that it will be good for Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What export opportunities does this integration provide Kazakhstani brewers?</h4><p>As the Russian market has a capacity surplus and logistics expenses are high, Russia is not a potential export market for our beer. Moreover, Efes already has a very strong market presence in Russia, with a portfolio very similar to that of Kazakhstan. Should we observe a capacity shortage in Kazakhstan or in Russia, the Customs Union can be an opportunity for Efes to make more efficient use of its capacity in both operations.</p><h4>How do you see 2012 shaping up?</h4><p>Our goal is to continue on the path of sustainable and healthy growth. While the sector is projected to grow in single-digit terms in 2012, we intend to reach higher growth rates and increase our market share. At the end of 2011, the global macroeconomic outlook was not entirely optimistic. However, with the latest developments and new measures in place to resolve the European debt crisis, we have a more positive view of 2012.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Kazatomprom's vision in developing a more value-added chain in uranium and other rare earth materials production?<br></h4><p>Kazatomprom is successfully implementing the strategic objective of creating a vertically integrated company active at all levels of the nuclear fuel cycle to produce export-oriented products with the highest value-added. This we are seeking to accomplish through partnerships with leading companies operating in this field, which can bring their experience, expertise, and technology to the table to enhance Kazakhstan's advancements toward its goal. First of all, we are striving to gain a foothold in all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle, and one of the priorities is the construction of nuclear power plants. Kazatomprom is pursuing this target through multiple mechanisms including an alliance with Toshiba and Westinghouse, close cooperation with AREVA, and the planned creation of an alliance with Russia's Rosatom in the form of a joint uranium company.</p><p>There is also an agreement, once implemented, that will allow us to benefit from commercial services for uranium enrichment and the fabrication of fuel assemblies, which constitutes the final product in the nuclear industry. It should be noted that Kazatomprom, as a shareholder in the International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC) and Uranium Enrichment Center (UEC), gets access to Russian centrifuges, which are the most cost-effective technology for the separation of uranium isotopes, having become a part of the uranium enrichment market. We also intend to participate in the construction of nuclear power plants abroad, in particular directly through ventures with China.</p><p>The decision to build a conversion plant with Cameco will be finalized in 2012. By the end of 2011 we completed the creation of a joint venture with Rosatom to enrich uranium at its processing plant in Novouralsk. In 2009, during the official visit of France's former president Sarkozy to Kazakhstan, we signed an agreement on establishing a joint company called IFASTAR. This agreement is yet another fruitful result of the structural and long-term ties Kazatomprom and AREVA enjoy, and for us it is another milestone in the creation of a vertically integrated company that manufactures products with the highest value-added. A feasibility study for the project is complete. In 2010 Kazatomprom launched new high-tech projects, particularly those involving the establishment of the country's science-intensive industries for rare earth metals. In Spring 2010, Kazatomprom and Japan's Sumitomo Corporation signed the founding documents for the Summit Atom Rare Earth Company (SARECO) in the field of rare earth materials. The purpose of this joint venture is to create a vertically integrated company for the production of rare earth products with high value-added. The company has also signed a protocol of intent on cooperation in the field of rare metals with Toshiba Corporation.</p><h4>How do Kazatomprom's industrial advancements, such as high-tech tantalum and beryllium production, fit into industrial diversification efforts?</h4><p>Kazatomprom has advanced technology and extensive experience in the production of tantalum and beryllium products. Kazatomprom's Ulba Metallurgical Plant has a complete production cycle from processing the raw materials to the finished products of beryllium, tantalum, and niobium. Currently, our Ulba plant satisfies about 12% of world demand in tantalum and niobium and about one-third of the world's demand for beryllium. We are going to manufacture high value-added end-products for the needs of the electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. We are particularly looking to establish the production of superconducting materials for magnets. Now, we are working on a modernization program for our current production cycles.</p><h4>What business opportunities do you see for local and foreign investors in uranium and other rare-earth element production-related fields?</h4><p>Kazatomprom is interested in partners and co-investors that will bring their strength to the world uranium market and that will move us to the further stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, in which Kazakhstan is not yet present, such as conversion, enrichment, and the fabrication of fuel assemblies. We are ready to cooperate with the suppliers and consumers of uranium. However, to participate in the development of mineral resources of Kazakhstan, foreign partners must provide our country access to new markets and technologies, comparable to the projects' economic parameters. The company already is working under these terms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights of 2011?</h4><p>On a global basis, 2011 was a fantastic success. We experienced the best results in the company's near 40-year history, and it was the same story for our operations in Kazakhstan. The CIS region as a whole grew very quickly, and in Kazakhstan we experienced growth at faster multiples than that of other markets in the region. We have been confident in what Kazakhstan has to offer based on the fundamental economic structure of the economy and its correlation to SAP market dominance in many industries. During 2011, we expanded our footprint within the subsoil sector, made significant progress in the public sector, and formulated a structured and pragmatic program to address the SME sector, which has started to gain momentum.</p><p>As we look forward to 2012 and beyond, we are excited about the prospect of promoting new innovations in the sphere of real time (in memory) analytics and especially our mobile solutions and cloud offerings, which will complement and further enhance the value our clients can leverage from SAP innovations. Overall, we are very satisfied with our 2011 performance and remain confident and committed to our strategy to enable Kazakhstan to “Run Better."</p><h4>What strategies have you followed to achieve such a successful year?</h4><p>In order to realize the ambitions that we have set forth in our growth plan, we have invested significantly in both increasing the market awareness as to the tangible business value of SAP technologies, as well as developing the professional skills, certification, and volume of the consulting partners that we have within our local ecosystem. These measures are essential not only to project success and value realization for our clients, but also to form sustainable local content and employment opportunities in the local IT sector. In Kazakhstan, our strategy is to engage with our clients strategically, meaning that we seek to form long-term partnerships with clear and measurable objectives. We aim to be involved in formulating modernization plans in line with client and state objectives, such as the Productivity 2020 program, the People's IPO, and the topic of financial and operational governance. All of these elements are starting to come together: the local content, the investment, and the value realization programs. When we have forward-looking visibility, it gives us the opportunity to maintain or even increase our investment program in the region. The year 2011 marked the success of a good strategy that was launched several years ago.</p><h4>How do you see the demand for SAP consultants developing?</h4><p>In a word: significantly. As a rough rule of thumb, for every dollar invested in software, there is a ratio of investment required for implementation, ranging from 1:2 to 1:3. Kazakhstan is our regional hub in Central Asia, which includes Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. More than 90% of our business currently comes from Kazakhstan, which enjoys the political drive, expanding innovation, and a large amount of foreign investment; this cannot yet be said for the surrounding Central Asian states. However, if we acknowledge the vast resource wealth of Central Asia (outside of Kazakhstan) and take a mid-term perspective, we anticipate that the surrounding regions will need to adopt SAP technology to tackle the same challenges that Kazakhstan has been addressing in recent years. This, coupled with maturing demand in the Russian and Belarus regions, provides the basis for Kazakhstan to become a net exporter of IT consulting services and intellectual property (IP) in the medium to long term. The CIS market will reach a value of $2.5 billion-$3 billion by 2015, and will continue to grow; the question is where the human capital will come from and to what extent Kazakhstani businesses will catch the wave.</p><h4>How does SAP benefit the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>SAP's global mission statement is to “Make the World Run Better." As 63% of the world's GDP touches an SAP system, this is not as far-fetched a statement as it may at first appear. In Kazakhstan, we are able to introduce benefits in the short term, such as increasing the operational efficiency of a company and enabling the governance models that increase the confidence of both national and international investment communities. Within the region there is a lot of work to do to modernize via the adoption of global best practices, and thus the need to develop the local “knowledge economy." As an indication of our long-term commitment to the region, in 2011, the SAP board approved a project to translate our core product range into the Kazakh language to support the state in its initiative to retain the nation's cultural heritage. The project is enormous; there are more than 30,000 terms, words, and phrases that are used in IT systems today, and many of those words do not exist in the language. Kazakh is an old language, and this project will help drive its evolution. The project is a multimillion-dollar investment spanning more than two years. Does the market today justify that investment? It's questionable, but we believe that the market in the future will benefit from this.</p><h4>What level of demand do you see from smaller actors in the economy?</h4><p>SAP is perceived to be exclusively for global companies that run very large, expensive, and complex operations. This is a far cry from reality today, where we are able to provide both industry-specific preconfigured software and rapid deployment services solutions, which vastly reduce project costs and time to benefit. We are tackling the SME market by providing transparency in the form of fixed prices, costs, and scope packages. Another way that we address SMEs is by working at the state level to provide cloud services; this changes the game for prospective SME clients by removing the barriers of entry and adoption both technically and from a cost perspective. As a consequence, this creates opportunities for new services and hosting partners. SMEs should be able to gain access to the global best practice technology through SAP, but in a virtual environment at an affordable price without the need for capital investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did International IT University (IITU) come into existence?<br></h4><p>It opened on the initiative of President Nazarbayev in April 2009, and IITU has already been widely recognized as a successful breakthrough university. It has been called upon to boost the industrial innovative development of Kazakhstan. IITU has established extensive links with educational and commercial leaders of the world, such as its main partner iCarnegie, a structural unit of Carnegie Mellon. IITU is actively implementing numerous projects with Malaysian IT universities, including the University of Kuala Lumpur, University Tenaga Nasional, as well as the London Academy of Management and Business, Riga Technical University (RTU), ITM-St. Petersburg, and other universities around the world. Top-ranking IT companies such as Microsoft, Cisco, Huawei, and IBM have all opened laboratories at IITU.</p><h4>What is the background and scope of IITU's collaboration with Latvia's RTU?</h4><p>In May 2012 members from RTU's administration made a friendly visit to IITU. RTU is a very large and important university, which has two Nobel laureates among its graduates. With its ample educational experience in electronics and computer technologies, this EU partner raises the international profile of our university. Our Latvian colleagues have extensive experience in the field of radio electronics and robotics, particularly in robot-sumo and underwater robots under development for NATO orders. In the framework of our cooperation, RTU will train our specialists in Master's and PhD programs under our exchange programs. We are also planning to do joint research. There is also a preliminary agreement about an IITU faculty member visit to RTU in Latvia in January 2013. Our partnership envisages offering joint training courses that facilitate our students' integration into the global professional community and therefore increase their global employment opportunities. In fact, organizing courses from leading vendors is a very important part of the learning process for us. Such courses are not only of practical, but also of methodological value.</p><h4>How do you see IITU's competitive advantage vis-í -vis other private higher education institutions?</h4><p>The main competitive advantage of IITU is that it is an industry-oriented university, which is the reason why the state provides substantial support to us largely in the form of grants. In the first year we received 300 grants, and now we have 312 grants in addition to 30 grants for the Master's program. The government supports us by allocating state orders; for example, we are now engaged in creating an e-government system. We are striving to train highly qualified IT specialists that meet international standards. An important facet of such support is our cooperation with state holding Zerde.</p><h4>How does IITU seek to bring innovation to Kazakhstan's IT industry?</h4><p>As a young university we are meant to develop new IT technologies. In the second and third year, IITU students create their own innovative IT projects. For example, 12 IITU student projects were presented in Astana at the recent “Innovative Kazakhstan: A Look Into the Future After 20 Years of Independence" forum.</p><p>How do you see the state's role in economic development?</p><p>The role of the state is very important for national economic development. For example, look at Malaysia and Singapore, which set a suitable example for us not only because we have a similar mentality, but also because they are the leading economies of Asia where the role of the state has always been very important.</p><h4>What are some highlights from your future plans?</h4><p>We plan to develop three-stage education and introduce undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate programs; open three faculties in software engineering, information systems, and computer science; create a university college; expand our digital library; offer e-teaching and e-learning opportunities; and establish a special e-learning portal and new research laboratory, in particular for Open-Source 3D graphics.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see growth potential?</h4><p>Compared with developed countries, our market is still emerging, but the IT market may potentially grow two fold in a matter of years. Telecommunications, satellite communications, the oil and gas industry, and the public sector are growing at an impressively fast pace, showing our immense untapped potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan has inherited an extensive space legacy from the Soviet Union. How has Kazakhstan's government sought to maintain and upgrade the industry's infrastructure?</h4><p>Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan inherited the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Although this facility is located in Kazakhstan, the country can neither maintain nor develop it alone. The operation and development of the cosmodrome is carried out in cooperation with Russia according to two key agreements. The first one, dated March 28, 1994, was signed between the two countries to lay out the basic principles and conditions of use for Baikonur. The second agreement dates back to December 10, 1994, and was signed to lease the complex to the Russian Federation for a period of 20 years until 2014, with a possible extension of the lease term by 10 years until 2024. The initiative to extend the term of the lease until 2050 has come from the Russian side as the country annually invests tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure development and maintenance of the cosmodrome. The Russian Federation intends to continue to invest in the maintenance and development of Baikonur. In this regard, our countries have agreed to work together to ensure the continued effective use of the cosmodrome in the interests of Russia and Kazakhstan through the implementation of international cooperation programs.</p><h4>Kazakhstan has adopted a very comprehensive space program. How would you assess the significance of this program for the country's quest to become more developed?</h4><p>Provided Kazakhstan's vast territory and rich resources, space is an area of geopolitical, economic, scientific, and practical interest. Without involvement in space activities, it is extremely difficult to create a common information space, to study and rationally use natural resources, or to conduct environmental monitoring in our country. President Nazarbayev has always devoted special attention to the country's space activities, and provides great support. The President has set the task of developing and implementing a phased, long-term program for the creation and development of the space industry. In this regard, for the further development of space activities, KazCosmos designed a sectoral program for the development of space activities for 2010-2014 that aims to create a fully fledged space industry as a high-tech sector that contributes to the acceleration of industrial innovative development in the republic, strengthening national security and defense. In accordance with the industrial program, KazCosmos was set the task of creating and developing our space infrastructure, developing a scientific and technological base, and ensuring the right human resources and international cooperation. For the creation of targeted space systems and technologies, the following projects are being undertaken: the production and launch of a series of communications and broadcasting KazSat satellites; the creation of an Earth remote-sensing space system; the manufacturing of a high-precision satellite navigation system; the construction of an assembly, integration, and testing complex for spacecraft; and the development of the national space-monitoring system.</p><h4>Kazakhstan started the construction of its space center in Astana in 2010. What is the status of construction at the moment?</h4><p>President Nazarbayev's visit to France in June 2008 provided strong impetus to the selection of a strategic partner to create projects and promote the use of remote space sensing as well as an assembly and test facility for space vehicles. The assembly, integration, and testing complex for spacecraft will create a high-tech enterprise specializing in space technology components and payload elements. This is the only enterprise of its kind in the CIS. During President Nazarbayev's visit to France in October 2010, Kazakhstan signed two contracts with EADS Astrium, a strategic partner that Kazakhstan will collaborate with in the supply and installation of test sites and services to support the design and construction of spacecraft. For this purpose a joint Kazakhstan-French enterprise—Ghalam—was established. The joint venture will focus on the execution of domestic and international orders for satellites, and will provide the assembly and testing of spacecraft for purposes such as communications, broadcasting, and remote sensing data. In accordance with the founding documents, the contribution of EADS Astrium in the authorized capital of the joint venture will be 27.5% of the total amount. Also, EADS Astrium will place orders worth ‚¬60 million. The future National Space Center will be located on the left bank near the racetrack in Astana on an area of 30 hectares, and it will house production, research, administrative, and social complexes in addition to a museum and planetarium.</p><h4>How does multilateral cooperation benefit your activities?</h4><p>KazCosmos is actively developing international cooperation with foreign countries and international organizations for the efficient development of its space activities, and is attracting world-class technologies. This will allow Kazakhstan to create a space industry and begin to use space science, engineering, and technology for the economic development, safety, and welfare of its citizens as quickly and effectively as possible. Kazakhstan's main strategic partner is Russia, and two partners cooperate on joint space projects at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. In 2009, a strategic partnership with France was established in the field of space activities. On the basis of an intergovernmental agreement, national company “Kazakhstan Gharysh Sapary" and EADS Astrium are actively cooperating on two major projects: the creation of a space system for the remote sensing of the territory of Kazakhstan and the establishment of an assembly and testing facility for spacecraft in Astana. Kazakhstan has signed international cooperation agreements for the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes with the governments and space agencies of Russia, Ukraine, France, Israel, Germany, India, China, Japan, and South Korea. We have conducted meetings and negotiations with potential partners from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Thailand, with whom relevant agreements were signed. At the present time, KazCosmos is in talks with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In addition, KazCosmos is continuing the development of a satellite technology megaproject. The activities of KazCosmos within the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space will also continue, as well as cooperation within the CIS and other international organizations. An important factor in the development of national space activities and the participation of Kazakhstan in international space cooperation is the access of the country to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Kazakhstan has met all the requirements of the MTCR to accede to international treaties on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and has adopted a package of regulations to ensure the effective export control of missile systems, components, and technologies. Currently, work is continuing in this direction.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Heads Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[heads-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main characteristics of the company's 2020 vision?</h4><p>All of our projects have the full political support of the Prime Minister. The National Space Agency has a strategic development plan for 2011-2015, and this plan was approved by the government in February 2011. Additionally, under the Space Agency's jurisdiction, we have drawn up a development plan for 2011-2020. Our strategy has also been adopted by government resolution. The main project, which we are now working on, is a national space center, which in itself is a mega project consisting of several smaller projects. The largest of these is a spacecraft assembly and testing complex. That is where we are creating the heart and brains of the complex, a specialized design office of space technology (SKTB). It operates in conjunction with the spacecraft assembly and testing facility. The strategic plan foresees the completion of SKTB by December 2012 and the spacecraft assembly and testing complex by July 2013. Thus, we are creating a production base for the space industry. The second project that we are carrying out at the National Space Center is a  Earth remote-sensing space system. It consists of two segments: the ground complex and the space segment. The latter includes two spacecraft. One unit will carry a high-resolution  payload with one-meter resolution. It will have the capacity to scan 220,000 sqm per day with a swath width of 20 kilometers. The device is planned to start operating in December 2014. It will be manufactured in France in conjunction with our strategic partner EADS Astrium. The partnership agreement was signed during French President Sarkozy's visit to Astana in 2009 and President Nazarbayev's visit to Paris in 2010.</p><h4>How important are international partnerships?</h4><p>The second spacecraft has a medium resolution of 6.5 meters. It can cover 1 million sqm a day and within 30 days can completely cover the entire territory of Kazakhstan. This satellite, built in cooperation with the UK and France, will be launched in December 2013. With our British partners we are producing a medium-resolution payload in the UK. While we create our funds and power, we purchase the satellites from the French side. Starting in 2014, we will be doing it on our own. To do this we are building a specialized design office. We invest in our human resources. Our objective is to provide technology transfer. Thus, we are creating not only an industrial and technological base for the space industry, but also developing staff to ensure that our people can design  projects themselves. From 2013, we will start sending people to France so that they learn how to maintain and operate spacecraft. We just signed a contract with another European company, IABG from Germany, which has 50 years of experience in the testing of space technology and we will work with it as an external consultant.</p><h4>What is the practical use of these endeavors?</h4><p>First of all, for three years we will train 130 people who will acquire practical skills in designing, manufacturing, and assembling spacecraft. This will have a great impact on the quality of human capital. Secondly, if Kazakhstan can manufacture spacecraft domestically, money will be saved. Thirdly, the whole world is now using satellite images more extensively than ever. For example, the US established the National Spatial Data Infrastructure System (NSDI), the satellite imagery archive that has been used in daily life for 20 years now. In turn, Europe began to adopt this idea only five years ago. On the basis of our satellite images we will create such a system. Around 20 years ago we established the national system of space monitoring (NSKM). The main components of space monitoring are three pillars: a database, satellite ranges, and geo-portals, through which there will be access to this information database. We hope to release the status of fires and floods through the online system.</p><h4>How do you seek to improve the global navigation capacity of Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The global navigation project focuses on the establishment of ground infrastructure of highly accurate satellite navigation systems covering the entire territory of Kazakhstan. In the world today there are two global navigation systems: GPS and Russia's Glonass. So far, we have cooperated with the Russian Glonass system. It consists of three subsystems: a spacecraft subsystem, a control management subsystem, and a subsystem of consumer navigation equipment. We are now building a system that consists of 60 stations in the territory of Kazakhstan and is much better than GPS. We can give the consumer the ability to control their traffic flows and their vehicles. To do this we created a differential monitoring center in Astana. We have a mobile station differential correction. And now we are building a naval differential regional station in the city of Aktau.</p><h4>What opportunities are there within your project for foreign investors? What role can the private sector play in the development of this project?</h4><p>Kazakhstan needs only 20% of the remote sensing capacity of its satellite resources. The remaining 80% can be used by foreign investors. The second effect is that by investing in our projects, investors can join us to have a portion of the proceeding benefits. We are now living in a world of global information, navigation, and connections, and all these must be combined with global reach. In the long run, and in the second phase of development, we will be attracting private investment. Now, we have to show investors the possibility of a multiplier effect. The concluding remarks of the TransEurasia-2011 conference highlights the significance of the regular use of space technologies in the transport and freight logistics flows throughout Eurasia. Hence, it is our goal to create an international group of technical experts, as well as to integrate satellite systems in the Customs Union and Eurasia, which will streamline and consolidate the efforts of all states to improve the efficiency of transport and logistics systems.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company developed since its establishment in 1998?</h4><p>Today, Europe-Asia-Transit (EAT LLP) is one of the largest transportation and logistics companies operating in Kazakhstan. Since its establishment the company has been through a few major stages that have contributed to the formation, strengthening, and expansion of the company. We started as a ground-handling agent providing services in temporary storage at Almaty International Airport. Quickly enough, we came to the decision that in order to grow we needed to expand the line of services we provided. Thus, freight-forwarding services have developed into one of the principal activities of the company. Our country, situated between Europe and Asia, enjoys a unique geographical position, so we started organizing new freight routes by integrating different modes of transport. Through the development of new multimodal delivery schemes we have been able to reduce costs and increase freight flows to the country. With input from our company, the first transit/transfer zone was put into operation at Almaty International Airport in 2000 in order to increase transit flows and also improve service quality and increase the speed of cargo handling. To improve the quality of incoming cargo transport handling and provide various operational solutions, the construction of the first multimodal cargo terminal in Asia was initiated by our company and started with our direct participation in 2005. This project was approved by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and received a positive evaluation from representatives of the Eurasian Economic Community and the State Customs Committee. To proceed with the project's development, a Memorandum of Cooperation between our company and the Customs Committee was signed. Throughout the course of its development, the company has strictly followed state initiatives and guidelines stipulated in programs such as Strategy of Transport Sector Development of up to 2015. The company is a member of international and national organizations such as IATA, TIACA, FAGSA, the American Chamber of Commerce, and it is included in the suppliers databases of the Ministry of Industry and Innovative Technologies and the Ministry of Oil and Gas, as well as in First Point Kazakhstan, a database developed to register all suppliers to the oil and gas industry in Kazakhstan. According to the Air Cargo World magazine, EAT LLP was the only Kazakhstani company in the top-20 freight forwarders of the Asia Pacific region in 2008. Over the period of its operation, EAT has established itself as a reliable partner both in Kazakhstan and abroad. Yet, we forge ahead and seek new development options. Thus, the new mission was set in 2010 to create a national brand that would be associated with reliability and high-quality services meeting international standards in the field of transport logistics. Thereby, we are expanding the geography and range of provided services to obtain the opportunity to provide customer service. In 2010, the company adopted a development strategy that also involved the opening of 25 offices all around the world. Now we have branches all across Kazakhstan, as well as foreign branch offices in Hannover, Frankfurt, Vilnius, Seoul, Sharjah, and Istanbul, and six offices in major US cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, Atlanta, and Chicago. Moreover, this is just a part of our plans aimed at expansion on the global market. These achievements would have been impossible without the appreciation and support of the state.</p><h4>EAT LLP has received numerous awards for quality. How did you develop your team?</h4><p>Working face to face with the customers we understand that the professional qualification of our employees is of crucial importance as it affects the level and quality of service and the company's reputation. That is exactly why we place strong emphasis on the training and professional development of employees. The company has a training center and there is a special training system for new employees. Furthermore, whenever we enter into agreements with big international companies, we ensure that these agreements provide for skill and knowledge sharing for our employees through joint workshops and the exchange of staff. In addition to investing in training, we constantly expand our technical base, and every year we try to offer new products to meet the most sophisticated customer needs; there is a special research team engaged in the development of these products. We see the EAT team as our own family, and each team member as a member of the family because we know that the company's internal environment affects its operations. To strengthen these traditions the company organizes corporate team-building exercises and outings on a regular basis. Providing that we fully appreciate the value of each employee we always try to help our colleagues by rendering support, creating favorable working conditions, and providing employees with all wage supplements. This affects the quality of the teamwork in direct proportion. The high quality of teamwork is attested by our clients and certified by well-deserved awards. The list of our clients includes, but is not limited to, major national and international companies such as Kazakhmys, Kazakhtelecom, Air Astana, Kazzinc, Coca-Cola, State Air Company Berkut, the OSCE, Fashion Retail Kazakhstan, Caspian Offshore Construction, VILED, Highvill, Wirtgen Group, Citic Construction, Sinopec, Sembol, the Banknote Factory of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Halyk Bank, Zhezkazganredmet, and the US and Japanese embassies. The company is actively involved in the logistics processes of the country's industrial development. We are participating in the reconstruction of the Atyrau oil refinery, the construction and logistical support for the Pavlodar Chemical Plant, and construction of the largest asphalt plant in the Mangystau region, as well as the construction of Heating Power Plant (HPP) 3 in Astana. We handled the transportation of the Coca-Cola Company plant from Kazakhstan to Pakistan, provided logistics for the construction of the Khan Shatyr complex in Astana, and assisted in the organization of the Beijing 2008 Olympic torch relay in Kazakhstan. EAT LLP was awarded with and “Arch of Europe" gold medal for Technology and Quality, a certificate of the World Customs Organization, and has been repeatedly recognized as the best brokerage company. Since 2007, an annual audit of the quality management system has been carried out at the company in accordance with ISO 9001:2000 accreditation.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the greatest demand for your services?</h4><p>Kazakhstan, being a young state with unique natural resources, is in the process of the active development of its industrial capabilities. With this objective in view the government has developed such programs as the national development plan “Business Roadmap 2020," the Forced Industrial and Innovation Development Program, and more. Thus, there is a universal development of chemical and energy industries as well as oil and gas, mining, metallurgical mining, and aviation sectors in the country. In these areas, we see the principal demand for our services. The rapid development of the state determines the basic demand for the whole chain of logistic services. Working from new freight routes, implementing infrastructure projects, broadening services across the country, and bringing in transit cargo traffic are all factors that single EAT LLP out as a unique company able to provide the complete range of services that the client might need.</p><h4>What trends do you see emerging?</h4><p>Logistics has the potential to become a leading sector in Kazakhstan. The arrangements developed by the government will enable Kazakhstan to become a major transit hub in Central Asia. This is the main trend. The geopolitical position of Kazakhstan as a bridge between Europe and Asia, the formation of the Customs Union with a common customs legislation as a consequence, the construction of infrastructure facilities, as well as the favorable investment climate determine the basic trends of transit and its growth. EAT LLP was one of the first companies carrying out transit from China via Kazakhstan to Europe and other countries. EAT LLP is actively involved in the development and implementation of a number of infrastructure projects conducive to favorable conditions for the growth of the country's transit potential. We believe that these and many other instruments will turn Kazakhstan into a Eurasian transit bridge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What events have influenced the trends in the mass retail market in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Despite its relatively small population and geographically isolated location, Kazakhstan is increasingly attractive for mass retail chains. Fundamentals such as political stability and macroeconomic growth are strong in the country. As economic conditions improve, we see an emerging and strengthening share for the middle class, whose natural demand for goods and services is growing along with its disposable income. Whereas in the West there is an oversupply of goods and services targeted at the middle class, in Kazakhstan there is an undersupply that triggers more activity in the commercial real estate and retail segments. Inditex Group, the world's largest retail group with brands such as Zara and Bershka in its portfolio, bought out its local affiliate and began direct operations in Kazakhstan. For foreign retailers, this indicates that the Kazakhstani market is ready for Western companies. More international brands are considering launching direct operations in Kazakhstan, such as DeFacto, Koton, and LC Waikiki. Others seek regional partners with Russian and Middle Eastern retail groups. Local companies with operations in the retail business are also looking to form local retail groups. In mass-market retail, these local companies are developing their brands and corporate identities to be competitive. The lifestyle and entertainment segments are also developing fast, with cinemas and toy store chains entering the market. In general, we see these developments as very positive for our company; the number of deals is increasing and property developers are providing the market with retail space that meets the demands of international brands, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p><h4>Aristan Group recently completed the renovation of the historical TsUM shopping mall in central Almaty. How did Aristan transform this obsolete urban structure into a modern facility that meets the standards of the 21st century?</h4><p>Aristan Group is a vertically integrated solutions provider for real estate developers and retailers. Thus, we provide services from consulting to concept creation, accompanying project management and providing engineering services with our international partners, with whom we have long-term relationships. We also own a construction general contractor. Aristan Group facilitated the TsUM project, developed by Retail Group Kazakhstan, by providing engineering solutions with the approval of the group and the Almaty Municipality. TsUM was originally built during the Soviet era. Although the structure was kept in place, 90% of the building and façade was renovated. We introduced smart building management, which uses energy and water efficiently. In this regard, we paid special attention to regenerating energy cycles within the heating and power systems. Previously, TsUM had corridors and small boutiques, and now the internal layout has significantly changed. Now, there are five operators that have street entrances, which creates an outdoor retail environment. These changes were planned and implemented through close consultation with the Almaty Municipality and Retail Group Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What is the significance of the TsUM project for Almaty's urban regeneration?</h4><p>TsUM is a unique project that entails the transformation of a national architectural treasure into a world-class street retail shopping center in a very high traffic area. In the Soviet Union, the central shopping district was initially planned for that area, with limited vehicle traffic and high pedestrian access. This area was neglected after Kazakhstan's independence, as new shopping centers were developed across the city in less central areas. The renovation of the historical TsUM center proves that there is investor interest in the historical center of Almaty. It constitutes a landmark project for the development of street retail in the historical center, and demonstrates the interest of very experienced international retailers to penetrate and grasp the market in the top locations of the city. We see very big potential in the area, similar to the famous İstiklal Avenue in Istanbul, where architectural heritage is successfully combined with state-of-the-art retail services. This is going to drive further restoration of the area and eventually create a unique retail experience for shoppers.</p><h4>Which projects and urban centers have the biggest potential for retail growth?</h4><p>The TsUM area is one of the top two retail locations in Almaty, along with the MEGA center. A third emerging project is the Dostyk Plaza, a project that TS Engineering and Development will start in 2012. This project signals a change in the funding schemes of real estate in the post-crisis period. Previously, banks heavily leveraged the structure of real estate development in Kazakhstan, which brought larger risks that materialized during the credit crunch. The Dostyk Plaza is a new kind of investment, where a local investor takes on a heavy portion of the investment instead of the banks. The shopping center at the Esentai Complex is about be finished. Initially announced to position itself as a high-class mall hosting a number of luxury brands, the center's spaces are too large for smaller brands. Therefore, the top challenge for the Esentai Complex is to balance these luxury brands with mass retailers without diluting the initial concept.</p><h4>How does the development of retail space in Kazakhstan compare to other countries that you are familiar with?</h4><p>Developments like City's or Demirören Plaza in Istanbul are not the appropriate schemes for Almaty. Istanbul is very crowded with limited and very expensive land available, and therefore vertical expansion is necessary. This also applies in Hong Kong, where the scarcity of land for real estate development sparks the development of vertical and multi-story shopping centers. In countries such as India, China, and Malaysia, we also see a drive toward retail space development. In Kazakhstan, two to four floors are ideal. This is because consumers are comfortable with horizontal space and there is more available land in the cities.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Aristan Group and the industry as a whole?</h4><p>We foresee that the next two to three years will be bright for Kazakhstan. The year 2012 will see a settling of the market and a new wave of confidence among investors, and there are many projects being reviewed as possibilities for the future. Financial institutions are eager to invest in projects that provide the best concept and location. Celebrating its fifth anniversary, Aristan is now growing as a group of companies and attracting more and more technology. Over the past five years, we have learned to acknowledge possible market risks and turbulences. We are aiming to learn more about the business and diversify within the real estate sector. We are now strongly developing retail construction and have many large projects in the pipeline.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have HeidelbergCement's operations evolved in the CIS region?</h4><p>HeidelbergCement is the global market leader in aggregates and a prominent player in the fields of cement, concrete, and other downstream activities, making it one of the world's largest manufacturers of building materials. The company employs some 54,000 people at 2,500 locations in more than 40 countries. The HeidelbergCement Group is present in Russia with three plants, and has plans to expand its operations in this part of the world. We have operations in Georgia and Ukraine as well. HeidelbergCement's network really gives a clue as to the importance we attach to the Central Asian region. As for Kazakhstan, HeidelbergCement has been interested in this part of the world and in 2005 it began discussions with the Bukhtarma Cement Company in the northeast of the country. Following negotiations at the end of the same year, HeidelbergCement decided to buy the company out, and since 2006 we have been operating the facility. In 2007 we started to develop our other business lines. At the moment, in addition to the Bukhtarma plant, we have five ready-mixed concrete plants in four locations: Almaty, Aktau, Astana, and Shetpe, and one aggregate quarry near Astana. HeidelbergCement is also investing heavily in West Kazakhstan. In Shetpe, near Aktau, we are building a new cement plant. Our plans are that in 2013 we will start production at this modern, dry-processing factory with a capacity up to 1 million tons of cement per year, and will build a second line when the demand is high enough. Our factory in the north is a wet-process plant that we are planning to convert into a dry-process plant as the future is in dry processing.</p><h4>How do you see Kazakhstan's cement production base and consumption channels developing?</h4><p>There are a lot of projects to be built and new capacity will soon be developed in Kazakhstan. The total production capacity in the cement industry in Kazakhstan is currently 8 million tons, and it is anticipated to increase up to 12.6 million-13 million tons in the coming years. Current market demand is estimated at 6.2 million tons, and that is expected to increase to 6.7 million tons in 2012. We cannot forget that around Kazakhstan there are a lot of competitors pushing cement into the country from Uzbekistan and Russia. However, we have observed that imports are decreasing, and in 2011 they were 40% lower than in the previous year. In my opinion, this trend will continue. On the one hand,  production capacity will increase competition, and on the other hand, it will decrease the need to resort to imports. It is positive for the country to produce locally and sell domestically. In Kazakhstan the sector is typically driven by big infrastructure projects financed by the government. What this country needs is more development from the private sector side, which we currently do not see much of, although the current trend looks set to continue.</p><h4>As a company registered in Kazakhstan, how do you strike a balance between directives from head office and initiatives from the field here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our head office gives us ideas, and we implement them according to our experience in the country. Innovation comes both from the field and head office. The Heidelberg Technology Center (HTC) supports our operations through its know-how and it is developing and providing us with technical assistance. Since 2006 we have spent millions of euros on modernization and environmental programs. We have added cement mills, silos, and Kazakhstan's first bag filters. In 2012 we are going to install the last filter, which will cost around ‚¬1 million. We also have ideas that we come up with here that you cannot create at head office. We are trying to implement a European culture of doing business in a market that was defined in the past by antiquated development and economic principles. After implementing all these changes, our organization should be led and managed by locals. We have standards that we are strict about, yet at the same time we are very flexible and close to the business here. We make decisions here in the field according to our corporate standards. We have freedom, and that helps our company to develop fast by taking quick decisions.</p><h4>What are the barriers to a higher level of FDI in the sector?</h4><p>Relative complications in the law and bureaucracy cause difficulties from time to time in areas such as licenses, visas, immigration procedures, and work permits. Apart from this, the long distances between population centers pose another difficulty. However, these are challenges that can be addressed over time, and Kazakhstan's government should work heavily on them. The country depends on the rail network because of the long distances between markets. Without a well-organized rail network, it is hard to shift goods and materials. The majority of the equipment is unfortunately old, and is getting older; investment is needed. In the second half of 2011 we faced delays in the delivery of raw materials due to logistics problems in the infrastructure network, resulting in a temporary halt to production. Many companies used this moment and increased prices, which stunted our decision-making. In the end it was a fight to get wagon space. In 2012 the market will not be easy, either. As the Russian and the Kazakhstani markets grow, more volume and logistics will be needed to be able to handle the increased output. Recently, I have observed that in Kazakhstan many infrastructure projects are being carried out to solve the logistic problems in this country. I see that there is a movement for development, but I would appreciate if more was invested in that area.</p><h4>How would you assess the latest trends in construction materials manufacturing?</h4><p>Unfortunately, most of the products come from abroad. Almost everything is imported. In the past, Kazakhstan produced a lot of interesting things, and now those factories are closed. There are goods imported from China, Russia, and Europe in the market now. This is not the best development path. Kazakhstan should focus on developing its own production, and the Customs Union with Belarus and Russia opens up new possibilities. In the building materials industry, for example, cement is manufactured locally, but the majority of all other construction materials come from abroad. We can find European technology in Kazakhstan, but I do not see real Kazakhstani products. It is, however, difficult to develop products when faced with such strong international competition. The fastest way to develop our own industry is to invite investors to establish production facilities in Kazakhstan. HeidelbergCement is investing in Kazakhstan directly. We are employing local people, bringing in know-how, developing cement production, and paying taxes in the country. This is, in my opinion, the right model.</p><h4>How does your experience in 2011 compare to your expectations for 2012?</h4><p>We have been in Kazakhstan since 2006, and 2007 and 2008 were good years until the crisis set in. The following year, 2009, was the weakest year for our business in Kazakhstan. In 2010 the market recovered. Development in 2010 was healthy and up by about 10%. The following year, 2011, was positive and we recorded a growth rate of around 11%. For 2012 we are expecting a growth rate of 6%-7%. We are planning our results according to these projections. In 2011 our growth was well above the market average, but this will not necessarily be the case in 2012 due to stronger competition and anticipated logistical  constraints.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Interteach was originally an insurance company also working in medical services. How did the company develop in insurance and how did you decide to get into medical services?<br></h4><p>For more than 22 years, Interteach has contributed to the development of Kazakhstan, realizing major projects in health and medical insurance. Currently, Interteach is the leading provider of medical insurance and services in the country. We provide medical insurance and the organization of medical assistance, and serve over 500 corporate clients. Among them are government agencies and large foreign and national companies. Interteach is a major supplier of medical services to participants in the financial, oil and gas, construction, and tobacco sectors.</p><h4>What insurance and medical services do you provide?</h4><p>Interteach's business philosophy is based on belief in the uniqueness of each client, and each part of this company constantly develops new programs taking into account varying preferences in medical care and insurance. All packages are regularly reviewed to meet the ever-increasing complexity and cost of treatment and improve the quality of service, so companies and individuals can always be assured of best advice. Interteach has integrated with the public healthcare service sector, without which it is impossible to provide specialized medical care to citizens in Kazakhstan, as well as expatriates. In terms of expatriates, the company provides the evacuation of patients in serious conditions, and works with Kazakhstani and international air carriers to repatriate patients to anywhere in the world. In addition to its own offices abroad, Interteach has strong relations with several European assistance companies. To maximize the quality of services, Interteach has developed a system of organization and control treatments. At its disposal is a network of 15 medical centers, over 200 additional clinics, 46 of its own ambulance crews, and more than 50 dental clinics dispatching services around the clock. The company provides health insurance services, arranges medical care, and serves over 500 corporate clients throughout Kazakhstan. Interteach has a reputation as a stable, reliable, and trustworthy partner among its customers.</p><h4>What services do your clients seek?</h4><p>Interteach is well aware of the pressing challenges of companies and is guided by the message of the President in it activities, in which he urges the large subsoil users to increase local content, striving to provide a high level of services to foreign and local companies involved in the commodities sector. Interteach organizes specialized medical care in remote areas, medical points at companies, evacuation and repatriation anywhere in the world, all in collaboration with international assistance groups.</p><h4>What opportunities does the oil and gas sector represent?</h4><p>The company is actively attending regions where major projects are implemented in the field of oil exploration, extraction, and processing, including in Atyrau, Kyzylorda, Aktobe, and Mangistau. Medical posts to serve working staff have been set up in Karabatan, Tengiz, and other offshore and onshore projects. We have medical services based in Almaty, Astana, Atyrau, Kulsary, Aktau, Aktobe, Aksai, Uralsk, Karaganda, Shymkent, and Kyzylorda. Representative offices operate in Tashkent, Bishkek, Ashkhabad, and Nebit Dagh. Interteach has partners in Moscow, Cologne, and Liberec in the Czech Republic. In all of these parts of the world customers can count on quality service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p><h4>What business opportunities do you see in private healthcare?</h4><p>Kazakhstan attaches great importance to public health, and public health facilities are equipped with the latest equipment and technology, and continues to evolve. However, in private medicine, more developed investment policy is needed in terms of both manpower or medical personnel and equipment.</p><h4>Do you see the future consolidation of health clinics?</h4><p>For the customer it is profitable to have a unified network of hospitals with common standards, with a unified system of quality control and an integrated council for insurance companies. Today, the objective is to create an integrated system of registration for medical care, which is only possible on the basis of the widespread use of modern information technologies in a single information space.</p><h4>Are you planning to establish partnerships to grow?</h4><p>The implementation of such a system of health management requires partnerships with several participants. We would like to extend our services to our potential customers, perhaps in east Kazakhstan, to develop our regional network. We are currently working with a large assistance group in Russia, and we want to merge our efforts so that our customers can freely flow without restriction. We are active with our foreign partners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you define beverage-drinking habits in Kazakhstan?<br></h4><p>The beverage market in Kazakhstan has developed in much the same way as the beverage markets in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, and the EU countries. The average Kazakhstani consumer spends a large part of his or her income—about 43%, and one of the highest rates in the world—on food and beverages. Approximately 40% of beverages consumed in Kazakhstan are teas. Water consumption is also fairly high, and the juice segment is very developed. The sparkling beverage sector, however, remains rather underdeveloped as far as per capita consumption when compared to other countries with similar economies.</p><h4>What are the challenges in creating room for the sparkling beverage industry and what strategies are you exploring?</h4><p>The strength of the still beverages sector and strong cultural trends are significant challenges in creating room for sparkling beverages, but we view these as areas of opportunity. For example, Kazakhstani consumers enjoy traditional flavors, and based on this knowledge we successfully launched Fanta Dushes and Fanta Buratino in 2010, as well as introduced Fanta Lemonade and Coca-Cola Zero in 2011. The extension of these Fanta brands in Kazakhstan contributed largely to our double-digit volume growth in the sparkling beverages category. So that we remain in a position to take advantage of such growth opportunities in the sparkling beverages sector, we place great emphasis on understanding and monitoring consumer behavior. We closely monitor consumer demand, preferences, and trends. We manage our product portfolio by adding new flavors, brands, and packaging, and we continue to focus on effective marketing strategies such as our recent “Coke'n Meal" campaign in order to attract new consumers.</p><h4>Against the backdrop of this information, how has Coca-Cola's position evolved since entering the Kazakhstani market?</h4><p>We have been in the market since 1996 and have just celebrated our 15th year here. We have invested so much because the local economy has grown. We started out by importing, but now we operate the largest plant in Central Asia. Our operating systems are technologically advanced, and we produce nearly every kind of packaging imaginable, including canned and carton products. In 2012 we are investing in a glass bottling line, and this summer we will start selling original glass bottles to consumers. We directly employ more than 700 employees in Kazakhstan, but indirectly our employment footprint is significantly larger.</p><h4>How does Kazakhstan compare to other countries in the region in terms of per capita consumption?</h4><p>In terms of per capita consumption, we are benchmarked alongside both Russia and Turkey, but are considered more closely aligned with Russia, with which we share a very similar consumption culture. We are the biggest market among the Central Asian countries. Total consumption is set at 74 servings of 250 ml per person per year.</p><h4>What does the country's small population imply in terms of Coca-Cola's future?</h4><p>We enjoy favorable demographics in Kazakhstan. For example, 50% of the population is below the age of 30, and this is a very valuable market for FMCG producers. I believe growth will continue in our business and in our industry because this young population is willing to spend a higher income percentage on food and drink.</p><h4>What are some particular specialties that have caught your attention in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>One noteworthy aspect is that Kazakhstan is largely a cash-based society. When I first came here, I saw many cash machines, and therefore presumed credit card transactions would be popular in Kazakhstan as they are in Turkey. But there is little evidence of credit card transactions. Even in supermarkets, Kazakhstani customers make cash withdrawals and then carry out cash transactions.</p><h4>What is Coca-Cola's plan for the future in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We recently launched our company's 2020 Vision and Strategic Framework and we defined the roadmap for the next 10 years, outlining the extraordinary growth opportunities that lie ahead. We believe that the young population in Kazakhstan, combined with trends such as urbanization, an emerging middle-class, and global connectivity, will present tremendous growth opportunities for us during our journey toward 2020. Last year, the beverages market grew 17%, but we grew 25%. In line with our 2020 Vision, we expect our volume to continue along a double-digit growth trend.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Retail in Kazakhstan is marked by growth, innovation, and competition. How would you list the defining characteristics of the retail industry over the past 12 months?</h4><p>We are confident that the retail market in Kazakhstan will maintain fast and steady growth, which has been impressive and prompted a number of international players to invest in the country. A recent study released by CBRE suggests that  as many as 18 global retail companies have entered the Almaty market, Kazakhstan's largest city. This proves that modern retail is coming to the country. Of course we are proud that Metro Cash &amp; Carry was one of first international trade companies to decide to invest in Kazakhstan. Since entering the market in 2010, we have expanded into seven cities in Kazakhstan and now operate eight wholesale centers. In the first quarter of 2012, we continued our expansion drive by opening two new wholesale stores in Aktobe and Ust-Kamenogorsk.</p><h4>Metro Cash &amp; Carry had a strong entry into the Kazakhstani market. How do you see your roll out expanding in the medium term?</h4><p>We see Kazakhstan as an important growth market. We are now considering an expansion course in the country, and we want to focus on the main cities in the north and south of the country, especially Almaty and Astana.</p><h4>What specific geographical, economic, and demographic factors are you taking into account while forming your expansion strategy?</h4><p>Certainly, Kazakhstan is a booming economy that offers great business potential. With a vast territory, it is also a country of great diversity that we need to take into consideration when developing strategies and getting down to implementing our investment plans. For us, one advantage is that we have an established network in Russia, and so we have decided to make the most of the synergy between the two countries in terms of purchasing and supply chain management. For example, joint procurement projects help us secure favorable prices, while logistics infrastructure plays a crucial role in the success of our operations. The Customs Union between Kazakhstan, Russia, and Belarus has opened up additional opportunities for the more efficient flow of goods, which will benefit our operations and ultimately our professional customers.</p><h4>Metro Cash &amp; Carry is also known as being active in helping local producers enhance the quality of their goods. How would you assess the level of dialogue Metro Cash &amp; Carry has established with local producers?</h4><p>Metro Cash &amp; Carry operates worldwide, and we are a close and reliable partner for local producers and suppliers in all the countries where Metro is present. Without a doubt, Kazakhstan is no exception. Up to 90% of the goods in our stores are sourced locally, which in turn supports economic growth and upgrades the infrastructure of the local community. In each region we organize regular seminars for our potential suppliers, with the help of international experts invited from Europe, to share and transfer knowledge on a range of topics such as product packaging and the correct marking of cargo. Today, there are over 700 suppliers who cooperate with our company and we always support them through constructive dialogue, which makes it possible to expand our range year by year. As an experienced food wholesaler and retailer, Metro attaches great importance to quality, freshness, and hygiene. To secure a reliable supply chain, Metro makes a lot of effort to train local producers on food safety and quality, including supporting them to reach international standards and become certified. In Kazakhstan, we are engaged in a supplier development program, where local producers aim to get certified by International Food Standards (IFS). In particular, we are working with local manufacturers to produce our own branded goods, which are in demand at all Metro stores. It is a process where suppliers can learn our specific requirements concerning production, quality, and packaging to raise their level of competitiveness. Thus, we are helping SMEs to improve their viability.</p><h4>What is the level of saturation in the retail industry? In which segments do you see opportunities for growth and investment?</h4><p>The retail industry in Kazakhstan is far from being saturated. Instead, it offers a great deal of untapped potential. We are a self-service wholesale operator serving professional customers such as hotels, restaurants, small- and medium-sized retailers, institutions, and offices, and stable growth in all of these sectors will bring us  continued healthy demand from our customers.</p><h4>What role do you see for the retail industry in the ongoing efforts to diversify the economy?</h4><p>The retail/wholesale sector is still enjoying fast growth in Kazakhstan, and modern retail and wholesale can play an important role in developing the distribution sector and upgrading infrastructure. Therefore, we welcome the government's actions directed toward the support of non-resource sector development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

What is Kazakhstan's significance in this setting?<br></h4><p>As a global mining company, Rio Tinto specializes in developing large-scale and long-life mines. Kazakhstan shows potential for the discovery of such world-class resources. The country offers us the opportunity to gain experience in the region, find local talent, and develop expertise in how to operate in this environment. In the future, we expect to branch out from Kazakhstan and extend our footprint to places such as Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. However, Kazakhstan will continue to be the hub for our activities in the region.</p><h4>Rio Tinto has a massive global mining portfolio. In which segments are you planning to launch operations?</h4><p>Rio Tinto, as a multi-commodity mining company, has the ability to focus on the quality of the opportunity and not be constrained by the commodity that we are working with. That being said, our focus is on copper and uranium in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The benefits of partnering in uranium are fairly self evident, because Kazakhstan is the leading producer of uranium worldwide. Rio Tinto is also one of the world's largest uranium producers, through our operations in Namibia and Australia, as well as with development options through a recent acquisition in Canada. In terms of copper, we firmly believe that the region is underdeveloped in respect to its resource potential. To exploit these opportunities, we employ two main strategies. The first is exploration, in which we seek to identify and develop new resources. The second is a review of existing resources that have been discovered through comprehensive exploration work completed under the Soviet Union more than 20 years ago. These resources may have value that has not been recognized, or may be unlocked through the application of Rio Tinto technology.</p><h4>What value-added does Rio Tinto bring to Kazakhstan's mining industry?</h4><p>Rio Tinto is a world leader in technology and mining, and we firmly believe in our program, “mine of the future," which evaluates step-changes in technology and advancements for exploration and mining. These are elements that are required for efficient future mining operations to be sustainable as the world consumes more and more metals. As our operations expanded, we realized that the majority of easy deposits have been found, and the more complex deposits are being developed, a process that requires technology. We seek to apply technology to our exploration, assessment of known resources, and the future development of resources. With respect to the environment, the sustainability of operations is central to Rio Tinto's strategy, which we feel is well aligned with the Kazakhstani government's agenda. We apply rigorous environmental standards that meet or exceed regulations in all our operations, monitoring emissions and planning for the closure of our operations. We believe that our approach will raise the bar in terms of environmental performance in Kazakhstan, and assist the Kazakhstani mining sector as it improves its performance and efficiency, thereby reducing the environmental impact. Sustainability is also about working closer with the host communities in which we operate. Through our global operations we have observed that producing additional raw materials stimulates the development of local manufacturing businesses. Wherever Rio Tinto operates, we seek to use parts, equipment, and services from local companies and service providers, which stimulates investments in manufacturing and in the local economy.</p><h4>How accommodating would you consider the business climate in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>In general, it's a positive environment; if anything less, we wouldn't be here. The country has the basic ingredients, but there are significant challenges for a foreign investor. The first is the level of bureaucracy throughout the process of establishing a business. It can be difficult to manage, operate, and report, and this procedure demands a huge amount of effort. This effort would be better directed toward operations rather than navigating through the bureaucracy of Kazakhstani investment legislation. Transparency is another very key risk in the sector, and we have significant concerns that a foreign investor is not on a level playing field with respect to local competitors. We believe that increased transparency and a more clearly defined process is crucial. With those two ingredients in place, it's not the legislation that is causing problems, but the necessary knowledge to cooperate with the law. The government should tackle this challenge if it is serious about attracting more FDI to Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which research areas can Kazakhstan contribute to the advancement of science?<br></h4><p>The first area that I can highlight is the energy sector. Kazakhstan has vast reserves of oil and gas and has become an energy giant. At the same time, the country decided early on to work on climate change issues to ensure that its effort to reduce the country's carbon footprint was a part of the international endeavor to mitigate against climate change. Renewable and alternative energy sources, including wind and solar, are increasingly popular in Kazakhstan. This is a country that will hopefully champion modern urban development in a manner that will keep its environmental footprint to a minimum. Indeed, a member of Nazarbayev University's research team is on the 20-member expert council under the UN Climate Change Conference. Furthermore, Kazakhstan, like Japan, is aware of the benefits as well as dangers of nuclear energy. Kazakhstan has denounced the military use of nuclear weapons, but supports research into the resource as a means to generate energy. The country is also a part of the collective effort on research into nuclear medicine and life sciences. This university, alongside other universities and institutions, is doing its best to improve the quality of human resources in all of these fields. We firmly believe that Kazakhstan can contribute greatly to scientific research. On the instrumentation side, such as in robotics and mechatronics, the country has already launched many activities. Robotics is a quintessential part of energy and other extractive industry activities and requires continuous research.</p><h4>How are you looking into improving Kazakhstan's workforce?</h4><p>Nazarbayev University has started corporate executive education programs for the private sector, and also initiated an industrial council, which is an advisory body representing the major firms in Kazakhstan, with whom we will enter into a sustained dialogue. We will discuss and negotiate with enterprises to offer internships to our students; we will also provide career-planning advice. This will be another important facet of NU's approach. Naturally our students will participate in research at an early stage. In order to allow this to happen, during our one-year foundation program students will be exposed to critical thinking. This is very important not only to nurture good scientists, but also to the development of our students as good citizens. Our students' progress in learning to develop critical judgment will be a part of the overall mentality change we are eager to install. The mission of this university is demanding: develop tomorrow's leaders in business, government, and science; develop first-class scientific research that benefits the workplace; and contribute to Astana being recognized as an international educational, science, R&amp;D, and healthcare hub.</p><h4>How do you make sure that your collaboration with international institutions is tailored to the Kazakhstani context?</h4><p>We have to ensure that our international faculty is mindful of Kazakhstan's needs and the country's context. Substantive parts of studies and research are Kazakhstan-based. We also run public policy courses for senior government officials in collaboration with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy of the National University of Singapore. These executive courses address priority needs in Kazakhstan's public management, such as public policy design, performance management, budgeting, and analyzing the external environment. Toward the end of 2012, we will launch our graduate schools of business and public policy, followed in 2013 by our graduate school of education, all of them with internationally renowned partners such as Duke University, National University of Singapore, University of Pennsylvania, and Cambridge University. In October 2011, we started a one-year professional development program for close to 100 secondary school teachers, who upon completion will be assigned to Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools, a new type of secondary school. A priority task for Nazarbayev University this year is to bring the university's scientific and research system into compliance with international standards. We are developing our internal regulations on peer reviews, including through the engagement of international experts. Moreover, the university will keep strict watch for observance of ethical and other norms in research affecting human subjects or animals. The Research Advisory Council of the university is overseeing the development and observance of these rules. In parallel, the intellectual property rights regime that will have a decisive influence on future research, will be clarified. We will try to find the best balance between the interests of researchers and the university.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Kcell sought to maintain its local market share over 2011?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Kcell has focused on strengthening its market position, leading to a dramatic evolution within our business. Our clients are the company's main focus, which results in positive feedback from our subscriber base and has led to an increase in subscriptions; in 2011, we reached a total of nearly 11 million users. To maintain our success over the long term, we came to the conclusion that there is a need for innovation. Kcell's previous business transformation was innovative, but the changes came from the top down—now, employees at the base of our workforce must become the catalysts of innovation and be the promoting engine. At present, we are at the beginning of a long process, and 2011 was the starting point for this inspiring journey. An active increase in data traffic was another important factor for Kcell's development in 2011, and our company set the trend in the market for mobile data services. We launched a number of revolutionary offers that made mobile internet available to the masses at very low cost. At the same time, we have been working to improve our mobile data speed, actively developing the 3G network, and increasing the mobile data speeds on the 2G network (EDGE). The next step was to expand the availability of smart phones. This strategy led to an increase in the number of mobile data services users, which exceeded 6 million in January 2012.</p><h4>How do you see Kcell and Activ complementing each other, as far as presence in the market is concerned?</h4><p>We very clearly positioned our two main brands; Kcell is the corporate segment brand, and Activ is geared toward the mass market. This segmentation allowed us to consider subscriber needs and efficiently respond to market changes. A strongly positioned brand in the mass segment, with its wide portfolio of tariffs, made it possible for us to successfully compete without additional effort or extra financial expenses.</p><h4>What are some highlights from your infrastructure development in 2011? Which direction are you planning to take with capital expenditure in 2012?</h4><p>As of January 1, 2012, the Kcell network covered 4,917 population centers in Kazakhstan. This means that there are communication services in all major cities, and towns with populations of between 5,000 and 10,000 people, and in almost every village with populations starting from 1,000 people. Taking into account the territory of Kazakhstan—the ninth largest country in the world by land area—we feel that tremendous achievements have been accomplished. At present, Kcell ensures the coverage of 44.4% of the country, which is more than 94% of its population. Our plan for 2012 includes the completion of mobile communications coverage in smaller villages; ensuring mobile communication in rural areas is one of our most important social tasks. Moreover, we will proceed with further network developments, aiming to provide high-quality voice and data services for the people of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How has 3G changed the dynamics of the industry? What major trends have you observed in the market?</h4><p>Lately, the main trend we have observed in Kazakhstan is the explosive growth of data traffic. The long-awaited 3G launch back in January 2011 greatly contributed to our success. The company centers its efforts on the latest version of 3G, HSPA+. This technology has a maximum speed of up to 21 Mbps. At present, the average speed on the Kcell 3G network reaches 14 Mbps. In an effort to spread 3G throughout more regional centers by the end of 2011, Kcell 3G was operating in 31 cities and regional centers across Kazakhstan. We are now working to make 3G devices readily available to the masses. To do this, we have begun to offer telephones under a contract-based program, which has been a tried and tested model in most European countries. This program was implemented in Kazakhstan for the first time, and it has fostered the growth of our customer base.</p><h4>What is the level of progress and readiness in terms of new technology? What is the potential for 4G in your industry?</h4><p>Our viewpoint on the issue of implementing 4G/LTE in Kazakhstan is fairly simple. We believe that this technology should achieve the stage that we can characterize as “commercial maturity." This maturity refers to both providers of equipment and manufacturers of subscriber devices. There is also the issue of private standardization, as in Europe, the US, Russia, and India. I strongly agree with the opinion of many sector experts who believe that the current LTE standard being implemented in several countries has no significant advantages over 3G/HSPA+ in terms of mobile data speed. As soon as 4G/LTE becomes a cost-effective project for Kazakhstan from a commercial viewpoint, Kcell will consider the possibility of its implementation.</p><h4>Do you see changes in the composition and share distribution of the market benefiting customers over the long term?</h4><p>The average cost of one minute on our network is about KZT10, less than $0.10. There are tariff offers that lower the cost down to KZT1. We operate in a market of about 17 million people, and if we compare our mobile tariffs with those in China or India, there will certainly be differences. I would like to emphasize that over the past several years, the average cost of one minute on our network has been reduced significantly, and the cost reduction trend can still be observed. Our EPSI rating and research demonstrates the level of satisfaction from our clients, including criteria based on value for money; Kcell customer satisfaction remains the highest in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How does the availability of social networking through 3G affect the demand for SMS services?</h4><p>The usage of SMS services will contract due to the onset of smartphone applications. The general trend is that people tend to use applications more than SMS. Of course, the penetration of 3G-compatible phones on operators' networks corresponds to just 20% of all phones, so there is still major potential for operators to plan accordingly and develop the appropriate applications. Smartphones are not included in this 20%, and they still represent less than 5% of total market penetration.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some highlights from your operations over the last year?</h4><p>DHL is a clear market leader in both international and domestic express deliveries in the Kazakhstani market historically, and over the last year we have continued our growth. We carried out many operations in order to meet customer requirements, and to satisfy customer demand in terms of fast transportation. This includes not only documents, but parcels and heavy shipments within Kazakhstan and internationally. Kazakhstan is the ninth biggest country in the world, and transportation and infrastructure are very important for Kazakhstan's economy. Moreover, we absolutely support the strategic efforts to utilize all transit opportunities and to turn Kazakhstan into a transit corridor between Asia and Europe, and the north and south of Asia. Apart from this transportation system, for us it's important to see good growth in comparison with the average growth of the transportation sector in Kazakhstan. Our estimation is that all of Kazakhstan's modes of transport will grow. In 2011, growth came in at around 14%, while we have also shown double-digit growth. This year is also going well in terms of shipments and revenues.</p><h4>What trends do you see in terms of Kazakhstan's connectivity?</h4><p>What we found in 2011 was that customer demand was pushing us toward faster transit times within the domestic market, and in particular to and from Astana. The traditional way of moving goods to Astana is via Almaty, which serves as a hub. This puts an additional day onto the delivery time. We then performed market tests in terms of transit performance and made adjustments. DHL has now improved transit times across the country to Astana to between one and three days, depending on the origin. For example, in August 2011 we launched a direct air connection between Moscow and Astana, for all shipments between the two cities. As a result of the new connection, DHL customers can take advantage of unprecedented service levels for their shipping requirements between the two countries. The company can now offer a transit time on the route of just one day for standard express shipments.</p><h4>How is the Kazakhstani market evolving?</h4><p>DHL knows that the Kazakhstani market requires a wide range of services and products, beyond just shipping between Almaty and Astana, in order to meet all customer requirements. Over the last year, there have been some interesting developments. The Customs Union started to function properly, and we have seen an increasing number of shipments between Kazakhstan and Russia, and Kazakhstan and Belarus. Companies such as DHL Express are true indicators of business activity, and we certainly noticed a jump in the number of shipments and active customers interested in making deliveries throughout the Customs Union. Interestingly, shipments to international destinations such as the US, France, the UK, and China also increased significantly. This is a good indicator of the diversifying nature of Kazakhstan's economy.</p><h4>What competition do you see in the market now that there's heightened demand for deliveries?</h4><p>The most competitive area is the domestic market as the barriers to entry are very low, and any man and his truck can make a domestic delivery. Probably the most competitive line would be Russia, because this is an area where the majority of volumes are. We are growing very quickly, but we have to differentiate this market from the postal market because our main market is business-to-business, next-day delivery.</p><h4>What are the main challenges for DHL in the logistics sector?</h4><p>The biggest challenge that we face in the local market is in bringing shipments into the country; specifically, there have been times when we have experienced limited capacity. If you don't have the capacity, you can't fulfill your customers' expectations. Similarly, when you ship to smaller cities by air there is also limited capacity. We are too dependent on local airlines and their success. We depend on them and their capacity, and this is a major challenge.</p><h4>What innovative solutions are you introducing to enhance your clients' experience with DHL?</h4><p>I think from a strategic perspective in 2012, we would like our employees and all of our customers to ask the question: “Why wouldn't I work with DHL?" It sounds corny, but from a customer service perspective, if you have a large market share and the market diversifies, the risk of losing market share or growth is high. How do you protect that market share? Through the customer experience. If I have a courier and he goes to a customer every day for two or three years, there's a relationship that's established. If I have a courier that goes there every two months and leaves DHL, and then another one goes for another two months, there is an increased risk that our customers might leave us. In that regard, customer service and employee satisfaction are probably the most crucial factors in terms of where we are going right now.</p><p>We have introduced some European innovations here in Kazakhstan, which has made business easier for our customers. We also introduced online solutions for customers in order to make the customer's own business more accessible and DHL Express services easier to use. We are ready to provide our customers with a preview on the internet with full details to track and trace their shipments. They can select DHL shipping options, which allow them to manage their database, and that makes DHL usage easy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan's current agriculture policy aims at developing more competitive agribusinesses. How do you describe the agenda of the government for the coming decade?</h4><p>The Ministry of Agriculture has three main objectives: improving productivity, ensuring food security, and increasing the export potential of the agriculture sector. These problems can be solved by encouraging agro-industrial diversification, providing increased production of agricultural raw materials and food, boosting the technical and technological modernization of industry, and developing new approaches to state support for agriculture. In this regard, the Ministry has developed a program for the development of agriculture in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2010-2014. In accordance with the program, policies are designed to achieve full self-sufficiency in the country for all types of agricultural products. This will be achieved through increased crop production, structural and technological diversification, the application of modern manufacturing technology, and the wider use of chemicals. The government is also working to develop new and currently unused irrigated land.</p><h4>What measures have been taken by the government to improve the efficiency of livestock production and the mechanization of agriculture in the country?</h4><p>The strategy provides for an increase in livestock production through the transfer of industrial know-how, the development of breeding stock, and the importation of breeding cattle. Particular attention has been paid to the development of beef cattle in the future.</p><p>The strategy in the processing of agricultural products is aimed at the technical and technological re-equipment of production and a transition to international quality standards, which will expand the range of food products and enable us to compete with our major trading partners in the Customs Union.</p><p>In order to stimulate the economic development of the industry and enhance its investment attractiveness, agricultural subsidies will continue, making maximum use of stimulus features.</p><p>To increase the production volume and quality of beef, a project called the “Development of Export Potential of Beef" was approved by the Head of State and is now being implemented. In the next five years, up to 60 feedlots with a total capacity of 150,000 feeding units will be built; 72,000 head of pedigree cattle will be delivered from abroad and 54 breeding farms will be created. Furthermore, a project to train 2,500 farmers with 300,000 head of breeding stock will be implemented. The implementation of these activities forms the budget that is available to agricultural producers in the form of credits.</p><h4>How can Kazakhstan improve its status as a major international exporter of grain and livestock in the global market?</h4><p>At present, Kazakhstan's agricultural sector is a steadily growing segment of the economy, which provides not only the country's food security but also the export of agricultural products.</p><p>It is very important to use the potential of agricultural resources such as large reserves of undeveloped land, water, and other natural wealth. Kazakhstan boasts more than 2.7 million square kilometers, and ranks ninth in the world in terms of land area.</p><p>As is well known in the current economic conditions, a key factor in ensuring a competitive edge is use of high technology and the scale of production with efficient organization. This can only be achieved through the expansion of our markets.</p><p>The Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus is an important step toward the integration of these countries. The customs border between our countries has been completely eliminated, and the transportation of goods shall be free. This has formed a single market for goods with a population under 170 million and total GDP of about $1.8 trillion.</p><p>According to the Kazakhstan Statistics Agency, in 2010 the volume of production in the food industry amounted to KZT673.3 billion, an increase of 12.9% over 2009. In terms of the production capacity of agricultural commodities, the volume and geography of exports will also expand. As for the prospects of food exports, we would like to note that global population growth exerts enormous pressure on agriculture as the production of agricultural products and processed products is not keeping up with the growing demand. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicts that food consumption in the world will grow by 70% by 2050. Experts and analysts in the field of food security point out that today the world is already facing problems of food shortages and high prices, leading to famine, political unrest, and revolution. In particular, in 2011 the UN food index reached a maximum altitude. As a result, food is a hidden force that also shapes world politics. In this situation, given the presence of more than 93 million hectares of agricultural land in Kazakhstan and almost all types of climatic conditions and soil zones, Kazakhstan has great opportunities for increasing exports of agricultural products.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to increase the volume and quality of small producers?</h4><p>The program for the development of agriculture in Kazakhstan from 2010 to 2014 includes measures of state support aimed at improving the effectiveness of small, medium, and large farms, as well as family farms and the development of agriculture in general. The focus areas are the development of seed production, the reduction of the cost of fuel and lubricants (and other inventory items required for harvesting), the delivery of irrigated water to agricultural producers, the provision of bookmarks and cultivation of perennial fruit berries and grapes, the examination of the quality of Kazakhstani cotton, and the increased productivity and quality of crops.</p><p>The animal husbandry segment has seen a steady increase in cattle, poultry, and livestock production. In order to stimulate the development of domestic agricultural producers, including families and individual farmers, state support is aimed at decreasing the cost of breeding products by 50%, the cost of feed and concentrated feed by 45%, as well as partially refunding the cost of producing milk, wool, fine-wool sheep, mutton, horseflesh, kymis, and shubat. The support mechanism also includes non-financial support measures such as conducting training seminars for agricultural producers and granting access to free information on agricultural subjects.</p><p>Additionally, the Ministry of Agriculture is lending to farmers. Through concessional lending, the rural population is able to purchase equipment and livestock. The cost of credit, issued by subsidiaries of the Ministry's holding company, is substantially below the cost of loans granted by the banking system and also has favorable payback schemes.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012 and beyond?</h4><p>The improvement and strengthening of state support will continue to increase, as well as investments in agriculture and the food industry. The agriculture master plan contains information on the necessary types of products and their volumes in line with the needs of the population and external markets, which allows investors to set clear targets and function as indicators for entrepreneurs as financial institutions in the implementation of investment projects. National holding KazAgro also implemented an investment program, for which the state allocated KZT120 billion. This fund will be used for high-tech investment projects including greenhouses, dairy farms, feedlots with developed infrastructure, vegetable and sunflower oil production, drip irrigation technology used in the cultivation of fruit and vegetables, fodder production, the expansion and modernization of poultry production, a network of slaughterhouses, a meat-processing complex capable of vacuum packaging, the production and processing of fine wool, infrastructure development, the export of grain, the creation of production for the assembly of agricultural machinery, and the construction and modernization of silos. These measures will help us identify potential investors for the most promising and economically profitable areas in the context of regional specializations in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the activity in the healthcare sector in Kazakhstan during the company's evolution?<br></h4><p>Twenty years ago we were facing the huge challenge of almost not having a national healthcare system. We did have well-developed social infrastructure, but the system was managed from Moscow. We faced a strategic planning vacuum. We had our own health ministry, but it executed a centrally planned agenda. In the past 20 years we have attempted various reforms and had different experiences. In the mid-1990s, we introduced a health insurance system, which was not very successful, so we switched to a budget-based system. Currently, preventive medicine, primary care, emergency medical services, research, and medical education are all funded by the government. The government is the main driver of social development, but this is not necessarily good, because in order to develop infrastructure, meet rapidly changing global challenges, and meet the public's needs, healthcare providers should be more flexible. In 20 years since independence, we have continued to develop our healthcare infrastructure. More than 400 healthcare facilities have been built across the country in the past five or six years. We have established a central regulation system and financing system. The recent healthcare reforms were launched in 2010 through the creation of the unified national healthcare system; all healthcare funds were centralized and patients can now choose any hospital in the country after consulting with their primary healthcare providers. Currently, regional hospitals are developing rapidly, relieving some pressure on the hospitals in Astana and Almaty. We give a high priority to primary care, because good primary care reduces the pressure on secondary and tertiary care providers. We have begun to increase our per capita spending across many regions of Kazakhstan. The Ministry of Health is providing incentives to providers based on performance, in order to keep primary healthcare providers practicing in rural areas.</p><h4>What are some highlights from the NMH's recent past? How would you evaluate the Holding's significance for the country's healthcare sector?</h4><p>Managing a hospital involves managing several thousand different business processes, which requires a diverse skill set. A hospital manager can no longer be just a physician. We are trying to change our management system to one where hospital directors are interested not only in running a hospital, but in having a unified policy for patient satisfaction, which we give them as a strategic plan. Each hospital has a strategic plan and all six have implemented them to achieve strategic goals. It is not about changing only the management, but also the mentality of the staff, and gaining competence in diverse areas such as health economics, patients' rights, and informatics. We are spending a lot of money on the education and retraining of our staff.</p><h4>How has your cooperation with Nazarbayev University assisted your operations?</h4><p>Since 2010, National Medical Holding is a 100% subsidiary company of Nazarbayev University. Previously we saw ourselves as a new group of innovatively managed hospitals with an advanced technological base, trying to distribute that innovation throughout the healthcare system of the country. Now we see ourselves as part of an academic healthcare system. We are training new doctors and conducting research. The big issue is to integrate clinical practice, medical education, and research in our centers. The concept of an integrated academic healthcare system implies that one physician will provide care, train students, and conduct research on a usual basis. Our challenge is to catch up with best international academic medical practices that are the results of hundreds of years of experience in a short time using sound strategic tools.</p><h4>How do state and private healthcare services balance each other in Kazakhstan? What steps can be taken to facilitate the growth of private healthcare services in the country?</h4><p>Government cannot be the sole investor in social infrastructure. Demand is growing fast, and because of high costs the government cannot support the entire process. At some point the private sector needs to take over to meet increasing demand, and keep up with the latest technologies. The government is trying to encourage private investment activity in this field, and we are already seeing more activity on the part of foreign investors. We will be partnering with private sector companies more and more in the future, as long as they bring good results. Some intermediary services such as private labs and ultrasound centers represent opportunities for investment; also, small private medical centers and clinics are opening, providing a limited range of services. In the future, it is possible that mergers will occur in this area, and through consolidation we will see bigger private actors in the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[hold-the-dream]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan was a pioneer and a true visionary. His indomitable will and steadfast leadership prepared the UAE for the future and accomplished what many simply considered impossible. We find such vision and commitment still alive today in Dubai. Under the extraordinary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al Maktoum, Dubai has become the model for the 21st century. Man-made islands, waterways, and ultra-modern architecture harmoniously coexist with their natural surroundings. Dubai has successfully blended together modernity, the environment, and aesthetics. Dubai has already taken steps to undergo another great transformation by making itself the model of what it means to be a green city in the 21st century. Dubai is a living testament of what human imagination, creativity, commitment, and able leadership can achieve. Korea also believes in realizing dreams. Korea was a country ravaged by decades of colonial rule followed by a devastating war that left the entire country in utter ruin. However, Koreans were able to transform the country from one of the poorest in the world into a robust and dynamic country. Many thought that Korea was hopeless, but the Korean people believed in their dreams. We have also become a country that is now providing assistance to others. We successfully hosted the G20 Seoul Summit, contributing to common prosperity and shared growth. For a country that was once sustained solely by outside help, it is a phenomenal achievement that we are proud of. And the reason we achieved such growth was because we believed in our dreams and worked to make them happen.<br></p><p>Our two countries share a common spirit, and we have built an important and successful economic partnership. Trade between the UAE and Korea reached $22.1 billion in 2011. Today, Korea is the world's seventh largest exporting country, and the UAE is its largest export market in the Middle East. UAE exports to Korea rose 21.2% to $14.75 billion in 2011, and Korean exports to the UAE grew 32.4% to $7.26 billion. It is believed that UAE-Korea trade will grow by 21% in 2012 to a record $26.6 billion. South Korean firms are now important participants in many key projects in the UAE, from nuclear power to infrastructure. UAE firms are increasing their role in Korea, entering partnerships to ensure Korea's energy security and running one of the country's largest ports.</p><p>As a young man, I devoted my life to making my country prosperous. That was my dream. Later, when I became Mayor of Seoul, I worked hard to realize another dream of mine, which was to make Seoul a green metropolis; a city to be truly proud of and comfortable to live in. A long time ago, there used to be a stream that flowed through the heart of Seoul, but it was covered up and left to fester. I got rid of the concrete expressways and the covering that had been in place for decades. I restored the stream to let it breathe again. Today, the silver fish, which are known to live only in the cleanest waters, have returned. When I became President in 2008, my dreams for Korea continued to grow. As we celebrated our 60th anniversary of the founding of the nation, I put forth a new vision. Our “Low-Carbon Green Growth" vision is our answer to the future.</p><p>We believe that protecting the environment and attaining sustainable growth can go together. Our Framework Act on Low-Carbon Green Growth is the first of its kind in the world. We are investing over 2% of our GDP into green technology, and are pleased to be able to share our knowledge and expertise with the UAE. South Korean nuclear energy professors have taken up posts at Khalifa University, and Emirati engineering students have visited Seoul to learn about the nuclear industry. A South Korean Green Economy agency is also working in Masdar City. Climate change is undoubtedly the defining challenge of our time. However, we consider this challenge as an historic opportunity. Our Green Growth initiative is revolutionizing the way we think, and the UAE is also thinking creatively to seize this historic opportunity.</p><p>When we look at the nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, the renewable energy project in Masdar, and Dubai's construction of an eco-friendly, high-tech city of the future, I applaud the UAE's vision and foresight. For a country with one of the world's largest oil reserves, I know it took courage and vision for it to make this decision to prepare for the post-oil era.</p><p>And this is why Korea is proud to be the UAE's partner in this endeavor, a journey to create a better, cleaner future for all. Climate change cannot be addressed by a few countries. It is a global challenge that requires a global solution. It must involve our developing partners as well as the advanced countries. This is why Korea launched the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) in June 2010, for which the UAE will be its strategic partner. The regional office for the GGGI in the UAE will act as a hub for the Middle East and North Africa. This institute will be focused on finding workable solutions and bringing genuine change. Our responsibility is to work together to make this world a better place, for ourselves and for our children. Let us show the world the power of dreams.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Priority Hub]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-priority-hub]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did the current trade mission choose Qatar and the UAE specifically?</h4><p>We chose Qatar and the UAE for three main reasons. First, both countries are investing heavily in infrastructure and transportation, to the tune of $300 billion combined. Second, both countries have strong economic growth projections during the short, medium, and long term. Third, these countries have histories as profitable markets and business hubs for many American companies. Since the beginning of this administration, these markets have been some of our top priorities. In addition to my trips to the region, our Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance, Michael Camuñez, and our Assistant Secretary for Trade Promotion, Suresh Kumar, have also visited both countries in order to promote further trade and investment.</p><h4>The Gulf has been identified as a priority market for the US. What factors went into this calculation, and specifically what makes the region as a whole stand out?</h4><p>The Gulf is showing strong economic growth projections in the short, medium, and long term. Additionally, US companies face increased competition from East Asian, South Asian, and European businesses in the region. Thus, it behooves the US government to increase its work in as close collaboration as possible with our private sector, which is competing against foreign firms. The US government has always been dedicated to its relationships with the Gulf, and our private sector has always been active in the region. President Obama's National Export Initiative provides us a platform to show the Gulf that our government and private sector are each, and together, committed to the region and our continued economic and commercial relationships. As a region, what stands out is the vision for the future that the governments of the Gulf countries have taken. They see the need and opportunity for economic diversification. While oil and gas is, and will continue to be, an important sector—one in which we have been and will continue to be involved—many of the regions have a vision to invest in their people by investing in health, education, and new technologies, all using environmentally sound strategies, and we have competitive advantages in each of these areas.</p><h4>Historically, what has the trade relationship been like between the US and the UAE, Dubai specifically, and what key developments have you witnessed?</h4><p>The US-UAE trade relationship is marked by the same characteristics as are our political, military, and strategic relationship: friendship, dedication, and collaboration. US-UAE trade has almost quadrupled in the last decade from $3.3 billion in 2000 to $12.8 billion in 2011. Each year, the UAE is the largest, or one of the largest, destinations for US exports in the Middle East and North Africa. While the energy sector is still a major contributor to the UAE's GDP, and our companies have been and will continue to be very active in that sector, our trade relationship has expanded into consumer products, services, and almost anything else you can think of. Today, US companies are already active in the country's moves into renewable energy, education, and other activities undertaken to diversify its economy and provide greater opportunities for its population. In regard to Dubai specifically, we have been a partner in the Emirate's impressive growth since the beginning. Our trade relationship with Dubai has continued to mature.</p><h4>In which industries and sectors do you see the most potential for greater commercial integration between Dubai and the US?</h4><p>I never like to limit the products or services that I cover when I speak about opportunities for US—UAE commercial integration. We shouldn't limit our imagination. Already one has seen American companies participate in Dubai's impressive growth across many sectors; from energy to water, from glass to coffee outlets, from automobiles to speedboats and yachts, and from shoes and clothing to jewelry. For instance, Pottery Barn opened its first Middle East store in Dubai, to take advantage of the Emirate's purchasing power. Additionally, the UAE is a top destination for US SMEs; from 2007-2008, the UAE was one of the markets with the largest percentage increases in SME exports to the world. Today's global economy is so diverse and changes so quickly, that it is almost impossible for anyone to say what is going to be hot tomorrow. Rather than naming a specific sector, I can say that commercial integration between Dubai and the US is going to be based on products, services, technologies, and individuals that are dedicated to mutually beneficial commercial relationships that help create knowledge and economic return for both sides.</p><h4>Would you say there are any further regulatory changes needed to attract more businesses to Dubai?</h4><p>In a global economy that is as fluid and competitive as the one in which we operate, there is increasing pressure on nearly all governments to ensure their regulatory environments can keep up with changing economies, and that there is transparency. Dubai has rightfully earned its favorable reputation as a good place to do business. And a large part of that reputation stems from the excellent counseling and assistance offered to foreign companies by the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, the Dubai Department of Economic Development, and other government organizations geared to promoting trade and investment. Of course there are always areas for improvement. US (and other foreign) firms often cite the restrictions on foreign ownership, the requirement of having a local agent in order to do business in the UAE, and difficulties in terminating agents as some of the issues affecting their investment decisions in Dubai and the UAE. I understand that the new revisions to the Companies Law that was just passed by the UAE Cabinet will allow more than 49% foreign ownership in certain sectors. We will be following these new developments closely and welcome any changes that make it easier for our firms to do business in the UAE. Additionally, another concern I have heard from US companies across industries, vis-í -vis Dubai, is a need for increased transparency in regulatory development.</p><h4>What is your outlook for US businesses operating in Dubai and for the region as a whole in the coming year?</h4><p>I am bullish on our companies operating in Dubai and in the region. Our exports to the UAE were up almost 35% for January-October 2011, versus the same period in 2010. Despite regional political unrest, the Gulf has generally remained stable and is making heavy investments to address many of the socioeconomic concerns of its citizens. US businesses must be ready to compete, of course; but they have the technology, products, and business know-how to do so. In 2012, like in years past, you'll see our companies visiting Dubai's trade shows, meeting with potential partners from throughout the region, and inviting them to visit their sites and facilities in the US.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[time-to-aim-high]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core of the UAE's foreign trade policy, and to what extent is local economic openness paving the way for wider regional growth?</h4><p>The UAE's foreign trade policy is geared toward economic openness to the world and productive interaction with its global trade partners. It is founded on the principles of parity and mutual interests. The decision to nurture an open economy was wisely made by our Founding Fathers led by our late President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan from our country's inception. Even then they knew that an open economy was vital to the UAE's commercial ties at a regional and international level. An open economy has helped the UAE gain the confidence of global investors and businesses and has accelerated the nation's economic diversification efforts. It has also boosted local competition, job creation, and the options of goods and services that UAE citizens can choose from. An open economy has been vital to our resilience against the global downturn and the social movements that have posed numerous economic challenges to the region and the world.</p><h4>Following the successful diversification of the UAE economy, which sectors hold the largest growth potential for trade and investment?</h4><p>The industrial sector shows very promising potential. In 2011, the UAE's industrial activities expanded by almost 11% to remain the second largest component of our GDP after hydrocarbons. The manufacturing sector accounted for a record $38.8 billion in 2011. The transport sector is another rewarding area for trade and investment, as it expanded by 6% in 2011. Renewable energy is also growing, especially as we are now the official headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The UAE has already adopted a plan to raise the contribution of the renewable energy sector by up to 7% of national energy requirements by 2020. SMEs represent yet another solid sector, accounting for over 70% of the UAE's GDP (excluding oil), and are thus considered the backbone of the national economy. Other recommended sectors include tourism, finance and banking, education, health, logistic services, and ports and airports.</p><h4>Which countries currently present particularly interesting opportunities for bilateral trade growth with the UAE?</h4><p>We are eyeing countries with high growth rates, large and expanding populations, stable economic and political environments, forward-looking policies, and a clear vision of FDI in regions such as Latin America, Africa, and Central Asia. These growth partners uphold laws for protecting investors, widening investments, and expanding trade. We also intend to broaden our bilateral trade with strategic partners such as India, China, and Korea.</p><h4>How important a role do SMEs play in utilizing opportunities and strengthening bilateral trade between countries? What can be done to empower and enable SMEs to enter international markets and benefit from exports in expanding their operations?</h4><p>SMEs represent around 70% of our GDP, so any country tapping into our SME sector would be engaging with the backbone of our economy. SMEs are major users of imported goods and also account for a large exporting group; they are vital to strengthening bilateral trade. Companies falling under the SME category face many financial and policy challenges, which the UAE is keen to address. Governments should introduce supportive policies that make it easier for SMEs to expand and enhance their operations and enter international markets. For its part, the UAE aims to create a supportive environment where SMEs can easily benefit from the right financial, training, and knowledge resources. We recognize the positive value of SMEs in our national economy.</p><h4>What will be the focus of the 2012 Annual Investment Meeting? What makes the UAE such an ideal location for international economic forums and events?</h4><p>The UAE is an excellent host for international dialogues and events due to its strategic geographic location between East and West. As the region's recognized commercial hub, it also provides an ideal setting for businesses to interact and deal with each other. It offers many world-class venues such as the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre and the Dubai World Trade Center as well. The country's thriving meetings, incentives, convention, and exhibitions (MICE) industry is considered an important medium for showing the UAE's push away from oil toward a more diversified economy.</p><h4>The UAE joined the World Trade Organization in 1996, and a number of WTO reports have since been issued evidencing the country's commitment to creating an open international trade environment. What measures continue to be implemented in this regard?</h4><p>During our second Trade Policy Review (TPR) under the WTO we were commended for upholding free-market principles and for aggressively pursuing economic diversification. We are committed to continue implementing measures that sustain the positive world view of our open trade environment. For one, we continue to update and improve our economic and legislative laws to fortify our open market. Building on the strong approval of the WTO over our latest TPR, we also intend to provide more information on our trade policy and deliver on our obligations to the WTO. We will continue to work with the WTO Secretariat and benefit from the expertise and technical assistance it extends. Since 2011 we have not raised our tariffs beyond 4.9% to float us above the global crisis without compromising our trade liberalization. This strategy has worked well alongside our simple tariff structure and minimal non-tariff barriers, and will continue to be in force. Of course, we will also maintain our business-friendly environment and free trade zones, which have carved for us a successful model for investment promotion.</p><h4>What lessons were learned from the recent global liquidity crisis? What measures is the UAE implementing to develop appropriate policies for recovery that balance economic growth with sustainability?</h4><p>In the UAE, we have adopted several measures to balance between economic growth and sustainability. For one, we have restructured our economy to focus on sectors such as tourism, logistics, and trade. In addition, most of the assets of national and foreign banks are located within the country, with their parties well-known and sound. We have also kept the percentage of our bank reserves and capital over our total bank assets far above international Basel II standards. Moving forward, we are continuing with several mega-projects, implementing strategic wage increases, and enhancing our investment offerings to draw in more FDI. We are planning several initiatives to further strengthen trust in our economy and cement our status as a preferred regional and global business and investment partner.</p><h4>As the first female UAE minister and an inspirational role model for young Emirati women, what advice would you impart to budding young female entrepreneurs?</h4><p>I would advise them to aim high and not set limits to what they can achieve; the region has made great strides in opening up opportunities to our sisters. I would like to remind them that women possess many unique traits such as exceptional interpersonal skills, persuasiveness, adaptability, team spirit, and confident decision-making, which make us excellent entrepreneurs. I would also warn them not to fall into the trap of competing against men. Their greatest competition is themselves. They should work with men for the betterment of society.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the rest of 2012?</h4><p>Many indicators point to a breakthrough year for business in the UAE. After a three-year asset slump, the country's banks are looking at a strong profit rally in 2012. We are also optimistic about 4% economic growth this year. Business Monitor International predicts that we will witness a 9% increase in tourist arrivals to 9 million guests; as the region's tourism hub, this will spell big business for the UAE. These are just some of the many barometers pointing to a strong business performance for the remaining months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sme-you]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Department of Economic Development (DED) in achieving the Dubai Strategic Plan 2015?</h4><p>The aim of the Dubai Strategic Plan 2015 is to leverage the Emirate's successful economic diversification for sustainable growth and prosperity. The plan contains a common framework that integrates strategies to promote economic and social development, service excellence, and Dubai's reputation as an ideal destination to live and do business. The Economic Development Plan (EDP) focuses on strengthening the supply-side factors that have contributed to economic growth in Dubai—chiefly the Emirate's strategic location, efficient government, solid institutional framework, effective service delivery mechanisms, strong laws and regulations, superior logistics infrastructure, commitment to free trade, and openness to foreign cultures—and is a key component of the Dubai Strategic Plan 2015. In line with our mandate to support economic policy and planning in Dubai, DED works in collaboration with a wide spectrum of stakeholders from the public and private sectors to ensure that Dubai retains its strong economic performance, leadership, and competitiveness. Ongoing global economic changes also make it necessary to regularly revisit the Dubai Strategic Plan 2015 in order to safeguard our past achievements and define a non-inflationary, sustainable growth path for the Emirate.</p><h4>Why is the development of SMEs so important in Dubai?</h4><p>SMEs are the backbone of Dubai's economy. In total, they account for 95% of the enterprise population, 42% of the workforce, and 40% of annual GDP in Dubai. Empowering these SMEs with knowledge and resources will eventually enable Dubai's economy to be driven by innovation, technology, and high productivity. Our SME strategy focuses on enabling SMEs in Dubai to move to the next level of growth and compete on a global level through better access to capital and government incentives. Dubai SME is a DED agency that is dedicated to implementing this strategy. The agency works with every stakeholder involved in SME development, boosting the entrepreneurial environment in Dubai, building partnerships for SME growth, encouraging innovative start-ups, and grooming promising SMEs. Most recently, Dubai SME announced the “Dubai SME 100," a first-ever ranking initiative aimed to identify the top-performing SMEs in Dubai and enable them to grow. Dubai SME also organized the first Conference on Corporate Governance for SMEs and announced the landmark Code of Corporate Governance in 2011. Both the conference and the code are aimed at educating SMEs on the need to bring in efficient governance practices and transparency, thereby making them more attractive for financial and talent capital. Dubai SME places special emphasis on identifying entrepreneurial talent at a very early age and translating it into successful enterprises. The annual Young Entrepreneur Competition (YEC) is currently in its eighth cycle. The contest promotes entrepreneurial spirit among students in public and private secondary schools and universities across the UAE. In addition, Dubai SME instituted the Young Business Leaders (YBL) award, which honors successful entrepreneurs for their innovations and exemplary leadership. Finally, the government has also developed a Government Procurement Program (GPP) that enables member SMEs to supply 5% of the procurement requirements of Dubai government entities.</p><h4>Have you witnessed any new trends in Business Registration and Licensing (BRL) applications in 2012? Are you seeing increased interest from any nearby markets?</h4><p>Investment inflows and business activity in Dubai have continued to grow, despite the challenging global economic climate. We have seen robust activity across key economic sectors throughout 2011. DED issued 14,360 business licenses in 2011, with the professional services sector accounting for the largest share at 7%. The services sector is also reflecting admirable growth and diversity along the lines of the developed world. Tourism accounted for the second-largest share of licenses issued in 2011. General trade led the list of the top 10 licensed activities in the commercial category, with 1,799 licenses, compared to 1,543 in 2010. Among the top 10 nationalities to which licenses were issued in 2011, citizens of the UK were on top, followed by Saudi Arabians, Indians, and Bahrainis, in that order. The licensing trends clearly indicate that the current economic situation in Dubai and future prospects are promising at both the overall macroeconomic and sectorial levels.</p><h4>What is the focus of the new Center for the Amicable Settlement of Disputes?</h4><p>The Center for the Amicable Settlement of Disputes was set up by DED in cooperation with the Dubai Courts, as a one-stop shop for quick and cost-effective settlements for businesspeople and investors. The center will have offices where legal suits can be filed, as well as judges specialized in dispute settlement and a group of experienced and qualified arbitrators. The center was established following a study submitted by Dubai SME, which revealed the necessity for an investment environment that meets the needs of SME owners and allows for faster and affordable dispute settlement. DED decided to extend the new approach to all businesses, given its wider relevance. The center will enable speedier and affordable dispute settlement, compared to what legal firms and offices offer—without the need to resort to the court system. The initiative also reflects DED's eagerness to cooperate with governmental authorities, thereby elevating business and customer service standards in Dubai.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the DED's four key agencies?</h4><p>DED's mandate is to foster Dubai's economic development, and thus the decision to bring in key developmental agencies under its umbrella. Aside from Dubai SME, one of our agencies is Dubai FDI, which promotes investment opportunities, supports international investors in establishing their operations here and encourages businessmen to take advantage of our strategic location. The agency assists in the identification of sector-specific opportunities, providing connections to a network of both government and non-government partners, as well as support throughout the investment lifecycle. Another agency is Dubai Exports, which promotes exports and re-exports by creating an environment that enables local exporters and helps them establish partnerships with trade promotion agencies across the world. Dubai Exports has developed a range of value-added trade support services for UAE-based firms. These initiatives are designed to accelerate the profitable expansion of Dubai businesses in foreign markets. The final agency is the Dubai Events and Promotions Establishment (DEPE). This organization aims toward developing, promoting, facilitating, and supporting the retail and events sectors in Dubai. DEPE complements Dubai's tourism profile by highlighting the Emirate's strengths and attractiveness as a year-round destination through a variety of events, including the Dubai Shopping Festival.</p><h4>What key insights have been uncovered by the quarterly business surveys?</h4><p>DED has launched quarterly surveys to measure the perceptions of the business community and capture the outlook for the future. It is important for Dubai to offer the latest business updates and forecasts to support economic decision-making in the Emirate. Key trends from the surveys are collated into the Business Confidence Index, thus providing policy-makers, investors, and businesses an objective metric for planning. For example, the findings of the survey for the 4Q2011 indicated rising confidence about future revenues and profits among Dubai businesses and an increasing optimism from SMEs and exporting firms. Over 67% of the survey participants said that they expect an improvement of up to 10 percentage points in sales during the first quarter of 2012, compared to 4Q2011. While 39% of the companies said their profits are likely to remain stable, 44% saw 1Q2012 bringing higher profits. The survey also indicated robust activity across the trade, logistics, and transportation sectors, which are the chief drivers of growth in Dubai. Nearly 30% of the companies surveyed reported that they will increase the size of their workforce, with manufacturing and service firms expressing the strongest interest in hiring. Overall, a progressive build-up of dynamism and confidence is visible across our key sectors, which demonstrates that 2012 will energize growth in Dubai. However, we will continue to closely monitor business sentiments and plans in order to apply corrective actions if and when needed. We firmly believe that these quarterly business surveys are very useful for the business community as a whole.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Dubai's continuing appeal to foreign investors?<br></h4><p>I think it is the positioning of Dubai more than anything else, that as a city it enables businesses not only to come and set up but also grow in the entire region. From Dubai you can reach out to a population of around 2.2 billion within four hours; this is very important for investors. Dubai represents and is accepted as a global services center to many multinationals looking at expanding their businesses in the region and globally.</p><h4>What measures have you taken to increase Dubai's appeal as a hub?</h4><p>We are focusing more on the central role of Dubai in the region. Our location has been key to our status as a hub, and we will continue to be important regionally and globally in the future.</p><p>On the economic development front we are looking at best practices that we can learn from, while at the same time trying out new things boldly and being innovative in the way we develop our infrastructure to make it more appealing to businesses. We are also launching campaigns across the global media, and new success stories are being told to the world. In addition, the key economic messages of Dubai are delivered across bilateral and multinational platforms, such as delegation visits, missions, and conferences.</p><h4>Has the recent regional unrest had a direct impact on FDI flowing into Dubai?</h4><p>Regional unrest always creates a positive flow into surrounding markets that are stable and have sound fundamentals. It is important to note that Dubai has been a safe haven for investment for many years, and will continue to be a preferred investment destination, not so much due to regional unrest, but because of the underlying fundamentals driving the economy. Dubai has proven that it can compete on an international scale in times of global growth and in times of global decline, which is proof of a resilient economy.</p><h4>What initiatives are being taken to continually increase Dubai's attraction as an FDI destination in light of the increasing competition from regional markets such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar?</h4><p>We have been observing competition for a long time, and we are convinced more than ever that such competition should be welcomed by all means. One of the philosophies of Dubai is that rather than being looked at as one city—as one center of excellence—we want there to be a holistic approach to the market. Being part of a region where there are a number of cities that are vibrant only serves to add value to what Dubai has to offer in terms of investment propositions.</p><h4>How does the government balance the interests of local businesses in the market against the entrance of international companies?</h4><p>In terms of the free market, Dubai, since its inception, has set no real limit as to where foreign companies can invest. We now have global companies here in the market, and we would like our own companies to be more competitive in order to enter and be established in the global market. When we look at those family-owned businesses now, they appear well positioned to become more international and offer more opportunities for joint ventures. There are still a few protected areas, such as oil and gas and telecommunications, but these are highly advanced areas. Generally, the government wants to support multinationals that can add to diversity and competence to the business sector and engage in fair competition with local firms. It will help both sides by creating new jobs and opportunities for the training and development of the local population and knowledge transfer.</p><h4>In which sectors are you seeing increasing activity and from which markets?</h4><p>The main areas witnessing activity are trade, logistics, hospitality, and tourism, and we are also starting to see an improved flow into real estate. However, trade, logistics, and services continue to dominate the scene. We have more than 16,000 hotel rooms under development, which for a location like Dubai is very important. ICT is also a strong sector. We are seeing encouraging development in the healthcare and education sectors, and we support this because we want to see global best practices in these two sectors. As for our major trading partners, we see India, China, the UK, the US, and Switzerland in the top rung, and we are starting to see an increased flow coming in from South American countries as they look to diversify their trade balances with different regions in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You last visited in Autumn 2011. Why did the recent trade mission choose the UAE specifically?<br></h4><p>In the current economic climate, trade and investment have taken center stage as sources of sustainable growth, with governments and consumers no longer able to turn to debt to finance their spending. The UAE is a very important market for the UK. It is the 16th largest export market for the UK globally, and the number one market in the region. It is an exciting and growing market that UK companies are very keen to do business with. While our relationship is very strong, there is still more to do in order to build up business in the UAE and to encourage companies from the UAE to enter the UK market.</p><h4>During your trip in 2011, many references were made to London as the “Eighth Emirate." What is special about the investment relationship between the UAE and the UK?</h4><p>UAE companies have invested significantly in the UK, from the London Gateway, which will be London's largest deep-sea port and logistics park, funded by DP World, to the London Array offshore wind farm. I welcome this investment, which brings great benefits to both sides. The UAE is also a popular destination for people from the UK. There are some 4,000 British companies based in the UAE and 100,000 British nationals living there. Many of them have been involved in the UAE's development over the past decade, helping to make it the exciting, diverse regional hub it has become.</p><h4>Dubai has emerged as a regional hub for investment and business activities throughout the Middle East. What has made Dubai successful in this way?</h4><p>It is clear that in recent years the center of gravity in the global economy has shifted from west to east, and from north to south. Dubai has successfully positioned itself as a hub for the growing economies of the Middle East and Africa. The vision of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has diversified the country's economy away from traditional oil and gas businesses into a finance, investment, and tourism hub.</p><h4>In which industries and sectors do you see the most potential for greater commercial integration between Dubai and the UK?</h4><p>There are many sectors where the UK and the UAE already work closely together. Ties with the Lord Mayor of the City of London are very close. In terms of infrastructure, British companies are very active in the UAE and vice versa. There are also great opportunities for closer commercial integration across all sectors, such as education, ICT, health care, energy, life sciences, and the creative industries. In autumn 2011, UK Trade &amp; Investment will be inviting British companies to attend the “Big 5 2012" construction fair and trade show.</p><h4>What is your outlook for UK businesses operating in Dubai and for the region as a whole in the coming year?</h4><p>I am very positive about UK businesses in the UAE, not least because an increasing number of them are going out to test the waters. UK Trade &amp; Investment in the UAE helped around 2,400 British companies in 2011, and this number has grown despite the global downturn—a sure sign that the market continues to offer exciting opportunities and that UK SMEs are willing to take on the challenge. We are well on the way to achieving our aim of increasing bilateral trade to £12 billion by 2015—a good indication of the strong economic bonds that continue to exist between our two countries and the significant investment opportunities that lie ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the positive outcomes from your visit to Dubai?<br></h4><p>I came to Dubai with ProChile, the Chilean promotion bureau, to participate in the Gulfood 2012 fair. We are aiming to enhance the volumes of trade between Chile and the region. When you promote a country, there are three sectors to consider: international trade, investments, and tourism. International trade and tourism have a similar sales pitch in terms of attracting customers, but investments are a different ball game. While in tourism, you may hope for surprises in a newly discovered country, in investments you don't want any surprises. International trade is a precursor to investments. We have seen the volume of trade increasing between the UAE and Chile. We want to reach a tipping point at which the international trade between the two countries reaches the investment level.</p><h4>What does the opening of the UAE's embassy in Santiago in 2011 say about the trade relationship between the two countries?</h4><p>International relations are based upon signaling, and this was a great signal for us. It demonstrates the commitment of the UAE to the region. We are hoping to launch direct flights from Santiago to Dubai. There is a direct flight to Brazil, and they will open a new route to Argentina. However, the volume of trade has a high correlation with the number of direct flights.</p><h4>What does Dubai have to offer in terms of Chile's opening up to the Middle East?</h4><p>Dubai is a hub. Its people have local regional knowledge, share the same religion, and practice the same customs. It's easier for us to go through Dubai than to make trade relations with the neighboring countries on our own. Dubai has 1,400 hotels. The hospitality sector is huge, and there is a lot of room for the international trade of Chilean products such as wine, fruit, and dried foods.</p><h4>What other exports is Chile promoting in Dubai?</h4><p>In terms of international trade, there are certain sectors we are tying to push, such as pharmaceuticals. The are many pharmaceuticals companies that want to set up here. Other manufactured products, such as produced olive oil, are also in demand. In terms of investments, we have a portfolio of public and private projects in sectors such as agribusiness, infrastructure, energy, and mining. We are especially focused on agribusiness, given the fact that this region has issues with food security, and Chile has very healthy food production. Chileans consume just 20% of what we produce. We also have the third-largest supply of lithium, following Kazakhstan and Bolivia.</p><h4>What opportunities and challenges do you anticipate in Dubai?</h4><p>I think that food is critical, and we have many opportunities in that sector. If it wishes to become a technology hub, it will start to require lithium, iron, and copper. There is a problem with branding; when other countries think about Latin America, they tend to focus on Brazil, the same way China has been the focal point in Asia. There are many countries on the side that are not as well-known and considered. We are trying to brand our position and sell our attributes. Latin America is a region of the world, and people usually view it with a lot of prejudice and believe the stereotypes, which are simply untrue in Chile.</p><h4>How do you help businesses interested in investing in Chile?</h4><p>There is a huge difference between the governments in the Gulf region and governments back home. In Chile, the government comes behind the private sector, as the private sector leads and knows best. However, in the Middle East it's more government-to-government. The trade commissioner supports people who may be willing to invest, and while we are here in Dubai, we try to set them up with a plane to Chile. You can trade or make a touristic decision based on a brochure, but it's very unlikely that someone will invest without seeing the country itself. Our goal is to convince them to visit Chile.</p><h4>How supportive has the UAE government been during this initiative?</h4><p>The government has openly supported us. The fact that it opened an embassy is a good sign. Since the UAE is flying to Brazil, it's a signal that there is more interest in the region. The UAE is becoming more aware of Latin America and its potential, especially during these times when Europe is not doing so well. The US also has an election this year, and the UAE is viewing that as another opportunity to try and diversify its portfolio in terms of investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Isle of Man and Dubai share a number of economic strengths. What scope is there for an enhanced trade relationship?<br></h4><p>Indeed, we share mutual strengths in independent areas of expertise, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Our desire is to explore opportunities with the Emirates and further develop the already positive relationship at a government level. Equally, the Isle already has a number of excellent businesses and brands operating in the Middle East region, fully complementing the local offering. Examples include our life insurance companies, such as Zurich, which bases its international operations on the Isle, employs several hundred people in the UAE, and sells investment and savings products globally. The government on the Isle of Man is committed to providing support to such organizations.</p><h4>What role does the UAE and wider Middle East play in the ongoing trade development vision?</h4><p>Without a doubt, the Middle East has emerged as a key region in a global economic context, particularly over the past two decades. Furthermore, the ongoing growth pattern remains evident. This factor and Dubai's geographic location will continue to ensure the prominence of the region. The Isle of Man has recognized the opportunities, and for some time our government-to-government relationship has been strong. We have identified a number of possibilities to explore and the authorities are excited by the mutually beneficial prospects. While there have been past visits by former ministers and chief ministers to the region, with the advent of our new department committed to a sustained regional strategy for developing relationships, the Middle East has the potential to become our second most important market after the UK.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see particular development potential opportunities?</h4><p>Both the Middle East and the Isle of Man have demonstrated excellence in many areas. Undoubtedly, the financial services sector will feature in our joint appraisal of areas in which we can work together. In particular, our vibrantly successful international wealth management offering has potential; many globally branded businesses use the Isle of Man as a center from which to operate. We anticipate great opportunities as we explore this further. The Isle of Man also has clear strengths in asset structuring, retirement solutions, and succession planning. Diversity is a feature of the relevant economies, and we will welcome discussions at both a government and business level in the coming months. For now, a number of great ideas are emerging, which we are very eager to explore in the region. We know that sharia-compliant products may be important in the region, and there is no reason why our businesses cannot offer these. I know one or two companies that already do. We also now have foundations that are more readily accepted structures for holding assets in civil law countries, recognizing that our traditional trusts were not as popular.</p><h4>What are the benefits for the registration of aircraft from the UAE and the wider Middle East?</h4><p>We are proud of our renowned aircraft register, a highly successful component of our overall proposition. The register has a number of features. It is the world's only aircraft registry dedicated exclusively to executive jets, and our legislation and requirements are tailored uniquely to the executive jet sectors. In addition, we recognize and accept design standards and licenses issued by multiple jurisdictions, with an unrivalled service standard. Our charging scheme is highly competitive and includes a secure mortgage register. The private and public sectors work together closely to offer an integrated one-stop shop for our clients. Lastly, we offer a neutral national registration prefix (M), which is highly desirable to many owners.</p><h4>How strong is the government-to-government relationship?</h4><p>The respective governments have fostered a relationship for many years, and I am aware that former chief ministers are cited with great fondness by many existing government officials in the Emirates. Following meetings at the end of 2011 between counterparts from the Isle of Man and Dubai, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Department of Economic Development in Dubai and the Isle in January 2012. This is designed to underline our desire to work together for mutual benefit and will be the subject of a number of meetings during my visit to the region. We will pursue further agreements in the Middle East—the recently signed Double Taxation Agreement with Qatar is just one example.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main strengths of Dubai as a possible location for the World Expo 2020?<br></h4><p>Dubai's commitment to host the World Expo is really about placing Dubai as a location where culture, ideas, and people from all around the world can come together to share and contribute their thoughts and add meaning and value to the environment and world around them. We believe that Dubai has many factors that make it a particularly good candidate, with the first being its geographic positioning. We have a very good position between East and West and have very strong relations with countries in the south. Historically, both in the last 40 years as the UAE and long before, we have always been a kind of hub. This is a place where people from all over have passed through. Secondly, we feel we have some incredible infrastructure, from our airport to roads to ports to the metro; we have everything necessary to facilitate the flow of millions of people who will have to come through. The third important quality that Dubai has is the fact that it is already a mini expo with more than 200 nationalities living here and showcasing their nationalities, art, and culture. To have 200 different nationalities that live and work here is something very special and shows that we are very open to the world. I think our fourth strength is that this is such a strong place for business. Some of the most important companies from around the world are here; 60% or 70% of the Fortune 500 companies have headquarters in Dubai.</p><h4>What is the idea behind the “connecting minds, creating the future" theme?</h4><p>The UAE is a responsible global citizen. We look at the world around us and realize there are challenges out there; we then try to address them. This notion of global citizenship is very important for Dubai and for the UAE in general. We believe that “connecting minds, creating the future" is the right theme as we feel that through doing that we can address global challenges. What we have done is looked at the global challenges in the world today and what they may be in 2020. Some will be energy security, employment generation for the youth, integration, the empowerment of women, climate change, and the efficacy of aid programs. What we see today may be exacerbated by 2020 and we want our theme to address these global challenges and help to provide solutions for them.</p><h4>What motivated the choice of the large plot by the new Al Maktoum Airport as the proposed location for the event?</h4><p>Expo 2020 is really a national project that involves the support of all of the Emirates and, obviously the Prime Minister. We felt that having a site that is located half an hour from Abu Dhabi's airport and 40 minutes from Dubai's airport will allow us to capitalize on the strengths of both cities. It is also connected to the Al Maktoum International Airport through a seamless corridor and to Dubai's ports. We see this connection with the new ports and airports as one large web of connectivity. The 400-hectare site will be best leveraged because it is connected to such important logistics and transportation nodes.</p><h4>How important is Dubai's role in terms of the development of the new Silk Route?</h4><p>Our role as a hub has dated back to the early 19th and 20th century. We have evidence of people who have come through Dubai to East Africa and Europe to Asia and East Asia. This is something that is very integral to us as a fact of history. With Dubai, we have that historical merit, and the city is built upon it. Dubai is also very keen to become more modern and efficient, embracing new technology and new ways of doing things. We see ourselves as very much a part of the new Silk Route. There are more than 200,000 Chinese people who live in the UAE. We have over 4,000 Chinese companies based out of the Emirates. Every single day, you will see travellers here making that East to West journey and now, more and more, we see the South to North connections as well. In my daily interaction with colleagues in Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, I see that movement continuously. It is all happening in Dubai, primarily.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The future always surprises us. We cannot predict it, but we do have a responsibility to look ahead and trace its outlines, as well as the opportunities and challenges it will present.<br></p><p>In 2050, our young nation, the United Arab Emirates, will be almost exactly twice as old as it is today. Forty years of foresight and strenuous hard work by our people and our country have led to our achievements and laid the foundations for our global position today and a prosperous future.</p><p>Dubai and the UAE sit at the intersection of one of the most transformative moments in geo-economic history in more than a century: the gradual but inevitable shift of the economic center of gravity from the West to emerging markets and the rise of new trade markets.</p><p>Between now and 2050, emerging markets will be the main engine of global economic growth. In this new world, trade flows will be infinitely more connected than ever before, and goods, services, and people more mobile than at any time in the past.</p><p>Here in Dubai and the UAE, we see these trends as positive. While we recognize the profound importance of safeguarding our identity and traditions—keeping sight of who we are and where we come from—we embrace the possibilities the future presents for our people, our city, and our country.</p><p>Standing at the center of trade between the Middle East and Asia linking Latin America, Africa, and beyond, Dubai is shaping and catalyzing this new world of trade and investment flows.</p><p>Trade is important, of course, but we also recognize the importance and resilience of a knowledge-based economy as a key driver of sustainable growth and opportunities.</p><p>We continue to invest not just in hard infrastructure but also in soft infrastructure; our education, our healthcare, and a culture that promotes the research and development of new ideas.</p><p>Based on our vision of the new world, we are equally committed to building a sustainable environment that supports the growth of our economy.</p><p>Our Green Economy Initiative announced earlier this year reaffirms our commitment to diversify energy sources and preserve the environment whilst strengthening our competitive position. Through this initiative, we aim to become a world-leading center for the export and re-export of green products and technologies.</p><p>While there are many routes to success, here in Dubai, we are seizing the economic, cultural, and scientific opportunities represented by the future, forging new connections, and positioning Dubai for growth across this decade and the ones that follow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Chamber's strategy aligned with the 2012-2016 Federation of the UAE Chambers of Commerce vision?</h4><p>The Dubai Chamber was established in 1965 through a decree issued by the late Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum. He realized the important role that a chamber of commerce would play in supporting the economy, and since then the Dubai Chamber has become a major business organization in the UAE. Over the past decade, company profiles have altered dramatically and are now much more sophisticated than what they were 10 years ago. By updating and refining our products and services in line with differing business needs, we have been able to attract new members and better support and protect the wider business community. Our offices are located in key commercial areas in order to make our products and services more accessible to the business community. They can be found in the Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza), Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZ), and Al Awir area, as well as at the Department of Economic Development (DED), Al Twar Center, and Dubai Industrial City. Our services have also changed to become more complex as doing business becomes more sophisticated. Not only do we offer documentation services for traders, we also provide legal advice and support, business networking opportunities, and economic research to the entire business community. At the same time, we are helping companies meet international standards of sustainable business through our Center for Responsible Business and resolve commercial disputes in an amicable way through the Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC). Helping our members meet best international practice is part of Dubai Chamber's strategy. Therefore, we are closely aligned with the strategy of the Federation of the UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FCCI) for the 2012-2016 period. Earlier in 2012, we hosted and participated in the first workshop for the FCCI team responsible for developing the proposed new strategy. The project is important, and the Dubai Chamber will support and contribute in any way possible to accelerate the development of the strategy, which aims to develop technical and administrative policies based on best international standards.</p><h4>As one of the world's top 10 business destinations, what are the factors that lend credibility to Dubai as an international business hub?</h4><p>Dubai has a number of benefits for international businesses, which help attract new companies every year from all corners of the globe. These include the city's strategic location in the center of the map. Dubai offers easy access to several major consumer markets and as such is one of the world's leading re-export destinations. At the same time, Dubai offers companies a safe and stable environment to do business. The city is geared toward helping companies prosper with business-friendly laws, modern infrastructure, and a diverse and predominantly young workforce. One attraction for international businesses specifically is free zones, which are tax free and allow for full ownership and profit repatriation.</p><h4>Which regions have you identified as holding significant potential?</h4><p>The main markets we have identified include India, CIS countries, Africa, and Latin America. Dubai historically has strong ties with India and parts of Africa, and we are working hard to build stronger links with many countries, particularly in eastern Africa, by sending overseas delegations and hosting the Eastern African Community Forum in Dubai in October 2012. Meanwhile, Latin American and CIS countries are witnessing incredibly strong growth, and we believe that our members could benefit from the opportunities being created in those parts of the world.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of exports and companies applying for membership?</h4><p>Our members' exports in 2011 reached AED246 billion, which is 14.5% higher compared to 2010. This total is also higher than the peak in 2008, which was AED213 billion. This expansion demonstrates the strength of the trade sector and its importance for Dubai's economic growth. As for our membership trends, last year we added 10,092 new members, which took our total membership to over 128,000. This was an increase of 8.5%, which points toward the economic growth that Dubai witnessed in 2011. We have seen our membership increase again to over 130,000 in 1Q2012, as more companies choose to set up in the Emirate.</p><h4>What benefits will the ATA Carnet system bring to Dubai, and what motivated the initiation of the system at this stage?</h4><p>The UAE began accepting ATA Carnets for goods for use at trade fairs, shows, and exhibitions on April 1, 2011. The Dubai Chamber is the national guaranteeing and issuing agency of ATA Carnets in the UAE. Known as a “passport for goods," the ATA Carnet is an international customs document that permits the duty-free and tax-free temporary import of goods for up to one year. The UAE is the first country in the GCC to implement this system, and we are encouraging our partners across the region to also adopt it. In Dubai, there are many trade shows every year, and the adoption of this system will make importing products and goods for display much simpler and more affordable. This will be a major boost for companies working in the sector. We firmly believe it will help attract more exhibitors to Dubai, which was one reason behind our motivation to use the ATA Carnet system.</p><h4>What lessons were learned from the global liquidity crisis, and how far along the road to recovery would you say Dubai's economy is?</h4><p>The main lesson learned was about stability. We need to move away from the boom and bust years and focus on achieving sustainable growth over a longer period. And this is not just a lesson for Dubai—this applies to every economy in the world. In terms of recovery, Dubai has come a long way. The country's key economy drivers—trade, tourism, logistics, and financial services—have bounced back to their pre-crisis levels. That is not to say we are out of the woods yet, especially considering the financial pressures that continue globally. However, we are certainly on a more even footing.</p><h4>Where in particular can further reforms be implemented to facilitate economic growth?</h4><p>A number of new laws and updates to existing legislation are currently being studied by the UAE authorities, which will help drive business growth. These include a draft of the UAE bankruptcy law, to be ready by the end of 2012. The law is aimed to enable listed and family-owned businesses in the UAE to be rescued, rather than having to go through lengthy liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings should they fall into financial difficulty. This will have the effect of easing restructuring and offering out-of-court negotiations, which in turn will help attract more overseas investments.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012 for the Chamber's activities and the wider economy?</h4><p>In 2012, Dubai Chamber will focus its efforts on enhancing business relations with key emerging markets in India and Africa. In October 2012, we will host the Eastern African Community Forum in Dubai to help build bridges and connect our members with interested companies overseas. This follows delegation visits to Surat and Ethiopia. Generally, we anticipate Dubai's economic growth to be around 3%-4% in 2012.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How developed are the UAE accounting standards requirements for auditing practices?<br></h4><p>Presently, the Commercial Companies Laws do not specify any accounting standards framework for the preparation of financial statements. The Central Bank of the UAE has made it mandatory for banks to prepare their accounts as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Listed companies prepare their accounts according to the IFRS. In the absence of any specific standards framework in the UAE, most of the practicing firms apply IFRS in the preparation of audited financial statements, and apply International Standards of Auditing in the conduct of the audit of financial statements. The Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA) of the Land Department also recommends that the financial statements of buildings owners' associations should be prepared according to IFRS.</p><h4>Did the global economic crisis place greater importance on the need for strong internal auditing and risk management procedures?</h4><p>As economic conditions change, so too must risk management priorities. That is why internal auditors should consider—first and foremost—whether they are aligned with the strategy and direction of the company. By focusing on the company's long-term strategy, understanding the impact of short-term initiatives on this strategy, and aligning itself accordingly, the internal audit function can better position itself to monitor and address risk management activities throughout the organization.</p><h4>How is the Strata Titled and Jointly Owned Property legislation governed in Dubai, and how prevalent is this type of ownership in the Emirate? What kind of auditing issues should owners be aware of?</h4><p>Dubai's Jointly Owned Property Law (Law No. 27 of 2007) establishes a framework for the development and sub-division of developments into such units and common parts, with the sub-division known as “jointly owned property." Each development in Dubai comprises not only a number of units, but also common parts designed for common use by unit owners and occupants. Regulations have been introduced to enforce the law, and among other things, they provide that an owners' association of all the unit owners is responsible for the management, operation, and maintenance of common areas. For each development, the developer must file a “jointly owned property declaration" with the Land Department. RERA made it mandatory to submit the annual audited financial statements of owners' associations.</p><h4>In terms of business challenges, what sort of reforms to the framework do you think would enhance the development and resilience of the economy?</h4><p>The reform of insolvency and creditor/debtor regimes can improve economic efficiencies and strengthen market resilience in times of crisis. Reforming the insolvency law to provide a clear, predicable, and transparent means for a company to reorganize would benefit the national economy and all UAE companies by reducing the cost of capital for UAE companies over the medium- to long-term. A bankruptcy law already exists. However, it has not been tested by any company, which means there is much uncertainty in legal circles about how it could be applied in reality. Best practice corporate governance provisions can play an important role in stimulating investment in the UAE and enhancing the confidence of investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the strategy of the Department of Tourism, Commerce, &amp; Marketing (DTCM) tie into Dubai's integrated 2015 strategy?<br></h4><p>All sectors of the economy and the corresponding governing bodies contribute to that strategy. Over the past few years, Dubai's tourism numbers have been very positive compared to many other destinations. The sector is growing, and the results have been pleasing. We have made several changes according to various global issues. At the moment, the sector is one of the leading segments boosting the economy. The government and the private sector work closely to achieve the targets we set.</p><h4></h4><h4>Dubai currently has some of the highest hotel occupancy rates in the world. What factors have led to this success?</h4><p>There are a number of reasons. Looking at the steady annual growth we've experienced for many years, we have built Dubai as a tourist destination. Marketing is done through our overseas offices. We have chosen the right markets and reviewed our work and changes year after year. We are up to date with the changes happening in other markets, and we are evaluating our source markets. We consider our opportunities very carefully. Looking at the average global performance, Dubai is far ahead. Working together with the private sector and the other government organizations, we were able to achieve success through marketing campaigns that suit each market. With the exception of the 2008-2009 period, when our source markets suffered financial troubles, we have always had good occupancy rates. The right things happen in Dubai because we enhance our products in the right way and the right place and also launch new products.</p><h4>How have your source markets changed and developed?</h4><p>Up until now, and for the past two decades, Europe had been one of our main markets. The UK is one of our main markets, and Saudi Arabia is also one of our strategic markets. However, now we can see that the value of the pound has fallen. In Australia, it's the other way around; the value of the Australian dollar has been much higher in the last few years, and that is a market where we are advertising Dubai. This is part of the evaluation that we do when we consider a market; we look at the economy, the value of the currency, the aircraft capacity, and the competitors' offerings.</p><h4>Are there any sectors in the hospitality segment for which the DTCM is trying to attract FDI?</h4><p>We are always trying to attract FDI. However, local involvement is so great that we find that those investments are actually enough to support the tourism sector. The hotels and resorts are mainly funded by local investment. In terms of related services, there is large interest from foreign investors, who are active in various segments.</p><h4></h4><h4>What can Dubai offer as a venue for international events?</h4><p>When you consider the primary requirements that event organizers from around the world are seeking in a destination, Dubai delivers it all. It's almost as if Dubai was designed specifically for events. Firstly, it's easy to get to. With Emirates Airlines, the ease of access is incomparable to most other destinations. Dubai International Airport also offers services and conveniences that make arriving and departing from Dubai easy and enjoyable. The recently expanded Dubai International Conference and Exhibition Centre offers over 90,000 sqm of flexible event space. Additionally, Dubai has over 74,000 hotel rooms to fit all types of delegates' budgets. The city has exciting excursions, unique catering venues, in addition to cultural and heritage sites that bring it all together. Getting around Dubai is also well planned with the use of any of our ground handlers or the Dubai Metro, which connects Dubai International Airport, the convention center, and over 18,000 hotel rooms on the Red Line. The DTCM has focused on increasing its share of this market by creating the Dubai Convention Bureau. This section of the DTCM is solely focused on bringing more MICE opportunities to the Emirate.</p><h4>What do you think the World Expo 2020 would bring to Dubai from a tourism perspective?</h4><p>The primary sectors that are greatly affected by hosting a World Expo are infrastructure, retail, and tourism. Tourism stands to gain a great deal by hosting this event, with an expected attendance of 25 million visitors. The impact that this amount of visitors has on a destination over a six-month period is truly staggering. The tourism projects that are developed for this large-scale event will also have a legacy affect on the region. Many cities that have hosted the event in the past are still benefiting from the expo, even 50 or more years after the event, such as the case with Seattle, which is this year celebrating the 50th anniversary of the event taking place. As a candidate city and hopefully the host city, promotional campaigns around the bid and event will be included in all of the DTCM's overseas activities.</p><h4>Dubai is a very cosmopolitan location. How do you work to keep the Arabian spirit alive?</h4><p>We've been building Dubai as a tourism destination for over 23 years. Everything is highly controlled, and people understand each other. The cultures have blended very well. Dubai has been cooperative with the international community for many years, with many people from every region doing business here. This integration hasn't created any conflicts or clashes among the population, and the transition has happened very smoothly. People have come to respect and appreciate what we have here.</p><h4></h4><h4>What is the significance of the Green Tourism Award?</h4><p>Green tourism is of course now a trend for many cities. For us, tourism is one of the main sectors we are developing, and green tourism is attractive for a large segment of people from around the world. When we presented the Green Tourism Award to our partners, we received many requests from organizations and individuals to take part from across Dubai and the UAE. The development of green tourism is very important for people and it is also a useful marketing tool for us.</p><h4>How will the impact of knowledge transfer impact the tourism industry?</h4><p>Our product has become better, and the demand is growing. However, our source markets are still suffering from terrible economies. We have to monitor the market to make quick changes and launch rapid promotional activities. Our flexibility is what is helping us grow actively in the area, and this evaluation is happening on a daily basis. The knowledge transfer is helping us better understand how the markets are evolving and changing, and this in turn has led us to better select our targets.</p><h4></h4><h4>What are the key events and activities happening for the DTCM in 2012?</h4><p>We will be marketing Dubai as a tourism center in different and direct ways. Our strategy from a few years ago cannot function as such today; we have to update our targets and plan. We will seek new markets, and we are hoping to be present in markets where we haven't been before, such as Latin America, where we are doing events and exhibitions. We are establishing an office base in Latin America. The potential in Latin America is greater than it was before, especially as Emirates has opened new destinations throughout the continent, and we work closely with the airline to develop new routes. We are also seeking to open up in markets such as Belgium and Spain. We are entering new markets and enhancing our current markets through increased representation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai Culture is leading a renaissance of the cultural scene in Dubai, transforming the city into a hub of culture, arts, and heritage. How is Dubai unique in the region with regard to its efforts in culture?<br></h4><p>As home to some of the world's most iconic achievements, Dubai has gained a reputation as a multicultural center of creativity and innovation, a reputation that global art institutions have recognized. With dedicated cultural and artistic spaces, and over 70 galleries active throughout the year, Dubai's thriving arts community has sparked increasing interest throughout the region, in part because of its geographic location and the emergence of knowledgeable collectors with more sophisticated tastes from the region and across the globe. Today, Dubai has earned a firm spot on the global art-commerce map. Furthermore, a committed government demonstrating its support in the form of funding, community involvement, and educational programs—as highlighted by Dubai Culture's various initiatives including the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Patrons of the Arts Awards—has produced a conducive environment to promote all aspects of culture and the arts. Established and emerging artists have both found recognition here and abroad, for example, by taking center stage at the second appearance of the UAE pavilion at the Venice Biennale. The continued growth of the cultural scene in Dubai is most apparent in the Al Quoz Industrial Area, now home to many art galleries, rehearsal spaces for musicians and performers, as well as photography and design studios. This development is similar to the beginnings of such artistic hubs as Factory 798 in Beijing, where industrial areas have become a haven for an arts industry to thrive in. This, in addition to the Gate Village in the Dubai International Financial Centre, is a pulsating community for art and culture. Two major annual art fairs, Art Dubai and the SIKKA Art Fair, and several film, literature, and theater festivals fill up the city's arts calendar.</p><h4>What strategies do you conduct to keep the essential Arabian spirit alive while promoting more internationalization?</h4><p>We, at the Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, believe in remaining firmly rooted in our Arabian identity throughout our further progress toward wider global recognition in the cultural scene. By initiating several pioneering projects we have broadened and deepened public engagement with the arts, culture, and heritage. The most crucial function of the Authority is to build on the city's cultural identity and protect its national heritage, while contributing to the transformation of Dubai's cultural and artistic landscape. To achieve this, the Authority has formulated policies to preserve and foster the heritage and traditional facets and assets of the city, while collaborating with global art centers and government entities that will play an integral role in enhancing cultural knowledge and promoting global dialogue on culture and the arts. Dubai Culture has announced several initiatives that strengthen the historic and modern cultural fabric of Dubai including Khor Dubai, a living museum; activities at Al Bastakiya; Dubai Next; heritage week, and heritage centers in schools.</p><h4>How would you assess Dubai Culture's contribution to intercultural dialogue?</h4><p>Dubai Culture is committed to enhancing awareness of culture and arts in Dubai by fostering robust dialogue with the public to generate interest in the sector, while creating and implementing a strong marketing strategy. Each initiative led or supported by the Authority spearheads and encourages both the public and private sector to play an active role in promoting Dubai's true cultural and artistic essence. The Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Patrons of the Arts Awards is a pioneering and trail-blazing initiative that further strengthens the active participation of patrons, the building blocks of the cultural landscape. The effect and importance of patronage is now highly visible, with increased involvement from the private sector across all key disciplines. The success of Dubai Culture's focus to promote cultural and arts patronage has been further underlined with a noticeable increase in the support of patrons to various art forms in the city. In the third cycle in 2012, some 44% of those honored were new patrons, apart from a 17.5% overall increase in patrons, underscoring the increased interest among organizations and individuals in driving the arts sector. Of total patrons, 15% comprised government departments and organizations, a 75% increase compared with the first cycle.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has Jumeirah Group played in the rise of Dubai as a luxury holiday destination?<br></h4><p>Since the opening of our first property, Jumeirah Beach Hotel in 1997, we have worked closely with both Emirates Airlines and the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing to promote Dubai as a luxury travel destination. The opening of our flagship hotel, Burj Al Arab in 1999, followed by the opening of Madinat Jumeirah in 2004, reinforced Dubai's image as a world-class, year-round holiday destination. As the Jumeirah and Emirates brands expand their global reach, we are continuing to promote Dubai in new overseas markets, such as China, Russia, Brazil, and the US.</p><h4>Where is the group planning to expand and why?</h4><p>When we began our international expansion in 2005, we identified the “key letterhead cities" around the world, which became the priority destinations for our expansion. Just like an airline, a successful hotel brand should be represented in a number of “tier one" locations, such as London, Frankfurt, Shanghai, and New York. Over the past 12 months we have reinforced our presence in Europe by opening five new hotels: Jumeirah Frankfurt, Jumeirah Grand Hotel Via Veneto in Rome, Jumeirah Port Soller Hotel &amp; Spa in Mallorca, Pera Palace Hotel Jumeirah in Istanbul, and Grosvenor House Apartments by Jumeirah Living in London. Going forward we plan to open new hotels in the Asia-Pacific and MENA regions to ensure that our brand is represented in all key markets. Over the past year, we have expanded our portfolio internationally from 10 hotels at the beginning of 2011 to over 20 hotels at the beginning of 2012. These include new properties in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, the Maldives, Shanghai, Frankfurt, Istanbul, London, Mallorca, and Rome.</p><h4>How has Jumeirah Group managed to maintain its position at the head of the industry?</h4><p>Our hotels in Dubai are the market leaders in terms of occupancy rates and revenue per available room (RevPAR). The beachfront resorts recorded extended periods of full occupancy averaging at 84.4% during the first four months of 2012, while RevPAR—the industry standard for measuring revenue in relation to rooms available—has grown by 18.7%. Jumeirah's city hotels have also regained their leading position with an average occupancy rate of 85.5% and RevPAR growth of 8.4%. Over the years, our hotels and resorts have gained a reputation as the finest in the city, and therefore we enjoy a high ratio of return guests. Sirius, our loyalty program, has also proved to be highly successful. Jumeirah has also hosted and sponsored a number of prestigious events that truly showcase the very best of the properties and the destination. These include Art Dubai, which takes place in Madinat Jumeirah every year, and the Dubai International Film Festival. On the sponsorship side, Jumeirah is very proud of the achievements of Rory McIlroy, our Global Brand Ambassador, who is now recognized not only as one of the top golfers in the world, but as one of the top sports personalities.</p><h4>What role has the food and beverage aspect of the group's operations played in the business?</h4><p>The business of food and beverage has been an essential part of Jumeirah's success. We now operate over 100 restaurants, bars, and lounges in our hotels in Dubai. We also have a dedicated restaurant division, which is in charge of a number of restaurant licenses. Some of these have been developed in-house, such as the noodle house, which is now represented on a franchise basis in a number of countries in the Middle East, and will soon be opening outlets in the UK, Russia, and Morocco. Additionally, Jumeirah operates several restaurants under a license agreement with Caprice Holding, such as The Ivy Dubai, The Rivington Grill, and Scott's, which is due to open later this year at Jumeirah at Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. These restaurants provide an authentic London dining experience and have proved very popular with our guests.</p><h4>Dubai is also a hub for MICE tourism. Is this an important revenue generator for Jumeirah?</h4><p>MICE tourism forms an integral part of our business. Jumeirah offers one of the largest MICE facilities in the region and we are delighted with the results we achieve. Our hotels in Dubai host a number of high-profile events, such as the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council meetings, the Arabian Hotel Investment Conference, Leaders in Dubai, and Dubai International Film Festival.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan aims to modernize its railway infrastructure. What is the role of Tulpar Talgo in achieving this goal?</h4><p>I believe that Tulpar Talgo will play a key role in this area, and we are already in the early stages of achieving the needs of passenger trains for the national rail network, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy. In the future, we will consider the possibility of exporting to the CIS region. This is the first project using such advanced technology in the CIS region. Our vehicles utilize unique technology for the suspension system, which allows the trains to reach maximum speeds while carrying our passengers on curved sections of track in complete comfort.</p><h4>What are the prospects for Kazakhstan to become a manufacturer of transportation equipment, and how will this help Kazakhstan diversify its economy?</h4><p>We will gain experience, create new employment offerings, and support local producers, from which we can purchase different parts and materials. The company constantly increases the amount of local content and searches for potential suppliers in the local manufacturing industry. In addition, many European companies seek to form partnerships with us as they continue providing for the Spanish branch of the company, Talgo. The purpose of Tulpar Talgo is to enhance the role of domestic materials producers in the construction of cars, combined with the leadership of our European partners, in order to contribute to a deeper level of integration.</p><h4>How has Tupar Talgo created a micro-economy around the factory?</h4><p>When Tulpar Talgo reaches its design capacity for production, approximately 380-400 employees will be working in the factory. Tulpar Talgo participates actively in the national passenger railway industry, encouraging the development of related industries and the manufacturing of components, such as stainless steel cables and wires, glass, electrical equipment, aluminum, air conditioning, audio-video systems, and lighting. We are also prepared to sign contracts for the purchase of electric cables, glass, polymers, and resins.</p><h4>In which countries do you see the most import capacity?</h4><p>Our neighbors are the source of greatest potential, as well as Iran, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Representatives of these countries joined opening ceremony of our factory and have expressed an interest in our project. There is a great potential in the CIS area for new supply projects and some neighboring countries have shown great interest in Talgo trains but no concrete projects have been defined yet. Our main objective now is to execute the current orders for KTZ.</p><h4>How have you adapted the technology Talgo of Spain to Kazakhstan conditions?</h4><p>Experience has shown that for the first nine years of work in Kazakhstan, the Talgo passenger trains have proven to be reliable, safe, and comfortable. One of the problematic issues was the adaptation of the trains to the extreme weather conditions in this country. However, the solution was found, and our Spanish partner understands all aspects of the project and aims to ensure the safety and maximum comfort levels for passengers, as well as the technical knowledge necessary for local production.</p><h4>How did Temir Zholy and Talgo merge?</h4><p>In Kazakhstan there are many example of foreign transportation companies going into joint ventures in the manufacturing and railway areas, such as General Electric and Alstom. These large factories are manufacturing for the various types needs of Kazakhstan Temir Zholy. This idea was born a long time ago and the first discussions started in 2006. In 2009 joint works began between the Spanish and Kazakhstani sides. It was decided on in 2010 and a factory was built. The construction was finished in one year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Damas' relationship with the Dubai gold industry evolved?<br></h4><p>Damas is a 105-year old company that started in Damascus. The story of Damas goes well with the story of Dubai. Damas began to grow exponentially in the 1970s, opening up wholesale and positioning an international brand. We have expanded into international jewelry, diamond jewelry, and other precious stones, but we are still gold jewelers. We process around 10 to 11 tons of gold every year. At any given time, we have around 6,500 kilograms of gold at our branches, which demonstrates how important gold is to Damas. We have grown from being a UAE-based company focused mostly on Dubai to a multinational player. Over the last few years, and as a result of the global recession, we have focused on our global footprint. We are now focusing on the GCC market, which is considered to be our core market—we officially have businesses with about 12 markets in the region. Looking at the retail side, we have four different formats, and this is our main advantage. We have diversified across different levels. Considering the UAE business, we are in almost every product category—we offer 18-karat, 21-karat, and 22-karat gold in addition to diamond jewelry and watches. We have just announced a joint venture with a different company to propagate the five or six branches Tiffany has in the UAE. Considering this second segment of our diversification, we are present in many markets.</p><h4>How did the IPO change the company's direction? Do you foresee more local companies opting to float their shares?</h4><p>Becoming a public company created huge pressure—as you know, listed companies are usually under the spotlight. I believe that the challenge was to transform from a family-run business to a listed company, especially in building policies and procedures that reflect corporate governance. The IPO did consume a huge amount of energy from the company, but we gained a testimony on behalf of the business model of Damas. The capital markets believed in Damas to the extent that people were paying money to buy our shares. Within the context of family businesses, every company needs to be evaluated separately. Floating a business obviously has its own advantages, including access to capital markets and raising money. At the same time, there are certain challenges, such as transitioning from being a family-based culture to one where individuals make decisions about structures and system policies and procedures, ensuring corporate governance and dealing with related parties. The ability to transform this culture is a key factor in terms of deciding whether to go for an IPO or not.</p><h4>How has the company's strategy adapted to deal with fluctuating gold prices?</h4><p>The greatest impact on us was the weakening in demand from certain segments, especially in the lower end of the market. Gold became out of reach for certain groups. In the past, we used to see lower-income consumers buying gold; this has stopped in the last two or three years. There was an immediate demand from our clientele for lighter jewelry, and this is why the last couple of launches we have done introduced the new technology of laser cutting, which allows us to produce a piece weighing 3 grams. We gained the ability to produce a full three-piece set of 18-karat gold jewelry that weighs only 6 or 7 grams. There was a lot of pressure to produce lighter jewelry that still looked nice. In terms of consumer segments, we have seen a small percentage of the consumer base focused on investments in the belief that gold prices will continue to rise. This has resulted in more demand for the 22-karat segment, where there are better investment formulas. We see an increasing demand for small bars and gold coins.</p><h4>What plans are in the pipeline for 2012?</h4><p>The takeover process is complete and many of the issues we were dealing with have been solved. Now there is a lot more focus on the business, and our attention is on the management and organization of the company. We have very ambitious plans for the coming three years. Our ability to introduce new designs and reinvent certain goals that we have is being improved every day. By August or September 2012, we will begin launching new consumer initiatives, in-house plans, and general goods to satisfy the consumer demand that we are seeing. We are now looking at ways to reinvent our retail presence. We understand that some of our shops have been there for a long time, and we are looking at ways to rebuild our concept and look after the consumer needs and desires. In the coming months, we will start working on the retail format that we currently have now and begin to renovate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dubai has successfully branded itself as a top destination in the region for leisure and business travelers. What are the strengths of the Emirate in the region?<br></h4><p>The most notable service industry in the UAE is its tourism business. The city of Dubai has been transformed from a small desert town into a towering metropolis. Tourism has become so important to this nation that it even accounts for over 30% of Dubai's GDP. The Middle East has in many ways become one of the leaders in luxury hotel industry, and has always shown a strong desire to grow.</p><h4></h4><h4>Where is the Sofitel brand planning to expand in the region and what motivates the choice of the targeted destinations?</h4><p>Sofitel is firmly establishing its hotels in the region, thanks to Sofitel Abu Dhabi and Sofitel Dubai JBR. We are extremely confident in the expansion of our brand in the region. All keys cities in the Middle East are targeted, including in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan.</p><h4>Dubai International Airport receives flights from more than 260 destinations. What trends among business and leisure travelers have you observed recently in terms of their origin?</h4><p>Initial results show that the luxury travel industry follows the same trends as the luxury sector in general, although luxury travel is not commonly categorized within the luxury industry. Not only are luxury travel sectors distinguished by uniqueness, brand imagery, and high price levels—the main guiding principles of the luxury sector—but they are also impacted by the same trends. A clear distinction between ultra-luxury and affordable luxury has been observed, together with the development of personalized services, a move away from ostentation, the increasing importance of web-based media, and progressively more attention to green and ethical social principles. Above all, as with the luxury sector in general, the demand for luxury travel is expected to grow, especially in relation to emerging economies. Dubai has a reputation for being a center of luxury tourism, and competition in this bracket is very high.</p><h4>What strategies has your hotel followed in redefining luxury and establishing strong brand recognition in a competitive market?</h4><p>The perception of luxury is continuously evolving. Now we're seeing a move away from ostentation toward authenticity in the travel experience, and a call for sustainability and environmental conservation as an integral part of the offerings for affluent travelers. On the distribution side, the greater use of online tools will have an effect on the sales process and on communications. A shift toward a more self-sufficient approach in travel planning is therefore expected, plus increased influence from social media in the decision-making process.</p><h4>What has the hospitality sector's experience been like after the offset of the global liquidity crisis?</h4><p>After years of turmoil, the hospitality industry is on the mend. Although operating performance has begun to recover, operators, investors, owners, developers, and managers are approaching their segments with a new air of caution and fresh ideas. A global recovery in hotel operating fundamentals is now a fact. Although many global markets have been slow, demand has returned and boosted occupancy.</p><h4>Dubai is also a hub for MICE tourism. Is this an important revenue generator for you and what further opportunities for development in this respect do you see?</h4><p>Dubai is the regional hub for most of the regional and international corporations. MICE tourism is a crucial segment as it brings additional revenues to our hotels in terms of food and beverages and meetings. It forms approximately 15% of our overall business mix. For ongoing and further development, we participate in most of the international MICE exhibitions to promote our hotels along with the destination. IMEX in Frankfurt, EIBTM in Spain, as well as several MICE forums give us the opportunity to establish contact with worldwide MICE buyers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main strengths of Dubai as a possible location for the World Expo 2020?<br></h4><p>Dubai's commitment to host the World Expo is really about placing Dubai as a location where culture, ideas, and people from all around the world can come together to share and contribute their thoughts and add meaning and value to the environment and world around them. We believe that Dubai has many factors that make it a particularly good candidate, with the first being its geographic positioning. We have a very good position between East and West and have very strong relations with countries in the south. Historically, both in the last 40 years as the UAE and long before, we have always been a kind of hub. This is a place where people from all over have passed through. Secondly, we feel we have some incredible infrastructure, from our airport to roads to ports to the metro; we have everything necessary to facilitate the flow of millions of people who will have to come through. The third important quality that Dubai has is the fact that it is already a mini expo with more than 200 nationalities living here and showcasing their nationalities, art, and culture. To have 200 different nationalities that live and work here is something very special and shows that we are very open to the world. I think our fourth strength is that this is such a strong place for business. Some of the most important companies from around the world are here; 60% or 70% of the Fortune 500 companies have headquarters in Dubai.</p><h4>What is the idea behind the “connecting minds, creating the future" theme?</h4><p>The UAE is a responsible global citizen. We look at the world around us and realize there are challenges out there; we then try to address them. This notion of global citizenship is very important for Dubai and for the UAE in general. We believe that “connecting minds, creating the future" is the right theme as we feel that through doing that we can address global challenges. What we have done is looked at the global challenges in the world today and what they may be in 2020. Some will be energy security, employment generation for the youth, integration, the empowerment of women, climate change, and the efficacy of aid programs. What we see today may be exacerbated by 2020 and we want our theme to address these global challenges and help to provide solutions for them.</p><div class="quote">“Expo 2020 is really a national project that involves the support of all of the Emirates."</div><h4>What motivated the choice of the large plot by the new Al Maktoum Airport as the proposed location for the event?</h4><p>Expo 2020 is really a national project that involves the support of all of the Emirates and, obviously the Prime Minister. We felt that having a site that is located half an hour from Abu Dhabi's airport and 40 minutes from Dubai's airport will allow us to capitalize on the strengths of both cities. It is also connected to the Al Maktoum International Airport through a seamless corridor and to Dubai's ports. We see this connection with the new ports and airports as one large web of connectivity. The 400-hectare site will be best leveraged because it is connected to such important logistics and transportation nodes.</p><h4>How important is Dubai's role in terms of the development of the new Silk Route?</h4><p>Our role as a hub has dated back to the early 19th and 20th century. We have evidence of people who have come through Dubai to East Africa and Europe to Asia and East Asia. This is something that is very integral to us as a fact of history. With Dubai, we have that historical merit, and the city is built upon it. Dubai is also very keen to become more modern and efficient, embracing new technology and new ways of doing things. We see ourselves as very much a part of the new Silk Route. There are more than 200,000 Chinese people who live in the UAE. We have over 4,000 Chinese companies based out of the Emirates. Every single day, you will see travellers here making that East to West journey and now, more and more, we see the South to North connections as well. In my daily interaction with colleagues in Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, I see that movement continuously. It is all happening in Dubai, primarily.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does ArcelorMittal's experience in Temirtau reflect Kazakhstan's economic progress in the past two decades?<br></h4><p>ArcelorMittal moved into Kazakhstan in 1995 when we took over the steel plant in Temirtau and the coal mines in the Karaganda region. We have seen significant progress ever since we came to this market, particularly in terms of industrial development in this region. There are several reasons behind this marked improvement. First of all, this country is blessed with lots of natural resources, particularly minerals, and the government is headed in the right direction to add value to these products and make it economically viable and sustainable in the long term. We have also invested quite a lot in our operations and benefited from the growth in this part of the world. In 1995, we were not a 4 million-ton company as we are today. In all three of our focus operations, which are mining, steel making, and transforming steel into value-added end products, we are making significant contributions to the country's progress.</p><h4>ArcelorMittal experienced increased steel production in 2011. To what extent is this due to post-crisis recovery, and to what extent do you see new demand?</h4><p>This increase is partially due to new demand in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan was one of the countries that anticipated the 2008 crisis. In 2007, we experienced financial issues and this government took some well-calculated measures. Due to these prudent policies, it was one of the first countries to emerge from the crisis. We still feel the positive impact of those decisions, which translate into a relatively stronger economic performance compared to other countries in the region. We are expecting GDP growth of around 7%, which is a high number. Therefore, fundamentally, growth has come to some extent from Kazakhstan. However, the per capita consumption rate for steel is low in this country, and thus a certain level of growth must also have come from the CIS region.</p><h4>How do you to strike a balance between the installation of new production lines and the modernization of existing infrastructure?</h4><p>We need new installations for growth, as customer requirements change. Additionally, we invest to improve efficiency and reduce costs. With respect to new offerings, we are launching long products. This mill has traditionally produced flat products. However, our investments are not limited to quantifiable indicators such as production volumes and efficiency. First and foremost, we have invested in health and safety, which is the prime focus for the company. As far as improvement is concerned, health and safety is one angle. The second is the augmentation of production. The third level is improving the existing product portfolio. As far as improving the quality is concerned, we have also invested in high value-added product lines and services. Lastly, distribution is an area in which we are investing. One other area that requires attention is ArcelorMittal's prioritized efforts to comply with Kazakhstan's environmental laws. In 2011, we completed the reconstruction of blast furnace 2 with state-of-the-art de-dusting and gas-cleaning equipment, installed electric dust filters at blast furnace 4, and launched a closed-circuit cooling system for coke gas. In 2012 we are working on the reconstruction of the gas cleaning system at the converter's shop, which will eliminate a large portion of the plant's air emissions. Our coal mines are also improving their environmental performance. For example, in early 2012 we launched a 1.4 MW power generator that uses coal bed methane as fuel. Methane is also used as fuel for boilers to produce heat during the winter season.</p><h4>How does ArcelorMittal support Kazakhstan's target to establish an export-oriented industry focusing on end products with high value-added?</h4><p>The country will need to support value-added exports as the population is limited and development of the industrial base will have to rely on exports. This is very much in line with ArcelorMittal's strategy in Kazakhstan. Our exports from steel plants are this country's natural riches—coal and iron ore—and are converted into various kinds of flat and long steel products. Everything we do is value addition and our focus has always been to climb up the value chain. In addition to steel making, ArcelorMittal has invested in the manufacturing facility in Aktau, which produces large-diameter pipes for oil/gas, water, construction, and mining applications. We are also supporting the government in the development of transport infrastructure. Kazakhstan has experienced a shortage of railcars for the movement of goods within the country and beyond. We are now involved in a project to build wagons. This initiative will enable us to execute our core business and it will benefit Kazakhstan's economy at large.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Shatel Group looking to shape its customer strategy?</h4><p>Customer satisfaction is one of the leading priorities of this organization. Shatel is a service-based company targeting customers that are comparatively more familiar with modern technologies. These customers know how to evaluate a service provider and are willing to spend money to choose the right vendor. Therefore, we have to do our best to focus on our abilities to provide customers with services. We use many strategies to achieve this, including using fully integrated professional ICT systems to interact with clients, such as a customer portal, call center, request tracking, online chat, and intelligent troubleshooting. We also promote flexibility and honesty among our staff and operate with transparency toward our clients. We are constantly innovating after-sales services, and operate a complaint management system as well as offer motivational targets in order to make sure our staff members are as helpful as possible. We emphasize the importance of customer satisfaction at Shatel, and have established an education center running 80-hour courses over the course of a year in order to train the Shatel team. We are an EFQM-awarded company, and are proud of our organizational excellence and the fact that we are able to maintain and increase our market share.</p><h4>How can you overcome the challenges in the internet sector?</h4><p>We are facing many challenges in this market as we have to procure the required facilities and infrastructure from local telecommunications companies that have recently been granted the same license as we have now for high-speed internet services. In fact, we have to compete with companies that have exclusive access to telecommunications infrastructure that also match our own needs, such as space, power, and transmission bandwidth in local exchange points in cities. Considering the paradox that on average we are paying approximately 35% to 40% of our revenue to our rivals, you can imagine how difficult it is to convince these telecommunications companies to allow us access to the required facilities. However, we have at least 100,000 prospective subscribers in the queue waiting for our ADSL services. In spite of this unequal competition with telecommunications companies that are owned by the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI), we are applying a differentiation strategy as well as a customer-relations strategy to succeed in the market. We are more agile and flexible in offering new services to customers. We have stocked enough network and access devices and offered various and more efficient products and services to the market. To give another example, we have 160 customer support engineers in Tehran and 400 engineers in other provinces who are supporting our subscribers around the clock. These are some of the approaches that we have selected to differentiate our services from other market players. Moreover, partnership with telecommunications companies is one of the options that we're focusing on, and we have had a very good experience in Mazandaran province. The result of this partnership was very fruitful for the people, Shatel, and also the local telecommunications company. For the time being, Shatel has a market share of more than 50%.</p><div class="quote">“Shatel is a service-based company targeting customers that are comparatively more familiar with modern technologies."</div><h4>How does Shatel look to provide high-quality services in such a tough market?</h4><p>For high-quality services in the internet market, you need to have high-quality technology, devices, human resources, and effective policies for service management. As the market leader, using state-of-the-art technologies and choosing the best vendors have always been two of Shatel's main principles. We have hunted for the best personnel and also trained employees ourselves. We even have close relationships with well-known Iranian universities to run exclusive customized courses for Shatel's supervisors and managers. In terms of service management, we are fully aware of global benchmarks. For the time being, different departments such as market R&amp;D, technical R&amp;D, quality management, and product marketing are responsible for helping the service management in our company. Moreover, we have different committees to enhance service quality as much as possible.</p><h4>What services does Shatel offer to corporate clients?</h4><p>Around 30% of our high-speed internet service customers are corporates. We provide them with different high-speed internet services over DSL, leased lines, or point-to-point wireless technologies. In addition, there are 500 enterprises using our dedicated internet services. As a VoIP carrier company, we also supply international origination and termination telephone call services.  We are a partner of Kaspersky Lab in Iran, and its bundled security services are another value-added service we provide to both our corporate clients and home users.</p><h4>Which areas of the local ICT sector do you feel are in need of investment?</h4><p>The number of high-speed internet users in Iran is less than 2 million among a population of over 70 million. However, we think that potential in the market is as much as 8 million to 9 million. This means that there is room for substantial investment and growth.</p><h4>How do you assess the digital divide here in Iran, and what strategies are you implementing in order to integrate more users?</h4><p>There is a huge gap between urban and rural areas in terms of access to the internet. Even the small- and medium-sized cities have this problem. The highest portions of high-speed internet users are concentrated in few major cities such as Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Qom, Tabriz, and Shiraz. The main problem is lack of core infrastructure in small cities and villages. We are willing to launch our services in these areas, but there are two challenges: a lack of infrastructure and the high expenditure needed for bandwidth transmission. The strategy that we found useful and effective was by forming a partnership with a local telecommunications company. We started a partnership with the Telecommunication Company of Mazandaran that bore fruitful results for all stakeholders. At the moment, the internet penetration rate in this region is the highest in Iran. It is the only province that people in all areas have access to the internet.</p><h4>What is your strategy for 2013?</h4><p>Our generic strategy is growth, and we shall continue our aggressive marketing strategies. The main factors forming this strategy are launching new value-added services, offering the best quality after-sales services, and investing in human resources.</p><p>© The Business Year - September 2012</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Kazakhstan unique in establishing a favorable tax climate vis-í -vis the other emerging economies in the CIS region?</h4><p>Tax rates in Kazakhstan are among the lowest in the world. What differentiates Kazakhstan's tax system from that of its neighboring countries is a generally low tax burden on the economy, which is achieved through low rates that form the state budget. Along with this, our tax system also includes a number of preferences aimed at creating a favorable investment climate. The corporate income rate has been reduced to 20%, and the term for the transfer of losses from business activities has been increased to 10 years. Payments for individuals, entrepreneurs, and small businesses have been reduced. Furthermore, the VAT rate is 12%—one of the lowest among the world's standard tax rates. The code provides taxpayers with the possibility for investment tax preferences, which allows full deductions while calculating corporate income tax. In addition, the tax law provides special treatment for organizations operating in economic zones, which exempts them from paying corporate income tax, property tax, and land tax payments under certain conditions, as well as the application of a zero VAT rate on sales turnover in the zone. For taxpayers operating in the ICT sector, an additional exemption from social security tax is applied. Also exempt from taxation are dividends and capital gains for the relatively long-term ownership of stocks and shares, as well as the sources of income separate from subsoil use in Kazakhstan. In the World Bank's Doing Business 2012 report, Kazakhstan ranked 13th in terms of taxation, well ahead of other countries in the CIS region and Eastern Europe. An assessment of the overall tax rate reveals that Kazakhstan boasts one of the lowest tax rates in the world, ranked 40th ahead of countries such as the UK, Norway, Russia, Germany, and the US.</p><h4>How would you describe the main anchors of the new banking law and the improvements it will bring to the system?</h4><p>Since 2008, Kazakhstan faced the consequences of the crisis in the global financial system, which required a quick and timely response from the government. Hence, the state supported second-tier banks in order to maintain liquidity and stability, as they are integral elements in the economic system and can ensure the normal functioning and development of the market. The state provided financial support to the banking sector to maintain lending to the real economy and its overall stability. These measures were taken in a timely and effective way. The global crisis provided an opportunity to identify the main causes of the instability of financial institutions vis-í -vis economic shocks. Lack of information transparency, low capitalization, a high concentration of business operations with high risk, poor corporate governance, and a weak degree of responsibility by the supervisory authorities are among the main causes of the instability. Therefore, in December 2011 we adopted a new law to minimize risks. The amendments are aimed at leveling the shortcomings and increasing the transparency of financial institutions. To strengthen the consolidated supervision of banking conglomerates by minimizing the risks of financial institutions from transactions with related parties, major changes were made. The important rules were the introduction of transparency schemes and the improvement of the quality of financial institutions. The crisis also led to the introduction of early response indicators for actors in the financial sector. At the same time, the responsibility of these actors increased, including improving corporate governance that ensures the accurate disclosure of financial accountability.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of the Eurasian Economic Community Anti-Crisis Fund? What is the scope of Kazakshtan's involvement in the process?</h4><p>The 2008 global economic crisis significantly affected the Eurasian economies and the conditions of their development. Much of our efforts are devoted to basic anti-crisis policies. In order to overcome the negative effects of the crisis on national economies, ensure economic and financial stability, and promote the further deepening of economic integration, the Eurasian Economic Community developed an anti-crisis fund. Since its inception, the fund has provided financial support to Tajikistan and Belarus. In terms of the scope of Kazakhstan's involvement in the fund, the country is the second largest shareholder, with an initial contribution of $1 billion­— second after Russia. In turn, we believe that the fund should be used for investment projects aimed at deepening the integration process and to ensure sustainable economic development.</p><h4>How will the creation of a development bank affiliated with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) contribute to economic progress in the region?</h4><p>Based on the current global economic risks, it is advisable to create a financial institution that will promote the efficient use of resources that can expand economic and trade relations as well as industrial and investment cooperation with the SCO. Regional cooperation through the establishment of international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are integral in achieving specific goals to maintain and develop the economies of the member states. The experience of international development institutions shows that such financial institutions play a specific role in times of financial crisis, using their privileges, immunities, and resistance to high risks to continue and even increase investments in priority sectors. During the SCO meeting of the Council of Heads of Government on November 7, 2011 in St. Petersburg, the Chinese side proposed the establishment of the Development Bank of the SCO, a body that will be providing financial services for medium- and long-term investments for public and private clients.</p><h4>What are the highlights in terms of bond issuance in 2011?</h4><p>Domestic government borrowing is set to finance the budget deficit and maintain sufficient government securities, with a vision to establish an appropriate reference point in the stock market. In 2011, the Ministry of Finance issued state valuable papers with maturities of one to 20 years, in the amount of approximately $4.5 billion. Today, despite the absence of sovereign Eurobonds, the domestic corporate sector is actively issuing corporate bonds. According to experts, the global market is now characterized by high volatility, which may adversely affect the value of a possible sukuk issuance. In general, given the lack of need for external borrowing, as well as the current situation, the Ministry of Finance has no plans to issue Eurobonds or sovereign sukuks in 2012. However, in the medium term, the Ministry considers these issuances as a possibility.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Preparations for Kazakhstan's self-styled People's IPO program are now well underway. The program received its approval in parliament in Astana back in August 2011, and the first candidates designated for listing in 2012 are busy preparing themselves for the challenges of being public and listed corporations.</p><p>The framework and structure of the People's IPO was devised in Kazakhstan and is supported by President Nazarbayev. The value proposition of the program is the establishment of a wealth conduit for the people of Kazakhstan to have the opportunity to share in the growth of the country's leading companies and assets. The first candidates for the IPO program are the electricity grid company KEGOC, the oil pipeline company KazTransOil, and the country's flagship airline, Air Astana. These are companies that are intrinsically linked to the growth of the economy. Other leading companies within Samruk-Kazyna's portfolio are scheduled for subsequent offerings between 2013 and 2015.</p><p>The People's IPO, in this phase, is entirely domestic in its focus, putting Kazakhstanis first while international participation is expected to come at a later stage. A welcome aspect of the program would be for the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) to become an investment destination not only for Kazakhstanis, but also, in the future, for international investors looking for Kazakhstani or regional exposure. We see this dynamic in other emerging markets around the world, and we are keen to see it take off in Kazakhstan, with all the associated positive effects.</p><p>The People's IPO should not be compared to the privatizations of the past. Kazakhstan is approaching this program from a position of economic strength and not from a need to attract capital to plug a hole. It's a structural initiative of the government, aimed at developing the domestic capital markets, to encourage an internal investment culture, and thus provide an avenue of wealth creation. In the long term, it is intended to encourage and ultimately diversify economic activity, which will benefit all Kazakhstanis.</p><p>Given the objective to make this a true People's IPO, and thus engage individual Kazakhstanis as investor partners, accessibility and affordability are key performance metrics. We envisage pension funds playing an important role in reaching a substantial part of the population. The pension funds already reach more than 8 million people, or about 50% of the population, and a substantial part of the population has savings in the pension funds. In addition to the distribution strength of the pension funds, such a system removes disposable income barriers because it utilizes cash that is already committed, making affordability a non-issue. We do envision the development of independent brokerage accounts as well.</p><p>One very important aspect of the People's IPO will be successfully addressing the knowledge base of the general public about their broader savings and investing in shares. Although steps are being taken to mitigate certain risks and improve the investment profile of companies participating in the program, it is very important that people understand what it means to invest and the risks and returns that an investment can generate.</p><p>The People's IPO process is well advanced and a lot of preparatory work has already been completed in areas related to legal, accounting, and compliance. The selected companies have undergone and will undergo a comprehensive due diligence process that would be applied anywhere else in the world. Samruk-Kazyna, together with the government, has assembled a team of competent advisors, independent and otherwise, to ensure that the program is both successful and adheres to best market practices.</p><p>There is some skepticism from the public and from the opposition toward the program, but let's remember that at the time of the financial crisis in 2009 when the government began the restructuring of certain domestic banks, it faced the same skepticism. Some people said they did not believe the government, and that the banks would go bankrupt soon. But the banks met the challenge, and the burden-sharing framework, devised internally with independent advisors working alongside the government, has become a model considered globally. Other countries are now considering Kazakhstan's approach. Like the restructuring of the banking system, the concept of the People's IPO was similarly designed in Kazakhstan. It is a truly Kazakhstani project.</p><p>I am confident that the intention of the government is to make this program accessible, equitable, and ultimately successful. It promises to be an exciting stimulus to Kazakhstan's business and investment culture, and to further establish the country as an important hub for the capital markets across Central Asia. This is an opportunity that the people of Kazakhstan should grasp.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nurbank has recently seen a series of structural changes. What have been the highlights from this process?</h4><p>Our shareholder structure has changed, and so has our management. When the new management came in, we analyzed everything and performed many structural modifications within the bank. The changes were also applied to the corporate, SME, risk, and retail business departments. Moreover, we worked heavily on the optimization of the members' structure of our financial group. In 2011, the most important event was the successful completion of a $150 million Eurobond tranche in October. There were five-year bonds issued in 2006, and they were listed on both the Luxembourg and Kazakhstan stock exchanges. It was not an easy period; however, Nurbank demonstrated itself as a reliable partner so that every investor could believe in its future. This bond repayment sent a good message to our potential investors. We expect that if we decide to issue new financial instruments in the future, interest in Nurbank will grow. We received a $650 million capital injection that we have allocated to create provisions. In fact, we now rank eighth among Kazakhstani banks in terms of provisions. We have taken a more conservative approach to risk management and the evaluation of the assets and financial position of our borrowers. I am confident that another difficult period in banking history was successfully passed. However, we still have some post-crisis difficulties to deal with; we have aggressive plans for the coming year.</p><h4>How has the bank worked to expand its SME coverage and open new credit lines?</h4><p>The bank shareholders and management have approved a new development strategy. The main priority was given to the enhancement of the SME and retail business in the common pool of banking services. Our main goal is to bring down our corporate business share, which historically was at 70%, and our medium-term target is to decrease it to 50%. If we talk about SME credits, for example, that segment seems more attractive in terms of growth potential. Moreover, the SME sector risks are more diversified. It is worth underlining that this not an easy task. If you look at the official statistics, the corporate business sector is comparatively developing in a more rapid way. This does not translate to closing doors for SMEs, but to the fact that the corporate sector is performing relatively better, hence its heightened share of GDP. The government undertakes variable measures to support the SME sector, but the share of corporate activity in the economy is still very high. Tourism, entertainment, food services, and retail are nevertheless good areas for SME investors. From our standpoint, the SME market is tough and represents many challenges. Competition between commercial banks for the SME segment is continuing, especially between Russian banks, which are aggressive in our market. In this situation, the banks have to decrease their interest rates. Moreover, it applies to the three main segments of credit. On the other hand, Kazakhstani banks do not decrease their interest rates infinitely. Reasons for this include that the internal deposit funding base is still expensive, there is a low level of liquidity on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange, there are many toxic assets in second-tier banks' portfolios, and funding from the Western capital markets is still limited and comparatively expensive for Kazakhstani banks. Taking into consideration these factors, we continue working to provide excellent service and additional products to our customers so as to build up long-term business relations.</p><h4>What competitive advantages do you have over your rivals?</h4><p>There are 38 banks in Kazakhstan, and for a population of 16 million, this is a large number. Among these banks, our competitive advantage is that we have a transparent financial group structure, shareholders, and management structures. We are represented as a universal bank that provides a wide spectrum of financial services and covers the entire territory of Kazakhstan through 16 branches and 54 outlets. We are planning to open new outlets in 2012. Moreover, we have widened our range of banking products. New proposals covering all business directions of our bank include unsecured and mortgage loans, account services, overdrafts, working capital injections, project finance, collateral realization, bank guarantees, and letters of credit.</p><h4>The IMF has noted that “the ongoing vulnerabilities in Kazakhstan's banking system are a cause for concern." How do you assess this statement?</h4><p>Like any other banking system in the CIS, we have both advantages and disadvantages. We have a strong two-level banking system in terms of infrastructure, legislation, and human resources, as well as in many other aspects. The main challenge is still toxic assets in Kazakhstani banking portfolios. We cannot consider banking separately from other sectors of the economy; the banking sector always indicates the overall situation. The dependence of several dominant industries of the Kazakhstani economy on world prices for natural resources such as oil, gas, metals, and wheat affects the financial position of our clients and bank revenue inflows. The government undertakes definitive measures aimed at reducing this dependence, but the influence of world prices is still substantial. For banks' credit portfolios, it is necessary to point out that the government regulators are working constantly to settle this problem through reserving special funds to buy these assets from and clean up their balance sheets. It leads to a series of negotiations. In accordance with the law on risk minimization, signed by the President at the end of 2011, a legal entity specializing in improving credit portfolio quality will be created at the National Bank.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2012?</h4><p>We have huge expectations for 2012. We made some structural decisions and a number of significant changes through business process optimization and the widening of services in 2012. We are planning to obtain the results by the end of the year. There are several fears regarding the situation in the capital markets of the eurozone and the US, but our bank is going to focus on the internal market in terms of sales and funding. We expect moderate GDP growth of around 5%-6% in 2012. This is the forecast, and time will tell.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes have you noticed since the introduction of the Customs Union with Russia and Belarus?<br></h4><p>On the corporate side, it is much more challenging to openly compete with large Russian companies. When Kazakhstan is not producing enough consumer goods, it is difficult to be competitive. Our entrance to the market was asymmetrical owing to the presence of larger economies and broader consumer markets. However, we are looking at the Russian market as a strategic segment. We will definitely invest and develop our presence, trying to find a niche for Kazakhstani companies in Russia. It is a difficult and lengthy process to obtain a license for brokerage and securities sales in Russia; it takes three months to process the documents, and if there is a mistake, we have to start over. In Kazakhstan, the process is much more transparent.</p><h4>How do you assess the IMF's report into the weaknesses of the local banking system?</h4><p>The report was absolutely correct. The first weakness is BTA Bank and the state banks. How these banks develop will influence the overall banking sector. Commercial banks have weaknesses in terms of non-performing loans (NPLs). The NPL ratio of the country is around 30%, which is very high. This influences the overall growth of the loan portfolio and the quality of our borrowers. Many of these debts are from our medium-sized companies, and we were waiting to write off the NPLs because the regulations forced banks to pay taxes on any losses. In order to protect the bank from the tax, we keep the debts on our balance sheets. Fortunately, a law was passed at the end of 2011 that allows us to write off the loans without penalty. In 2012, I expect many banks to begin cleaning up their balance sheets. There was also the creation of a distressed asset fund under the National Bank. The new legislation allows banks to create special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) for dissolving NPLs. It will be consolidated and included in the final report, and we are looking forward to opportunities for the NPLs at our bank and throughout the country.</p><h4>What are your expectations from the new banking law?</h4><p>The law approved at the end of December 2011 as well as over 70 regulations have yet to be finalized. Some articles are still open ended, and it will depend on how the National Bank decides to adopt the regulations. Working as a banking conglomerate requires more capital, regulations, and responsibility. There is more fiduciary responsibility as well. Although we have not yet operated under the legislation, we trust it is a positive—albeit strict—change.</p><h4>What are some highlights from Halyk Bank's steps in terms of optimization and innovation?</h4><p>The year 2011 was the year of optimization for Halyk Bank. Every year, we have a slogan or a main target for the year, like “be professional" or “be financially strong." In 2011, we optimized the business processes. We became the best bank in Kazakhstan, and we grew by more than 40%. The bank has grown by 50% over last three years. Our client base has been expanding, but our number of staff has been reduced by 700 people. That means that the aim to increase business and decrease manpower by becoming more productive and efficient has worked.</p><p>We have had to optimize our business procedures through technology; we have the largest ATM network in the country with more the 1,700 ATMs. In 2011, we began to purchase and establish payment terminals and internet, retail, and mobile banking. We were the first bank in the country to introduce mobile banking. These technological developments combined with less bureaucratic steps and documentation, without increasing risks, are very important in the industry. We went through many business processes step by step, looked at each stage, and studied where we could optimize them.</p><h4>In which areas do you see opportunities for Kazakhstan to create an investment culture?</h4><p>In terms of private equity, SMEs have a lot of power. We have a number of distressed assets, and banks always aim to clean up their balance sheets, generally by selling certain assets. There will probably be opportunities for private equity investors to buy assets such as business offices and factories at a discounted price. The agricultural sector is very interesting today because resources are limited and the population is increasing. Commodity prices are maintaining high levels, so I think the agricultural sector will play a key role in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the banking sector's loan portfolio, deposit base, and asset growth in 2011?</h4><p>In 2011, the banking sector showed a positive trend of development. Issued credit grew by 15.7%, the deposit base by 14.3%, and assets by 6.5%. Despite these figures, the problem of loan portfolio quality persists. Credits to the economy could have grown at a higher rate, but the large share of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector—around 30%—mitigated such growth. In order to solve this problem, a set of measures were adopted by the government and National Bank that were intended to remediate the balance sheets of the banks. On the one hand, amendments were made to the tax legislation that proposed deductions of income on the recovery of provisions from taxable income when writing off bad loans. On the other hand, a concept for the improvement of bank asset quality was developed, which suggests the use of a centralized and decentralized approach in the process of remediation for bank balance sheets. As part of its implementation, the National Bank established a special purpose vehicle (SPV), the Problem Loans Fund, which will be buying up troubled bank assets and taking action to restore their quality. The concept also suggests that SPVs would be established with a view to buy out bad-quality assets and take actions to restore their value by the banks themselves, which is a decentralized approach. In connection with the implementation of these measures, in 2012 we can expect that the quality of the credit portfolio for the majority of large- and medium-sized banks will improve.</p><h4>In 2011 the financial system underwent structural changes that increased the regulatory weight of the National Bank. How do you assess the impacts of the decision so far?</h4><p>In accordance with the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 61 dated April 18, 2011, the functions of the Agency for the Regional Financial Center of Almaty (RFCA) and the Agency for Regulation and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations (AFN) were consolidated under the National Bank. This concentration of control of the financial system in the hands of the National Bank is consistent with international practice. A similar practice is observed in the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore, and Bahrain. The task of Almaty becoming a regional financial center does not entail only the development of the stock market and the provision of services by brokerage firms, as it was until today. Our task is more global; to develop the infrastructure of the entire city. While achieving this task, it is important to coordinate all government agencies, primarily the Almaty Municipality. And of course, the role and status of the National Bank, whose structure now also includes the Development Committee of the RFCA, is much higher than it was at the now-defunct agency. The target indicated by the President is to become one of the top-10 financial centers in Asia by 2020. The committee fully inherited the tasks, functions, and powers of the abolished agency. However, with the transfer of structures to the National Bank, more opportunities have appeared to help realize the set tasks. The reorganization stage is complete and the committee is working on a new concept of development at the RFCA, taking into account the changed conditions and new opportunities. To date, we have identified three main activities for the committee: the provision of public services, improving financial literacy, and the development of Islamic finance.</p><h4>The IMF has noted that “the ongoing vulnerabilities in Kazakhstan's banking system are a cause for concern." How do you evaluate the IMF's statement?</h4><p>The IMF's concern is related to major problems in Kazakhstan's banking system, including a low-quality credit portfolio and the low credit activity of the banks. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that 2011 marked the start of a positive trend of development in the banking sector. After three years of stagnation the banks began to show growth in credit activity. Moreover, the 14.3% growth in the deposit base indicates the maintenance of trust in the banking system. In regard to systemically important financial institutions and the whole banking sector, the National Bank plans to introduce Basel III requirements starting from 2013, despite the fact that the capital requirements are higher than those used in the Customs Union, the EU, and the US. This step will allow for a strengthening of the resilience of bank capital, and will contribute to financial stability in the banking sector.</p><h4>How is monetary policy shaping up to support the country's development goals?</h4><p>The National Bank will support the country's macroeconomic development plans within its competence, such as from the standpoint of ensuring the money supply growth rate and encouraging adequate economic development. In this case, given that the priority for the National Bank is price stability, the conduct of monetary policy is carried out so that the monetary component is at an optimum level and does not provide additional inflationary pressures. In the medium term, the President has set an important task—to achieve 7% growth in the economy. Already, state agencies have developed the necessary measures to achieve this target. Furthermore, it should be noted that during the design and implementation of economic policy, the government and the National Bank will take into account all the risks that could adversely affect the macro-economic development of Kazakhstan. The present government and the National Bank are working to develop a set of policy measures aimed at ensuring social stability, the stability of the financial sector, the provision of low inflation, and the stability of the tenge.</p><h4>What implications does the state strategy for the National Oil Fund's utilization have for local and foreign investors?</h4><p>The President instructed that the means of the National Oil Fund should be invested in the internal development of the country and the diversification of the domestic economy. There is much work to be done, including identifying which industries require large investments. A way needs to be found to transition from strategic planning to specific projects, with verified feasibility studies supported by full cost calculations. Prior to this, it was impossible to talk about the exact amount of investment from the National Oil Fund for this purpose. At the same time, I would like to clarify that in accordance with the current concept formation and use of the National Oil Fund's means, the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 962 dated April 2, 2010 established a minimum balance of 20% of the forecasted value of GDP at the end of the financial year. The National Bank supports the focus of the National Oil Fund. Economic diversification and the development of non-oil sectors are of strategic importance to Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the performance and development highlights of the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE)?<br></h4><p>We are a part of the global market, and any international trends immediately affect our local market. Unfortunately, in 2011 the KASE index dropped by 35.7%, but during the same time period, volumes remained equal to those in 2010. The largest sectors of our market—forex and repo—showed similar trading volumes, although volumes in repo for corporate securities dropped by 2.5 times. At the same time, trading in corporate bonds increased by approximately 8.7%. In 2011 we launched trading in futures, and the trading volume on this market reached $20 million. In 2011, the National Bank became the sole regulator for the financial market, including the stock market, banking, and pension funds sectors. The National Bank used to be the financial market regulator until 2004, but a separate agency for the supervision of the financial markets and organizations was created as a regulatory body. Currently, the agency is merged with the National Bank and has committee status. In 2012, KASE has a number of important tasks to accomplish, the first being the introduction of necessary changes to its internal regulations in accordance with amendments made to laws on joint-stock companies and the financial market concerning risk minimization. The amendments came into force on February 1, 2012. In compliance with the new law, KASE established the Clearing Department to undertake clearing on all markets.</p><h4>What strategies and incentives will the KASE implement to increase market activity?</h4><p>Our main objective is to increase liquidity in the stock market, and it requires a number of actions to stimulate investors and issuers. A number of attractive instruments will be offered to the public with the commencement of the People's IPO program. To successfully carry out the program, KASE is working to improve its internal operations, regulations, and infrastructure. We encourage close interaction between our members and continuously work on stimulating their activity on the market. For example, we're about to commence a new program aimed at motivating market makers who maintain narrow spreads by providing sizeable rewards. In order to provide investors with more convenient means of trading on the KASE, we are working to introduce direct market access. We believe that this tool would attract more retail investors to trade on the KASE and will make it much easier for them to get involved in the upcoming IPOs.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the readiness of the public for the People's IPO?</h4><p>It is planned that the first company to undertake an IPO will be KazTransOil, which is involved in the transportation of crude oil, refining, and oil and gas pipelines. The shares are expected to go public in fall of 2012. As this program is a government initiative, we believe that the maximum effort will be applied to create awareness and increase financial literacy among the population through a variety of media. The KASE's contribution to educate the public about investment opportunities is carried out through our continuous work with local universities. Our staff conduct workshops for students using an in-house development training trading system. This system allows any individual to learn the necessary skills for trading on the exchange. In this way, we're building a new generation that is financially literate and able to create personal investment strategies.</p><h4>How do you see companies of various sizes emerging and showing interest in the KASE?</h4><p>Generally, we see a good amount of interest from companies of all sizes, but because this is the period after the global crisis, there are different expectations. It is possible that some negative processes will take place on global markets, and for our companies and investors it is not an easy time to predict the activity of the market in the future. However, we feel that large- and medium-sized companies are seeking to come to the KASE and utilize our listing mechanisms for capital raising purposes. In 2011, a number of companies from the oil and gas sector listed their shares on the KASE. Other companies from different sectors of our economy also listed their shares and bonds in order to increase the transparency of their business activity. Although there is a vast amount of public information about companies available in general, the level of transparency increases with each listing. In 2012, we are seeing increased interest in listing on the KASE from different companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the agreement between Kazakhstan and its various contracting companies in the oil and gas sector?<br></h4><p>In December 2011, the Karachaganak partners and the Republic of Kazakhstan reached an agreement that resolved a range of outstanding issues. This was a significant milestone in our relationship. The agreement opens the way for the next phase of Karachaganak's development. We are currently working hard to identify and agree on an optimal development concept that will maximize the future benefits to all parties involved. The agreement also opens the way to the full entry of KazMunaiGas (KMG) into the Karachaganak consortium. We very much look forward to working closely with our new partner.</p><h4>Less than 10% of Karachaganak's immense resources have been produced to date. How would you assess current production levels and future expansion plans?</h4><p>Even before next-phase development has begun, Karachaganak Petroleum Operating (KPO) has already set new liquid production and gas reinjection records so far this year. Short- to mid-term field development consists of a number of projects aimed at maximizing liquid production—notably the drilling of new oil wells and the debottlenecking of facilities. There is enormous potential in Karachaganak. We are still in the early planning stages to determine the concept, scope, and timing of its future development. The major challenge is in handling the gas as the gas-oil ratio changes with falling reservoir pressure. Future expansion will require the proper evaluation of the available options in the phasing of gas sales and gas injection facilities with the overall aim of increasing liquid production. Underlying this will be the drilling of new production and injection wells, as well as intra-field distribution infrastructure.</p><h4>In which direction are you planning to take your strategy as Kazakhstan becomes more advanced in terms of its environmental and safety regulations?</h4><p>Safety is of paramount importance for BG Group. All oil and gas operations carry inherent safety risks. At Karachaganak, this challenge is compounded by extreme temperature fluctuations, the high hydrogen sulfide content in the hydrocarbons we produce and process, and high-pressure sour gas injection. Our key priorities in Kazakhstan include the safe operation of Karachaganak and the wider use of new technologies in gas utilization and marketing. Since 1997, KPO has invested over $214 million in this area. Completed in 2010, the KPO Eco Centre ensures proper recycling, the treatment of drilling fluids, and the safe disposal of drilling waste in an environmentally friendly way. As for emissions, over the last three years total air emissions have decreased by about 20%. On the basis of the Gas Master Plan developed by BG Kazakhstan at the request of President Nazarbayev, we have introduced a natural gas vehicles pilot project in cooperation with KazTransGas and Almaty Akimat. As a result, 200 buses in Almaty now run on compressed natural gas, contributing to a cleaner environment in Kazakhstan's largest city. We are looking at ways to bring this experience to other regions of Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What synergies are you looking to create with the country's local HR and services base to ensure that it caters to the needs of the leading international players like BG?</h4><p>We support the country's local content agenda. It is important to note that, while discussions about “local content" often focus on goods production, services are just as important. Oil services can play an important role in supporting economic modernization. As a joint operator of KPO, we have a strong record of supporting local content. In 2010, KPO signed supply contracts with Kazakhstani companies worth over half a billion dollars. In 2011, the local content of those contracts rose from $86 million in 2010 to $268 million. KPO is driving forward the employment of local citizens on the basis of a nationalization plan agreed with the government. So far, KPO has exceeded every target in advance of the agreed deadlines. Around 94% of KPO employees are now Kazakhstani citizens. KPO is now setting up the Aksai Industrial Park. This will encourage contractors to establish high-quality facilities and services to support technology transfer, the localization of production, and the creation of joint enterprises specializing in maintenance and repair. The foundation stone was laid in June 2011, and the park is currently under development. It will help create joint enterprises that specialize in maintenance and repair under field conditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[just-what-you-need]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Chagala decide to focus on its niche service areas?<br></h4><p>The company started operations in Atyrau in 1995. At that time, there were few options for accommodating the large in-bound work force drawn to the city by projects such as Tengizchevroil and the OKIOC (AGIP KCO/NCOC) project. There were no hotels of international quality standards. Chagala was established to address that need, and we quickly expanded into food services, office space, recreational facilities, and logistics, among others. We have focused our business model on the needs of international and domestic oil companies and the service companies that support them. In doing so, we've also fostered an improved standard of living for the West Kazakhstan community in general—not only by building the skills and providing employment for many Kazakhstanis, but also by bringing higher quality standards to the region. We understand the demands of today's oil companies, such as health and safety expectations, flexibility in service provision, cost effectiveness, and quality. We are always talking with our clients about their future needs.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of Chagala's joint venture with ADM Capital?</h4><p>The joint venture with ADM is an exciting opportunity for Chagala. It allows access to development capital for projects we have already identified and feel strongly about, but would be a challenge funding on our own. The venture allows us to capitalize on these opportunities and to position the company for continued growth. This is an example of how our market reputation and strength has enabled us to employ a variety of financing approaches, unlocking the potential in our development pipeline.</p><h4>How do Chagala's different regional operations compare to each other?</h4><p>All of Chagala's operating assets are in the west—Aktau, Bautino, Atyrau, Uralsk, and Aksai. All are designed and built to service the large oil and gas projects located there—CMOC and the N Block project in Aktau, CMOC and Kashagan in Bautino, Tengizchevroil and Kashagan in Atyrau, and Karachaganak in Uralsk and Aksai. Our long history and future in the region positions us to anticipate and meet the rapidly developing needs in these locations. The bottom line is that none of the cities where we have operations today had a well-developed service sector when we first arrived. In many ways we were the trailblazers. Look at Aktau and Atyrau today—they are both very different places. At first there was a need for basic quality housing, and then better food service options, office space, logistics, and others quickly followed. The nature of market demand continues to evolve. We know the market and have a pipeline of development projects to meet what we foresee the market demanding.</p><h4>What is affecting the investment climate on the services side of the oil and gas industry?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is currently doing what many resource-rich countries are doing; assessing the state's involvement in developing its natural resources. In some cases the authorities are taking steps to bring a more appropriate balance to the relationships. This has not always been an easy process, and in some cases it has caused delays in projects. To a large degree, the project shareholders are reluctant to commit investment dollars to projects until they better understand the investment climate. The knock-on effects for service companies can be easily understood. But again, once that understanding is gained there is no question that projects will push ahead and business levels should improve in concert with that. As for smaller projects, with energy prices likely to remain at current levels for the foreseeable future, more and more smaller companies are looking to expand operations and improve conditions for their staff. Better service in areas such as catering, remote camp management, office space, and access to leisure facilities are all now topics of discussion with companies that could only dream about such issues even five years ago. We see a very bright future for the company in this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Fircroft first begin to explore business opportunities in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Fircroft has been operating in this part of the world for more than 12 years after we first identified the potential of this growing market. We have since been committed to this market and have grown in line with the GDP of the country. Our international presence and experience in 40 countries in addition to our master agreements with major operators worldwide, such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, BG, BP, and Shell, gave us the confidence to be successful in Kazakhstan. We remain committed to developing national expertise in this business and abiding by the local content requirements of the market.</p><h4>What is the basis of your extensive working relationship with Tengizchevroil (TCO)?</h4><p>Fircroft operates through a service agreement with TCO, in accordance with Kazakhstani legislation, providing engineering and technical services since 2006. We have more than 140 engineers—both nationals and expatriates—working on the different projects that TCO has underway.</p><h4>How would you assess the demand for the services segment in Kazakhstan's oil and gas industry?</h4><p>It all depends on the upcoming projects; however, we are quite optimistic that over 2012 there will be a consistent demand for services from various projects in the oil and gas industry as well as the mining sector. The authorities and various ministries make their own forecasts, and we employ our own internal analysis of the world economy. Based on the specific pattern of services we understand will be demanded, we form our potential service profile. It is, of course, an ever-changing landscape.</p><h4>Do you see any differences between the expectations of local clients and multinationals?</h4><p>From my personal perspective, over the last decade, I have seen many tremendous changes in the professional development of the national workforce as it has gained substantial experience working on various projects around the country. As such, there is little difference in the expectations of domestic companies and foreign companies because their use of labor is for the same or similar purposes. That said, the largest clients continue to be multinationals, and we foresee that trend to continue.</p><h4>How would you characterize the government's approach to developing the capacity of local HR?</h4><p>I think the government's approach has been very positive following the recent lifting of legislative restrictions imposed on manpower companies regarding seconding staff to operators and maintaining a ratio of 90% nationals to 10% expatriates. I see this as a good sign from the state that it seeks to support the industry and the economy of the country. We believe that the government needs to increase the presence of vocational training institutes in the oil and services sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2012?</h4><p>Fircroft is quite optimistic for the coming year looking at the trend of business in Kazakhstan for the oil and gas industry and mining sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Recovery & More]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[recovery-more]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan's fast upturn after the 2007—2009 crisis is encouraging. The country has seen a swift pace of economic recovery, which is now more broad based, as high oil prices and the rebound in agricultural output have helped spur domestic demand. Although construction and real estate activity remain weak, strong real GDP growth of 6% is foreseen for 2012, and inflation is projected to pick up only modestly, to 6%-7%, from the current record-low levels. The country also enjoys a solid external position, aided by increasing oil exports. At close to 8% of GDP, the current account surplus is the highest that the country has registered in many years. And combined international reserves and oil fund resources, amounting to more than $86 billion (about 42% of GDP), provide a comfortable buffer for the economy.<br></p><p>The recovery, however, is taking place amid an uncertain external environment. Prospects for global activity are improving only slowly, and growth is expected to stay weak, especially in eurozone countries. While action by policymakers has helped reduce global vulnerabilities, risks to the outlook remain high, particularly from the possibility of renewed financial turbulence in Europe and geopolitical uncertainties affecting the oil market. For Kazakhstan, immediate spillovers from an adverse external scenario are likely to take the form of lower exports, volatility in commodity prices, and fluctuations in capital inflows. The country's close links with international markets and dependence on commodity exports expose its economy to developments in the rest of the world, particularly in its two key trading and financial partners, China and Russia.</p><h4>Oil Wealth</h4><p>Part of Kazakhstan's substantial oil proceeds contribute to financing development needs, while another significant share is prudently saved for the benefit of future generations and to help insulate the economy from swings in inflows generated by global oil price fluctuations. Kazakhstan's stabilization fund—the National Oil Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan—is the cornerstone to managing and preserving the country's oil revenues. The central bank manages the fund, and the government budget is allocated a fixed annual transfer. Thanks to the authorities' discipline in managing oil proceeds and to high oil prices, the fund has increased from about $20 billion in mid-2009 to $51 billion in April 2012.</p><p>Kazakhstan's oil wealth is a great catalyst for growth in the non-extractive sectors of the economy and the development of the country. The link between the oil and non-oil sectors seems to have become stronger in recent years. However, the direct benefits of increased oil activity are only shared by a few related sectors, such as transportation and communications. It is therefore important that the country's plans for economic diversification continue to be implemented to ensure positive spillovers of Kazakhstan's mineral resource wealth to the other key domestic drivers of growth, including manufacturing, construction, real estate, and various other services. Structural reforms, such as improving the business environment, removing barriers to trade, building institutions, and enhancing governance in the banking and corporate sectors will be key in attracting private investment to non-oil activities. Similarly, better integration of the stabilization fund into the budget, with well-defined, medium-term fiscal targets, would allow for a more efficient use of oil revenues to finance investments in health, education, and infrastructure. This strategy should be complemented by continued private-sector investment in the oil industry, sustained by market-friendly conditions.</p><h4>Restoring the Health of the Banking Sector</h4><p>It is also vital that Kazakhstan overcome its banking sector difficulties, which restrain the full recovery of non-oil sector activity. Despite strong economic growth, the banking sector has not fully recovered from the severe shock in 2007. Foreign liabilities have fallen drastically, aggregate liquidity is ample, and the provisioning of overdue loans is still relatively high. Nevertheless, domestic banks' burden of non-performing loans has further increased, and BTA bank has embarked on a second debt restructuring with external creditors after a default earlier this year.</p><p>The authorities have appropriately removed tax impediments to writing off bad loans and adopted policies to discourage foreign currency lending, increase minimum capital requirements, and require better governance and transparency practices. The central bank has also announced the establishment of a centralized problem loan fund, and enabled banks to set up asset management companies to handle bad debts. Nevertheless, additional efforts are needed to fully restore the health of the banking system and to boost its resilience to potential shocks and improve its ability to channel savings toward productive activities.</p><p>A first priority is to enforce existing regulations, such as ensuring realistic loan valuation and proper provisioning in all banks. In addition, actions should be taken to replenish bank capital—with shareholder or public funds—where needed. Contingency plans for such eventualities need to be prepared. These measures would allow Kazakhstan's economy and banking system to be better prepared for a possible further deterioration of the global environment and, in particular, potential spillovers from large neighboring countries. Transmission channels would include lower access to funding and higher borrowing costs (for banks, corporations, and quasi-sovereign entities), and weaker confidence, which would in turn result in additional bank difficulties. Despite the economy's ample financial resources, such a situation would create multiple challenges for policymakers, and could inhibit efforts to encourage private-sector-led growth and economic diversification.</p><h4>Macroeconomic Policies</h4><p>After two years of very strong expansion, the projected return of Kazakhstan's economy to its growth potential calls for continued fiscal adjustment and close control of inflation. The authorities' plans to deal with ongoing uncertainty in the global environment through expansionary policies should therefore be treated as contingent: monetary and fiscal authorities should stand ready to adjust conditions if external shocks affect the domestic economy, while avoiding premature or excessive reaction that could unnecessarily invigorate demand and result in overheating. In addition, social spending should be anchored on improved safety nets to avoid the use of administrative measures to control inflation. Greater exchange rate flexibility would help the economy adjust to external shocks.</p><p>In the medium term, there is considerable scope for a smaller role for the public sector and more dynamism in private sector activity. This would make growth more inclusive, bringing benefits to the population as a whole, and help ensure social cohesion. In this regard, recent improvements in international indicators of the ease of doing business are encouraging, and further gains in governance, transparency, and institution building—in parallel with restoring the soundness of the financial sector—would create new investment, growth, and employment opportunities in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is the collective voice of the Muslim world, looking to safeguard and protect the interests of Muslims in the spirit of promoting international peace and harmony among various peoples of the world. Kazakhstan, as an active and important member state, is playing a key role in supporting the OIC as it achieves its objectives.<br></p><p>The organization has come a long way to make its impact felt not only among the member states, but internationally as well. President Nazarbayev said in his speech at the opening of the 38th Session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers in Astana, “The organization is a unique structure that performs the role of the UN of the Islamic world uniting 57 states on four continents."</p><p>Inspired by the new vision and lofty objectives of the Charter and the 10-Year Program of Action (TYPOA), adopted at the Third Extraordinary Summit in Makkah in 2005, we have managed to elevate the OIC profile, endowing it with greater significance that has engendered respect and trust. The OIC now enjoys greater visibility in the international scene; it has become more involved as an indispensible actor among international institutions. Many circles at a regional and international level have expressed their continued interest in nurturing a sustained dialogue and in opening lines of communication and cooperation with the OIC.</p><p>With its peacefully active policy on the international scene, Kazakhstan was able to maintain its Muslim identity, yet remain on track toward modernization. It has been a member of the OIC for a decade and a half. It has since developed a high level of cooperation with the OIC in areas such as culture, education, science, and technology. The OIC appreciates Kazakhstan's role in promoting inter-civilization and inter-faith dialogue, and recognizes the country's pivotal role in bridging communication between East and West.</p><p>In June 2011, Kazakhstan took the Chairmanship of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM). As the Chairman of the 38th CFM, Kazakhstan has shown its preparedness to lead the Ummah during this difficult time of our history. From day one of its chairmanship, Kazakhstan has focused on continuing its efforts to strengthen multifaceted intra-OIC cooperation and reinforce the OIC's standing as a well-respected organization by mainstreaming and consolidating its international relations. Cooperation between Kazakhstan and the OIC in the past years has indeed proven mutually beneficial.</p><p>Kazakhstan took the chairmanship of the OIC during a period of time when the Muslim world is facing numerous challenges with direct impact on its stability, unity, prosperity, and development. Today, most conflicts and trouble spots in the world are situated in the Muslim world. This sad reality obviously needs to be tackled decisively if our aspirations for progress are to be achieved. It is therefore logical that the OIC, the second largest international grouping after the UN and representing over 1.5 billion people, assumes its rightful place and plays a leading role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The OIC is better equipped to understand the nature and ramifications of conflicts in its member states and evolve appropriate mechanisms that could effectively address them.</p><p>The OIC Charter and the TYPOA, guided by the principles of moderation and modernization, are both based on a perceptive vision that carries in its folds appropriate solutions for the unrest we are witnessing today in the Muslim world. Therefore, there should be stronger commitments from the OIC states to see to the implementation of the TYPOA, particularly in the domain of good governance and the rule of law.</p><p>The TYPOA also underlines the importance of intra-OIC economic development and cooperation. As the disturbances in some states have indicated, one of the major factors behind that is the stagnation in socio-economic development. Kazakhstan, with its successful economic policies and its strategic location at the heart of Central Asia, can be a guiding example for other OIC member states to achieve prosperity and social progress.</p><p>In line with fostering relations between the member states, there are now encouraging signs of growing interest in Central Asia. Central Asia occupies an important geostrategic location in the world. It is situated at the crossroads of cultures and transit routes like the Silk Route and connecting the Islamic world to many parts of the globe. The region is hugely endowed with natural resources in different fields and sectors. The history of Central Asia bears testimony of its immense contributions to the building of a rich culture that was, during its era, second to none. This glorious history flourished upon the advent of Islam in Central Asia. Despite the impediments and hardships faced by Muslims in this region, Islam remained an essential component of the identity and everyday life of the people in Central Asia. Today, the Muslim world takes pride in the magnificent heritage of the great and illustrious scholars, thinkers, historians, scientists, and geographers who were natives of the region and who played prominent roles in advancing Islamic culture and civilization.</p><p>In light of the existing resources, capabilities, and potentials in Central Asia that further explore and integrate the region into the larger Muslim world for the benefit of a strong Ummah, an OIC Plan of Action for Cooperation with Central Asia was adopted at the 38th Session of the CFM in Astana. Through this project, the OIC will boost trade, investment, and the implementation of industrial projects of mutual interest both to Central Asia and the countries of the Muslim community.</p><p>Furthermore, Kazakhstan has made several concrete proposals to boost intra-OIC cooperation. At the Seventh World Islamic Foundation, held in Astana in June 2011, President Nazarbayev offered to create a dialogue platform for the top 10 Muslim economies, which produce 80% of the total GDP of the Muslim states. The President had similarly proposed to develop and adopt a joint action plan within the OIC for investment in energy sector. At the 38th Session of the CFM, President Nazarbayev also proposed creating a secure food supply system within the OIC. This proposal is now under implementation with the suggested OIC Office on Food Security to be headquartered in Kazakhstan. The OIC thus greatly values the inspiring and innovative participation of Kazakhstan in its activities and programs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan will enter into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Eurasian economic integration at the same time. How do these two processes complement each other?<br></h4><p>The Customs Union (CU) is, first and foremost, a favorable environment for attracting mutual investment and establishing joint production, taking into account the available economic potential in each state. As a result, a single market for goods without tariff and non-tariff barriers has been created, and entrepreneurs are free to move their goods among the 170 million people in the CU. To date, the process of forming the CU has been completed, and the legal basis, which includes more than 70 international agreements, has been formed. The Common Economic Space (CES) agreements came into force on January 1, 2012, and the parties have proceeded with closer integration—the building of the CES. Accession to the WTO, as well as the formation of the CU and the CES, is a priority for our country and for our partners. The process of accession to the WTO began in 1996. Integration into the world trading system is inextricably linked with the formation of the CU. From its inception, the legal framework of the CU and the CES has been built according to the principles of the WTO, and its norms concerning the scope of CU regulations will become part of our legal system. Kazakhstan has signed protocols on the completion of bilateral negotiations in terms of market access for goods and services with 29 WTO member states. In general, we are confident that negotiations on Kazakhstan's accession to the WTO are in their final stages. Kazakhstan's participation in the work of the WTO will improve not only the competitiveness of the national economy, but of the emerging economies of the CES as well. Our country's entrance into the organization would mean that Kazakhstan is “ready to play by international trade rules."<br></p><h4>How is Kazakhstan improving its SME base?</h4><p>In order to expand state support for entrepreneurship in the country, the program Business Road Map (BRM) 2020 has been developed and is operating today. The program is a logical continuation of the implementation of our road maps in 2009 and 2010. Meanwhile, the emphasis has shifted to post-crisis development. The measures provided in the BRM 2020 have been used successfully in many countries around the world. One of the other tangible measures that can be taken to improve the business climate in the country is the alleviation of administrative barriers. The Ministry, with the assistance of the World Bank, USAID, and representatives of the business community, have developed plans to adopt a new legislative concept, whereby a single law will determine an exhaustive list of permits with their categorization by degree of risk. The law will also establish uniform requirements for the issuance procedures. Reforming the licensing-permit system will be accompanied by a parallel transfer to an electronic format. At this stage, the government has introduced a draft law to reduce the number of licenses and permits by one-third.</p><h4>Which segments of the economy have benefited from Eurasian economic integration?</h4><p>Kazakhstan's entry into the CU is already yielding results. Each year, the trade turnover of Kazakhstan within the CU grows by more than 40%. In 2010, turnover increased by 40.5%, and in 2011 by 40.8%. Moreover, the share of trade with Russia and Belarus in Kazakhstan's total turnover has increased from 18.5% in 2010 to 19.4% in 2011. In January 2012, mutual trade between Kazakhstan and CU countries amounted to $1.4 billion. Thus, the abolition of customs procedures and other control types (except at the border) promotes bilateral trade between our countries. One of the positive aspects is the fact that Kazakhstan has created a more liberal fiscal policy and investment climate than that of its partners in the CU, and therefore has a better chance to attract foreign capital and create joint ventures. In particular, Russian business is attracted by favorable investment legislation and effective measures designed to support businesses in Kazakhstan. A particularly important aspect is the political and economic stability of the country. For example, individual income tax in Kazakhstan is 10%, and VAT is 12%, while in Russia and Belarus these are higher. The excise tax rate per ton of gasoline in Kazakhstan is KZT5,000, in Russia it is KZT19,000, and in Belarus it is KZT61,000.</p><h4>To what extent will Kazakhstan be affected by a possible second wave of the global financial crisis?</h4><p>At present, Kazakhstan is well prepared for the crisis. To date, the international reserves of the country, including the foreign exchange assets of the National Oil Fund, amount to $80.6 billion. This accumulated financial strength will ensure stable economic development in the future. In the years of previous crises, Kazakhstan gained considerable experience in carrying out anti-crisis measures for the improvement and strengthening of the economy with minimal government interference in market processes.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for the medium term?</h4><p>The economy of Kazakhstan in 2012 will be developing under important global trends. Squeezed external demand requires adequate measures to accelerate our economic growth through internal resources. We estimate that GDP in 2012 will grow by 6% in real terms compared to the previous year. The main factor behind this growth will be internal demand. The forecast for industrial growth is 3.9%. Growth in this sector should be assured by the outpaced growth rate of the manufacturing sector, which should be around 7.1%. The expansion in the sector is caused by an ongoing trend of high growth in production volumes for the machinery, chemical, and metallurgy sectors, as well as the non-metallurgy mineral production sector. Because of the agriculture sector's dependence on weather conditions and the cyclical nature of harvesting, we forecast a decrease in the harvest index by 13% in 2012. However, the negative tendencies in agriculture will not affect the country's economic growth as a whole. The growth of value-added services in 2012 is predicted to be 8.5%. We also foresee a high growth rate for trade (12.7%), transport (7.9%), and communications (8.2%). Our estimates for inflation are within the forecasted corridor of 6%-8%. Economic growth in 2013-2017 may be more balanced and focused on internal coordination of the sectors in growth rates, which excludes an extreme increase in demand that could be caused by credit activity. Economic growth in 2013-2017 is predicted to be between 6.3% and 7.7%. The main growth factor in 2013-2014 will be internal demand, which may grow by as much as 10.3% on average, and in 2015-2017 by 7.4%. The value of investment inputs in GDP growth is estimated to be higher than that of 2008-2011. As a whole, over the forecast period a high rate of capital savings will occur, with the share of investment in GDP estimated at 30.1% in general.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-space-to-trade]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The development of the global economy amid the financial crisis has accelerated the launch of the regional integration processes, one of which is a Customs Union, which was created in accordance with the agreement for establishing a common customs territory and the formation of a Customs Union in October 6, 2007. This is primarily related to ensuring the harmonization of international legal regulation of importers and exporters within the framework of the Customs Code of the Customs Union. The Customs Union includes three member states: the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Belarus. Within the integration process, entrepreneurial activity in the territory of the Customs Union has been greatly expanded.<br></p><p>The Customs Union is a form of trade and economic integration that resulted in creating the common customs territory. Within the space, there are no customs duties or restrictions of an economic nature, except for special protection, anti-dumping, and countervailing measures. Within the Customs Union, the unified customs tariffs and other common measures on the regulation of goods trading conjointly third countries are applied.</p><p>The boundaries of the Customs Union territory are considered to be the customs border of the Customs Union. The transportation of goods in the territory of the Customs Union shall be carried out freely. The goods that are recognized as the goods of the Customs Union shall be subject to free movement.</p><p>The goods of the Customs Union shall specify goods that are situated in the territory of the Customs Union, made or produced in the territory of the member countries of the Customs Union, or are imported into the customs territory and further acquired the status of the Customs Union goods (i.e. have passed customs clearing and released to free circulation).</p><p>The free movement of the goods in the territory of the Customs Union assumes the absence of customs registration for goods when crossing the border of a member state. Thus, if the goods of an importer fall under the terms of the Customs Union, their import into the territory of Kazakhstan will be carried out without customs registration or the payment of customs duties and taxes.</p><p>In addition, when the importer's goods, which have been previously imported from the Russian Federation, for example, have passed customs clearing and have been released to free circulation, they shall be considered as Customs Union goods. The transportation of such goods to the territory of Kazakhstan for the rendering of services will be carried out without customs registration or payment of customs duties and taxes.</p><p>Customs support and preliminary decision-making shall apply to an import's customs duties and taxes, which are defined according to the Uniform Customs Tariff of the Customs Union, at a VAT of 12% and customs charges for the declaration of goods. Thus, in case of imports by an importer in the territory of Kazakhstan of equipment from non-member countries, the customs procedure for temporary import (admission) shall apply. These terms and conditions of commodity circulation greatly simplify the cooperation of companies importing from countries of the Customs Union and eliminate the problems that previously occurred during the import process. Nevertheless, one of the main problems still remains the lack of financial resources for continuing the stable import of goods.</p><p>In this context, the relevance of trade and project finance in the Customs Union has been rapidly increasing, and the demand for this type of service continues to grow.</p><p>Being one of the leader-companies in trade and project finance among the Customs Union CIS countries, the International Law Firm Integrites helps companies to find financial sources for business development. Thus, our company can be considered as a contributor to the economic development of the CIS countries, and in particular, the Customs Union. Trade finance provides an excellent opportunity to access one of the most profitable and affordable international sources of financing for companies that are involved in the importation of goods.</p><p>Typically, resident banks in CIS countries provide short-term loans at very high interest rates. In this regard, national importers are interested in cost-effective financing sources. One of these schemes is aimed to obtain a loan from a bank—a non-resident of the CIS secured by the guarantee of foreign export credit agencies (ECA).</p><p>The Integrites' concept—trade and project finance—is a type of financing for foreign trade operations through the use of current turnover assets of the foreign supplier or the foreign bank.</p><p>The main objective of trade and project finance is to reduce the risks related to foreign trade operations, as well as provide the importer with the financial resources necessary to carry out a foreign operation. The difference between trade and project finance is the amount and term of financing and the level of risks the ECA incurs.</p><p>Accordingly, the difference may be in the level of the ECA's commission for participation in this international transaction.</p><p>The fees of foreign banks secured by the ECA's guarantees are much lower than the commissions charged by commercial banks in CIS countries. Accordingly, the use of trade or project finance instruments is substantially more beneficial to importers in CIS countries.</p><p>Integrites experts provide their clients with comprehensive assistance in attracting trade and project finance, from assessment of a borrower's solvency through Integrity Check to the complete structuring of trade finance transactions, including the participation of the ECA. Taking into account the wide range of our experience in assisting our clients in the procedure of obtaining trade finance, it should be noted that, as a rule, the amount of insurance coverage provided by the ECA is 80%-90% of the value of the loans extended.</p><p>Structured trade finance is one of the priorities of Integrites. Our specialists have wide experience in minimizing the risks associated with the implementation of foreign economic operations, and in finding the optimal solutions to finance your company's import activities within the countries of the CIS.</p><p>Depending on the complexity and specificity of a particular transaction, the Integrites team is ready to offer the most effective tools of trade financing, including the preparation of investment memorandums, export credit insurances, and export factoring services and forfeiting.</p><p>The basic principle of our company in providing trade finance services is that Integrites prepares contracts of guarantee, providing guarantees for the deferral of payments through the ECA, under which the foreign banks may provide money for CIS importers. This allows the importers of the Customs Union to significantly reduce the cost of implementing import operations by reducing the share of loans in their credit portfolio. The transactions under consideration range from ‚¬150,000 and up. The term to raise short-term and long-term financing transactions may last from two to five months. In the case of positive results during the evaluation of a company's exporting capacity, this period may be extended.</p><p>In conclusion, we would like to say that the integration process which is being formed within the Customs Union to date has greatly increased the demand for such legal practices, such as the customs law, antitrust law, tax law, investments, and corporate and commercial law.</p><p>Accordingly, the Integrites International Law Firm is ready to kindly assist importers in the member countries of the Customs Union, both in the provision of legal services and through the involvement of tools of trade and project financing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>According to international experts, Kazakhstan is currently seen among the most attractive destinations for foreign investment across the world.<br></p><p>Kazakhstan pursues a policy of openness, transparency, and stability, which serves as key to attract foreign companies to the country. The amount of investments also shows the trust foreign investors have in Kazakhstan.</p><p>During the period from 1993 to end-2011, $146.6 billion of FDI was attracted into Kazakhstan's economy. Moreover, we are witnessing a positive growth trend.</p><p>The year 2011 saw Kazakhstan attract $19.9 billion of FDI to the economy, which is 10% more than in 2010 ($18.1 billion).</p><p>Our country ranks second after Russia among the CIS countries in terms of accumulated FDI over the past 10 years, and is a leader in terms of accumulated foreign investments per capita. Investments in Kazakhstan come mainly from the US, the Netherlands, the UK, France, Italy and Germany, which together bring advanced technology and innovation into the country.</p><p>Kazakhstan already has about 8,000 companies operating with the support of foreign capital in its territory, including companies from the Fortune 500, which clearly indicates the investment attractiveness of the country.</p><p>In 1998, the Foreign Investors Council (FIC) was established with a view to achieve better interaction between foreign investors and local companies. Today, the FIC includes the heads of 30 of the largest foreign investment companies representing various sectors of the economy. Since its establishment, the council annually discusses the most important economic trends in the country and makes recommendations on various issues, such as the modernization of enterprises, the development of local content, the training of staff, the improvement of the taxation system, the simplification of bureaucratic procedures, the building of the national image, the increased of transparency of legislative process, and the protection of the environment, among many others. Mutually acceptable decisions are made on all matters, allowing Kazakhstan to successfully develop international economic cooperation and adopt the world's best practices.</p><p>The successful attraction of investments would not be possible without a corresponding legislative base, which has provided favorable conditions for foreign and local investors. The Law On Investments was adopted in 2003, and provides full protection for investors' rights.</p><p>Moreover, the new Law on Special Economic Zones (SEZs) was adopted in 2011, which allowed a comprehensive restructuring of their activities. The law provides the involvement of professional management companies in the development of SEZs and creates a single-window work format. Today, Kazakhstan has nine special economic zones in operation.</p><p>A significant contribution to attracting investments and technology into the non-extractive sector is provided for in the 2010-2014 State Program on Accelerated Industrial-Innovative Development of the Country. The program determines clear strategic goals for the diversification and accelerated industrialization of the Kazakhstani economy, where main emphasis is directed toward the development of high-tech and innovative sectors.</p><p>Under this program and through ongoing work to improve the investment attractiveness of the country, the national plan to attract investments and the related program, as well as the development of special economic zones and export promotion in Kazakhstan between 2010 and 2014 has been adopted and are currently being realized.</p><p>The main objectives of these programs are to improve the investment legislation of the country, promote Kazakhstan's image as an investment destination, pursue a collaborative system while working with foreign investors, and develop more SEZs. The result of the adoption of these measures will allow for significant procedural alleviations, including issuing visas, creating favorable conditions for investors' stay in the country—specifically in the regions—and supporting investors, both at central and regional levels.</p><p>In addition to the national investment legislation aimed at the promotion and protection of investments, the government has signed bilateral agreements on the promotion and mutual protection of investments with 46 countries.</p><p>The programs adopted and measures undertaken by the government are the major tools for attracting investments and they will further promote the improvement of country's investment image.</p><p>Owing to the active pursuit and implementation of these policies, Kazakhstan remains in an advanced position in terms of attracting investments, not only among the countries of the CIS region, but worldwide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan has a comprehensive investment strategy supported by a wide range of state bodies. How do you describe the role and significance of KAZNEX INVEST in this picture?<br></h4><p>KAZNEX INVEST is a one-stop shop for foreign investors. Our work with investors can be divided into two major areas. The first area is informing the international business community about investment opportunities in Kazakhstan and searching for potential investors for the priority sectors of the economy. This work includes business forums, roadshows, advertising campaigns, and the national investment website. Our second task is to assist the investor, both during an examination of investment opportunities in Kazakhstan and the realization of investment projects in the country. In addition, the national plan for investment attraction was developed with the support of KAZNEX INVEST. According to this plan, KAZNEX INVEST is actively working with state authorities to establish service centers for investors in every region of the country. Most importantly, the national plan aims to build a system of state bodies, from the Ambassador of Kazakhstan through to the so-called “front group," which includes the border and customs services, to leadership in each region. Every ambassador, minister, head of a public holding, national company, and regional governor is working to attract investment.</p><h4>In which areas is KAZNEX INVEST particularly interested? From which geographies do you see increasing demand for investment?</h4><p>Our agency held several successful events to present investment opportunities in Kazakhstan. In April 2012, we presented our investment climate and projects to US and Canadian companies. In the US, we were in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC, as well as in Vancouver in Canada. During this roadshow, we presented priority sectors such as agriculture, machinery, chemistry, pharmacy, metallurgy, and ICT. Attracting foreign investment to these and other non-extractive sectors of the economy was the main purpose of the roadshow. We gathered more than 200 North American transnational and middle-sized companies. As a result, KAZNEX INVEST signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with GlaxoSmithKline and Bloomingfeld. In June 2012, our agency organized a series of roadshows in European countries: Belgium, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the UK. This roadshow was devoted to presenting the sectors of agriculture, chemicals, renewable energy, goods and services for oil and gas, and machinery, among others. Through this roadshow, we were able to attract more than 250 European companies. In fall 2012, our agency is planning to hold a roadshow in Asia, including events in Japan, Indonesia, and India.</p><h4>What synergies do you create with foreign investors to facilitate the realization of industrial projects in the country?</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a country that is open to foreign investment, and hence its government constantly strives to improve the business climate. In the scope of its role as a national operator on investment attraction and export promotion, KAZNEX INVEST has a great deal of governmental support, which facilitates investment attraction and export promotion. As a subsidiary of the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies, our agency does not create joint ventures with foreign investors, nor does it provide any kind of funding. Our main tasks and strengths are providing up-to-date information on all of the aspects of investing in Kazakhstan, organizing meetings with state bodies and partners for foreign investors, escorting investors to the regions of Kazakhstan, and solving any bureaucratic issues. Other than these investor-centric tasks, we do have a number of broader goals, such as generating a better investment image, conducting analytical studies, and improving investment legislation. Another factor we consider our strong point is our dual ability to handle investments and promote exports. We understand that due to the country's population size, our domestic market alone is not very interesting for multinational companies. Therefore, most large companies enter Kazakhstan with the idea to use the country as a bridge to the Customs Union and other nearby markets. In that regard, these companies can obtain support from KAZNEX INVEST not only as prospective investors, but as exporters as well.</p><h4>In which regions and for which sectors does Kazakhstan have competitive advantages?</h4><p>In the last two years, new types of engineering products were exported to the EU market. Kazakhstan is set to specialize in exporting machinery products to countries other than the CIS. Taking into consideration the criteria to comply with international trade standards, global demand, raw material security, and the production capacity and profitability of exports, it is possible to identify potential export markets. Kazakhstan is traditionally strong in metallurgy, oil and gas extraction, and wheat production. Recently, however, we have started to gain experience in the production of machinery and equipment. In terms of drilling equipment, exports are promising for Turkey, the UK, and the UAE. Batteries and electrical equipment also have great potential in these markets.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Kazakhstan's experience within the Customs Union and the overall process of Eurasian economic integration?</h4><p>We see the initiation of the Customs Union in 2010 as a mostly positive event for Kazakhstan. There are three main benefits for Kazakhstan. The first benefit is the expansion of the market. One of Kazakhstan's weaknesses is its small population and domestic market. With the Customs Union, there is a unified market of 170 million consumers. A second factor is the increased amount of trade, and commodity turnover has greatly increased. Thirdly, we are seeing the development of more industries, such as machinery. For example, compared with 2009, automotive production increased by more than 2.5 times in 2011. This growth happened due to unified customs tariffs, which have increased competitiveness in the domestic market. However, an event of this magnitude creates challenges in addition to opportunities. In our field of work, one of the main challenges is the redirection of investment flows from Kazakhstan to other Customs Union members. To prevent the occurrence of such a problem, the government constantly strives to improve the investment climate. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Kazakhstan is more open to FDI than other CIS countries. In the FDI Restrictiveness Index, which measures statutory restrictions on FDI in different countries, Kazakhstan is ranked 14th with a score of 0.14, which is a non-OECD average. The World Bank also measures the conditions for business ventures in different countries. According to the Doing Business 2012 report, Kazakhstan was positioned 47 spots ahead of the other members of the CIS. Furthermore, the country ranked 10th worldwide in terms of investment protection. After the establishment of the Customs Union, the growth rate of mutual trade with other Customs Union countries has become faster than that of non-member state imports. In 2011, the export growth rate was 211% and import activity grew by 182% in comparison with 2009. Although Kazakhstan's balance of trade with the Customs Union countries is still negative, this is mainly due to the fact that Kazakhstan sends products for export to foreign countries and acquires the necessary goods primarily in the markets of neighboring countries. In 2011, the share of imports from the CU countries was 44% of total imports. For two years, the country's export of Kazakhstani high value-added products increased significantly. For example, 99% of bearings exports, 90% of battery exports, and 66% of phosphinate exports are destined for Customs Union countries. In line with the state investment and export promotion program, KAZNEX INVEST is supporting domestic enterprises to promote the export of Kazakhstani goods to foreign markets and encouraging foreign investors to consider Kazakhstan. In particular, KAZNEX INVEST provides informational and analytical support to local enterprises and foreign investors, such as market analyses. The agency also identifies potential buyers, provides financial assistance in entering foreign markets, and offers assistance in establishing an enterprise in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the rest of 2012 and beyond?</h4><p>In 2H2012, we plan to continue our activities concerning the presentation of investment opportunities in Kazakhstan. We have intentions to conduct roadshows in Japan, India, and Indonesia, as well as business forums in Brazil, Spain, and Switzerland. In addition, we are preparing a 30-second video about investment opportunities in Kazakhstan. In the fall of this year, viewers will be able to see this informational video on the world's leading channels. In 2011, we filmed a similar video and broadcasted it on CNN, BBC, and Bloomberg. Regarding the improvement of legislation, we would like to mention that experts at the OECD have analyzed our regulatory framework, which defines the business environment, and compared it with the standards of the OECD as well as with international best practices. As a result, OECD experts offered 12 recommendations to improve our investment legislation. At the moment, KAZNEX INVEST is considering the desirability and feasibility of these recommendations. By the end of 2012, we will have a vision that guides the continuation of our work to improve the regulatory framework for investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you choose Kazakhstan as a place to start business?<br></h4><p>In my high school graduation yearbook from 1982, I wrote that my greatest dream was to study medicine and work with our brothers in Central Asia. Although I decided not to practice medicine upon graduating from Çukurova University in 1989, I did decide to do business with the newly independent Central Asian republics and focused on Kazakhstan. My childhood friend Ismail Koyuncu is of Uzbekistani origin, and we worked together to establish our first company in 1992. When we started the enterprise, we did not have huge amounts of capital, but we had passion and faith in our goal. Since then, we have worked hard to not disappoint the people who trusted us. We delivered all the products our clients ordered on time, even if it caused us losses. The combination of our trustworthiness, sincerity, and organizational excellence led to our current success. We moved our head office from Istanbul to Almaty in 1997. From our Almaty center we operate in Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Mongolia. We are also planning to expand into Afghanistan. Today, we are leaders in every business segment we operate in, including distribution, construction, and industry, and we aim to maintain our position as one of the top three companies in each sector.</p><h4>What were your initial areas of focus?</h4><p>Having a vision is synonymous with the ability to take tomorrow's picture today, and establish a strategy accordingly. We did not reinvent the system—we just discovered our niche and excelled in it. Our departure point was to market Turkish exports in Kazakhstan. When we first arrived here, we saw that the production line from the Soviet era was broken, and there were many consumer needs in every sector. Until 1994, we imported a wide array of goods from Turkey; anything from soap to blankets. In an environment where a plethora of Turkish firms have tried to conduct a similar import business, we took the radical decision of not importing from Turkey and began to distribute goods from other countries. As our distribution network expanded, we negotiated with new partners such as Unilever and Nestlé, and we have been working together with them for more than 15 years.</p><h4>What role does Turkuaz Group play in the development of industry and energy infrastructure in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Soaring chimneys and endless fields have always inspired me. With this excitement, we have launched our operations in industry. Currently, there are four factories, two of which belong to Turkuaz Group: a brick factory and a tea factory. We also have two partnerships. Through our partnership with Henkel, we produce construction materials. With our Saudi Arabian partner, Savola Group, we operate a sunflower oil factory. Annually, we produce 80 million liters of sunflower oil, which is the largest capacity in Central Asia. Our brands are market leaders. Although we established this factory independently, we later partnered with the Savola Group, demonstrating our willingness to form foreign partnerships. Although we are a foreign company in Kazakhstan, we have attained an excellent level of localization. This achievement helps us successfully integrate our corporate culture and professionalism with local requirements. Therefore, it is beneficial for foreign investors to partner with Turkuaz in Kazakhstan. The fact that global leaders such as Henkel and Savola partnered with Turkuaz proves our competence as a local partner of foreign origin. Looking ahead, we are interested in the energy sector. Energy is a subject we would like to explore, and we are particularly interested in power generation. Provided that Kazakhstan has increasing power needs and that the government continues to focus on privatization, the energy sector is an area we would like to pursue.</p><h4>What advice do you offer to foreign investors interested in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>President Nazarbayev is a formidable leader for Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the entire Turkic population. Against the backdrop of every cultural, economic, and political difference among the Central Asian nations, I strongly believe that Kazakhstan is the leader in the region. Kazakhstan is also the most attractive country for foreign investors who seek stability and growth along with access to the CIS markets of more than 200 million people, including Russia. However, it is not possible to replicate the gold rush of the early 1990s in Kazakhstan. My advice to investors that come to Kazakhstan is to do the business they excel at instead of starting new adventures. Kazakhstan presents many opportunities to investors, not only in the extractive industries, but in other fields as well. Investors should keep in mind that they might find themselves in a position to manufacture in the country, as the majority of the country's consumer goods are imported. In general, we strongly welcome investors to Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Suddenly Better]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[suddenly-better]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>If one had to summarize Kazakhstan's economic prospects in two words, they would be: “suddenly better."<br></p><p>Why suddenly, and why better? Because Kazakhstan is suddenly a stronger economy, and Central Asia is suddenly a better neighborhood.</p><p>To see why, go back to the year 2005. Global GDP was $37 trillion; $27 trillion of this was in advanced economies and about $10 trillion in developing countries. Five years before that, in 2000, global GDP was $32 trillion, and three-quarters of it was in advanced economies. You do not have to be a geographer to know that there are no advanced economies near Kazakhstan. It pays to be close to countries that are doing well, but the countries of Central Asia were far away from where much of the world's economic activity was concentrated. Central Asia was not a very good neighborhood 10 years ago.</p><p>In 2005, something remarkable happened. Global GDP increased by $1.3 trillion, but that had happened before. For the first time, more than half of this increase in global economic activity came from developing countries. Among these developing countries were China, India, Russia, South Korea and Turkey—the big neighbors for Kazakhstan. Together, these five countries had almost 10% of world GDP in 2005. Today, it may be close to twice that share.</p><p>When Kazakhstan became independent in 1990, assume that output was 100 in each of these countries. Today, it is 800 in China, 400 in India, 250 in South Korea, 200 in Turkey, and once again 100 in Russia. One-fifth of the world's GDP has come closer—much closer—to Astana. And world GDP is much bigger now. In 2011, it was $42 trillion, up by $5 trillion in real terms since 2005.</p><p>To be sure, developing countries are still just one-third of global GDP, so Europe, the US, and Japan still matter a lot. But China, India, Russia, South Korea, and Turkey are growing rapidly, making the whole world dynamic, and making the Central Asian neighborhood better. This year, developing countries will add more than $1 trillion to global output. And a lot of this will be close to Kazakhstan.</p><p>These are big changes, in just six short years. For Kazakhstan, things are suddenly better.</p><h4>Making the Most</h4><p>These changes are resulting in a broadening of the sources of global economic growth and innovation beyond North America and Europe, and the creation of new poles of growth in Asia. As incredible as the changes in the former Soviet Union were over the last 20 years, the next 20 may bring even bigger changes.</p><p>What are the economic prospects for Kazakhstan the next decade? This is difficult to predict, because so much depends on what businesses and policymakers do between now and then, and there will be many surprises. But it is likely that the big trends will continue for some years. Over the next decade or so, developing countries are expected to grow by about 4.5% each year. Developed countries will grow at less than half that pace. How can Kazakhstan be a part of this story?</p><p>In two words: investment and trade. Kazakhstan has done well to protect investors and to make it easier to trade and to invest. It can do even better. Perhaps the two biggest parts of the strategy are better regulations for traders and investors, and more transparent government. World Bank assessments of policies and institutions rate Kazakhstan highly in terms of macro stability and budgetary processes. But they are not so favorable when it comes to what we call structural policies—those that govern trade, finance, and private enterprise. They are even less favorable when it comes to the institutions needed to ensure transparent policymaking. Consider the following:</p><p>•In terms of per capita income, Kazakhstan was ranked 66th out of 180 countries in the world by the IMF in 2011, almost in the top third of all economies.</p><p>•In terms of economic freedom, Kazakhstan was ranked 78th out of 179 countries by the Heritage Foundation in 2011, just barely in the top half of all countries.</p><p>•In terms of transparency and corruption perceptions, Kazakhstan was ranked 105th out of 178 countries, well inside the lower half of all nations.</p><p>So, as we look at income levels to economic freedoms to corruption perceptions, Kazakhstan slips further and further down.</p><h4>Diversify, Diversify, Diversify</h4><p>The case of Sweden is especially instructive, and tells us of the importance of three ingredients. The first is agriculture. Sweden changed the structure of land ownership to allow for consolidated farms. As a matter of policy, new production techniques were introduced. Within 20 years between 1830 and 1850, Sweden went from being a big importer of food grains to being a big exporter. The second is education. Like the institutional changes in agriculture, education was reformed as a matter of policy. Schools, technical institutes, and universities were all expanded. By 1850, Sweden had the core of a modern engineering industry. The third is “protoindustry"—simple manufacturing, mining, and forestry—though this was not the result of explicit industrial policy. It resulted in Sweden exporting processed food and wood products, and simple industrial products like iron ore.</p><h4>Goal: Emulation by Neighbors, and the Admiration of Others</h4><p>Why is this so important? It is important because Kazakhstan has the potential to be an inspiration to its neighbors in Eurasia and to others around the world. It is important because these are the visions and aspirations of thoughtful people in successful economies in the world. I am reminded of an essay in a book called East Asian Visions, by Singapore's leading ambassador and academic, Professor Tommy Koh, who writes that his “dream is that Asia will be admired by the world not only for [its] prosperity and modernity, but also for [its] soft power. Three of the obstacles that we have to overcome in order to achieve my dream are corruption, growing social inequity, and environmental neglect. We have to solve these and other short-comings if we want the West to treat us as equals and if we want the rest of the non-Western world to look to Asia for inspiration."</p><p>At the World Bank, we share this vision of a world in which Kazakhstan is emulated and admired by other countries. And while this article is about Kazakhstan, its conclusions hold as much or even more for other countries in the neighborhood such as Azerbaijan, Armenia, Russia, and  Uzbekistan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kazakhstan has made impressive progress in economic development. Against a backdrop of new economic challenges and the ongoing global crisis, what action does the state intend to take to realize its full potential?<br></h4><p>In order to achieve all we have, we have worked to diversify the economy, stimulate the production of innovative components, and support export-oriented industries and the development of SMEs. In 2011, the GDP growth rate was the highest in the last three years at 7.5%. Given the instability of the global economy, measures to prevent a recession in the economy include maintaining employment levels, providing social assistance to citizens of different categories, and ensuring financial stability. In addition, wisely using natural resources has allowed the accumulation of substantial financial capacity in the specially created National Fund. To date, the international reserves of the National Bank, with assets from the National Fund, total more than $80.5 billion. With the establishment of “threshold" values, the dynamics of key macroeconomic indicators are systematically monitored on a constant basis. Additional incentives and support measures will be introduced should the economy enter into a risky zone. To reach our goals, we need to ensure annual economic growth of at least 7%.<br></p><h4>Large-scale projects in the processing of raw materials and infrastructure development have been launched in Kazakhstan. What is the significance of such developments?</h4><p>Indeed, in this year's State of the Union Address, I gave instructions on the implementation of a number of large industrial and infrastructure projects such as the construction of a gas and chemical complex in the Atyrau region, and an integrated refining complex in the Atyrau oil refinery for the production of complex fertilizers. Other large-scale projects that will be built include the West-North-Center gas pipeline, the Balkhash thermal power plant, the Beineu-Zhezkazgan and Arkalyk-Shubarkol railroads, and the 2,800-kilometer-long Kazakhstani section of the international Western Europe-Western China transit corridor. The total project cost will amount to KZT4.3 trillion, or about $29 billion, about $9 billion of which will be financed by the state. Funds allocated to the national welfare fund Samruk-Kazyna for the anti-crisis program of 2009-2010 will be re-allocated to this end. All of these global initiatives are aimed at addressing the key objectives of Kazakhstan's economy; a self-sustaining, independent domestic market of oil products and mineral fertilizers, the gasification of the northern regions, the enhanced energy supply of the southern regions, and the formation of transport arteries and international transit routes. In addition, the implementation of such projects should provide a significant multiplier effect for the major regions of the country. These projects should stimulate the development of SMEs and new technologies. This is the basic idea of the industrial policy; the state sets the initial momentum, and the task of the private sector is to pick up and develop the initial initiative. For example, the construction of a gas processing facility for the production of polypropylene and polyethylene will not only diversify Kazakhstani exports, but also create conditions for the formation of a number of new high-tech chemical industries in Kazakhstan. The Western Europe-Western China transit corridor involves around 100 contractors, 30 asphalt producers, and 24 cement/concrete plants. The project involves over 35,000 employees. Since the beginning of the project, 21 production facilities were either built or modernized, including two cement factories in the cities of Taraz and Shymkent, a plant for the production of dowels for cement-asphalt coatings in Almaty, the upgrading of two bitumen plants in Kyzylorda and Shymkent, and factories for paint and geosynthetic materials production in Almaty. I would also like to note that the program of industrialization is not limited to the projects I have mentioned. During the 2010-2011 period, 389 projects worth around $12 billion have been implemented, and they have created 43,000 permanent jobs. The implemented projects create an economic value of $3.4 billion annually. Now, in the framework of Kazakhstan's industrialization map, 220 projects are being implemented in a wide spectrum of industries including refining, agriculture, metallurgy, chemicals, engineering, construction, pharmaceuticals, and aerospace. The total cost of the projects is about $53 billion and they will provide for the creation of about 300,000 jobs.</p><h4>The Foreign Investors Council has become an effective platform for strengthening dialogue between foreign businessmen and the government in recent years. What benefits does such close dialogue bring to the development of the business climate in the country?</h4><p>The Foreign Investors Council was established in 1998 to provide for direct dialogue with investors operating in Kazakhstan, as well as operational solutions for issues concerning investment activities. One of the main functions of the council is to make recommendations on key areas of investment policy, as well as to improve the investment climate and regulatory framework. At present, the council includes 29 leading foreign companies and international organizations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Deutsche Bank, ArcelorMittal, HSBC, General Electric, Sberbank, Total, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and others. Since its inception the council has held 24 meetings, in which a wide range of topics were discussed. The key issues include improving the tax system and tax administration, the modernization of Kazakhstan's economy, Kazakhstan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), progress in improving transparency and fighting corruption, the involvement of foreign investors in the policy of diversification, and technological development in Kazakhstan. In light of the opinions of members of the council, I have given appropriate instructions to the government that are going to be implemented before the next council meeting. In order to detail the recommendations of the Foreign Investors Council, working groups constantly look at issues of taxation, legislation, the current activities of foreign investors, and the improvement of the investment image of Kazakhstan, as well as the oil and gas sector. Ultimately, much of the council's recommendations are reflected in policy documents that result in concrete results, such as the state program for accelerated industrial-innovative development over the 2010-2014 period, the program to attract investment, the development of special economic zones, and export promotion for the 2010-2014 period. Thanks to this policy to improve the investment climate, total FDI stock in Kazakhstan grew from $2.78 billion in 2000 to $19.85 billion in 2011. From only 2008 to 2011, Kazakhstan went from 64th to 47th place in the World Bank's Doing Business report. In the “Protecting Investors" category, Kazakhstan ranked 10th. In May 2012 the council held the 25th meeting on the theme of “Kazakhstan; an international trade, logistics, business, and financial hub." We are always open to fruitful discussions and the valuable advice of the council members, who will be  able to give an additional boost to the economy. Overall, I would like to commend the contribution of the Foreign Investors Council in improving the business and investment climate in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>During the second summit on nuclear security in Seoul, you mentioned Kazakhstan's plans to build an international bank for low-grade uranium in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). How important is this project for Kazakhstan and for global security in general?</h4><p>The international bank for low-grade uranium  under the auspices of the IAEA is to be created on the initiative and financial support of the non-profit Nuclear Threat Initiative, as well as the US, EU, Norway, the UAE, and Kuwait. In 2009, Kazakhstan proposed hosting the bank on its territory and in 2011 submitted a formal application to the IAEA. At present, the project is entering the implementation stage. The bank aims to ensure the effective functioning of the international nuclear fuel market. States that comply with the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and are developing a national nuclear energy sector should be confident that they will receive nuclear fuel in a guaranteed and predictable manner. The establishment of the nuclear fuel reserve under the auspices of the IAEA is intended to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and demonstrate the consistency and feasibility of international initiatives in this area. Proposing to host a fuel bank in its territory, we hereby reaffirm that Kazakhstan is an active supporter of the non-proliferation regime, and a leader in strengthening global security.</p><h4>Kazakhstan is a champion of multi-vector diplomacy in its foreign relations. In which direction will the nation's foreign policy develop in the coming years?</h4><p>Kazakhstan's foreign policy is predetermined by the realities of the world, including features unique to the geographic position of our country. Therefore, our country has taken a worthy place in modern geopolitics, following a multi-level and multi-dimensional foreign policy. We will continue with our balanced foreign policy, interacting not only with the West, but also with Asian countries. Today, regional processes are increasingly setting the global agenda. The nature and dynamics of the integration process will depend on the future of the world. Our foreign policy will remain the same; integration in the region, followed by access to global integration with the global community. We intend to continue to lead in our global initiatives. Today, it is important for the whole world and every state to find answers to powerful global and regional challenges. Thanks to peaceful foreign policy, international initiatives, strict adherence to obligations, and participation in regional and world affairs, we have earned the trust and respect of our foreign partners. Kazakhstan's foreign policy proposals were supported by the international community on both global and regional levels. Our challenge is to implement these proposal and realize a number of international events of global and regional importance. Kazakhstan will continue to identify ways to strengthen peace and international security and encourage the disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Contributing to the addressing of global and regional economic security at the Fifth Astana Economic Forum, held in May 2012, Kazakhstan presented its idea to create an initiative called G-Global to discuss ways of overcoming the global crisis. We will also strive to implement Kazakhstan's global energy strategy, as well as initiatives such as the Astana “Green Bridge," aimed at the transfer of green technologies. The Fourth Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, which has become an important platform for international inter-religious dialogue, was held in Astana in May 2012. By holding the congress, Kazakhstan contributed to the union of the spiritual and moral potential of religious teachings in resolving international conflicts and combating modern threats. As an active member of the UN and other international and regional organizations, our country is becoming the center of focus for the regional offices of international organizations. In this regard, Kazakhstan is expected to form an international hub for multilateral diplomacy in Almaty. The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA). This year marks the 20th year of my initiative of convening the CICA, which is considered today by the international community as a unique inter-governmental platform for dialogue and consultation, decision-making, and action by consensus on security issues in Asia. The inclusion of the CICA in working groups under the auspices of the UN and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is evidence of the importance of this forum in the world. Kazakhstan will work on the implementation of multilateral decisions taken during its recently concluded presidency of prestigious organizations such as the OSCE and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Interesting projects are expected to be realized within the Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States. In particular, Astana was proclaimed 2012's culture capital of the Turkic world and the CIS. This year, we have to adequately complete the chairmanship of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In the future, the implementation of our initiatives, which have received the support of the OIC, will take place. Our country intends to continue its efforts to promote cooperation within the CSTO, and build its capacity in order to ensure peace and stability in the region. Responding to the global challenges of the 21st century, to deepen Eurasian integration, we, along with Russia and Belarus, formed a single economic space, which will proceed to the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union. This is an important step to regional stability overall and improving the competitiveness of our economies. We are ready to support the desire of other CIS states to join this Eurasian integration. Attention will also be given to the implementation of a CIS development concept. This document defines the priority directions of cooperation for the long term and is intended to revitalize the CIS. However, it should be clear that while transitioning into the Eurasian Economic Union, Kazakhstan's foreign policy, as it always has, will continue to develop balanced relations with other countries and regions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In an increasingly globalized world, a lack of rules can have the gravest of consequences. Unchecked emissions of greenhouse gases cause global warming, flooding, and storms. Overfishing irreparably harms ocean ecosystems that billions depend on for food and income. Unbridled financial speculation over recent years has triggered the collapse of the global financial system.<br></p><p>Yet there is one other issue where the absence of regulations holds more destructive potential than anywhere else: nuclear weapons. There are already a number of treaties and norms addressing the possession and testing of nuclear weapons. They are admittedly not a cure for everything, particularly since not all states abide by these rules. But without them, a global and regional arms race could quickly spiral out of control. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a crucial building block in this protective architecture. Its verifiable and all-encompassing ban on nuclear testing provides the final barrier for any country trying to acquire nuclear-weapon capability.</p><p>Kazakhstan has shown an extraordinary commitment to the cause of ending nuclear tests. Few other countries have suffered so severely from the recklessness of Cold War nuclear testing. Over 450 blasts irradiated the Semipalatinsk Test Site and its region, causing untold human loss and suffering lingering on into the present. I have visited Semipalatinsk repeatedly and felt its oppressive nuclear legacy, which will continue to haunt the people of the region for many generations to come: plutonium-239, one of the isotopes released into the atmosphere by a nuclear explosion, takes 23,000 years to lose just half of its radioactivity. The CTBT, adopted in 1996, is the tool that can put an end to this once and for all. The treaty bans nuclear testing in every respect, but has yet to become global law. Its stringent entry-into-force provision requires that all 44 nuclear-capable countries identified at the time of the CTBT's negotiation in the 1990s formalize their adherence through ratification, as Kazakhstan did in 2002.</p><p>Through its initiative to create a UN day against nuclear testing on August 29, which marks both the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949 at the Semipalatinsk Test Site and also its closure in 1991, Kazakhstan is renowned for repudiating nuclear weapons. While attending the ceremony this year commemorating the 20th anniversary of the closure of the test site at Semey, I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the Kazakhstani people for the cause of nuclear disarmament.</p><p>However, until the CTBT enters into force, the door to renewed nuclear testing remains open. Securing the consent of the eight remaining countries for its entry into force—China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Egypt, India, Israel, Iran, Pakistan and the US—is a daunting challenge. Some observers have even diagnosed a “debilitating, circular dynamic in which no one state will ratify unless others do so first." Nonetheless, I see room for cautious optimism. Firstly, with the decision by Indonesia's parliament to ratify the CTBT on December 6, 2011, the political momentum for entry into force has been renewed. Each additional ratification increases the pressure on the remaining holdouts. Secondly, despite not yet having entered into force, the CTBT has already created a normative and moral global consensus against nuclear testing. The only country to have conducted nuclear weapon tests this century is the DPRK, which was met with universal condemnation and unanimously adopted UN Security Council resolutions. Thirdly, 153 countries have already ratified the CTBT, including the nuclear weapon possessors Russia, France, and the UK. This clearly demonstrates the conviction that national security interests are better served by a global, verifiable ban on nuclear explosions than by resuming testing themselves. They realize that the latter would only trigger testing elsewhere, thus eroding global security in the long run.</p><p>However, my largest source of inspiration is the resounding support for the CTBT from countries such as Kazakhstan, which have consistently made political, technical, and financial investments in the treaty and its verification regime, even in difficult political and economic times. In addition, Kazakhstan generously hosted a major exercise in 2008 that helped to improve the CTBT's on-site inspection capabilities. Five of the 337 facilities making up the CTBT's International Monitoring System (IMS) are also located on Kazakhstani territory, and help to ensure that no nuclear test goes undetected, thus deterring would-be testers.</p><p>Thanks to the help of countries such as Kazakhstan, the world is a little bit safer from the devastating threat posed by nuclear weapons.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Astana Group was first created by the establishment of Astana Motors in 1992. What have been the cornerstones of your group's evolution over the past 20 years?<br></h4><p>The group was established in 1992 with Astana Motors right after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The country was devastated and there was a deficit of all consumer goods. We were the first to import Japanese car brands such as Toyota, Nissan, and Subaru, and worked with well-known Japanese trading houses such as Nissho Iwai and Sojitz Corporation. Our mission was to create a civilized auto retail market in Kazakhstan. In 1996, when the privatization process started, we started buying silos, milling complexes, and pasta factories. We invested by bringing in new equipment, and as of today we are the leaders in the production of pasta and flour, exporting our products to close to 10 countries.</p><h4>How do you see your livestock activities developing in the medium run?</h4><p>My vision is that ultimately we want to create a system of quality livestock breeding to increase meat production in our country. By doing this, in five years' time we will be exporting beef to neighboring countries, especially to Russia, which is the best meat export destination considering its annual meat import potential. Our export focus on livestock production will differ from our grain export business. While the latter targets countries in Central Asia, the former will concentrate mainly on the Russian market. A small share of livestock production will be dedicated to halal meat, targeting countries in the Middle East and Gulf region. Our livestock base is very conveniently located 50 kilometers from the Russian border in the Kostanay oblast. This location is well placed in terms of logistics.</p><h4>Astana Motors has a 16% share in the new automobile market. How is the sector developing?</h4><p>In 2007 we reached our peak, with 11,000 cars sold. In 2011 we sold 6,200 units, with higher profitability than when we sold 11,000 units. Thanks to the crisis we learned how to conduct our business more profitably. Our target for 2012 is to double and pass the levels for 2011, which will exceed our pre-crisis levels. In 2011 we launched an assembly plant for Hyundai commercial vehicles. Locally assembled trucks will be sold in Kazakhstan and within the Customs Union. It is unprecedented in our history that now we export trucks assembled in Kazakhstan to Belarus. Hyundai is also considering supplying the Azerbaijani market from Kazakhstan, with possible exports to Russia as well. All this is happening because of the Customs Union. In April 2012 we will begin to assemble buses, which is a new area for our business. We are shifting from merely an import business to a more production-focused one. Within the assembly business we are not only importing, but also looking for local suppliers for spare parts, such as accumulators. Of course, we will not be building engines in 10 years, but one should not forget that this is where South Korea started out 40 years ago. Our Korean partners are advising us that if we do not start from somewhere, we will not navigate away from our dependence on the extractive industries.</p><h4>How do you assess the current state of demand for retail space in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We saw that Kazakhstan lacked quality retail space and shopping malls. Following our philosophy of being the most cutting-edge company of our type in the country, we invited leading foreign architects to design retail locations and support us during the initial stage of managing our shopping centers. Today, the supply of quality conceptual retail space differs in Kazakhstan from region to region. In Astana there is a surplus of shopping areas; however, if you look at other regions there is a deficit of retail space, as purchasing power is still low. A measure that shows quality space per 1,000 inhabitants indicates that while there is 400 sqm of class A retail space for 1,000 people in Astana, in Almaty it is 120 sqm. Hence, we started the construction of a second Mega Center in Almaty. It will contain a number of restaurants—not of a food court type, but targeted facilities for the premium segment with gourmet tastes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan is a high growth engine in Central Asia and has achieved remarkable macroeconomic stability and rising living standards among the country's population. It is true that the country was hit by a banking crisis and that the repercussions are still being felt, but this is the case for most of the world. It is also true that Kazakhstan enjoys a vast wealth of oil and other natural resources. However, one should not underestimate that prudent management is required in order to utilize this wealth and channel revenues into other industry sectors, thereby diversifying the economy. We believe that Kazakhstan is now on the verge of a transition into a high-income economy, but efforts are needed to stimulate this process.<br></p><p>Some will ask; what can unite the ninth largest country in the world with my tiny home country in the heart of Europe? The answer is simple: Austria is well positioned to contribute to Kazakhstan's successful transition from a highly resource-dependent country into a high value-added economy.</p><p>Austria and Kazakhstan have been partners for many years. Austrian delegations were among the first to visit newly independent Kazakhstan in the early 1990s and to provide support in the first stages of the transition of this large country. Trade turnover reached a record high of ‚¬1.6 billion in 2011. Kazakhstan is a strategic partner in Austria's energy supply and purchases various technologies, equipment, and machinery as well as pharmaceuticals and other high-value finished products from Austria. Austrian companies have invested ‚¬2 billion into the Kazakhstani economy and 60 Austrian companies are represented in the country, among them Austria's oil and gas company OMV. The Austrian Federal Economic Chamber opened its office in Almaty in 2010 and is now well placed to foster bilateral business ties. Austria's success story in Central and Eastern Europe underlines that Austrian business is prepared to enter markets early and create successful new business ventures.</p><p>Also, Austria's economy has been traditionally strong in some areas that are of major importance to Kazakhstan now: manufacturing high value-added goods based on innovative technologies and providing high-value services that are competitive in international markets forms the backbone of Austria's economy dominated by SMEs. Austria ranks seventh in exports per capita and exports account for well over 50% of GDP. Well-educated staff, high productivity, and resource efficiency in production are the keys to success. Kazakhstan recognizes the importance of SMEs and is now pushing for improvements in vocational education and training as well as in productivity of its industrial enterprises and higher energy efficiency in industry and buildings. Austrian institutions and businesses are well experienced and ready to share and form partnerships. In 2010, Kazakhstan started an ambitious program to diversify its economy, and again Austrian business is able to supply the latest, but at the same time reliable, technologies for new production bases. One distinctive feature of Austria's economy has been to foster social peace by providing opportunities and ensuring a high living standard and accessible social services for its population. You will find Austria at the bottom of rankings of strike days per year, but on top for GDP and income per capita.</p><p>Austrian business can also make a real contribution in tourism, health care, and infrastructure, including railways, roads, and municipal and environmental technologies. Kazakhstan and Austria also share some common ground given their geographical locations: Kazakhstan is implementing ambitious road and rail projects in order to link Europe and China; Austria has been serving as a logistics hub at the very center of Europe and Vienna as a regional hub and center of expertise for doing business in central as well as southeastern Europe. The opportunity to create and become a regional hub in Central Asia is there for Kazakhstan given its more advanced economic and regulatory environment.</p><p>Kazakhstan shows commitment and interest to work with institutions such as the UN, OSCE, and the OECD, some of which are based in Vienna. Austria, itself a long time member of these institutions, appreciates their work, and, from an economic perspective, the positive effect of open market access and more standardized rules for business. Kazakhstan's quick accession to the WTO and a closer cooperation with the EU are all being well supported.</p><p>Finally, “the people make the difference" is not a mere slogan, but in fact matters. My personal experience of talking to guests from Kazakhstan and to Austrian businessmen tells me that we like to work with each other. People from Kazakhstan appreciate quality made in Austria and enjoy Vienna, linked by a direct flight to Astana and other parts of the country. Austrians in turn highly value the hospitality of their partners and the dynamic development of Kazakhstan. This is the foundation for joint success in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Armacon's core strengths?<br></h4><p>When we registered the company we set out to invest in numerous sectors—mainly energy, real estate, construction, and food and beverages in Turkey and neighboring countries. Traditionally, companies have a specialty in a single industry, but our plan is to actively engage and invest in different sectors and establish the Armacon brand.</p><h4>What is behind the diversification strategy?</h4><p>We're willing to take risks—Turkish companies historically do. I have a background in banking and movie production, and now I'm doing this. Our company needs to have that philosophy. More and more companies are acting like holdings and diversifying. The current economic climate means that you can't rely on one sector, and at the rate that technology is moving it's beneficial to be as flexible as possible. We started this company from the ground up and we're going to shape it. Our partner, Mustafa Alpaslan, has a background in the services industry—mainly cleaning and security for municipalities, public and private companies, and institutions all across Turkey. We started our first infrastructure project in the oil and gas sector immediately after we registered in the fall of 2011. While we had expected to start our first project in Turkey, the opportunity rose to begin in a neighboring country. This project is showing a healthy return on investment by providing natural gas to people who don't have access, and it has lots of potential to expand. We personally experienced one more time what a strategically important geographical location Turkey has.</p><h4>What opportunities are you following in the renewable energy sector?</h4><p>We are enthusiastic about the renewable energy sector in Turkey—especially solar. Unfortunately, the latest government legislation didn't meet our expectations for feed-in tariffs. We were hoping for them to be at the same level as European country standards. Turkey has an extraordinary amount of potential for solar energy—the capacity and insolation levels are higher than in most countries in Europe. It's comparable to Spain. Since the tariffs weren't as high as we expected, we have looked into other ways of taking advantage of government incentives. If you use photovoltaic (PV) systems that are produced in Turkey, then there are additional feed-in tariffs. Now we're doing some more research and hope to partner with companies, especially from the US, Germany, Italy, and China, that have more know-how to start producing panels here in Turkey. If we can produce our own panels, we can take advantage of higher tariffs. Globally, there is a huge supply of solar panels at the moment so very few companies want to make additional investments to produce more. But we believe that if we start installing our own panels in Turkey, we can take advantage of the reliability of Turkish products in the region and achieve good returns. We are trying to find ways to take this risk. The government is promoting the production of high-tech industry, and we are more than willing to pursue this route. Many of the bigger companies are shying away from investing in solar—hydro and wind is more attractive for them because it offers a faster and more secure return. We think it's important for Turkish companies like ours to break through first and be pathfinders for the whole solar industry in Turkey. That's why we want to develop the technology here.</p><h4>What capacity are you aiming to produce?</h4><p>If we establish a factory here in Turkey, we want to produce the newest technology in the market with panels that have maximum efficiency and performance. This is the latest and most drastic advance, so there wouldn't be a need to update the technology immediately. More power per panel means fewer panels and lower costs. We're envisioning a factory that has a capacity of around 65 MW to start with. We're evaluating a number of sites around the country, and the government is announcing new and different incentives constantly.</p><h4>What are your targets for the medium term?</h4><p>We have ongoing investments in Turkey's real estate market. The market is full of opportunities, and we always keep our eyes open. We have invested in plots of land in both Ankara and Istanbul for future development. Multi-purpose projects are currently extremely popular in Turkey, and we want to ensure that we evaluate the positives and negatives as the market matures. Our goal is to be ahead of the curve of the next wave of real estate opportunities in Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Blossoming Relationship]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-blossoming-relationship]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Anadolu Group and Isuzu joint venture was the first Turkish/Japanese joint venture in the automotive industry. How has this relationship developed?</h4><p>We signed an agreement at the end of 1983 to begin the production and sale of commercial vehicles to Turkey. At that time there were no Japanese commercial vehicle producers in Turkey. Before then, Anadolu Automotive had only been producing the Czechoslovakian Skoda trucks. Our partnership with Isuzu started as a joint venture, but it has become a shareholder of Anadolu Isuzu. We have produced approximately 120,000 vehicles in Turkey.</p><p>After 1987, we started producing Isuzu midibuses. Turkish mechanics and engineers also started to design and build new Isuzu midibuses. Isuzu then decided to put its brand name on our buses, meaning their quality was accepted by Isuzu. Isuzu is a significant international player with commercial vehicles and diesel engines all over the world—it is in approximately 100 countries and its core business is commercial vehicles, especially trucks and diesel engines. In 1997, Anadolu Isuzu listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (İMKB), where we floated approximately 15% of our shares. In that period there were not many companies on the İMKB, especially in the automotive sector. Maybe we were not the first, but we were one of the first two or three. Being a listed company is very important for developing countries because it means that all information and details are open to the public.</p><h4>What share of production is devoted to the domestic market and what share is being exported?</h4><p>We started to export in 1994 and now export products to about 26 different countries, especially Isuzu buses. Most of them are European countries. In 2012, approximately half of our bus production was going to the Turkish market and half was exported. In the coming years, the ratio may be closer to 40-60 because exports are very important for the company, and especially for Turkey.</p><h4>What are your key export markets?</h4><p>Europe is very important, as is North Africa. Some 40% of total exports go to the Algerian market. The Algerian economy is stronger than some surrounding economies, due to its political stability—it will not be facing any massive political fluctuations. However, we mostly export to EU countries. In 2011 the Turkish automotive industry produced nearly 1.2 million units and 70% were exported, mostly to European countries, North Africa, and Russia. In the near future Turkey will be producing approximately 1.5 million units, including passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Of that total, approximately 1 million units will be exported.</p><h4>What is your position in the Turkish commercial vehicle market?</h4><p>Today, the company produces in four different areas: trucks, light trucks, midibuses, and Isuzu D-MAX pickups. For the pickups we are number two in the Turkish market and we are the leader in trucks. In terms of light trucks, we place third or fourth, and in midibuses we place second. Exports remain the most significant aspect of our operation, however. Approximately 50% of the company's midibus production is exported. That makes Anadolu Isuzu an important player in this country.</p><h4>Where are you targeting your R&amp;D expenditure?</h4><p>Anadolu Isuzu has two factories: a truck factory and a bus factory. For new models we make investments year by year. Over the last couple of years, we have designed two new models. In 2012 we entered the nine-meter bus segment, which will be important for Turkey, as municipalities around the country are changing the face of public transportation and introducing thousands of new nine- and 12-meter buses. This will give us plenty of new business.</p><h4>How has the company's relationship with Manisa city municipality developed?</h4><p>The municipality supports Anadolu Isuzu. There are an increasing amount of significant demand sources for midibuses, and in the long term municipalities want to satisfy their citizens. That's why, within three years, we will double our bus manufacturing output. In the past, Turkey imported buses, but over recent years it has become one of Europe's major bus producers. This potential is huge, and sales and exports will continue to increase.</p><h4>How committed is the company to environmental sustainability?</h4><p>All of our products fit EU regulations regarding the environment. That is why this year for example, we have started to Euro 5 diesel engines in our trucks and buses to meet European standards.</p><h4>Is the time right for electric vehicles?</h4><p>The bus has the most potential, especially in public transportation, in this respect and I expect to see a rapid change on that side, more so than on the commercial side. Although it may be a bit early for the nine- and 12-meter buses, in the coming years Turkey and Europe will begin to use electric buses. We do, however, need to worry about the economic connotations. Electric buses don't use petrol, but batteries. The state of batteries these days is still not green enough, however. That's why I believe we'll see this become a reality within a few years' time.</p><h4>How will Anadolu Isuzu take its share of the $75 million in Automotive Exports by 2023?</h4><p>I expect Anadolu Isuzu to grow double or more by 2023. All of our plans and targets build on this reality. We have got really big potential—not only in Turkey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strategy-to-succeed]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkey's defense industry has grown significantly since the government's policy to increase investment in local R&amp;D in 2004. How has the use of offset agreements helped to encourage this growth?</h4><p>It is a remarkable fact that Turkey's defense industry has grown significantly in the last decade, and offsets played an important role in this growth. It should be remembered that, in Turkey, offset policies and applications were identified by our Ministry after taking the needs of our defense industry into consideration. Within this context, two offset directives have been published since 2004 with the aim of directing offset activities toward the defense, homeland security, and aerospace industries to raise the level of local content and increase export capacities, as well as our share in the global defense and aerospace market. Moreover, in order to improve the penetration of the defense sector in Turkish industry, we made the necessary changes in our offset policies to encourage SMEs to be more involved in defense procurement programs. We believe that such changes in the offset policy have encouraged Turkish companies to create their own indigenous designs for defense acquisition projects, which eventually resulted in the growth of the defense industry. It should be kept in mind that offset programs not only create additional business possibilities for defense industry companies, but can also be utilized as a significant instrument to realize new investments in Turkey's defense sector. In such cases, both the investment amount and the exports to be realized as a result of this investment are accepted as offsets.</p><h4>Which Turkish defense products do you believe are the most competitive on the international marketplace?</h4><p>I believe that both land and naval platforms are very competitive on the international market, especially the coast guard boats, fast intervention boats, and modern patrol boats produced by our shipping industry. Also, Turkey has reached an advanced level of technology in armored and tactical wheeled vehicles, and those land platforms are highly reputable and widely exported. In addition to those platforms, I would like to mention the Amphibious Assault Bridge (AAB) project, which is being locally developed for the specific requirements of the Turkish Armed Forces. This product has significant potential market, as it is unique in its category.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to achieve Turkey's aspirations in the aerospace industry? How has TAI helped to boost Turkey's global profile in this industry?</h4><p>Turkey has given particular attention to aerospace projects, especially in recent years. There has been a remarkable increase in indigenous projects, such as the ANKA and Hürkuş, and Turkey is aiming to have its own fighter aircraft by 2023. Turkey's leading aerospace company, TAI, is a key player in these local projects. While on one hand we are moving to locally designed and manufactured platforms, on the other hand we are supporting the involvement of SMEs in aerospace projects. In the aerospace industry, it is crucial to follow standards, and it takes time to developed local industry up to the necessary levels. Via offsets we encourage foreign companies to work with local industry, especially in areas where the technology is moving toward export potential. SMEs can also benefit from TAI's experience via the Kazan Hub, through which they can easily become sub-contractors for TAI.</p><h4>How will the new light helicopter program fit into Turkey's growing defense manufacturing capabilities?</h4><p>Turkey's vision has significantly changed over the last decade from direct procurements to indigenous projects. Turkey now has the vision to establish a local aerospace industry that will have the ability to design, test, manufacture, and export aircraft. The aim is not just to manufacture aircraft, but also to have them manufactured to world standards and made compatible with their competitors. In order to achieve this goal, both industry and government need to harmonize their activities. With TAI being the prime contractor, guiding local sub-contractors, and the SSM governing and directing TAI and the local industry, the helicopter program will be a success story for the coming generation.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to establish Ankara as a hub for the defense industry?</h4><p>Most defense industry companies, such as TAI, ASELSAN, HAVELSAN, Roketsan, FNSS, and MKEK are all set up either in Ankara or in its vicinity. We are eager to improve the involvement of SMEs in the defense industry. In that sense, we have initiated the establishment of a hub adjacent to TAI's facilities in Kazan, Ankara in April 2011. An area of 3 million sqm was reserved for the Kazan Hub, and it is expected that 100-200 sub-industry companies and SMEs will benefit from it. This industrial zone will be a clustered and specialized establishment, especially for the aerospace sector, to improve the manufacturing, technological, and management capabilities of the companies present under the leadership of TAI. In addition to this hub, there is another defense and aviation cluster, called OSSA, situated in the organized industrial region of OSTİM in Ankara. This cluster was built in July 2008, and houses 89 SMEs that aim to become preferred sub-suppliers in the international defense marketplace. Running parallel to these initiatives, the Ankara Development Agency has declared Ankara the heart of the defense sector and announced that there will be incentives for clustering activities on offer in the defense sector. By these means, the involvement of local industries in defense procurement programs will be realized in a broader sense.</p><h4>Are we likely to see the further development of Turkey's warship building capabilities, and in what ship classes is Turkey looking to specialize?</h4><p>In recent years, Turkey's naval shipbuilding industry has developed extensively and succeeded in producing fast boats, offshore patrol vessels (OPVs), corvettes, amphibious vessels, and auxiliary warships. In addition to the development of surface ships, new submarine production and design capabilities have been developed. The sustainability and development of these capabilities shall be the main objective of future strategies. Within this process, several systems and equipment, such as command and control systems, fire control systems, and sonar have been developed by Turkish companies. Studies such as a national propulsion system have already commenced, and the development of naval defense capabilities shall continue. Turkey has achieved internationally competitive capabilities and has exported fast boats and OPVs to several friendly countries. Furthermore, the MİLGEM class corvette has received strong interest from the international market. In line with international needs and the development of Turkey's naval shipbuilding industry, the country aims to specialize in frigates and submarines in the future, as it has succeeded already in fast boats, OPVs, corvettes, amphibious vessels, and  auxiliary ships.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the use of offset agreements helped to encourage growth in the defense industry?<br></h4><p>Offsets have been used as tools to create volume for the industry, as it helps to balance trade within the country. The SSM was founded in 1985, and we have been given two important tasks by law: to develop the Turkish defense industry and to make acquisitions for the armed forces. These two should be balanced, but of course there are some tradeoffs. Offset agreements have been a starting point to establish the industry—using offset agreements alone for the industry does not make any sense. After making offset agreements, it is necessary to continue with other investments as a means to develop the industry.<br></p><p>In the 1990s, Turkish defense companies focused mainly on coproduction programs for land and air systems. One such company is FNSS, a joint venture between US and Turkish companies that produces armed vehicles. Even the F-16 assembler, TAI, started up in 1984 through joint ventures with General Dynamics. Now they have spent 15 to 20 years as co-production companies. In that phase we used offset agreements to keep those companies alive. What we realized by the early 2000s is that we cannot just keep using offset agreements to do so. They create a certain volume of business, but if you want to dive deep into the defense industry, you need to use cutting-edge technology. Without technology, you cannot obtain sustained growth. That's why we have developed and adopted a new strategy. While using the offset model, we need to focus and make more of an investment in technology and dedicate resources to certain areas, rather than making investments in all sectors. We need to screen which areas to make investments in and energize all the country's capacities. We still use the offset model today, since it is a tool of defense buying. In 2004 the local industry volume met 25% of the Turkish armed forces' needs. In 2012, it's around 52%, and this is because we have developed better technology and more volume.</p><h4>How has the SSM moved to enhance agreements since then with regards to technology?</h4><p>Technology is something that cannot be transferred. Offset agreements were used for production technology, but for real technology we have not used the offset model. Companies are not willing to give you technology through the offset mechanism. We have sought to encourage investment in R&amp;D by using domestic tools. Technology development depends on different elements. Human capital is significant, and universities are vital to the technological manufacturing process. SMEs are also important, as are R&amp;D centers. All of these elements need to be energized to create technology.</p><h4>The SSM is directly contributing to R&amp;D centers through the development of Technopark Istanbul. What will be its impact on the defense industry?</h4><p>The Technopark is directly linked to the SSM. The company was established in partnership with the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (İTO), and hopefully we will see the first phase of it open by the end of 2012. Murad Bayar, the Undersecretary for Defence Industries, and I are deeply involved in the process. Technopark Istanbul is being promoted through a roadshow, and we are seeing huge interest from defense industry companies to firms from other sectors. We want to apply a different model there, since the boards of İTO and the SSM are not keen on using Technopark Istanbul as a mere money-making scheme. We want to see real technology-intense companies working there, and we want to link them to industry.</p><h4>The integration of SMEs into the defense industry is an integral part of the SSM's 2012-2016 strategy. How will this be executed?</h4><p>It's not easy. We focus on SMEs because they represent a large portion of all business in Europe and everywhere else. Over the last 10 years, the defense industry has exhausted much of its energy on creating technology-intense main contractors. Now we realize that to develop a stronger defense industry we need layers. The US is a good example of a layered defense industry, which makes the industry more robust and sustainable. This is why, for a couple of years, we have been paying special attention to SMEs, not just as a strategy, but by contract we now require companies to give 30% of the work that is taken by the main contractor through the contract from the SSM to SMEs. This is why in the last couple of years the clustering of SMEs is growing, both in Ankara and Istanbul. SMEs are now the main focus of the SSM, both in manufacturing and technology capacities.</p><h4>The top five countries for defense manufacturing have stayed the same for years: the US, China, France, the UK, and Russia. How can Turkey take a share of the race for the $60-billion market?</h4><p>It is important to brand the country's products. “Made in Turkey" should be recognizable as a hallmark of quality, especially in the defense industry. Turkey's influence in the region and, in some cases, other parts of the world is growing. Influence creates opportunities to sell more. The defense sector is dominated by a few countries, so it's not easy. Two years ago, Turkey's exports totaled only a couple of million dollars, whereas today it is close to $1 billion. Our target for 2016 is $2 billion. Exporting is one of the most important tools for us to maintain sustained growth in the industry.</p><h4>How integral is Turkey's relationship with NATO to the SSM's growth strategy for the defense industry?</h4><p>Turkey has always been a good partner in NATO through its military forces; however, NATO has a commercial side as well. NATO's programs offer good opportunities for growth and exports. This is why, for the past couple of years, we have been paying special attention to NATO's programs, and we just opened a new office in Brussels. To promote exports we now have three offices, and the SSM has representatives there to ease communications. We have offices in Washington, D.C., Saudi Arabia, and now Brussels, to ease communications with NATO. We are also getting some results though NATO's programs. Turkey's share in defense has started to grow, but there's still more to be done.</p><h4>Are South America, Brazil, the US, and the Middle East your key markets for exports?</h4><p>These offices are not there to just promote exports, but to develop relations in the defense industry in order to better understand each other. Sometimes we get lost in the bureaucracy of the defense system in Western countries, so our aim is to better understand their systems. It's a government policy and we are trying to play our role within it, to support it in whatever way we can.</p><h4>What are the most important objectives of the SSM's 2012-2016 strategic plan?</h4><p>The idea of the new plan is to develop better technology and a better industry, as well as to layer the industry, develop better structures, and promote SMEs. It's a combined strategy to dive deep into the industry and grow technology. These are the two main pillars of our new strategy. We know that defense budgets all over the world are shrinking, but the only thing kept intact is the R&amp;D budget. You can cut anything, but can't touch the R&amp;D budget. If you touch the R&amp;D budget, you can't sustain the same capacity. In the defense industry Turkey is making an investment, both through human resources and also companies as well. This is why R&amp;D is critical. And our strategy is key for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which markets are the SSM and SSİ targeting for 2012-2013?<br></h4><p>Based on our export strategies and our strong relations, our main focus is on the Gulf region, Southeast Asia, the Caucasus, Africa, and South America. We continue to seek cooperation opportunities and encourage defense industry coordination activities in both Europe and the US, owing to the importance we attach to our strategic relationships. The SSM holds Defense Industry Days in collaboration with other countries. We believe that seeking codevelopment and comarketing opportunities is important. Turkey has adopted concrete strategies to promote Turkey's defense industries in the global marketplace, and now we are harvesting the fruits of our success. We aim to take our companies' efforts to a further level by pushing them to be more export oriented and competitive.<br></p><h4>Which Turkish defense products are most attractive for export?</h4><p>By looking at the exports Turkey has realized over the last few years in the global defense market, we observe that Turkish companies are highly competitive. We excel in the production of armored vehicles, naval shipbuilding, electronic systems such as Combat Management, avionics, software-defined radios, command and control systems, simulators, military clothing, and gear and logistics, owing to the considerable investments made in these areas that support indigenous defense capabilities.</p><h4>What is the strategy to double Turkey's defense exports by 2016?</h4><p>Turkey reached its 2011 export target with almost $1 billion worth of defense and aviation exports, and we aim to double this figure. The new strategic plan of the SSM for the years 2012-2016 sets ambitious targets in terms of exports. We aim to export $2 billion worth of defense products by 2016, and our defense export strategy has been shaped around this target. We have started different initiatives, such as the project partnership model, which aims to involve our interested partners in some of our defense procurement programs at different levels. With this method, we believe that we can offer the best-value solutions to our partners, which results in success in global markets and builds relationships based on mutual trust. We promote activities such as industry days with foreign governments (including the UK, Italy, Norway, and Finland), where both government and industry come together to seek opportunities for cooperation. Joint R&amp;D and technology development is also important in terms of gaining a competitive advantage. Furthermore, we encourage our companies to make new investments and establish joint ventures in our priority regions. The SSİ aims to solidify bilateral relations through memorandums of understanding (MoUs) and framework agreements that define the focus areas and avoid duplication.</p><h4>How does the SSİ contribute to the defense industry?</h4><p>The SSİ participates in defense industry exhibitions at a national level, promoting our companies through various methods. For example, we are working on establishing a Turkish Foreign Defense Sales system, which is similar to the Foreign Military Sales mechanism in the US, which we believe will help increase exports to certain regions. We have started to work on an export credit mechanism that can offer affordable financial solutions to countries interested in our products and systems. These incentives are also considered beneficial to encourage our defense companies, especially SMEs, to compete in the global marketplace. Furthermore, through our export portal, we share our strategies and capabilities with our partners. This keeps the industry up to date with our plans. Government-to-government dialogue and continued relations based on best value are of importance because they create a basis for solid cooperation. To achieve this, we coordinate and organize mutual high-level visits.</p><h4>What are the key functions of the SSİ?</h4><p>The SSİ is aimed at helping our defense companies increase their exports by combining our efforts to compete in the global marketplace. We have created a forum in order to be able to cope with potential challenges and provide vital information. The SSİ's key tasks are to restructure our defense companies in a way that makes them more export oriented, promote their capabilities in global markets, outline feasible methods and strategies, and increase the overall defense export capacity accordingly. It is not wrong to say that the SSM's international cooperation activities and defense export strategies will have a complementary effect on the SSİ's tasks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you rate Turkey in terms of local production?<br></h4><p>In terms of health care, Turkey ranks between 10th and 14th worldwide, so it's a big market, especially in interventional cardiology—yet there is no local production. Heart attacks are the number one cause of death globally, the second being cancer—heart attacks cause almost 35% of the world's total deaths, but there is very much we can do. There is a trend on the horizon; no one wants open-heart surgery anymore. The most common treatment of cardio problems used to be bypass surgery. When interventional cardiology became popular in the last 10 years, there was a dramatic drop in the number of operations. Technology to travel inside the body without the need for invasive surgery would be revolutionary. That's what we started to work on. We are developing all of the interventional cardiology practices, and we are expanding our portfolio by treating brain diseases without opening the skull. We can mend aneurisms or tumors without open surgery. We are also innovating drug and device combinations, where you put a drug into a device that takes the drug directly to the affected area internally, instead of directly injecting it into the body. This is very important in oncology, for example, where it is common practice to deliver chemotherapeutic agents that travel around the body. However, cancer products are toxic, designed to kill cells in the body. If you administer them systematically, there are very severe side effects. Due to these side effects, you can lose the patient while trying to treat the cancer. We are working on delivering chemotherapeutic drugs directly to the location of the tumor.</p><h4>How much does Alvimedica invest in R&amp;D?</h4><p>R&amp;D is the most important factor for us. Considering that any given company's current product portfolio will disappear in five years time, we are investing a lot in R&amp;D. We have an R&amp;D center next to our factory in Istanbul, and we have also launched a new R&amp;D center in the Netherlands—a significant investment from our side. We have 25 engineers working there. The number one company in medical devices in the world is Cordis, a branch of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Cordis was also based in the Netherlands, but in 2008 it transferred all of its production facilities to Mexico and San Francisco. When we arrived, we hired the experienced engineers still living in the area who knew a lot about catheters and stents. That presented us with a significant amount of power to jump into the market with new products. We have around 30 new products, and almost 12 of them are under Turkey's control. In January, we opened a new R&amp;D facility in Palo Alto, California, just next to Stanford University. We are developing new products with Stanford's electrical engineering department. We have invented a catheter with ultrasound technology on the very tip, which means we can take pictures of a patient's arteries. It's revolutionary. We hired around 15 engineers to work there under the supervision of a professor from Stanford. This project alone has needed investments of $5.2 million per year. Our investments in R&amp;D totaled $6.5 million in 2011. With new projects on the horizon, we are expecting to double it in 2012.</p><h4>What is Turkey's significance to Alvimedica?</h4><p>The founding members of Alvimedica were investors of Turkish descent living in Scandinavia. They gathered a fund in order to invest in health care in Turkey, and wanted to start a hospital chain. I suggested that investing in a hospital was not a wise decision, as most of the investment groups had already secured their positions in the market. Instead, I proposed medical devices—my idea was interventional cardiology. After the initial brainstorming, we moved our operations to Turkey.</p><h4>What are your main and developing markets?</h4><p>We sell products to 42 countries. We have established ourselves as a marketing company in Shanghai, and in the coming months our country manager will start there. In India, we have taken a very significant market share. We are present in most of the Asian countries. There are 1.7 billion people living in Asia, and only 10% have healthcare coverage. China exports a lot of medical equipment, but it continues to import medical devices. There is huge potential there. Interventional cardiology is increasing 10% every year. Our goal is to be in the top five companies in the world, and we are moving toward this goal as Cordis has stepped out of the stents business. Its two blockbuster projects were rejected by the FDA once it moved to the US, so it decided to leave the industry. We have expanded geographically. We will be selling products to 75 countries by the end of 2012. We are present in all of the South American markets, claiming significant market shares. One-third of our sales are domestic, and in Turkey our market share is almost 70%.</p><h4>What is the nature of the relationships you have formed with academic institutions?</h4><p>Each project is different, and partnerships also differ. With Stanford, it had its technology patented but not commercialized. We launched an R&amp;D center, hired local engineers, and made an agreement with its professors. Now we are working together to develop new products. At Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, we are developing a new product that was the university's idea, but that it couldn't develop alone. We are developing a stent that will be coated with stem cells so we can rebuild parts of the body by using a person's own cells. With different university and opinion leaders, we are working on different collaborations.</p><h4>How do you assess the value of Turkey's free trade zones in terms of science technology?</h4><p>The free zones are about to close down. The EU does not want free-zone incentives, so many of the free zones are about to close down and the incentives we had have been cancelled. We have been arguing with the Turkish government for the past year in order to get permission to build specialized industrial zones, and give special incentives to these zones. One of the zones would be a “biozone," which we are trying to establish in Çatalca near Istanbul. In Ireland and Singapore, they operate industrial zones where only pharmaceutical and medical device companies can conduct activities, such as product registration and sterilization. They accumulate healthcare or bio-based companies in one zone and give them special incentives, such as free land or tax exemptions. Then, those companies can work on R&amp;D together. If we did this, we could associate our R&amp;D centers with Istanbul Technical University or the medical faculties of other universities. This accumulation of knowledge would help us develop new products. This growth and cooperation was demonstrated by the recent growth in Boston, prompted by Harvard University and MIT. The engineers from MIT talked to doctors from Harvard, developed a product, and then tested it on patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. Almost instantly, new products began entering the market. This was the basis of how Boston became a hotspot for health care. By April or May 2012, we are hoping to mimic this success. We will announce the development of our bio-city zone in Çatalca. We will do various roadshows to entice other companies to build their production facilities in this area. Multinational companies will also bring expatriate families to the area, and they will want high-quality living quarters and schools to for children. There will be an industrial part, but we are also building an environment. We are leading initiatives to develop new residential areas and an international school.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent have the companies of the Turkish Armed Forces Foundation (TAFF) achieved their goal of competing in the world defense market to decrease the reliance on imports?<br></h4><p>In 2003, 25% of the Turkish Armed Forces' modernization needs were met through domestic production. In 2010, that figure stood at 52%. In 2010, 56% of the defense sector's $2.7 billion revenues was made up of the turnover of TAFF subsidiaries. This shows the importance that TAFF subsidiaries play in reducing Turkey's dependence on foreign imports. TAFF subsidiaries play a major role in the development of the Turkish defense industry with their unique designs of both main platforms and subsystems, and also through their cooperation with leading international defense firms in third-party countries. TAFF subsidiaries spend greatly on R&amp;D as part of their ongoing work in developing national projects. While the success with which TAFF subsidiaries have developed products and systems has played a great role in increasing the competitive power of TAFF subsidiaries on the international market, our emphasis on international cooperation has solidified our place on the international stage.<br></p><h4>How does TAFF effectively guide its subsidiaries and affiliates in meeting domestic demand?</h4><p>The TAFF 2012-2016 Strategic Plan aims to facilitate the forming of strategic partnerships and the development of critical technologies between TAFF subsidiaries, enable TAFF subsidiaries' subcontractors to become certified subcontractors, enable major international defense companies to become certified subcontractors to TAFF subsidiaries, and allow TAFF subsidiaries to become certified subcontractors to major international defense companies while expanding their technology base. To avoid any problems in the acquisition of foreign subsystems and components that will go to ensuring cost effectiveness and creating the necessary technologies for product development, we aim to support certified subcontractors to help aid the development of domestic resources so as to create local industrial alternatives, and, from the contract preparation phase onward, to aid strategic cooperation.</p><p>We are also helping certified subcontractors work with major international defense firms as they enter third-party countries, reducing costs to improve competitiveness, and contributing to sustainable profits. We also help major international defense firms become certified subcontractors to TAFF subsidiaries. TAFF focuses on developing cooperation and partnerships with universities so as to create new R&amp;D projects or complete existing R&amp;D projects that go toward developing critical national technologies. TAFF allocates 65% of its 80% profit share to armed forces projects. Between 2005 and 2011, a total of TL213 million was generated by TAFF.</p><h4>What portion of revenue from TAFF's subsidiaries is derived from international contracts and tenders?</h4><p>TAFF subsidiaries made up 61% of 2010 sectorial exports, and that figure increased by 55% to reach $602 million in 2011. The share of exports as a percentage of total turnover has continued to increase, reaching 35% by the end of 2011. The level of international competitiveness that TAFF subsidiaries have achieved is well demonstrated by projects that TAFF subsidiaries have competed for and won against international firms, such as STAMP, used on Dutch KMS sea platforms, numbered wireless sales to Pakistan and the US, a CN-235 simulator to South Korea, the Pakistan EHTES and South Korea EHES, F-16 modernization for Jordan and Pakistan, A-350XWB design, a multiple rocket launcher (MRL) system for the UAE, 122 and 300 mm rockets, and the T-122/300 weapons system to launch those rockets for Azerbaijan's border guard services, and more.</p><h4>What is your outlook and goal for TAFF, its companies, and the Turkish defense industry over the next five years?</h4><p>TAFF's vision is to be a group that plays an active role in the development of the domestic defense industry through the companies that it's a shareholder in, to play an effective role in increasing the share of local producers, to develop unique and original designs, and to compete successfully in international markets. Our mission is to create and develop defense companies that will contribute to increasing and developing the Turkish Armed Forces' overall fighting power. According to the TAFF 2012-2016 Strategic Plan, by the year 2016, TAFF subsidiaries will have achieved a total turnover of $31 billion, total sales of $4 billion, and 25% of sales from exports, thereby maintaining its domestic market share and expanding its international market share. In the same plan, we aim for the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce's annual list of top 500 companies based on production and sales volume to include ASELSAN and TUSAÅž in the top 25 of the list, and HAVELSAN and Roketsan in the top 100. We are also aiming for ASELSAN to be ranked 50th  in the world's top 100 defense industry companies and for TUSAÅž to be in the top 100.</p><h4>What is the significance of the International Defense Industry Fair (IDEF) to Turkey's defense industry?</h4><p>The IDEF has been organized under the auspices and support of the Turkish Ministry of National Defense since 1993, and it is under the management and responsibility of TAFF, with the aim of promoting cooperation and friendship between participating nations and their defense industries. In 2011, the IDEF has become the biggest defense fair in the region and one of the five biggest defense fairs in the world, with an ever-expanding list of participating countries, delegations, and companies. The 10th IDEF, which was held on May 10-13, 2011, featured 633 companies from 46 countries and 437 delegations from 70 countries. The fair was visited by a total of 52,502 visitors. One of the most beautiful cities in the world and a meeting point of civilizations, Istanbul will host IDEF 2013 on May 7-10, 2013, when it will be expecting an even greater number of participating countries, delegations, and firms, as it continues to contribute to developing trade, business, social, and cultural cooperation between those countries, delegations, and firms. The IDEF 2013 will feature the static display of land, sea, and air systems and vehicles, as well as extensive participation from local and foreign naval forces in Büyükçekmece Bay. We will take great honor in welcoming with traditional Turkish hospitality the leading authorities in the respective countries' defense procurement posts and the various leading professionals in the international defense industry, and of course all visitors, to what is our region's largest international marketing platform.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed since privatization in 2005?<br></h4><p>When Türk Telekom was privatized at the end of 2005, its main business was fixed line, and it had a 40% share in the smallest mobile operator in the market. Putting forward a convergence strategy and taking the necessary steps transformed Türk Telekom into the group of companies it is today. This transformation spanned from revisions to its business model, and the repositioning of its products and services utilizing a customer-focused approach, to human resources investments—accelerated in parallel with technology and infrastructure upgrades—and an international growth route supported by its group structure abroad. Türk Telekom offers not only landline, but also data and internet, as well as value-added services. The innovative technologies and services that complement fixed line and internet are developed by Türk Telekom and its subsidiaries, which are technology companies acquired with a convergent technology focus. Türk Telekom is well positioned to sustain this momentum and continue to build on its recent growth in 2011. We will continue to improve our services to the market, capitalizing on our advanced distribution channels, strong brand name, converged products, teamwork, and synergies. As a sign of customers' perception of all these products and services, Türk Telekom was ranked Turkey's most valuable brand by the international brand valuation consultancy, Brand Finance, in 2009, 2010, and 2011.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the Turkish ICT sector and how is Türk Telekom capitalizing on them?</h4><p>We see the future in convergence technologies that facilitate people's lives, support social developments, and make contributions to the quality of life. This is also the fundamental reason to concentrate on convergence technologies and undertake leadership in this field. With convergence in mind, we are focusing on various communications services like voice, data, and video transmissions via a single platform and are providing fully integrated products and services that offer value to our customers. Convergence not only means a converged network for fixed and mobile, but it is also about the convergence of services such as education and entertainment. We aim to offer value-added products and services for everyone in the most advantageous and affordable ways, and we think this is the main challenge for the telecommunications sector. In addition, content and value-added services are the other engines affecting broadband growth. In this regard, we set our plan for convergence two years ago and positioned it as the central theme of our investments.</p><h4>What role will Türk Telekom play in achieving the government's 2023 vision for broadband internet penetration?</h4><p>Turkey's unique geographic location allows us to cover a vast area from Europe to the Middle East, and become a bridge and communications center. In 2010, we began to take advantage this opportunity with the acquisition of Pantel, one of the foremost independent wholesale data and capacity providers in Central and Southeastern Europe with its 27,000 kilometer-long fiber-optic network. Yet another important development for Türk Telekom and the country's telecommunications sector was the realization of the JADI LINK project, which aimed to establish a colossal integrated multi-pass, fiber-optic network encompassing the Middle East, Southern Europe, and the Far East. I firmly believe that Türk Telekom will become a much more active international player by 2023. Turkey is expected to continue with this success story by maintaining sustainable growth. The ICT sector will be one of the main driving forces behind this growth. We believe that telecommunications infrastructure and information technology are critical elements for Turkey's competitiveness.</p><h4>What portion of Türk Telekom's budget is spent on R&amp;D, and what is the scale of its research activities?</h4><p>R&amp;D is one of the most important growth centers in our transformation process. We not only need R&amp;D in order to be in a position to follow technology trends, but also to lead it. In line with our vision to export Turkish technology all over the world, we attribute great importance to our R&amp;D activities. We are undertaking our R&amp;D efforts both through Türk Telekom and our group companies, such as Argela, İnnova, Sebit, and Sobee. These group companies play a pivotal role in the development of Türk Telekom's technological power and the export of convergence technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[up-to-the-challenge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Avea fit into the rapidly growing ICT market in Turkey?<br></h4><p>Avea is a young operator that is rapidly changing the Turkish market. Since we entered the market in 2004, we have brought dynamism to the sector, assuming the position of a challenger. The mobile market has enjoyed average growth of 12% annually over the last five years. By the end of 2011, Avea's revenues exceeded TL3 billion ($1.8 billion). Mobile technology constitutes an important share of ICT in Turkey, and GSM-based technology will continue to foster economic activity in the infrastructure segment. Avea invested TL799 million in infrastructure over 2011, and in the coming years, the value-added of widespread mobile application technology will increase.</p><h4>How has Avea become a leading figure in the GSM market?</h4><p>We prioritize network quality and focus on our sales channel. We have increased our 2G and 3G base stations in Turkey by 50% over the last 1.5 years. In sales, we have increased our footprint regarding the number of exclusive and non-exclusive sales points. We completely redesigned our stores, and we aim to raise customer satisfaction to the highest level in the sector. Every GSM user has benefited from the competition we present, as it forced the industry to provide better and more economic services. Our excellent team and our focus on innovation have helped us achieve and sustain this dynamism, and we will continue to invest in our strengths as a company.</p><h4>What impact will the mutual understanding reached by Turkcell, Vodafone, and Avea to reach 2,128 villages in rural Turkey have on your company's operations?</h4><p>This is a government-funded project with the objective of providing wireless communication services to remote areas with less than 500 inhabitants. Each major mobile operator will provide infrastructure for approximately one-third of the locations. All operators will have to provide roaming in their respective parts. Mobile services coverage will be expanded to these less-populated areas in a way that will enable operators to use their resources more economically. We are proud to be able to cooperate and bring services to these areas. Furthermore, we believe that this project is a crucial step in Turkey's 2023 vision. By cooperating with our counterparts, mobile technologies in Turkey will become ubiquitous, and we will provide important value-added products and services.</p><h4>To what extent has Avea's R&amp;D center become the preeminent technology base of the telecommunications sector in Turkey?</h4><p>We have reached the highest levels of R&amp;D investment in proportion to our revenues. Avea is the only operator in Turkey with an R&amp;D certificate, and we have opened the doors of our incubation center, “AveaLabs." The spirit of innovation differentiates us tremendously in this market. In 2011, we invested TL33 million in R&amp;D, and this substantial investment has started to bear fruit. Apart from leading the NFC initiative in Turkey, Avea began the “Smart Municipality" program by partnering with the Eyüp Municipality. Furthermore, we launched the “Augmented Reality Project" in cooperation with Rixos Hotels, which is a first in the world tourism sector. We also cooperate with universities. For example, we are collaborating with Galatasaray University on our “Mobile Health Project," and we have initiated a variety of projects in collaboration with UCLA, Boğaziçi University, and Sabancı University, among other academic institutions, as well as other smart projects in the health and logistics sectors.</p><h4>What is the potential for foreign investment in Turkey's ICT sector?</h4><p>Over the past decade, Turkey's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) has been a remarkable 10.7% of GDP growth annually. Over the same period, the ICT sector grew by 9.6%. With the increasing government focus on the industry, we believe that ICT growth levels will surpass overall economic growth. Turkey has a young and dynamic demographic, with flexible human resources that will meet the demand for increasing and changing skills. On the consumer side, Turkey is registering high growth levels for broadband and mobile usage, and this demand is expected to grow. In fact, foreign investors already have substantial equity in Turkey's larger companies. Additionally, global telecommunications companies such as AT&amp;T, BT, Telecom Italia, and T-Mobile continue operating in electronic communications via companies founded in Turkey. Thus, there are favorable indications for ICT investment in Turkey. The sector's growth, combined with favorable demographics and a dynamic Turkish economy, will continue to encourage both domestic and foreign investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Getting Down]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[getting-down]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the benefits of operating across all sections of Turkey's energy industry?</h4><p>BP has been in Turkey for 100 years, contributing to Turkey's economy, employment, and energy sector with billions of dollars of investment. This makes it one of Turkey's oldest and largest foreign investors. Having an integrated business, from upstream and midstream to downstream, puts us in an excellent position for future growth and continuing investment. Turkey is the main export route for oil and gas from Azerbaijan, which puts the country into a key position geopolitically. BP is proud to be the largest investor and operating shareholder in these important projects. We are committed to Turkey, and our investments will continue to grow in the future.</p><h4>What is BP Turkey's growth strategy for the country?</h4><p>On the upstream side, we plan to make significant investments in the future on our Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan. We recently announced that Shah Deniz II has entered into the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) stage. The entry into FEED represents the start of a key phase in the project during which engineering studies will be refined, further wells will be drilled, commercial agreements will be finalized, and key construction contracts will commence. What this means for our business in Turkey is that we will make key decisions on how to transport the gas through Turkey onto customers in Europe. On the downstream side, our fuels business in Turkey is growing and expanding into more cities. We expect to open another 30 to 35 stations this year. Our lubricants business is growing as well, and solidifying its market share with new products and strategies.</p><h4>A significant challenge in Turkey's downstream sector is the illegal usage of base oils as motor fuels. What steps is BP taking to address this, and how is the government monitoring the situation?</h4><p>Firstly, we would like to thank the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources as well as the Ministry of Finance and other relevant government institutions for the tax amendment by the Ministry of Finance in 2011, which was an important step in solving the Base Oil 10 issue. In addition to this important step already taken by the government, we feel that this needs to be accompanied by regular inspections and tax audits for a complete solution of the problem. Alternatively, the government can issue refunds on the special consumption tax, rather than the current tax deferral and exemption method. BP has prepared a report on the Base Oil 10 problem, with the objective to assess the current situation, and put forth recommendations for solutions. In this report, we have worked with PetDer, TÜBİTAK, the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ), and Istanbul Technical University (İTÜ). The report also includes data from studies conducted by BP's Global Fuels Technology Center in Bochum, Germany. These valuable institutions have provided us with laboratory testing and research data. We have shared this report with the government as well as the public.</p><h4>Turkey is a minor producer and a transit country. What is your vision for Turkey emerging as the region's energy hub?</h4><p>Turkey is a key country for the transportation of gas and oil from producing countries in the East to the markets in the West. The first example of Turkey becoming an “energy corridor" is the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, where BP is the largest shareholder as well as the operator. This is the primary export route for Azerbaijan's oil from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) field as well as condensate from the Shah Deniz gas field.</p><p>The Ceyhan area has been declared an Energy Specialization Area by the government, which means that the government will provide incentives for companies that wish to take part in energy investments, such as a refining, for example, in this area. Strategies like these will allow Turkey to reap the benefits of being an energy corridor. We see pipeline investments continuing, as gas from the Shah Deniz field, now in its second phase of development, will transit through Turkey to supply European markets.</p><h4>To what extent does BP invest in supply and logistics in Turkey?</h4><p>BP has continuing investments in this area, including fuel terminals throughout the country, as well as a very modern and safe road transport operation. On the natural gas side, Turkey needs further investment in areas such as gas storage. I think that this is clearly an area that foreign investors would be interested in.</p><h4>What portion of BP's Turkish activities can be attributed to downstream?</h4><p>BP has had a large-scale downstream business in Turkey for many decades. We are celebrating the 100th year of our operations in Turkey in 2012. Our fuels business supplies advanced fuels to over 620 stations throughout the country. Our lubricants business, including the Castrol brand, is number one in market share in the automotive segment, and number two overall. The Gemlik lubricants plant is an important investment for us. Products from this plant are exported to other countries as well. Turkey is a regional headquarters for Air BP, which supplies aircraft at four major airports in the country, and many more in the region. Our Auto LPG business is healthy and outpacing market growth. We are committed to growth in the downstream, and our significant investments will continue. One of the things I am most proud of is our sponsorship of the Turkish National Olympic and National Paralympic teams, as part of our 100th year in Turkey. We are supporting Turkish athletes as they strive for success at the London 2012 Olympic Games and beyond.</p><h4>How integral is the long-awaited Nabucco project and the BTC pipeline to BP's operations in Turkey?</h4><p>The BTC pipeline is currently BP's largest investment in Turkey, and is also strategically important for BP at a global level. We have transported over 1.5 billion barrels of oil since the BTC pipeline started operations in 2006. It is the main export route for Azerbaijani oil.</p><h4>Modern techniques designed to unlock tightly held hydrocarbons, such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracturing, have yet to be employed in Turkey. Do E&amp;P activities feature in BP Turkey's plans?</h4><p>In Turkey, we explored the Eastern Black Sea in 2005-2006, as a partner of TPAO, the national oil and gas company. Since then, we have not had any active plans for exploration in Turkey.</p><p>However, we continuously evaluate opportunities worldwide, and if there is an area of interest, we would be pleased to partner with TPAO once again on further exploration.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Turkey's energy industry in the medium term?</h4><p>As a growing country, Turkey needs continuing investment in the energy industry overall. This includes areas such as power generation, LNG, gas storage, and exploration. It is a very dynamic sector, and we expect it will continue to grow, to be able to fuel the needs of a large and growing economy. As one of Turkey's first foreign investors, and one of the largest, we are very pleased to see the continuing growth of the economy. We have been here for 100 years, and are committed to further investment in Turkey's economy and energy sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-bridging-role]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey is the second fastest growing economy in the world, second only to China. Figures from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) also reveal that Turkey is the second largest market in Europe after Germany. With a population of 73 million and a strong demographic of young, technologically minded, and increasingly well-educated people, the door for further growth remains wide open. Although affected negatively in 2009 by the global economic downturn, Turkey recovered quickly and enjoyed GDP growth of 8.9% in 2010, then in 2011 became one of the top-10 fastest growing countries, confirming Turkey's strategic importance. Such growth has a parallel impact on major industries, such as energy and oil and gas. As an emerging electricity and gas market for Europe, and with a geostrategic position on two continents, Turkey is high on all significant agendas in terms of future energy needs.<br></p><h4>Energy Diversification</h4><p>Today, energy diversification and supply security are among the most important issues that continental Europe faces. With its bridging role between energy-rich areas and a continent that demands energy, Turkey will play an increasingly important role in energy supply. Projects that can contribute and secure energy diversification will provide more value than ever. Pipeline projects that can extend energy supply to demanding markets need to be supported in every aspect.</p><h4>End-To-End Supply</h4><p>In Turkey, we have further strengthened our position through the ownership of 97% of Petrol Ofisi shares, which is Turkey's leading company in the retail and commercial business. The company has been rebranded as OMV Petrol Ofisi. Supporting the energy market in Turkey with its various investments and initiatives, OMV Petrol Ofisi aims to be a good partner for the environment and leverage the development of the market. In addition, the company will focus on providing energy-efficient products to its customers, ensuring that customer satisfaction comes first. The company will make investments that aim to meet Turkey's energy needs and targets.</p><h4>Gas-Fired Power Plants</h4><p>In the coming years, OMV will remain focused on its goal of being an integrated, international company in oil and gas, with clearly improved profitability and strong growth in the upstream sector. The business of exploration and production (E&amp;P) will assume a far more significant role. OMV will also experience strong growth in the gas sector, from production and transport to the marketing of gas. In Europe and Turkey, the gas business in particular will continue to experience strong growth. In contrast to the world market for oil production, gas needs regional integration from the field to the market through various logistic networks. OMV will expand its position along the entire gas value chain. Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and will be the most significant energy source of the future. Besides the current gas pipeline projects, we will complete our portfolio with modern, gas-fired power plants. These plants will add a highly interesting outlet for our equity in gas and will complement our sales and trading business. The advantage of combined-cycle power plants is that they can be turned on and off on demand, providing a balance to market need and continuity. They also have the lowest CO2 emissions of all fossil fuel plants.</p><h4>A Strategic OMV Hub</h4><p>The acquisition of a majority stake in Petrol Ofisi in 2010 significantly strengthened OMV's position in the Turkish market and supported OMV's strategy of further enhancing its leading position in the European growth belt. OMV has a strong footprint in the attractive markets of Central and Southeastern Europe. With this transaction, OMV added a leading position in the important Turkish market, where we will further develop and roll out a successful, integrated business model. Petrol Ofisi is a further step in OMV's growth strategy and aims at positioning Turkey as a third hub, in addition to Austria and Romania. OMV will seek to leverage Petrol Ofisi's position to the benefit of all its business units.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[closing-the-generation-gap]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Turkey's electricity generating capacity evolved since the restructuring process in 1994?<br></h4><p>In addition to key legislative changes, Turkey installed several thermal, hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, and biomass power plants between 1994 and 2011. Installed capacity has increased by about 154% since 1994. While electricity generation was 78,321 MW in 1994, and we generated 228,431 MW by the end of 2011.</p><h4>How is EÜAÅž planning to meet demand through domestic production?</h4><p>EÜAÅž rehabilitates every existing power plant periodically after considering the technological developments in the energy sector. Furthermore, operations aimed at increasing our installed capacity are in progress, especially in terms of thermal power plants.</p><h4>How important is renewable energy to Turkey's long-term power needs?</h4><p>The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources is carrying out the required studies in order to use the crucial potential of our resources in electricity generation according to a schedule. Turkey needs to take many steps to comply with the global renewable energy vision and to move into a future where the need for energy is met by renewable resources. These steps will increase financial competitive power and secure the simultaneous growth of renewable energy resources, as well as facilitate administrative processes to connect the resources to the grid and eliminate barriers. The main objective regarding renewable energy resources is to increase the share of these resources in electricity generation to at least 30% by 2023.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for international investment in Turkey's electricity sector?</h4><p>According to the projections of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Turkey's energy need increases by 6%-8% annually. The demand for electricity by 2020 is estimated to reach 500 billion kWh, which requires a new power plant of 3,000 MW to 4,000 MW every year for electricity generation and an investment of about $5 billion. The investment required to meet this demand is estimated to be $130 billion. Turkey is projected to have an electricity generation market worth $35 billion, an oil market of $40 billion, and a natural gas market of $10 billion.</p><h4>What is the anticipated impact from the privatization of Turkey's electricity sector?</h4><p>The privatization of the electricity market has been introduced to create a competitive market, increase the efficiency in electricity generation and distribution sectors, promote the investments required for long-term supply security, and reduce the role of public companies in the market.</p><h4>What role will EÜAÅž play in Turkey's nuclear power ambitions? What will be the impact of EÜAÅž's memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Canadian company Candu Energy?</h4><p>According to the legislation regarding nuclear energy generation plants, our company will acquire licenses and permissions for a construction site, as well as carry out construction and operations. EÜAÅž will also make regional and/or bilateral international agreements regarding nuclear plant construction and operation with the countries from which the fuel and technology will be transferred. Moreover, the company will take steps to renew these agreements and carry out the tasks described in the agreements. Negotiations with other potential countries to construct a second nuclear power plant at the Sinop site have been going on since 2010. The Sinop project is being considered as an infrastructure development project. EÜAÅž, as a public utility, is expected to be a major shareholder of the project and will be responsible for the operation of the plant. Therefore, we participate in the negotiations and pre-feasibility studies with nominated countries and companies. In this regard, EÜAÅž has signed a cooperation framework agreement with Candu Energy for the purpose of constructing, operating and decommissioning nuclear power plants at the Sinop site. According to the agreement, EÜAÅž and Candu Energy will perform a feasibility study, which will include items such as site development, the legal and regulatory framework, financing, human resources development, Enhanced Candu-6 Technology, and nuclear waste management. The parties are then expected to sign an intergovernmental agreement for the realization of the project, according to the results of the feasibility study.</p><h4>To what extent is there potential for investment in electricity distribution in Turkey?</h4><p>Distribution investments are required in parallel with the rapidly increasing generation investments. Regional distribution companies generally carry out investments, which must be realized rapidly as a result of the developments in the renewable energy sector.</p><h4>What is your outlook for energy production and distribution in Turkey in the medium term?</h4><p>The necessary work is being carried out to build power plants that make use of domestic natural, renewable, and nuclear resources to satisfy the country's demand. Commissioning these power plants and solving the issues concerning the national grid is our first priority.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What experience does Baycan have in Turkey's mining sector in terms of working with local and international companies?<br></h4><p>Of our portfolio, 80% of our clients are dedicated to mining law, and that includes both foreign and local mining companies. In addition, companies that seek to invest in the mining sector request us to be their consultant. We operate on the basis of legal and investment consultancy services, which we provide with our best efforts. Baycan Law Office has operated in the mining sector since 2004. We represent companies in different areas of mining, including coal, gold, silver, and copper. Recently, we have begun offering consultancy services regarding oil and gas opportunities. We provide legal assistance from the exploration license stage, to the operation and development stages, as well as during and after production. We help our clients as they establish a company in Turkey, advising each on issues of labor and construction laws and investment requirements such as finding a local partner. We encourage partnerships, as they have strategic importance for Turkey and foster effective operations and local investment. Working with a strategic local partner is not compulsory, but it speeds up the process of familiarization with the country. Baycan Law Firm has witnessed many positive results from these partnerships, and local knowledge also helps companies maintain close relationships.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the new mining regulations on investment activity in Turkey?</h4><p>The mining regulations have been changed to provide a better investment environment for companies in the mining business. The amendments and new regulations have changed the atmosphere and opened up the pathways to investment for mining companies that utilize know-how and financial resources. This type of regulation attracts foreign investors to Turkey and creates a fair business atmosphere. Our country's positive approach to FDI has created incentives for investors and is very helpful for the industry.</p><h4>How would you characterize the joint-venture trend in the mining sector?</h4><p>There are several types of joint-venture trends in the sector. To achieve the best results, I suggest that a joint venture is formed between a foreign company with a good level of know-how and solid financial resources and a domestic company that has strategic value and an interest and focus in the local mining business. These joint ventures create value-added, and will almost certainly lead to the most positive solution. The foreign company creates value by saving financial and logistic sources with the help of local partner. The local company creates value by receiving mining sector-related knowledge and technology through the foreign partner, and thus both parties create value-added through a joint-venture project.</p><h4>What are the major challenges facing international firms that seek to invest in the local mining sector, and how can they be overcome?</h4><p>International investors face the same challenges in Turkey that can be encountered throughout the world: a new country with different values, a set of regulations, and a variety of people. Investors need time to understand the existing investment atmosphere of the new country. Time is one of the most important aspects in business, as spending resources means spending money. However, this is not a very difficult obstacle to overcome. The importance of a local partner in a new location helps companies to understand the target country of the project, saves time, and allows enterprises to focus on business. This positively influences how the local people and government in the country approach an investor.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the mining and energy sector in Turkey in the medium term?</h4><p>Considering the results of production and investment scales, it is clear that the Turkish mining sector is growing. The developments in the sector and the growing number of investments is encouraging. The existing approach and support for investment and industry regulations provides a healthy and transparent environment for business. Our Minister of Energy, Taner Yıldız, Mining Bureau Manager, Mehmet Hamdi Yıldırım, and the department managers of the Mining Bureau are always ready and reachable for any investor—foreign or local—to provide them with the most comfortable investment atmosphere. In the medium term, I expect more attention and investments from both local and foreign companies in addition to more partnerships that create employment, good incomes, and opportunities for the country and its people. Regarding energy, the sector is an important item on Turkey's agenda for the coming decade, and nuclear power plants may provide a solution for our energy resources. The construction of two is already planned, but this number may be increased a four, which would easily meet Turkey's energy demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your ministerial parameters have changed to include science and technology as well as industry. How will this affect the way policy is formed?<br></h4><p>Science and technology have become the most prominent factors determining the development level of societies and countries in today's world. With a view to adapt industry to ever-changing conditions and increase the competitive power of the country in the international marketplace, great importance must be given to R&amp;D activities. Countries that have succeeded in adapting themselves have achieved growth and progress, whereas those who failed to do so have fallen behind in this development race. In order to ensure the economic and social development of the country, science and technology must be our focus. Improvements in science and technology will positively influence all aspects of life, from education to health, energy to agriculture, and transportation to communications. A country such as Turkey must be able to produce the know-how and information it needs and transform that knowledge into a final product. It is for this reason that we adopted the same approach for scientific, industrial, and technological issues and have chosen to manage these areas through joint policies. Turkey does not have the luxury of offering affordable raw material, labor, or energy. Our competitive power lies in the introduction of new technology, R&amp;D activities, innovation, brand building, and design.</p><h4>What measures is the government taking to establish Turkey as a regional center for R&amp;D?</h4><p>The reorganization of the former Ministry of Trade and Industry as the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology clearly demonstrates the perspective of the Turkish government. We have drafted a National Innovation Strategy that is implemented within the scope of the Science and Advanced Technology Board. Similarly, the Industrial Strategy Document is a roadmap for transforming Turkey into an R&amp;D base. Out of 72 actions involved in the Industrial Strategy Document, 23 are directly related to technological developments. The Industrial Thesis and Techno-Entrepreneurship Capital Support Programs, as well as the establishment of R&amp;D centers and new techno-parks, are examples of our initiatives. The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB) and TÜBİTAK also offer special support programs for industrialists. Specific programs will be implemented in order to increase the efficiency and number of start-ups with a focus on R&amp;D activities. We are also planning to establish Computing Valley, to which we attach great importance. The Valley is aimed at creating great momentum in critical sectors such as software development, electronics, and computing. Turkey has tripled its R&amp;D expenditure and the number of full-time R&amp;D personnel in the last nine years, and the country has also increased its share of R&amp;D expenditures within the national income to approximately 1%. The National Innovation System Targets for 2023 outline our goal to boost this figure to 3%.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the success of Turkey's technoparks in science, industry, and technology?</h4><p>Technoparks are very important in terms of scientific and technological progress. The Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology attaches great importance to increasing the number of technoparks in the country and improving their quality. The technoparks contribute most to the establishment of cooperation between universities and industry; they are effective platforms for bridging the gap between academics and industrialists. The world's largest companies in computing continue to carry out their activities in technoparks, although they also own R&amp;D centers. There were only two technoparks in Turkey in 2002, whereas now there are 45 technoparks, 32 of which are operational, and include innovative companies working in the sectors of software development, computing, electronics, advanced materials, renewable energy, design, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and automotive. As a result of the R&amp;D activities of the companies in these areas, innovative and advanced technology products are available.</p><h4>How will the new incentive system encourage regional investments?</h4><p>Between August 2009 and January 2012, 10,723 incentive promotion documents were issued. The fixed investments amount to TL148 billion, TL46 billion of which were regional, TL36 billion large scale, and TL66 billion in general investments. As stipulated in the investment promotion documents, TL4 billion of these fixed investments was provided to the mining sector, TL79 billion to the manufacturing sector, TL31 billion to the energy sector, and TL34 billion to the services sector. In addition, net international investment entry from January 2011 to December 2011 was over $15.7 billion, with $3.3 billion allocated to the manufacturing sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[read-all-about-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major successes you have recorded since 2007?</h4><p>The Turkish machinery sector is one of the fastest growing in Turkey. In 2011 alone, total exports in this sector reached $11 billion. Turkey is the fifth biggest machinery producer in Europe. In 2023 the sector's total exports are projected to reach $100 billion, making it the single biggest prospective export sector in 2023. This institution was established to promote the Turkish machinery sector and to show off our quality, competitiveness, and dynamism. We are actively promoting the sector in various countries, especially at expos and trade fairs—from Germany to Brazil to China. We've been very successful so far. There was a serious economic crisis after 2007 with a major drop in investment, including in Turkey, but this country was a lot less affected than the rest of the world. In 2011 Turkey's machinery exports grew by 25%. That's a very high number, and our contribution has been enormous, although it's hard to quantify in real terms.</p><h4>Turkey's current account deficit is a noted concern, with increasing exports playing a key role in reducing the gap. To what extent will Turkish machinery exports help?</h4><p>We export a lot, but we also have to import to produce what we do. The government is now giving support to promote local R&amp;D efforts. Turkey, in five or six years, may actually solve its current account deficit problem. The solution for Turkey is to focus more on value-added products, and more technologically advanced and profitable products. As we don't have natural energy resources, we need to go in this direction.</p><h4>How has the eurozone crisis presented an opportunity for Turkish machinery production and exports?</h4><p>There are certain big advantages. First of all, labor costs are higher in Europe, and manufacturers have to produce more value-added products. There is a competitiveness problem at the mid-level technology range, which Turkish companies can fill. Compared with Chinese products, our quality is higher. Our prices are closer to Chinese goods, but our quality is closer to European goods. Turkey presents an important opportunity for European companies, with its young population. Europe can overcome many of its problems through a partnership with Turkey. I realize that there are some worries in Europe over Turkey potentially joining the EU, but Europe needs entrepreneurial new members, and Turks are very business minded. Turkey would bring a new level of dynamism to Europe. It would also bring youth and strength to Europe. In a decade, Turkey will be the second biggest machinery producer in Europe. Furthermore, Turkey is surrounded by energy-rich countries. It would be easier for European countries to enter those markets from Turkey. Currently, Turkey's share of the world machinery sector is still just 0.5%, but our aim is to increase this number to 3%. Germany has 14%, to give a comparison.</p><h4>How would you assess Turkey's human capital with regards to machinery production?</h4><p>A young workforce has obvious advantages for the whole economy. However, that population also has to be educated, and Turkey is focusing on this as well. In fact, training and education make up the biggest part of the government's budget. As education levels develop, the workforce will advance further. Machinery production requires well-qualified people. We too try and do what we can to support this.</p><h4>Which promotion campaigns for Turkish exports have been the most successful?</h4><p>We went to Barcelona with 150 companies and the city was covered with Turkish machinery advertisements. Generally, Turkey isn't known as an industrial country. People think of sun, sand, and textiles, and that's it. Yet Turkey has more industrial exports than Russia. It's hard to measure and change this perception, but we know that our campaigns have been successful and that has led to the desired results. We are currently targeting Germany the most, as it is both a big importer and exporter. It imports over $200 billion worth of machinery a year alone.</p><h4>How do you lobby for domestic marketing policies? Which aspects would you like to see changed?</h4><p>We lobby the government a lot. Thankfully, the machinery sector receives huge attention from the government. It has serious plans for the machinery sector, especially when it's seen as a possible solution to the current account deficit. We receive serious support for R&amp;D, and 2012 will be exceptional. The R&amp;D departments of companies in the sector are also growing significantly. I'm also a member of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), and there we are working hard to develop university and business interactions.</p><h4>What and where is the potential for foreign investment in production and import of Turkish machinery?</h4><p>The machinery sector supplies value-added to all sectors of the economy. With its development, other sectors also grow, including the automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and service sectors, and more. In that regard, there's a lot of potential. All those sectors rely on a strong machinery sector. Any kind of investment in any area is welcome, and potentially very profitable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Small Hands was founded in 1996 as a pre-school and kindergarten for children from two to six years old. What was your aim when founding the school?<br></h4><p>My daughter attended a nursery school in England, and when we returned to Turkey I was so disappointed with the system. The educational system in Turkey is teacher-centered. The teacher talks and, sometimes, if the children are lucky, they can participate. Therefore I opened a school for my needs as a mother, but soon other mothers insisted that I open other centers. Now there are three Small Hands campuses, two of them on the European side of Istanbul, one on the Asian side, plus our Utopya Primary School with a kindergarten also on the Asia side of the city.</p><h4>Can you tell us about Small Hands' nature concept?</h4><p>The new generation doesn't have a chance to experience nature, especially children that live in the city. I believe the school plays a big role in the children's lives. Children have emotional and personal needs as well as educational needs. As educators, our job should be to cover a child's educational as well as developmental needs. However, society has changed dramatically, especially with the development of technology. Modern families have started living differently; children are loved in their family, but are isolated because parents come home late or when they come home they are tired and unable to engage. A school cannot be an ordinary, traditional school anymore. We try to give them as many real experiences as possible, especially with nature, and encourage them to do everything using their five senses. We also encourage them to be more independent and autonomous so they can be self-confident in the future. We learned about the nature education system in 2010 and implemented it. We have the same system for each school, but since each child has individual needs, we have to introduce different techniques and policies.</p><h4>How revolutionary is this approach in Turkey?</h4><p>Skills for the 21st century need to be established in children's lives. They need to see what the big picture is, and what kind of future is waiting for them. We look at what children might need. According to research, the neuron connections in a  child's brain can be different depending on stimulation, real life experience, and the use of their five senses. Children need to be looked after, but they also need to have connections—everyone needs to network. The educational system in Turkey is related to the culture; teachers who are educated under the current dominant mentality are completely teacher centered. This affects education. Small Hands and Utopya are completely opposed to this.</p><h4></h4><h4>How challenging is it to recruit teachers that are qualified and have language skills in Istanbul?</h4><p>It is very difficult. We have American, Australian, English, German, Swiss, Danish, Japanese, Finnish, and Turkish staff. Our first criterion requires that our teachers enjoy working with children. The good thing about foreign teachers is that they don't do jobs that they don't like. Thereafter we look at their qualifications and their world view as we wish to employ those who have a big vision and see the big picture. We also need teachers that can build good relationships with the parents.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the congresses you organize?</h4><p>We love to share our knowledge and to learn about other people's ideas and that's the reason we hold conferences and congresses. To date, five international congresses have taken place, which have been organized by Small Hands and Utopya. The topic is always “High Quality Early Childhood and Primary Education" and additional subjects are included in the program, such as different educational systems from different countries, philosophizing with children, nature education, individualized learning and brain based education, bilingualism, foreign language learning from a very early age, teaching 21st century skills, and many more. The aim is to make people aware and improve children's education for the better. These congresses help teachers who have a vision and those who will also continue with their own research.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Defense companies like Airbus, Boeing, and Sikorsky came to Turkey and had offset obligations. Presently, there is no manufacturer that can produce a civilian aircraft from start to finish in Turkey, but we have relations with various companies and aircraft producers all over the world. SMEs and clusters are a very important part of our establishment in the defense and aerospace industry. SMEs are at the base of technology in Europe, and they are very synergetic. We also have a very strong technological base when compared to some other developing countries. This is our magic.</p><p>It is easy to find suppliers in Turkey, which is very important. In some countries, for example, it is difficult to find companies that produce in the aerospace or defense area. We have one cluster, in Izmir, one in Eskişehir, and another one in Ankara. SaSad has the objective to encourage clusters because when companies get together they become very strong. This is the reason Turkey is developing quickly in this area, based on the rich variety of its SMEs. Our main suppliers are also trying to help smaller companies gain this kind of capability and potentially supply them with resources, machines to manufacture, or engineering support.</p><h4>What sort of technical assistance does SaSaD provide?</h4><p>We have consultancy commissions within the SaSaD organization made up of all the members and engineers, and each committee consists of 40 people, with eight commissions. For example, we have an SME consultancy commission and a quality commission. These committees arrange training for SMEs. We supply direction to them and try to take their problems to the government or to our main suppliers and solve them. This is one of the most important types of support we give.</p><h4>What role does SaSaD play in assisting foreign investment in Turkish defense companies?</h4><p>We have some members that are foreign investors, and in practice they report that they have some difficulties. In order to produce a defense product in Turkey, the facility should be secure. Foreign investors can buy any percentage of a Turkish company and sit on the board of directors. However, they can face difficulties when it comes to secret national projects. We help with discussions over the export license problem, and our organization is getting together with German and Italian associations and working through these problems in order to encourage their governments to make it easier to obtain export licenses. They cannot do it by themselves, and we are working at the strategic level for all our members, as we are the people who can offer solutions. If they establish good communications with SaSaD, then they know everything that is going on, what will happen, and how to resolve issues. We also have very close relations with the biggest private sectorial organization, the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB). Deputy Secretary General of SaSaD, Yılmaz Küçükseyhan, is also heading the Defense and Aerospace assembly of TOBB. This has created a strong link between SaSaD and TOBB.</p><h4>To what extent are international companies investing in Turkish R&amp;D?</h4><p>Many international authorities and industrialists in the US, Germany, and the UK are coming to Turkey to work together, not only to manufacture for the Turkish Armed Forces but also to export via joint ventures. They are forming partnerships with our companies because of the export license problems in their countries and the good reputation Turkey enjoys in some countries. In addition, the Turkish Defense and Aerospace Industry offers services at a high quality and reasonable cost that meet international standards. Together they produce the technology in Turkey and they can easily export their products.</p><h4>Why is it more attractive for them to produce in Turkey than it is in the UK or in Germany?</h4><p>Companies choose Turkey for its industrial capability to produce defense and aviation products at a high-quality level with reasonable costs. Our workforce has experience through international programs and partnerships. In addition, in the UK and Germany there are very rigid laws and legal restrictions about exporting products to foreign countries. We are aware of these restrictions as well; we never sell these kinds of products to countries that do not have clearance. Turkey is also rigid on export licenses, but not like Germany or the UK. We are even better than the US in terms of export licenses. This does not mean we sell to everybody—we are both a UN and NATO member, so we have rules and legal obligations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your experience in journalism influence you today?<br></h4><p>I graduated from Istanbul University in Turkish literature. I began working as a reporter in the arts sector, especially focused on plays and theater. Following that, I became an editor in the arts section of the newspaper. In 1996, I was a coordinator for the news company Zaman. In 1998, I left the company to study in the US, and I completed my MA at Amherst College in Boston; I came back in 2001 to begin my work as an Editor-in-Chief at the paper. Since then, I have been in a position of leadership. We print various newspapers, including Today's Zaman daily, and Aksiyon weekly, under the Cihan News Agency. We also publish the new Turkish Review magazine in English.</p><h4>How has Zaman evolved since its founding in 1986?</h4><p>In 2001, our circulation was 174,000 copies. In 2012, our circulation hit around 1 million. When I joined the company in 2001, I proposed a change to the design and style, as well as a number of other issues. Since we were approaching our 15-year anniversary, we went for it. There wasn't much time—just three or four months. I teamed up with my editors and designers, and we began discussing the new vision of the newspaper. We spent five days without leaving our hotel, just talking about how the newspaper should be. I have always believed that Turkish people deserved better than what they have had before. We had another meeting at a hotel in Istanbul, and we invited businessmen, politicians, and journalists. The Prime Minister congratulated us on our new paper and vision. At that time, some of our critics wrote that Zaman was too serious and boring, and that circulation was going down, and it wouldn't be able to get advertising. But people liked it, and our circulation has been increasing. I'm very satisfied with our current circulation.</p><h4>To what do you attribute this growth in a sector that is globally contracting?</h4><p>I don't believe that newspapers are dying. People are always claiming that the internet is coming, and print journalism is decreasing. Of course, some newspapers in the US and the UK have faced economic issues, but I don't believe that the reason is the internet. If we focus on the journalism and attract advertisers, our position is better than TV and internet journalists. They don't have a price for their channel, but we have the privilege of putting a price on the paper. In Turkey it may be as cheap as 45 or 25 cents, but it makes money. Our main sources of income include the price of the paper itself and advertisements. In 2011, our turnover was $45 million.</p><h4>How does Zaman deal with the challenges of freedom of press in Turkey?</h4><p>I'm optimistic. We have faced some issues, but on the whole we are writing articles about everything. We criticize the government and politicians, and we feel that there is a good standard of freedom of press here. Some journalists have run into trouble with the law and the government, and we have been no exception. In 2011, we covered more than 2,000 issues. We covered cases, and if the cases were secret, we had broken the law. I went to the courthouse 10 times to dispute the charges and say that we had not done anything wrong, and we have a right to write about what we choose. Most prosecutors, judges, generals, and politicians do not agree with censorship and would like the newspapers to continue expressing their opinions.</p><h4>How has Zaman sought to increase its international presence?</h4><p>In 2009, we began Zaman Weekly in the UK and France. They have been successful, and now we publish in many countries throughout Europe. We also distribute in the Balkans and the US. These editions were published in Turkish 10 years ago, but now we publish the paper in French and English, or in whatever language is widely spoken. We publish around 40,000 papers daily in Germany, and about the same number weekly in the UK and France. If we separated the circulation of the papers, 1,000 daily would be good enough for a country in Europe. We are growing in the UK and France. The spread of the paper is like franchising; we sit down with someone interested in distributing our paper, and they are aware of what is happening in the sector. We make an agreement specifying that they have to follow the policies of the paper. If they sign with us, they have to follow our guidelines. However, we cannot edit every article they publish, and we don't need to, because there is an agreement that stipulates that the writers cannot discriminate or use hate speech. Our responsibility is selling the brand, and they are responsible for what they write.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry of Agriculture investing in R&amp;D to promote advanced technological processes across the agricultural sector?<br></h4><p>The Program on Supporting Rural Development Investments was implemented by our Ministry in 2006. Grant support at a rate of 50% is provided for investments in the processing, storage, and packaging of agricultural products, the construction of new greenhouses that use alternative energy resources, pressurized irrigation systems, and facilities that produce alternative energy in support activities, as well as projects involving sheep, goats, and buffalo. To date, 3,203 facilities have been established with grant payments for these investments totaling TL575 million.</p><h4>What is your Ministry's strategy to encourage international investment in the Turkish agricultural sector?</h4><p>Turkey has become an attractive country for both national and international investors, with its explosion of activity in recent years, stable political structure, and improving sound economy. Investments have been increasing gradually in agriculture, and Turkey provides many significant opportunities to investors, such as a dynamic and young population, affordable and qualified labor, improved industry and trade, convenient land, air, and marine transportation, arable land, qualified production, suitable weather conditions, and proximity to important markets. Turkey's agricultural GDP increased from $23.7 billion to $62.7 billion over the period from 2002 to 2010, registering an increase of 165%. The export of agricultural products has also increased from $4 billion to $15.3 billion between 2002 and 2011, showing 282% growth.</p><h4>What trends in investment can you identify?</h4><p>The profile of investors who want to invest in agriculture has diversified and expanded in recent years. While small-scale investors with a limited budget were previously at the forefront, the number of medium- and large-scale investments has been increasing gradually. Companies in different service sectors are beginning to look toward agriculture. These developments are important indicators that support allocated to agriculture is successful. In total, $190 million in foreign investment was realized in the agricultural sector between 2005 and 2010. Although it is considered under the umbrella term of “manufacturing," the amount of foreign investment entering our country in the segments of food, drink, and tobacco has increased from $68 million to $145 million, an increase of 13% in the period between 2005 and 2010. In total, there has been $1 billion and $784 million of foreign investment in these sectors over the same period. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in the number of foreign companies in the agricultural sector. By the end of 2010, over 25,800 foreign companies were operating in Turkey, two-thirds of which were established in the last seven years.</p><h4>Which sectors are the most attractive for investment?</h4><p>Livestock, organic agriculture, aquaculture, and poultry are some of the sectors that have become prominent in our country in recent years. Due to the support provided by our Ministry in order to improve the sector, increase its productivity, and carry out important projects, livestock has become an especially attractive investment area. Another current investment focus is organic agriculture. Increasing sensitivity in terms of health and nutrition has made organic farming more important, a practice that is carried out without using materials that are harmful to the environment and human health, such as chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and hormones. Furthermore, this sector provides inputs for other industries, such as textiles, which makes it more attractive for investors. Studies into organic agriculture have been accelerated, with 1 million hectares of potentially usable land, improved legal infrastructure, and incorporation into the support system. While the sector boasted 310,000 tons of production and 150 product varieties in 2002, in 2010 this production had reached 1.34 million tons and 216 product varieties. Another prominent sector is aquaculture, which has been the most rapid-growing sector in the world according to FAO data. Our country ranks third in the world in the aquaculture sector, as Turkey is suitable geographically and enjoys increased production as a result of government support. Aquaculture production reached 653,000 tons in 2010, showing a year-on-year increase of 5%. Cultivation production was 167,000 tons in 2010, marking 5.3% year-on-year growth and 173% relative to 2002. The poultry sector is a third area that is growing and developing rapidly in our country, and according to TurkStat figures production increased to 1.6 million tons in 2011.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is TİGEM's relationship to the Ministry of Agriculture?<br></h4><p>TİGEM is a state economic enterprise. We are related to the Ministry of Agriculture and the Undersecretariat of the Treasury. We make our long-term decisions and policies through negotiations with them and in harmony with their long-term national policies. In terms of internal issues, we are independent. We are one of the oldest establishments in Turkey—our history goes back almost 700 years, when an Ottoman farm in Bursa called Karacabey was established in 1330. We have two main activities: plant production and animal breeding. As you know, the Ottoman Empire governed land on three continents for around 600 years, and horses played a very important role in that history. We are performing these activities on 371,000 hectares of land.</p><h4>How significant is Turkish agriculture to the region?</h4><p>Since our inception, we have been one of the most important actors in the agriculture sector. During the worldwide food scarcity through World Wars I and II, TİGEM was insurance for Turkey, as 1.5% of the agriculture area of Turkey is TİGEM's land.</p><p>In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, Turkey was ranked 7th in terms of the value of agricultural production in the world, with $61.7 billion. In Europe, we are ranked first. These figures demonstrate our country's significance and where we stand, and TİGEM's share in it shows our importance. Climatic conditions in Turkey vary greatly from moderate and warm Mediterranean climate to cold and harsh continental winters. Also, 3,000 out of 13,000 plant varieties grown are endemic to Anatolia, which is a clear advantage for breeding new varieties.</p><p>We produce certified cereal seeds and breeding animals to be sold to Turkish farmers. According to our research, we are the number one certified cereal seed producer in the world with 200,000 tons in 2011. Our 2015 goal is to reach 400,000 tons and meet 50% of Turkey's total requirement.</p><p>Of course, we cooperate with other countries from time to time. For instance, we exported 5,000 tons of certified wheat seed to Sudan during the 2008-2009 period. However, our main purpose is to meet our country's demand. We also cooperate with private sector companies, especially in vegetable and fruit production.</p><h4>What is the potential for foreign interest in TİGEM's role in Arabian horse breeding?</h4><p>We are one of the leading horse-breeding organizations in the Middle East. We have around 1,200 horses, all purebred Arabian, on three of our farms: Karacabey, Anadolu, and Sultansuyu. The total area we use for horse breeding is around 20,000 hectares. In Turkey, there are eight racetracks, and the country is well positioned for horse breeding. About half of the horses in Turkey are Thoroughbreds, and the rest are Arabian. In 2011, 35% of the Arabian horses running in national races were of TİGEM origin. However, more than 50% of the total prizes awarded in this breed's races were won by our horses. This reflects the quality of our horses. On the other hand, our process with a horse does not finish when we sell it to an owner. As long as it runs in races, we take a breeder's share out of its award and we purchase top performers of these horses back when they are retired from races in order to use them as stallions. Owners are obliged to sell these horses back to us. For example, we have a prize stud stallion named Caş. His offspring are well-known performers, showing real speed and power. Caş is around 23 years old, but he and his offspring have won more than $50 million in prize money so far.</p><h4>What role will Turkish agriculture play in the future in a global sense?</h4><p>Turkey is a net exporter in agriculture. Up until now, we have sustained our people, a population of 75 million with 35 million tourists every year. The world population has doubled over the last 60 years. The population is increasing rapidly and continuously, together with the demand for food. Meanwhile, the production area is reducing. Every year, 12 million hectares of soil are lost in the world due to environmental change, which equates to half of Turkey's entire agricultural land.</p><p>With these realities in front of us, Turkey has a valuable potential for large-scale agricultural production, including various vegetables and fruits. On the other hand, agricultural policies pursued by our government in last few years will be more and more fruitful in the longer term. In the near future, I can say that Turkey will be a regional center for both animal and plant products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the most remarkable social responsibility project that you have accomplished?<br></h4><p>GÜBRETAÅž is a corporation that has always given prominence to social benefits; this has been our mission since the establishment of the company. In this context, we have been designing the Soil Productivity Map of Turkey project, which analyzes soil samples collected throughout the country in laboratories and provides farmers with the most prolific samples for agricultural products. The R&amp;D department is working to complete the project by 2015. The technical characteristics of the soil samples are analyzed and recorded in an electronic database, and a prescription that contains area and soil characteristics, as well as cropping recommendations, is drawn up for farmers. This is a very important project, considering that 40% of the arable fields in Turkey are used for agricultural purposes, and most of them are not used correctly. Migration from rural to urban areas in the last 50 years has also influenced this phenomenon. The number of young and dynamic people engaged in agriculture has decreased. In general, people engaged in agriculture are using traditional methods that have usually passed from generation to generation. These methods fail to meet the requirements of today's modern practices. As a result, soil quality has diminished and profitability has decreased. A new driving force must be in place to reverse the ongoing process. In addition to this, a common awareness is needed to boost access to food and agricultural profitability, which are two very important factors for the population around the globe. This makes agriculture one of the strategic industries.</p><h4>How did your overseas investment strategy develop?</h4><p>Despite the fact that fertilizer consumption is around 5 million tons per year in Turkey, our country is still insufficient in terms of fertilizer raw material sources. For this reason, raw material needs and requirements are met by importing from the countries in the Black Sea Basin and North Africa. Considering these restrictions, GÜBRETAÅž has developed a new strategy with an eye for creating investment opportunities in raw material-rich territories.</p><p>Fertilizers are composed of three elements: nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium. The reason for our investment in Iran is because the country is rich with natural gas resources to obtain nitrogen. North Africa is also a very important investment area with rich phosphate resources. We carry out ongoing negotiations and research for making investments in North African countries, such as Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. In this context, we have new proposals on the agenda. We will examine them and continue our study. When the company sees a suitable opportunity, we plan to take new steps in line with the international investment strategy that we have adopted.</p><p>Our investments to renew our facilities continue in order to improve our production capacity in Turkey. We are going to establish a new NPK plant that is anticipated to increase our production capacity by 45% in Kocaeli from 2012 to 2013.</p><h4>What are the targets and plans in the medium term?</h4><p>In the forthcoming years, we are planning to increase our market share up to 35% in the domestic market and hold a permanent position there. After completing our current investments, we intend to take new steps both at home and abroad, seeking to ensure that GÜBRETAÅž makes progress to become an international brand in the industry. The company is actively increasing the number of laboratories we currently have in three provinces and boosting its market efficiency by offering various types of fertilizers specific to the region and plant type. In addition, we continue to perform training and awareness-raising work for the farmers in order to encourage them to play a role in improving the quality and efficiency of agricultural production. Over 100,000 farmers were trained at nearly 1,400 points last year.</p><p>Currently, 75% of GÜBRETAÅž is owned by Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey, which is composed of Turkish farmers. The remaining 25% is traded at the Istanbul Stock Exchange. In other words, we can be considered a 100%-public owned company. We are therefore very aware of our social responsibilities. Our main goal is to preserve our reputation as a high-quality and reliable corporation and to strengthen GÜBRETAÅž's position as a brand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish Airlines (THY) is one of the only air carriers registering consistent growth in passenger numbers every year. What were the main challenges in 2011 and what is your outlook for 2012?</h4><p>It was a very important year because it was the year that the most wide-body and narrow-body aircraft were added to our fleet. It was also a year for investment, up to $750 million, outside of aircraft purchases. We also added 24 new destinations this year, most of them long haul. In spite of all this, we finished the year in profit. In 2012 we are aiming for 18%-20% growth. We also hope to increase our fleet to 195 aircraft—29 of the planes we've ordered will have joined our fleet by the end of this year. There will be new destinations and flight points as well, and frequency increases to existing lines. For example, we've upped our flights to New York to three a day, and we're increasing the frequency of flights to Europe and the Far East. New destinations are also expected in Europe and Africa. We are planning on expanding to Central and South America. We believe that 2012 will be better than 2011, barring any unforeseen circumstances. We don't have any unresolved problems related to our operations. It's all going smoothly. One of the most important projects in 2012 will be the opening of our THY Technical Facility at Sabiha Gökçen Airport in Istanbul over a 380,000-sqm area. Operations will start in 2012 for narrow-body aircraft, and then as of 2013, it will include wide-body aircraft. As a result, Turkish Airlines will operate one of the key aircraft maintenance facilities in the region. We've finished design plans and will begin the serial production of aircraft galleys, starting with Boeing galleys, in conjunction with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). We also have an airline seat design company, which is expected to begin production in 2013. We have various deals with US companies in other production areas, such as with Goodrich for the production of aircraft components. On top of this, our pilot academy is currently graduating 100 pilots a year. We're relocating that academy and increasing the capacity to 300 pilots per year. This school is different from our Aviation Academy, which was recently IATA approved. So, it's a busy time for Turkish Airlines.</p><h4>Are these new production initiatives aimed at export?</h4><p>Sure, it's both for us and eventually for export, the aim being to develop and expand the Turkish civil aviation industry in Turkey.</p><h4>What impact will these new educational developments have for THY's position in the region?</h4><p>Our schools include foreign students from other airlines in the region. It will play a great part in the growth of educated and qualified aviation staff not just in Turkey but also in the region.</p><h4>How important is the Turkish Airlines brand on the cargo side of the business?</h4><p>We will eventually make our cargo division a separate company. We have over 190 cargo destinations around the world, and our brand image as a safe and reliable airline is well established. We're one of the fastest-growing cargo companies in the world. Turkey's geographical location, with Istanbul as a hub, is an important factor for our continued and strong cargo growth.</p><h4>What trends can you identify within the cargo industry?</h4><p>Istanbul has great potential and is developing very quickly. Turkey's and Istanbul's growth, development, and increased importance on the international scene have a direct impact on the growth of our business. We foresee a growth in cargo business, even though Istanbul still hasn't used more than 30% of its potential in my opinion. We need more airport facilities as well; Atatürk Airport is overcrowded right now, but the new airport project should resolve that. There's a new project to dedicate an airport solely to cargo, possibly in Çorlu, or as a part of Sabiha Gökçen Airport.</p><h4>There are rumors that Turkish Airlines will be acquiring a European airline. What effect will this have on THY?</h4><p>We're currently talking with the Polish national carrier, LOT Polish Airways. We've had meetings, and the process is underway to finalize this deal. This deal will of course have a positive effect on both airlines. We're not just seeking benefits for Turkish Airlines; we want it to be a win-win situation for both airlines and both countries. We also have other deals and initiatives we're working on with other airlines, and we're evaluating various offers.</p><h4>You mentioned 24 new destinations in 2011, and new destinations in the Americas. How would you characterize the demand in South America?</h4><p>THY seeks to serve three kinds of passengers: tourists, business people, and transit passengers. We find that there is a large number of transit passengers from South America to various points in Asia and the Middle East, most of which used to transfer in Europe. We would like to expand our share of transit passengers. We've increased the number of transit passengers by 18%-20%, thanks to increased traffic in Istanbul and on the global stage. We are also active in domestic flights. There are 48 airports in Turkey, and domestic air travel is also increasing rapidly, adding to our overall growth. This obviously has to do with Turkey's overall GDP per capita growth over the last few years.</p><h4>Do you have any other strategies to increase the number of passengers who choose Turkish Airlines?</h4><p>We focus on increasing service quality to make Turkish Airlines the best option. We think of it as a complete package, improving the flight experience, upping technology, making flights more comfortable, adding more destinations, and so on.</p><h4>You made a big impact with your promotional deals with FC Barcelona, Manchester United, and Euroleague Basketball. How have these deals added to Turkish Airlines' popularity?</h4><p>These sponsorships have added greatly to our public exposure. We have $100 million set aside for these kinds of deals. The sponsorship deals you mentioned will  continue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the government supported and incentivized investment in Turkey's maritime sector? What is Turkey's potential to develop its ports to become a regional maritime shipping hub?<br></h4><p>The seas have played a defining role in the history of civilizations, and have always been crucial from an economic, military, political, and geographical perspective. However, Turkey, a country that is essentially a peninsula, still hasn't been able to make full use of its maritime advantages. That's why the Ministry of Transportation, Maritime Affairs, and Communications has created the technical and legal foundations to change the situation and ensure that we utilize our maritime potential as an economic resource. The overwhelming majority of world trade is done by cost-efficient sea transportation. In Turkey, 88% of foreign trade is carried out by sea.</p><h4>The government has stepped in to shoulder the costs of building the third Bosphorus bridge after no bids were received from private companies. What impact will the bridge have on Istanbul's economy?</h4><p>The reason we received no bids for the open tender was due to the construction conditions and technical specifications. Since then, we've divided the project into two parts, and in April 2012 we opened a new tender on 65 kilometers of the bridge and the connecting roads, set to begin construction this year. We expect this part of the project to cost around $2.5 billion. Another section is the 360-kilometer highway tender, which we'll construct with public funding. Over the last seven years, the number of cars on Istanbul's roads has increased 2.5 fold to reach 2.5 million vehicles. Meanwhile, Turkish trade volumes are growing fast. As exports grow, imports also rise. The third bridge is necessary for transit vehicles; due to heavy traffic on the bridges, TL3 billion in fuel is wasted, as is TL500 million of work time, which costs the country TL3.5 billion annually. With the third bridge, we'll have eradicated this waste. Imagine that every year we lose the equivalent of what it costs to build a bridge.</p><h4>Prime Minister Erdoğan announced plans for Channel Istanbul in April 2011. When and how is this project expected to be realized?</h4><p>The Channel Istanbul project is an important and necessary project for Turkey and for other countries in the region. Once completed, it will significantly ease the existing sea traffic on the Bosphorus, increase sea traffic safety, and bring the risk of possible disaster scenarios to a minimum. As you know, the Bosphorus is a very risky strait with strong and shifting currents, as well as a strong counter current. An artificial channel will have none of these dangers. We've begun feasibility studies for Channel Istanbul, and we're currently doing geological and route studies as well. I estimate that these studies will be completed in the next two years. Following that process, there will be a six-month tender period. Based on the route chosen, the project should cost between $4 billion and $10 billion. After this stage of the project is complete, we envisage at least four to eight years for construction. We aim to have the project completed by 2023.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Turkish State Railways (TCDD) compare to other regional rail network operators?<br></h4><p>Based on our 2009 figures, we find that our country has the most extensive railway network in terms of main routes. In addition, Turkey has the highest number of passengers, the most rail freight and production after Iran, a ranking in the mid-level range in terms of rail per 1,000 square kilometers, a ranking in the mid-level range in terms of rail per 10,000 people and the third-highest passenger frequency after Bulgaria and Greece. With 888 kilometers of track, TCDD is currently the only high-speed train operator in the region. Turkey continues to move forward as a leader in the railway sector, and many serious investments have been made since 2003. Owing to massive amounts of both political and financial support, TCDD has received a total of TL10.8 billion in funding. While in 2003 TCDD received only TL250 million, in 2011 that figure had increased to TL3.3 billion. In 2003, a high-speed train system was implemented. Since then, we have modernized existing lines, upgraded rolling stocks, developed a high-tech railway industry, improved grade crossings, expanded inner-city rail transport, realized the Izmir Egeray, Ankara Başkentray, Istanbul Marmaray, and Gaziantep Gaziray projects, restored and renovated train stations, created logistics centers, connected industrial areas to rail, and established international rail corridors.</p><h4>What's the status of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railroad?</h4><p>Also termed the “Steel Silk Road," the BTK Project will be completed in 2012 and is expected to carry 1.5 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight per year in the initial period. With the implementation of the BTK, the Ankara-Istanbul high-speed line, the Marmaray, the Halkalı-Bulgaria rail project, and the ongoing Ankara-Sivas high-standard rail, a single continuous railway system will connect East and West, from Europe through Turkey and the Caucasus and on to Central Asia. Considering the $75 billion of estimated annual freight potential between Europe and Asia, the importance of international projects is very clear.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Marmaray project for the Turkish railway sector?</h4><p>The Marmaray project is an international project that will contribute greatly to Istanbul's inner-city transport network and unite the European and Asian continents by rail. The Marmaray project consists of four separate sub-projects: engineering and accounting services; the modernization of the Gebze-Haydarpaşa and Sirkeci-Halkalı suburban lines and electromagnetic systems; the Strait Tube Tunnel Crossing; and railway vehicle manufacturing. Once completed, a single connected railway line will run from London to Beijing. We expect the project to be completed on Republic Day, October 29, 2013. The Marmaray has a 100-year design background, and trains will run at 90-second intervals. At 55 meters below sea level, it will be the world's deepest rail and underground station. One-way capacity is 75,000 passengers an hour and 11 million tons of freight per year. In total, 140 of the 440 vehicles and 54 train sets will be built directly by Hyundai Rotem in South Korea. The remaining 300 will be built by the Hyundai Rotem-TCDD joint venture in Adapazarı at the Hyundai-EU Rotem factory. This facility is a very important step toward domestic railway technology transfer and is expected to create a domestic railway manufacturing industry. In the coming years, it will ensure that we will be less dependent on imports and can utilize our own national resources for future railway projects, as well as export this technology to the region.</p><h4>What is the potential for developing Turkish ports in line with the country's desire to become an international center for sea transport?</h4><p>Around 80% of world trade and 90% of Turkish imports and exports are done by sea. Being a natural geographic bridge between Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East, our country has great potential to become a transportation hub. As part of the Ninth Development Plan for the period between 2007 and 2013, the development and growth of Turkey's port infrastructure is a top priority. This means bringing our ports up to international standards, developing combined transport, facilitating privatization, defining the ports to play key roles as transit points in the Aegean and Mediterranean seas, and developing new alternative ports. In short, we must undertake a concerted effort in conjunction with the private sector to ensure the development of our coastal resources for the common good, keeping in mind the importance of environmental dimensions, and establishing a modern and comprehensive transport and trade infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey signed the UN Climate Change Framework Agreement in 2004 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2009. As part of Turkey's national vision to integrate economic development strategies with climate change policies, we've increased energy efficiency, used more clean and renewable energy sources, and sought to create better living standards while at the same time reducing our carbon output.<br></p><p>Turkey is a developing country that is undergoing rapid and sustainable social and economic development. We aim to expand the use of renewable energy and clean technologies in our drive for economic growth and job creation. The National Climate Change Strategy Document was implemented with the 2010-2020 period in mind. The document states that “a low=carbon economy will be achieved by increasing support for technology renewal, emission controls, climate-friendly technology production, and clean energy design and production technologies."</p><p>The National Climate Change Action Plan, which was created in July 2011 as part of our National Climate Change Strategy, has enabled us to make great strides in our international efforts in tackling the problem of climate change. This document is essentially Turkey's first green development strategy. The Climate Change Action Plan's general aim is to create the right conditions for the limiting of greenhouse gas emissions, thereby enabling us to do our part in tackling global climate change, dealing with its effects, improving our protection against it, and encouraging green practices overall. Also, in sectors like energy, transport, industry, waste management, buildings, agriculture, and forestry, the environmental, economic, and ecological dimensions have all been taken into consideration as an integrated whole.</p><p>The Climate Change Action Plan has a number of important objectives. Funds for R&amp;D in the field of energy efficiency will increase by 100% in 2015, compared to 2009. We will also support R&amp;D and innovation efforts for the development and production of technologies that support energy efficiency, and work on emission control scenarios in the energy sector to ensure that the share of renewable energy in electricity production is increased, with R&amp;D developed and supported to this end. This entails supporting the use of economic tools and cost/benefit analyses in the transfer of R&amp;D to the production and manufacturing stage. We will establish a Post-Project Support and Coordination Unit that will keep track of incubation and technology development areas and projects by Renewable Energy Sources (YEK). We will also analyze energy efficiency potential and priorities to carry out the insulation of buildings and create energy-efficient systems, as well as evaluate building materials and technologies in the market with an eye to energy efficiency. We want to support R&amp;D for the development of building materials and technologies that will increase energy efficiency. Our Ministry encourages investments to increase, spread, and register energy efficiency in the industrial sector through developing financing models for SMEs. As part of the voluntary agreements, we support projects that develop technological improvements and share the results with the public and undertake work to promote low-carbon intensity in the incubation and technology centers that will be developed, while creating an action plan for the reduction and tracking of the carbon footprint for companies active in industrial production and their products. We are also promoting R&amp;D work on smart transport systems and the creation of fleets of vehicles that run on clean energy sources in public institutions, and developing the mechanisms for this. In order to monitor our progress we are developing systems for the gathering, registration, auditing, and tracking of greenhouse gas emissions. This will enable us to analyze sectorial carbon stocks and create the necessary legal and corporate framework for the creation of a national carbon market.</p><p>Of the registered and zoned areas in Turkey, which amount to 2.26 million hectares, 0.47% is owned by foreign nationals, with 55% of that belonging to foreign nationals of Turkish origin. So, in other words, we're talking about a very small percentage of land. As part of the new legal framework, foreign nationals will now be able to buy real estate in un-zoned areas. When we consider the special interest shown in acquiring real estate in Turkey by Iranian, Azerbaijani, Qatari, and UAE nationals, we expect these real estate ownership figures will increase substantially. The new law also increases the amount of land that can be acquired per person from 2.5 hectares to 30 hectares, enabling investments to be undertaken not as companies but as private individuals. We can always make adjustments depending on developments, either liberalizing or restricting real estate ownership practices depending on the situation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TOKİ plays a major role in the regeneration of Turkish cities. The new finance center in Ataşehir, Istanbul and the micro-cities throughout Turkey are cases in point. What role does TOKİ play in supporting these projects?</h4><p>The land in Ataşehir, Istanbul, where Turkey's first finance center is to be constructed, originally belonged to Emlakbank. When Emlakbank was liquidated, its assets were passed to TOKİ and its affiliate, Emlak Konut Real Estate Investment Trust. Approximately 800,000 sqm of this land has been planned for the new finance center. The finance center was planned to be somewhat larger than that of New York, designed as a destination that could cater to the world. To date, planning efforts have been executed by the Emlak Konut Real Estate Investment Trust, under the supervision of the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization. The project involves buildings for Ziraat Bank, VakıfBank, Halkbank, the Capital Markets Board of Turkey (CMB), and the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), as well as a modern shopping center, offices, hotels, and residences.</p><h4>What role will foreign investment play in the development of the finance center?</h4><p>This investment was received favorably by foreign investors, but most of the funding will be provided by local investors. Foreign investors have been very active in Turkey since 2005, and foreign banks conducted interviews to lend loans to TOKİ. We are always open to foreign investors in our revenue-generating projects. In this context, we can start companies jointly to launch suitable projects. As a pilot firm, 51% of the shares of potential companies should belong to us.</p><h4>What is the investment process for TOKİ when it comes to micro-cities?</h4><p>The tender stage is reached by submitting a planning study to the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization. We make an announcement and call for the investors to bid on prestigious projects where no public funds are spent. After that, we award the contract to the firm with the highest bid to the administration through TOKİ and our affiliates. Our investment process takes about two and a half to three years for joint revenue-generating projects. The process of announcing tenders in line with the Public Tender Law with the equities of TOKİ takes from 1.5 to two years.</p><h4>Approximately 50% of Turkey's housing stock will need to be rebuilt to meet earthquake-resistance regulations. What role will TOKİ play in this reconstruction process?</h4><p>TOKİ has been successful in reaching its objective to build 500,000 new housing units and social facilities by 2011. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan asked TOKİ to construct another 500,000 houses by 2023. Over the last nine years, we have begun building 550,293 houses at 2,406 distinct construction sites in 81 provinces and 800 districts in Turkey. This means that we have created 21 micro cities with a population of over 100,000, in addition to sub-structure and social facilities. We also initiated the construction of 839 schools, 285 hospitals and village clinics, 27 retirement homes (245 buildings), 191 homes for handicapped citizens, 103 dormitories and pensions, 464 trade centers, 867 gyms, and 41 libraries, with investments totaling TL46 billion ($31 billion). We continue to work on projects aimed at supplying housing and earthquake-resistant homes for low-income citizens, which is carried out in cooperation with the private sector.</p><h4>How important is building environmentally friendly buildings?</h4><p>The concept and technology of “green" housing ranks high on the agenda in several countries, particularly in the US and Europe. We are tasked with managing the appropriate use of water and energy, implementing ecological features, building with eco-friendly materials, utilizing waste, and designing structures in harmony with nature. Turkey has reached a hazard limit in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, and most of the energy consumed is for heating and cooling purposes.   Nevertheless, we aim to promote the minimal use of energy in heating and cooling. In terms of energy efficiency and renewable energy in houses, TOKİ pioneers pilot housing projects where solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, fuel cell, and energy-efficient design material implementations are used in the different climatic regions of the country. In fact, 5% of our investment has been focused on green building projects, and we are working to increase this ratio. For example, we are benefiting from solar energy for our homes, elevators, and water supply. The organization has been careful to follow the TS 825 Heat Insulation Rules Standard, as well as save fuel during the construction process. At our Istanbul Kayaşehir Project site, 20,000 of the 65,000 units are using green technology. We are constantly working on new projects and technology, recognizing the importance of R&amp;D. There are several new projects in the field, which we continue to develop with local universities and research institutions. In 2008, we conducted a study in collaboration with the Middle East Technical University (METU) called the “Development of a Compilation Method on Human-Environment Relations Necessary to Form Urban Environment Standards in Housing Development Areas." We have already started to implement the results of the program in our projects. With a new project we initiated regarding the sustainable building standards in terms of environment and economy, we will further diversify and develop our environmentally friendly implementations.</p><h4>How does TOKİ intend to meet the housing shortage?</h4><p>There are 19 million housing units in our country, and there is a housing deficit of 2.5 million units. This means that approximately 600,000 houses should be constructed each year. TOKİ has met 5%-10% of the deficit in the last nine years. We offer houses with all necessary social facilities to our citizens, such as health centers, schools, parks, shopping centers, sports complexes, dormitories, libraries, and anything else necessary for modern life. We also regulate the existing real estate sales mechanism in the market through our implementations of this scale.</p><h4>What developments does TOKİ foresee in terms of access to mortgages and financing to increase home ownership rates?</h4><p>In developed and emerging countries, low-income groups can acquire houses through public subsidies to a great extent. TOKİ attempts to fulfill this duty for the benefit of the public by allocating the highest amount of funding to housing production and financing. We construct housing units on land owned by TOKİ and then provide loans to support the sale of these homes. We target low- and middle-income families that cannot afford to purchase a house under current market conditions, but still have a certain level of savings to buy houses through suitable payment terms. For this purpose, we have launched the “Revenue Sharing Model" on land with high revenue in metropolitan areas in order to fund our programs. This model constitutes an example of practice in the field of housing finance, a new financial fund-raising model, and effective cooperation with the private sector for a state with limited resources.</p><h4>What projects are you most proud of at TOKİ?</h4><p>The volume of housing produced by TOKİ across the country over the last nine years is equal to the establishment of 21 cities, each with a population of 100,000. With a production quantity of over 550,293 houses, we have provided employment to approximately 800,000 people directly and indirectly since 2003. These data are a source of pride for our administration. In line with the instructions of Prime Minister Erdoğan, the fact that TOKİ will take an active part during the planning and implementation stages of the 2020 Summer Olympics bid constitutes a comprehensive project that makes us proud. TOKİ will maintain this successful performance with a new vision aimed at building another 500,000 houses by the end of 2023.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY How should Kazakhstan look into developing its tourism offering?</h4><p><span></span>Around 20 years ago, foreign tourists in the USSR would travel to Moscow, Kiev, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Khiva. The Kazakh SSR, on the other hand, was associated with the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Baikonur, and the gulags. We have a lot to do to turn Kazakhstan into a country with developed tourism infrastructure. The country is located in the heart of a rapidly growing global market of tourist flows, which undoubtedly is a great chance to have Kazakhstan occupy its own niche. We need to create new tourism products, as without them we risk missing the chance to attract not only foreign but also domestic tourists. This requires public and private investment. Kazakhstan is a new tourist destination. At one time we lamented that during the Soviet Union the infrastructure was not developed well enough; no good roads despite long distances, and low population density, but eventually we realized that this is in fact an asset. Pristine nature can become the competitive edge of our nascent tourism industry. In almost every region of the country we have unique nature reserves that appeal to many holidaymakers, such as endless steppes, desert crossings, forest oases, majestic mountain ranges with pristine lakes, and extraordinary shorelines.</p><h4>What is the state's outlook for the development of the tourism industry?</h4><p>The Ministry of Industry and New Technologies intends to develop a systematic plan for the country's tourism industry, which aims to form the basis for a competitive and economically successful tourism industry and the development of measures to enhance its investment appeal, including tax privileges and preferences, the simplification of administrative formalities concerning the buying and selling of real estate to non-residents, and the implementation of a visa-free regime for the entry into the country of tourists from economically and politically stable countries. In addition to the oil and gas industry, tourism has become another important pillar of the modern Kazakhstani economy as a strong source of job creation, and it is very attractive to domestic and foreign investors. While developing a systematic plan, we need to find a cost-effective growth strategy in order to see what needs to be done to have foreign and domestic investors invest in the building of tourism infrastructure, and what incentives the state can provide.</p><h4>In what niche areas do you see Kazakhstan developing its tourism industry?</h4><p>We were once recommended by foreigners not to build such resorts like Kenderli on the Caspian Sea, Burabai in Akmola, or ski resorts near Almaty, but focus solely on eco-tourism, which has big potential in Kazakhstan. Yet, we should keep in mind that eco-tourism constitutes only 7% of the tourism market. We are looking into developing these resorts in a sustainable manner, with the use of alternative energy sources and environmentally friendly building materials preserving our pristine nature. International experience shows that 60%-70% of the world prefers beach tourism, combining it with various other types of tourism. Understandably, not everyone with the same enthusiasm would go for sports like skiing, rock climbing, or scuba diving. The Caspian coast provides a safe and comfortable place for a wide spectrum of tourists. In off-season periods, facilities can be used for MICE tourism, generating revenues for the state budget.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Kenderli project for Kazakhstan's tourism industry?</h4><p>Kazakhstan needs to have its own international resorts like Antalya and Dubai. One such project is the construction of an international resort on the Caspian Sea called Kenderli. This project will create 15,000 jobs in a town of 60,000 residents, a farm with greenhouses, and fields for crops of over 200 hectares for the production of agricultural products for sale on the domestic and foreign markets, as well as a farmers' training center. There will also be an aqua park called “Beluga Alemi," which will employ 150 people in the research, conservation, and breeding of sturgeons, which are under threat of extinction. This project is export oriented with an estimated capacity of 3 tons of black caviar, and 100 tons of sturgeon meat a year. It is also going to serve the MICE tourism sector. Soon the power, transportation, and energy infrastructure of the region will be enhanced with new power lines, airports, and roads. We will also have facilities for sewage treatment and desalination. The Kenderli project will be the take-off point for mass tourism in Kazakhstan. Near the resort, there is the village of Seneca where there are sand dunes. This area can also provide opportunities for steppe safaris, and tours to the nearby Ustyurt, which has no counterpart in the world with its white canyons. Additionally, we developed 14 tourist routes. Two-thirds of Kazakhstan's historical and archeological heritage is located in Mangystau. We need service points with fully developed infrastructure to realize this area's full potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[main-effect]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prospects does the bank see in Eurasian economic integration?<br></h4><p>Centrifugal tendencies in the development of newly independent states' economic systems are expressed in member countries of the Customs Union (CU) of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, which began operating in 2010. Since January 1, 2012, the first 17 agreements that form the basis of the Common Economic Space (CES) have come into force. These agreements regulate the number of key themes of economic convergence—from the coordination of macroeconomic policies to labor migration. The results of complex simulations demonstrate that the creation of the CES by Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus will have a positive impact on the development of the three countries. In terms of figures, based upon a complex assessment conducted by the EDB's Center for Integration Studies together with Russian and Ukrainian academics, the aggregate accumulated effect of the establishment of the CES may amount to $1 trillion (in 2010 prices). The effects may be distributed among the countries as follows: 15% additional GDP growth for Belarus, 6% for Ukraine, 3.5% for Kazakhstan, and 2% for Russia. The main benefits from integration will be gained by Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan in per capita terms. Russia will benefit from integration in absolute values. The maximum integration effect is possible in the technology-oriented sectors. Industrial cooperation in the sectors of aerospace, shipbuilding, and nuclear power plant engineering is based on both old Soviet ties and relations established within the CU and the CES. However, we should understand that integration is not a computer algorithm that results in success automatically. Immediate effects based upon the liquidation of tariff barriers are insignificant—the main effect is attainable from a long-term perspective, with specific initiatives and projects in high-tech industries subject to positive changes and major transnational holdings making a claim for global leadership in their sectors. Integration agreements will broaden the possibilities. However, these possibilities should be translated into action.</p><h4>In 2011, the EDB's investment portfolio increased by 32.7%. In which areas have you observed the largest increase?</h4><p>We signed 18 new projects in 2011. Most of them are being implemented in the following sectors: transportation and transport infrastructure, chemicals, petrochemicals and fertilizers, metallurgy, municipal infrastructure, energy, mining and processing, agriculture, and finance. In general, in 2011 the investment portfolio grew by $843 million. Now, the current investment portfolio is more diversified in terms of sectorial distribution. New projects have increased the share of many industries in the portfolio, such as transportation, metallurgy, and chemicals. In 2011, the Kazakhstani economy showed robust growth—GDP rose by 7.5% after increasing by 7.3% in 2010. Throughout 2011, the main drivers of economic growth have been domestic consumer demand and external demand for Kazakhstan's raw materials. Retail turnover increased by 12.5%, and industrial output grew by 3.5%. Despite the fact that the industrial sector increased its output in 2011, the growth rate slowed to 3.5%, from 10% in 2010. This was caused primarily by a decrease in oil production. Due to the low 2010 level caused by unfavorable weather conditions, agricultural output rose by 26.7% in 2011 and compensated for the decrease in industrial output. Due to favorable terms of international trade, exports outpaced imports. According to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, there was an export surplus that outpaced the similar figure of 2010 by four times. Export revenues also generated a significant surplus in Kazakhstan's consolidated budget (10.3% of GDP compared with 8% in 2010).</p><h4>The modernization component is a priority element of the bank's decisions. In which direction are you looking to take this initiative in your medium-term agenda?</h4><p>Our main priorities are to finance projects that are based on modern technology and innovations, as well as abiding by ecological principles. We will continue to support energy-saving projects, such as Nitol in Russia or Kazfrac in Kazakhstan. The first develops alternative solar battery technology, and the second implements an innovative approach for the utilization and recirculation of excess gas. The EDB is interested in taking part in large hydropower projects in Central Asia, as well as in the development of energy infrastructure in the region. Kazakhstan also demonstrates its consistent attention to these areas. However, it is a complex issue. The majority of hydropower capacity of the Syr-Darya and Amu-Darya rivers is underutilized. According to the most moderate estimations, the potential annual hydropower capacity of these rivers is above 400 billion kV per hour. Therefore, the bank cautiously analyzes and seeks mutually acceptable approaches to these issues. The bank also sees opportunities in the development of transportation infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Genel was the first Turkish business to list on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, and today, we consider ourselves an Anglo-Turkish exploration and production company.</p><p>Our Turkish heritage and support places us in a compelling position, and we believe that it will help us to access new opportunities in strategically selected regions, particularly given Turkey's increasing influence in the Middle East and North Africa region.</p><h4>What are the benefits of being an Anglo-Turkish company?</h4><p>Our Turkish heritage and support places us in a compelling position, and we believe that it will help us to access new opportunities in strategically selected regions.</p><p>Our operating headquarters are in Ankara, and, in addition to the people on the ground, a significant number of our management team and employees are Turkish, including our President, Mehmet Sepil.</p><h4>To what extent does the close commercial and cultural integration of Northern Iraq with the Turkish economy benefit Genel Energy's operations?</h4><p>Turkey is a growing influence in the region both politically and economically, and Turkey and the Kurdistan region of Iraq are developing close economic ties. In 2011, of the approximate $8 billion invested in Iraq, $6 billion of this was invested in the Kurdistan region. The Kurdistan region of Iraq has the potential to play a significant role in expanding Turkey's energy supply base, the majority of which is currently sourced from Iran, Iraq, Russia, and Azerbaijan. It is in the interests of Turkey, the Kurdistan region, and Iraq to develop the oil and gas supply route into Turkey. This evolving geopolitical situation will likely benefit Genel Energy, as Turkey's leading independent energy company.</p><h4>What potential is there for Turkey to emerge as an oil and gas transportation hub?</h4><p>Turkey occupies a strategic location at the crossroads of Asia and Europe. With its strong economy, stable political structure, and growing role in the region, Turkey is well positioned to serve as an oil and gas transportation hub in the years to come.</p><h4>To what extent will Genel Energy contribute to the development of the Kurdistan region's oil and gas industry?</h4><p>We have deep roots in the Kurdistan region. Our Turkish management made Genel Energy the first company to execute a production sharing contract (PSC) with the Interim Joint Regional Administration of Northern Iraq in 2002, when we acquired our interest in the Taq Taq field, and we have been working in the region ever since. Over the last decade, Genel Energy has been a core contributor to the development of the Kurdistan region's energy industry, which did not exist prior to our involvement.</p><h4>What are your long-term objectives for Genel Energy in Turkey?</h4><p>Genel Energy has a very strong Turkish identity. Not only is this reflected in our heritage, but also our long-term commitment to the region. We believe that Turkey's growing influence in the region, both politically and economically, will benefit Genel as the country's leading independent energy company, and we are committed to continue building our capability in Ankara in the years to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Kale Aero evolve from Kale Group?</h4><p>Kale Group, founded in 1957, is one of the largest holdings in Turkey. It started as a ceramic tile business, then evolved into diversified sister companies, one of which was founded in 1969. KaleKalıp was a molding and dye company that originally served the ceramic tile business. It was a machine-based company, and through time it was able to adapt to the defense industry. In the 1980s, KaleKalıp took part in the Euro Stinger Missile Defense Project, which was a NATO-based program where KaleKalıp manufactured critical parts and assemblies for Stinger missiles for about 12 years. Our next project was the Rapier Missile Program, which lasted until 2007. We then participated in an offset project for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, and through a productive and dedicated relationship, we were granted the Star Supplier Award in 2004 by Lockheed Martin. This gave us the opportunity to take part in the world's largest defense project, namely the Joint Strike Fighter program for Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division. Our performance in the defense business thus has turned into an aerospace-dedicated company, Kale Aero. The company was set up in a separate and larger location that would be 100% export-oriented due to the nature of the business.</p><h4>Was your relationship with Lockheed Martin facilitated by any offset agreements, or was it achieved independently by Kale Group?</h4><p>Our first contact with Lockheed Martin was through an offset program. However, since the end of offsets, due to our quality and delivery performance, backed by our competitive cutting edge, all of our business with Lockheed Martin is independent. We were also given the opportunity by Lockheed Martin to bid on the new generation fighter F-35 project, where in 2009 we were granted a substantial portion of the international statement of work from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. Today, Kale Aero is a major player in the F-35. We manufacture and deliver almost 230 parts, mainly for the wings and fuselage. Having the necessary engineering background, the qualifications, and the quality approvals, Kale Aero is well established and approved to work with all aerospace giants, including Boeing, Airbus, Spirit Aerospace, and Northrop Grumman.</p><h4>How much technology originates in Turkey, and how much of it is a result of technology transfer?</h4><p>There isn't much in the way of technology transfer. Over the years, Kale Aero has developed its own know-how and engineering background to be the best in what we do. Only aerospace-grade raw materials are imported, and the products are manufactured here with our own capabilities. Working with our counterparts at Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Spirit, and others, certain improvements, small design changes, and revisions are made accordingly for the mutual benefit of customers as well as for Kale Aero.</p><h4>What are your current export volumes?</h4><p>In 2008 our turnover was about $6.7 million. In 2009 it was $12.3 million, and in 2010 it was $23 million. In 2011, it was $30 million. Our projection for the 2015-2016 period is to achieve $54 million in sales turnover. Over the long term, the aim is to become a $100 million company by 2023. However, there are certain bottlenecks in developing or creating new businesses, because we are a private and 100% family-owned Turkish company. Kale Aero is the only enterprise in this sector not to have the advantage of the government ownership and participation and the customer partnership behind it. We had to work very hard to get to where we are.</p><h4>How is Kale Aero developing from being a supplier to a producer?</h4><p>About a year ago Kale Group signed a 51%-49% joint-venture (JV) agreement with Pratt &amp; Whitney, one of the world's largest aircraft engine companies, to manufacture parts and subassemblies for the F-135 engine as well other military and commercial jet engines. It will be a greenfield operation located in Izmir province, and the production facility will be completed by late this year. In four year's time, we estimate that the company will have an annual turnover of $84 million. We accomplished this all on our own merits, and we are very proud of the outcome. At Kale Aero, we are also very open to partnerships and have already had companies approach us. We can communicate the JV idea with companies that could bring value-added to the mutual benefit of both sides and develop the innovation side of the company. In 2011, there was a tender from the Undersecretary for Defense Industries (SSM) to develop Turkey's first turbo jet engine for the stand-off missile project. Kale Aero was awarded the contract at the beginning of 2012. It is a four-year project where we will develop and deliver a complete turbo jet engine to the SSM. This is a great achievement for us, and we are very proud. We will start with a prototype and then move on to mass production. If the need arises, we will create new facilities and make fresh investments in Turkey accordingly.</p><h4>What makes Turkey such an attractive partner for international aerospace giants?</h4><p>First off, Turkey is a NATO country. For the F-35 program, we are one of the countries that actually wanted to put in the resources. With SSM involvement right from start, this is a big asset for companies like us. The portion of the equipment investment at Kale Aero was done through an SSM credit line for the F-35 program. I now see that there are other small companies applying for the same credit lines also. Eventually, as Kale Aero becomes a $50 million-$100 million company, we would like to develop our own sub-tiers, because we believe that you can't do it all on your own.</p><h4>How is Turkey perceived by international aerospace companies?</h4><p>When Kale Aero was awarded a contract for the substantial portion of the international scope of work from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, there were typical concerns in giving work to a company 5,000 miles away. However, upon completion of the stringent due diligence survey in engineering, planning, manufacturing, quality, and special process capabilities on rate readiness, there was no doubt whatsoever. The F-35 is currently an expensive plane, and there is a great pressure from US Congress as well as from other partner countries on Lockheed Martin Aeronautics to bring the cost of the plane down to a certain level, which reflects on us too.</p><p>However, in parts production, one can only reduce the costs to a certain level, since all the raw materials have to be imported, and value-added is not as much. If subassemblies and major assemblies were contracted to Kale Aero, that is where real cost savings could be achieved due to lower direct labor rates.</p><h4>Who is your greatest competition?</h4><p>There is competition around the world. Europe is expensive due to rigid labor laws and low hours of work a week, while we work a standard 45 hours per week with very flexible shifts. We have good engineers, a very qualified labor force, and high-quality, on-the-job training. We recruit young engineers primarily from Turkish universities, rather than directly recruiting from other companies.</p><h4>Are you looking to expand into any other markets?</h4><p>We recently signed a large contract for 10 years with Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) for the Korean General Utility Helicopter program. We are definitely looking for more business opportunities from large commercial aircraft manufacturers. Our current turnover is heavily on the military side, and we would like to grow more on the commercial projects side where, ideally, 50% of our business should be.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[favorable-forecast]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the climate for international investors in the media sector?<br></h4><p>Robert Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch came to Turkey way back in the 1980s during the Özal era. They wanted to buy one of TRT's channels at the time, but the legislation was not there, so they could not obtain permission. Now, of course, Murdoch has an empire that stretches from Australia to the US. In that context, Turkey is very appealing as it is the 15th or 16th biggest economy in the world with advertising revenues on the rise every year. However, despite annual growth in advertising revenues of about 30%, total ad spend is still small at some 0.3% of GDP, especially when compared to the 1.5%-2% seen in the EU. This means that media revenues could increase five to seven fold. Therefore, it is a very appealing investment area.</p><h4>Which areas of the media will be growth areas?</h4><p>Unfortunately, newspapers are a dying brand. Newspapers are still alive because they are content creators, and as long as they keep providing content for television and radio they will survive. However, I do not expect more than one or two decades lifespan for newspapers. Therefore, the most interesting areas are television and the entertainment industry, such as video games. In terms of ad spend, internet and outdoor advertising seem to be the fastest growing sub-segments. When you look at the demographics, eventually those people who have not had much involvement with the internet will die, and the new internet-savvy generation will replace them.</p><h4>To what extent does Turkish entertainment have an impact on the region?</h4><p>Turkey is trying to be a role model for the region and, of course, Turkish drama series have an enormous impact on that. They are introducing a new way of life, and a new approach for women—working women, and women who have personal freedom. Turkish television series are now being run in at least 43 different markets, from Central Asia to the Atlantic coast. The whole Balkan region also watches Turkish television. It creates a circle of affinity. In the early stages of Turkish television we had Mexican, Argentinean, and Brazilian dramas, which were far closer to the hearts of Turks than US series. The characters were much more Turkish. This is now how Turkish series are being exported, and that is how Turkey is making money. When the private channels started up in 1990, we had enormous difficulty in trying to put together one drama series. It was a big adventure. Now, producers are churning out about 20-25 episodes of various drama series every week. It has become a very, very big industry in that respect, and the Turkish drama stars get the treatment of mega stars like Tom Cruise or Angelina Jolie when they travel anywhere in the region.</p><h4>How does this play into Doğan's strategy to become a big player in the international market?</h4><p>Doğan is investing quite a lot in these drama series, and as they are very successful right now in the Turkish television industry; their success helps to promote this type of product. Doğan is getting more and more into this area. It has its special arm, D Productions, which is solely dealing in this area, producing, selling, and exporting. It is a very strong asset for Doğan in that respect.</p><h4>What will be the hot topics on the Turkish news agenda in the years to come?</h4><p>As always in Turkey, the most important topic on the agenda will be the Kurdish question. That has to be addressed properly, and the right planning and execution is needed to get this settled. Secondly, regional links will be of utmost importance due to the significance of the region in which Turkey finds itself. Turkey cannot remain an island of stability forever, and the problems of the region need to be solved. Thirdly, we have to see how this economic crisis in Europe will be solved, and how Turkey's relations with the EU will develop. In the past, the EU was the ideal target for Turkey. Now, due to inefficient economic and political policies, Europe has started to lose its appeal in the eyes of the Turks. Around 10 years ago, 75% of the public supported accession to the bloc. Now, this figure is considerably lower. Therefore, I believe the EU has to tidy up its operations, and we have to wait and see what sort of leadership will emerge in Europe, because the current leaders are short sighted and are concentrating more on local political games, which is costing Europe a lot.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Local in Entrepreneur]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-local-in-entrepreneur]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In June 2009, along with several hundred business, government, academic, and foundation leaders from around the world, I attended President Obama's Summit on Entrepreneurship in Washington, DC—the first global forum focused on building entrepreneurship in Muslim-majority countries and Muslim communities. Sixteen months later, Prime Minister Erdoğan hosted a second summit with a similar focus—Entrepreneurship, Values, and Development: A Global Agenda—and I again welcomed the opportunity to participate in a discussion of best practices and new insights on how to stimulate entrepreneurial activity.<br></p><p>At the forum, Vice-President Biden quoted an adage from US politics: all politics is local. In my own view, all entrepreneurship is local as well. Reinforcing this theme, Dr. Cevdet Yılmaz, Minister for Development, outlined the ways Turkey is building regional capabilities rather than undertaking a centrally planned entrepreneurial development process.</p><p>The success of a “bottom-up" approach is reflected in the research and practical experience of decades of work at Babson on factors that foster entrepreneurship and how the entrepreneurial process generates economic growth and jobs. As the number one school in the world for educating and training the next generation of entrepreneurs, advancing entrepreneurship has been Babson's central mission for the better part of half a century. This has led us in recent years to launch a global outreach initiative, partnering with like-minded institutions of higher education, as well as with governments, philanthropists, and companies, to diffuse our practice-oriented pedagogy and tools for policymakers worldwide.</p><p>One of our newest initiatives, the Babson Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Project, is demonstrating on every continent and in very different environments how to build entrepreneurial ecosystems using a codifiable and replicable methodology. The goal is always the same—to foster high growth entrepreneurial ventures on a self-sustaining basis. What we have learned is highly relevant to Turkey and its shift to “bottom up" entrepreneurial development.</p><p>Three years into the project, we can tell you with absolutely clarity what does not work. Institutions typically try to stimulate entrepreneurship by emulating Silicon Valley in California—even though attempting to replicate someone else's success that evolved, and was not designed, in a dramatically different environment, is a serious mistake. Another error is resorting to “silver bullets"—incubators, angel networks, venture capital, education, micro finance, or technology transfer from universities. Each of these can play a significant role, but each must also be part of a broad-based ecosystem that is appropriate for a particular environment.</p><p>Another measure that does not work is the “top-down" selection of sectors, clusters, or companies that are deemed to be “winners." These strategies, typically driven by government organizations, have been a great disappointment in global economic development. Equally disappointing is the adoption of a single nationwide policy by governments, under the assumption that regional differences can be homogenized. That understates the complexity of the situation—and the reality that the elements of an entrepreneurial ecosystem must be intentionally designed on a local or regional basis.</p><p>In contrast to what has not worked, we can advance some recommendations based on what has worked in other parts of the world that we believe will lead to substantially more positive outcomes. We have learned in developed economies that most job growth, particularly on a large scale, comes from a small portfolio of high-impact growth enterprises that are nurtured by the ecosystems of specific geographies. This explains why it is so important to move forward from an understanding that all ecosystems are local.</p><p>I have visited Turkey on several occasions at different times in my life and there is no question that the robust economic growth and development over the past several years has stimulated an environment for entrepreneurs that has never existed before. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2011 data—showing that slightly less than 12% of the population identifies itself as being invested in entrepreneurial activities—when coupled with Turkey's robust growth, suggests that there is huge potential for educating and training people to identify opportunities and see the possibility of becoming entrepreneurs. Opportunities abound throughout Turkey and the locus of activity needs to continue to shift from the central government to regional and local initiatives to capitalize on these opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-the-rise]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has 2011 been for the real estate sector and for your business in particular?</h4><p>The past year has been much harder than previous years mainly because we started OnaltıDokuz Istanbul, our first real estate project. Previously we had only operated in tourism; starting with the Four Seasons Hotel. We have two Four Seasons properties, one is in Sultanahmet and the other is on the shores of the Bosphorus. Both hotels have been voted among the best hotels in the world. The Sultanahmet property has been voted the best hotel in Europe by Condé Nast Traveler for the past four years. The Bosphorus hotel has also been voted the second best business hotel in the world.</p><h4>Has Astay Yatırım's move into residential real estate been successful?</h4><p>OnaltıDokuz is our first residential project, located in Zeytinburnu. It contains 496 units, of which 40% will be apart hotel facilities. We have another project, Academia Apartments, in Avcılar, Istanbul, where we're aiming to create housing solutions for students and academics, mainly. Our primary target for that area is university students, professors, and investors who would like to rent their apartments to students. It has several floor plans, including one-bedroom, one-living-room plans, and two-bedroom, one-living-room plans. It has been a great success; we started very slowly, finishing the construction first and only beginning to market the spaces afterward, which is unusual in Turkey. In three days we sold 70 apartments, which was surprising because it was the beginning of September, and no one was in the market, but we have sold about 95% of the spaces. We are not a construction company. We are developers working with specialized contractors, able to deliver the Academia Apartments two months prior to our promised date. We began delivering the apartments in August 2011. It was a great success in construction and marketing. The rough construction of OnaltıDokuz will be finished at the end of November 2011. So far we have sold 85% of the apartments, and if we are not mistaken, we will be finished with the interior and deliver the apartments at the end of March 2012.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for 2012?</h4><p>Our goal is not to exceed 1,000 units per year. Other companies will build 20,000 units per year, but we will not exceed 1,000. Astay has a reputation in the A+ market, which is very narrow. We wish to build the Four Seasons Residences in Istanbul, as the owners of the Four Seasons Hotels in Turkey. They will boast the well-known Four Seasons Hotel quality. We also announced in March 2011 that we had bought some land in Bodrum, which we will develop as a Four Seasons Hotel and Four Seasons Residences. There will also be a small area of non-branded villas at that location. Those two Four Seasons-branded projects are our projects for the next year, but we will never exceed more than 1,000 units a year.</p><h4>How has the company become so flexible?</h4><p>We are good at creating new markets. What we did with Academia was very unusual. The quality of the construction at Academia is unmatched in the region. When we announced our prices, most people said we were crazy, and that those prices would not work in this market, but we said we would try. The materials that we used to build Academia were the same that we  used at the Four Seasons, and the prices are unmatched. When we began constructing the Bosphorus Four Seasons, we had a huge body of know-how to put into building a hotel. It took an extra year to finish it, but it was worth it. We delayed it a year, we took it at a slow pace, but the outcome is unparalleled even among Four Seasons Hotels. We used this as a springboard to inject our know-how from the Four Seasons into building OnaltıDokuz.</p><h4>How do you approach marketing your properties?</h4><p>The marketing department at OnaltıDokuz has a lot of toys to play with. Such toys include real 3D visuals, so you can enter an apartment with 3D glasses; we were the first in Turkey to do that. We also have 2D visuals and video; it took us six months to prepare everything. We worked with the best available marketing and design firm for this technology and also for other marketing pieces such as catalogs. Every level of our company is involved in marketing decisions—even our chairman gets involved.</p><h4>You have been good at identifying and creating new markets. What can you identify for the future? What new types of foreign investors in real estate do you foresee coming into Turkey?</h4><p>Istanbul is its own market. It's like a country unto itself. And it's not finished yet, it's only just beginning—52% of construction in Istanbul isn't even licensed. In light of the recent earthquake in Van, and the prime minister's push to renovate and earthquake-proof buildings, a new market will open up in Istanbul. The resources to satisfy the construction market in Istanbul don't exist locally; it will be necessary to import a lot of contractors, mainly from places like India and China. Now, people don't want to park their cars on the streets, and they will need social areas, pools, fitness centers, and spas. Even if they don't have the money for OnaltıDokuz, they will go to Academia Apartments instead. Both of those projects have the same infrastructure in these respects.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the upcoming new reciprocity law, allowing more foreigners to purchase property in Turkey?</h4><p>Even in the absence of this law, people who come to Turkey do have the right to establish a company and purchase property in the name of that company. That is how it has been done up until now, but it can be a hindrance. We have a potential backlog of a million requests from Europe, the Middle East, Europe, and Central Asia. Investors from the Middle East are especially interested in buying property in Turkey. I don't know why it has been such a hot market for the past five years.</p><p>Due to the crisis in the US and Europe, I think people from there will not be as interested in investing in real estate, because they lost too much liquid capital that way. Our prime minister and Foreign Minister Davutoğlu have a great dialogue with Middle Eastern countries. They now have a new vision for Turkey. They have the capital, and we have know-how. Istanbul has the greatest body of know-how in terms of construction.</p>]]></richbody0content>
