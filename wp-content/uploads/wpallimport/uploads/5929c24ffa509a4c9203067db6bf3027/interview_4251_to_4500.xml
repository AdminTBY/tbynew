		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is SQU's role in helping to diversify the Omani economy?</h4><p>In order to support the Sultanate's efforts to diversify its economy, SQU is keen on producing graduates who have the skills needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive job market through targeted programs. Our academic programs are aimed at addressing the acknowledged skills shortages that exist in a number of sectors that coexist with a high level of unemployment. We continuously update our curriculum, teaching methods, and revamp the whole education system to focus on science, technology, and engineering along with other vital fields. The aim is training Oman's youth population to take on the jobs that employers need to achieve His Majesty's visionary plans to bring diversification, industrialization, privatization, and increased integration into the global economy. As a leading university with a strong regional presence, SQU is keen on promoting the entrepreneurial skill of our students and their orientation toward strategic research and innovation.</p><h4>What is SQU's take on the increasing number of private education institutions throughout the Sultanate? <br></h4><p>To meet the growing number of students seeking higher education in Oman, and to meet the growing needs of the country in terms of skills development and capacity building, it is vital to have higher educational institutions that offer high-quality training in different fields. The recent increase in the number of private universities in the Sultanate is indeed a sign of progress in society. It indicates that more and more people are keen on acquiring advanced education. At the same time, students are eager to enroll in public higher educational institutions as well. The most sought after higher educational institution in the country is indeed SQU, the one and only national university that carries His Majesty's name. SQU is the premier higher educational institution in the country and continues its role as a model for other universities and higher educational institutions in Oman in terms of teaching and research.</p><h4>What steps is SQU taking in order to ensure that students are prepared for the demands of the private sector?</h4><p>A national-level project is in place to harmonize the output of higher education with the needs of the labor market. SQU is associating with several organizations and authorities for the successful completion of this vital project that will have a significant positive impact on the development process in the Sultanate. The project resulted in the establishment of a system of specialized studies in the labor market and a specialized database to assess the current and future needs of the Omani labor market in terms of expected numbers, skills, and disciplines required. The team seeks to build an economic model that helps to assess the future needs of jobs in the Sultanate according to different economic scenarios. It seeks to find quantitative results for the future needs of the Omani labor market for qualified human resources according to different scenarios, and find indicators about the important skills needed by the labor market from an employer's point of view. Other objectives of the team include finding indicators about graduates' satisfaction about the programs offered by higher education institutions in preparing them to join the labor market.</p><h4>What are SQU's main objectives for 2018?<br></h4><p>SQU is looking forward to receiving institutional accreditation to ensure the quality of our programs and services, which include academic and research programs and services provided to the community. We continue our efforts to promote the university's position at the local, regional, and international levels, and to ensure excellence to cultivate a culture of quality within the university's community, including staff and students. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Ministry of Education been developing a social platform for Oman through education?</h4><p>In the early 1970s, education was not available in most places; there were only three schools in the entire Sultanate. The idea was to expand education and introduce formal education. The strategy of the country and the vision of His Majesty was to focus on education as a priority. It took us almost 15 years to introduce schools in most places. Until three or four years ago, education was not compulsory, but access to education rose to 97%. We then started focusing on quality by emphasizing education infrastructure and training Omani teachers. The last reviews were in 2013 and 2015, which were done by the World Bank and an expert team from New Zealand. We reformed the curriculum and worked on what we call the Standards Project, which would bring the Omani education system up to international standards. Recently, we signed an agreement with Cambridge Press, and starting in 2017 through 2020, we will stagger the implementation of Cambridge International Examination Board standards in math and science at all grade levels. In addition, we are introducing English under the same international standards, which will require an intensive training for teachers. </p><h4>How is the ratio of Omani and expatriate teachers expected to evolve in the coming years?</h4><p>We have started to see a 5% decline in Omani teachers; now Oman has 90% Omani teachers versus 10% expatriate. We expect a teacher shortage in the coming five years if we do not attract more teachers, especially male teachers and teachers in certain subjects such as math and science. Our priority is to attract Omani teachers, as we want stability in our teaching staff that can remain in Oman for a long period of time. We expect to keep the ratio up between 90 and 95%, but we expect many retirements by 2020 and beyond. In addition, there is a significant growth in the number of students, so we need more teachers and may require an increase in the number of expatriate teachers.</p><h4>What are the ministry's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>Our main goal is to continue improving overall education and providing quality education for everybody in the country. In 2018, we are looking forward to a new curriculum, including international series of math and science. In addition, we have started the new reforms in other subjects such as Arabic, in which we are implementing a new system. We are also turning more toward ICT systems in education, and most of our labs now are equipped with smart boards and other electronic curriculums. For 2020, we are planning four focus areas to update with a modern curriculum, which will terminate the need for the infamous “foundation year" for freshmen university students. Secondly, we are working on and hope to bring in a new Education Law. The law has been drafted, and we are waiting for approval from higher authorities. The third area is to make sure that all teachers are well trained, especially those who are coming from outside Oman and who need to update their knowledge and skills. The fourth area is to decentralize and give more authority to regions to run their schools. When it comes to education support, we want to focus on nutrition and psychological development of students. We are currently working on three projects; one is to expand opportunity for sports in schools by providing more infrastructure. The second is to continue working with the Authority for Food Security to provide a system of healthy nutrition for students. Finally, we encourage more international investment in education by attracting more private international schools to come to Oman. We are discussing with the Ministry of Housing to provide land for these projects and are trying to facilitate investment in education so that people have a choice between government and private education. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Mazoon Dairy Company?</h4><p>The Mazoon Dairy Company is a private equity initiative, supported by the Food Security Policy of the Sultanate of Oman. This project is supported by government institutions and investors. The vision and mission of Mazoon Dairy Company is to meet the dairy and nutritional needs of the Sultanate and grow the country's net food exports. There is approximately 5-6% growth in dairy consumption every year, and 70% of the market needs within the GCC are imported. The goal of Mazoon Dairy Company has been to plug this deficit and stimulate the local dairy industry. Unlike other dairy farms around the world, Mazoon Dairy consists of a fully integrated facility that includes a dairy farm, processing plant, packaging facilities, and even marketing and logistics facilities under one umbrella. Our products include fresh milk, flavored milk, yogurts, juices, cheese, and ice cream. We will bring the latest technology in dairy and juice production, aiming for maximum consumer satisfaction and a leading position in the global market in the near future.</p><h4>What are your commercial production targets for 2018?</h4><p>Our production plan is made up of two phases. Under Phase I, Mazoon Dairy Company plans to produce approximately 360,000 liters of milk and juices over a four-year period. Under phase II, the plan is to produce approximately 750,000 liters of milk and juices over a 10-year period. The farm will house approximately 8,000 cows from the Europe, the US, and Australia in 2018 and 2019, with around 4,000 animals arriving in the first year and the rest in following years. We have plans to grow the herd naturally at the farm, and our target is to house a total of 25,000 by 2028.</p><h4>Why are you sourcing your cattle from these specific countries?</h4><p>We have to ensure that our cattle are high milk producing and disease free, which is why we source them mostly from Europe, Australia, and the US. However, it is important to note that the highest-milk-producing cows in the world do not come from the Netherlands or New Zealand, but from hot countries such as Saudi Arabia, where cows produce an average of 40-45 liters per day. In the absence of suitable climatic conditions for cattle rearing, the region has had to compensate with good genetics and technology to enhance productivity. Capital investment in technology—quality housing systems and cooling systems—is expensive. This is why we focus on genetically superior cows.</p><h4>Are your product branding and export plans already in place?</h4><p>Mazoon Dairy Company is a unique project. The region has not seen a project of this scale and magnitude in the past 30 years. Mazoon Dairy, however, will produce dairy and dairy-related products such as ice cream and cheese along with range of juice products. Other existing projects in the region have evolved over the last 30 years in terms of quality and their portfolio, but Mazoon will make its full line of products available from early stage. We have conducted a comprehensive market study to assess local demand and will look at filling the supply deficit. We are not only focused on setting up a dairy farm and importing the best cattle, but we want to establish a sustainable organization and business. Our OMR100-million (USD259.7-million) project is 50% funded by shareholder equity and the other half is funded by banks. The plant is being developed by the PM Group from Ireland, while the farm is being undertaken by Jake &amp; Martin from the US, which specializes in hot climate farming. We have already carried out some preliminary construction, completing the fencing, roads, and site office. The main construction is scheduled to begin by the end of 2017. We expect to be up and running toward the end of 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In light of celebrating 30 years in 2017, how has the hospital and Ministry of Health evolved to reach this important milestone?</h4><p>The Royal Hospital was commissioned in 1987. Built by Wimpey-Alawi LLC with the intense involvement of Omani leaders of the medical profession, the structure set a benchmark in hospital planning and design and became a model to be replicated in all regions of the country. Being the main healthcare provider, and blessed with a wise and stable leadership and support of the Ministry of Health, the hospital was able to lay out a strong network of primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare institutions and implement a referral system. This helped the Royal Hospital to transform itself from a state-of-art district hospital to an acute-care, tertiary-level apex referral center serving all regions of the country. And over the last two and half decades, the ministry has consistently provided resources to enable the Royal Hospital to upgrade its technology in step with leading hospitals in the developed world. The Royal Hospital also fulfills the role of a secondary-care hospital for Muscat as well as the major teaching hospital for the Sultan Qaboos University College of Medicine, Oman Medical Specialty Board post-graduate residency program, nursing institutes, and other allied health courses. Over the years, the Royal Hospital has expanded, specialized, and strived for centers of excellence to manage non-communicable diseases highly prevalent in Oman. Thus, many specialty centers were established. The Hyperbaric Medicine Centre is the latest addition, which is in the process of being commissioned. Also, 2016 was significant in terms of another significant milestone: the Medical Laboratory achieved ISO accreditation in August, and the Hospital attained recognition by Accreditation Canada International in December.</p><h4>To what extent have recent liquidity issues impacted the Omani healthcare system?</h4><p>While the economic downturn caused by the low price of crude oil has negatively impacted development projects, this period has given the Royal Hospital and the Ministry of Health a golden opportunity to search for more cost-effective ways of delivering healthcare. Several strategies were deployed to improve efficiency and reduce system waste. Besides making the staff more patient-focused, applying these concepts has achieved encouraging results. As an example, in the Adult Emergency Department, 55% of patients had a turnaround time of more than four hours in 2015. Currently, no more than 8-10% of patients wait more than four hours before getting admitted or discharged. Buoyed by this success, the hospital has now set up a performance improvement unit and another training program is being organized. So the need to “tighten the belt" during this period of economic uncertainty has been a driving force for government healthcare facilities to review their efficiency in resource utilization, achieve higher targets, find ways to minimize waste, and set up key performance indicators to benchmark and improve performance.</p><h4>How has the policy of Omanization developed in the healthcare sector, and how qualified is current local personnel?</h4><p>As the policy of Omanization was actively promoted since the early years, all heads of departments and clinical units, most of the senior doctors, the nursing administration, heads of nursing units and wards, and all senior technologists at the Royal Hospital are Omani. This is true even for highly specialized areas like cardiology and cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology and radiology, nuclear medicine, minimally invasive surgery, medical and radiation oncology, neonatology, pediatric intensive care, pediatric nephrology, pediatric and adult gastroenterology, pulmonology, and endocrinology. After their residency program in Oman, most doctors have obtained fellowship degrees from the UK, Canada, or the US, and have undergone advanced subspecialty training at leading centers abroad. So the Royal Hospital has not experienced any drop in throughput, quality of care, or level of sophistication in clinical procedures after the departure of expatriate doctors. Furthermore, since most consultant positions in capital area hospitals are filled, after advanced training abroad, Omani doctors are now returning to regional hospitals, too. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of private healthcare, what trends do you see in the development of health providers in Oman?</h4><p>Over the last five years, we have worked extremely hard with the private sector. The private sector is growing in the right direction; however, we still need to see more being done because, unfortunately, many of the procedures that the government does are not done at the private level and many Omanis still go abroad for treatment because of this. If there was a strong private health sector in Oman, most of those people would seek a second opinion locally instead of flying abroad. There is a great opportunity and potential for the private sector to grow further. The Ministry of Health is in fact outsourcing all its logistics services. I know of partnerships between Omani companies and international hospitals to set up centers in Oman. We welcome all, though all within a system of quality that aims for international accreditation.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Health demonstrate leadership regarding Omanization?</h4><p>One of our aims is to have Omanization without compromising on quality. In healthcare, we seek quality, not nationality. I prefer to see Omanis in all posts, but only when we prepare them and get them ready to take over from expatriates. We have an Omanization rate of about 34% for doctors in the Ministry of Health. We are doing much better in other healthcare providers because their training time is shorter; for example, nurses and physiotherapists train for three to four years, and the overall Omanization rate within the healthcare sector is above 65%. In certain hospitals, over 90% of nurses are Omani. We train most of them locally and then send them abroad for further courses. Further education of doctors and professionals is one of my priorities, even with the financial constraints; we have not slowed down funding, scholarships, and further training for our healthcare providers.</p><h4>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have been on the rise in the past years throughout the Sultanate; how has the ministry faced this issue?</h4><p>Unfortunately, NCDs are spreading worldwide and this is the case in this region mainly due to lifestyle. Diabetes, which leads to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and so on, is the leading cause of death in Oman, as well as in neighboring countries. GCC countries are the world capitals for diabetes. Oman was selected as one of 12 countries worldwide to focus on achieving the development sustainable goals in regards to NCDs. We had around 12-14 UN experts come to Oman to plan how to tackle NCDs. For this, we created a national committee to follow up on our efforts and explore best practises to reduce NCDs. The Ministry of Health by itself cannot regulate people's diets, create exercise plans for the public, stop people from smoking, or control prices; this is why we need the collaboration of every sector and each person to have a healthier lifestyle. We need help from the media, and it is in fact helping to spread the message in a better way. We have a Ministry of Health social media account that we use widely to reach out to the younger generation, which is around 50-60% of the population.</p><h4>What are your goals for the year and how do you plan on achieving them?</h4><p>Our plans and ambitions are huge; however, we are also realistic about how much we can implement. In the five-year plan that ended in 2016 we had many projects that were not completed. Some of them are important, and I have made them as priorities for this year. One of our ambitions is to begin building at least three of our 10 planned hospitals. Secondly,  a survey we recently started on NCDs will help to educate the public in regards to development sustainable habits. We want to build more and improve collaboration with international organizations as well as governmental and nongovernmental bodies to train our doctors and increase the number of doctors available. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Al Morooj Dairy fit into the Sultanate's food security and self-sufficiency strategy?</h4><p>The self-sufficiency strategy in the Sultanate starts with utilizing the country's resource potential, which is quite significant in fisheries, poultry and red meat, dairy and, to some scale, plant farming. These resources can form a good start and can viably cover a good portion of domestic demand for food if carefully selected investment were undertaken to develop them on commercial lines. By investing in milk collection and processing in Dhofar, which is a totally domestic resource-based investment, Al Morooj Dairy is setting forth a milestone for utilizing these resources toward contributing to food security, which in our case materializes in small-scale native livestock raising activities, natural pastures, and a suitable hosting environment. By undertaking this investment, Al Morooj will trigger small- and medium-sized investments across the Sultanate that can boost food production using domestic resources, an activity that will very much fit into country self-sufficiency in food.</p><h4>How is Al Morooj Dairy's milk collecting project expected to impact Jebel herders?</h4><p>One of the strategic purposes of our government for adopting a milk collection project was to utilize milk produced in the traditional sector but is wasted, and integrate small farmers' cow and camel raising activities into the mainstream production processes of the national economy. This sector has been growing in isolation from the speedily developed modern market economy since the start of the Omani Renaissance. It needs to be integrated into the formal economy if it should contribute to food security in a calculated and regulated manner. We anticipate that milk collection and processing shall have a transformational impact on the Jebel herders by reorienting their activities and driving the sector to a market context in the long term. The project will contribute to increasing farmers' income, downsizing herds by voluntary de-stocking, and controlling livestock raising to a modern farming style. We will likely encounter difficulties in the beginning. In the long term, however, we anticipate having a more business-oriented farmer society in Dhofar with the younger generation willingly involved in dairy production business, motivated by the profitable livestock raising environment that would be created by the project. Furthermore, the project will create job opportunities among the rural youth in modern dairy processing activities, which will form a total shift from traditional dairy skills to technically sophisticated processing skills.</p><h4>How will investment in advanced processing technique help increase the quality and quantity of dairy in Oman?</h4><p>Currently, farmers follow traditional processing methods that were passed down by their ancestors and, of course, that are limited in scale, with large waste in raw product. Investing in advanced processing will have unmistakable impacts on product quality and quantity. Advanced processing will introduce hygiene and animal health standards in the production and product process, and this will promote a better quality of products. This together with healthy packing and product classification will offer the now missing quality touches to the products. Today, only a negligible quantity of cow and camel milk reaches the market due to low hygiene standards, questionable production practices, and fierce competition from the modern dairy sector. Advanced processing will avail the opportunity to the community to sell all cow and camel milk it can offer through the permanent market outlets that would be created for them by the project. The project will also encourage farmers to concentrate on milk production, and hence, they would be likely to choose voluntarily de-stocking of non-productive animals and adopt modern breeding techniques to increase milk productivity and cutting cost per unit by producing more with fewer animals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the company expanding to increase the production of flour?</h4><p>We expect to complete our expansion plans at the beginning of 2018. After that, we will receive government payments allocated for the strategic storage of our wheat from where we can begin selling our primary product. The Port of Sohar, for example, is an interesting location for us as many of our transportation activities take place right there, making it cost effective due to the already established logistics platform. The population of Oman is increasing by about 7% YoY, thus the demand for flour products is also increasing by roughly the same percentage. There is a great deal of growth potential, and we have partners that have the right experience. The right alliances in strategic food-related activities will help us become more sustainable and allow us to help the government achieve its vision for food security. The coming years will bring a great deal of competition—as new flour mills have entered the market—and we need to be prepared. Our strategy is to focus on our core businesses and produce quality products because, for us, customer satisfaction and loyalty are critical. We wish to remain their preferred brand of flour and bakery products.</p><h4>What effect will investments from Libya and Japan have on the Omani food market and economy?</h4><p>The Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Oman is opening up to foreign investment. This affects local producers and leads to higher competition and price fluctuations and, at the same time, addresses the food security target in a positive way. We are in the process of negotiating one of the largest agreements for egg production in the Middle East with Japan and other regional producers. Currently, around 60% of eggs are imported, and we have found that imported eggs are not up to the required standard. This is why we linked ourselves with one of the largest Japanese egg producers, who can provide technical support to produce quality eggs. Incentives like this one have helped the value of our shares increase year after year. Our budget for 2018 is USD30 million, and we plan on using it for sustainable projects.</p><h4>What other markets does Oman Flour Mills export to now?</h4><p>We export flour and bakery products to more than 10 countries in the GCC and Africa. We want to expand our export base, but at the same time wish to remain the leading and preferred producer of bakery and flour products in Oman. In terms of flour specifically, we are not looking across borders because competition is great, and our core strength is the local market. For the time being, we have many projects underway.</p><h4>What objectives do you have for 2018, and how do you plan to achieve them?</h4><p>2018 will be a difficult year. Oman is stable, though we have to be realistic; there is not much predicted growth in GCC countries. For Oman, 1H2017 marked a USD2.4-billion deficit. In 2H2017, it could reach USD5 billion, which, altogether, makes our debt about USD15 billion. Our rates and debt may be lower than Dubai, though that money will not be allocated to investment. It will go toward paying salaries, operating costs, and interest to maintain government loans. Companies in Oman have to be smart now in order to figure out where and how to make profit. It is beneficial to think about looking outward. Our company will remain sustainable due to the lower depreciation of equipment, as much of our equipment is fully depreciated. The truth is, we produce and sell a very basic commodity—flour, which is consumed universally. The 7% demographic growth will continue to bring more business to our market, and, if the government makes the laws a bit more lenient on investors, a great deal of business will come to Oman. Sustainability is key. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[meat-the-new-oman]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Al Bashayer's current strategy, and how does it align with the government's food security strategy?</h4><p>In 2012 the government created the Oman Food Investment Holding Company (OFIC) with the goal of sustaining the country with regards to food security. OFIC focused on three main projects: first, it created Mazoon Dairy to handle the large amounts of dairy imports entering Oman. Second, OFIC set up A'Namaa Poultry. The third project, which focuses on red meat, is Al Bashayer. Al Bashayer Meat Company was established in 2016 with the same goal of providing food security throughout the Sultanate. Most of the meat entering Oman is imported, and we had to begin thinking about making the market sustainable and more self-sufficient. We plan to cater to 24% of the market's red meat needs in 10 years. There are many options with regards to red meat production including cattle, lamb, goat, and camel. When we studied the market, we saw growth mostly in cattle, followed by sheep and goats.</p><h4>What does the project entail, and how will it impact the overall economy?</h4><p>This project will help set a benchmark for food security in Oman; we will purchase animals from abroad and rear and fatten them locally. We will keep cattle, for example, in quarantine for 60 days to ensure the animals are healthy, at the right weight, and ready for consumption. For sheep and goats, we keep them in quarantine for 40 days. We want to ensure that, when these animals go to the market, people will accept the products. We need a highly traceable system whereby we can trace the animals to their origin, know how they were bred, and know that they have received the right vaccinations. This way we can assure consumers that the meat they are purchasing is top quality, halal, and healthy. This is extremely important in a country like Oman. We want to provide the market with meat that matches the best standards in all these categories; this is the only way consumers will trust the company, therefore making it profitable. As for the project itself, we seek to add value to other animal products. For example, we can place intestines and bones through a rendering plant to later sell these products; their skin can also be treated and sold. We also have manure, which can be sold. Then there is the issue of choosing the site of the project; we can set it up close to farms where manure is purchased from us, or even close to a port to easily transport animals. Choosing the location is also extremely important for the sustainability of the project itself. We seek to implement all these factors together in order to ensure this project is a success.</p><h4>In terms of production, what is the expected target for the first year of production?</h4><p>We expect to have 43,575 cattle, 216,000 sheep, and 97,450 goats in the first year of production. We have built our growth strategy around a safe model whereby we increase production by 3% each year. There is no other similar red meat company or project in the GCC. That is a challenge we face; we are pioneering integrated meat complexes like this. In 10 years, we expect to have 161,000 cattle, 764,000 sheep, and 353,000 goats. With regards to the process itself, the animals will first enter through a 9-sqkm area of land, before being moved into quarantine, followed by a holding area where they will be fattened and treated before being moved to the processing plant. At the processing plant, there are two lines: one for cattle and another for sheep and goats. From there, the final products go either to freezers or whole stock, and finally to dispatch. 2018 will be a fruitful year because of the foundations laid in 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[big-catch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Oman's fisheries grow by 11% every year, faster than most markets. What role has Oman Fisheries Company had in achieving this growth?</h4><p>Oman Fisheries is the largest fishery in the country and the GCC with a capital of approximately OMR12.5 million and turnover of OMR30 million (USD77 million). Being a regional mega processor, and having over 30 years of business expertise in seafood, Oman Fisheries is a name recognized worldwide and is the number-one choice of global fish marketers. Our distribution network spans over 50 countries worldwide, ranging from the US and the EU to island nations like Palau. Furthermore, with our presence through landing centers and network of fishermen along the entire coastline of Oman, we ensure that fish in Oman are harvested optimally, thereby driving the growth of this sector. Beside the active network, Oman Fisheries has five mega plants throughout Oman in Salalah, Shogra, Ashkara, Masirah, and Ghala. These mega plants are complemented by a fleet of trucks, real time management, and a premium warehouse of 9,000-ton capacity in the heart of Muscat. Oman Fisheries Company works closely with the government in terms of the development of the fisheries sector, including research and transformation in this sector to match global perspectives. With a strong team of 500 employees and a family of 7,000-plus fishermen under its belt, the future of Oman Fisheries as a company and the sector as a whole looks bright.</p><h4>What is the current production capacity in the Sultanate, and are there any expansion plans in sight?</h4><p>The current catch of Oman is around 270,000 tons. Out of the entire catch, around 20-25% is processed by Oman Fisheries and SMEs under its purview. Oman Fisheries currently processes more than 40,000 metric tons per annum and intends to double that figure in the coming years. With this goal in mind, we are upgrading our plant capacity by introducing new production lines. On the vertical scale of expansion, Oman Fisheries intends to target value-added products while on the horizontal scale it is targeting increased trading and logistics operations in coordination with its sister company, Al Ameen. We have already generated active demand in new regions in European countries, including Spain, Italy, and Germany, and we plan to expand our business in each of those markets. We also have plans to expand in various southeast Asian countries while expanding our base in China and Taiwan.</p><h4>What is the current state of illegal fishing activity in Oman?</h4><p>From Oman Fisheries' perspective, we strictly ensure that all fish caught from Oman are caught in accordance with the law. The total amount of fish caught and processed by Oman Fisheries is declared both before the regulatory authorities and also before the security markets. The government is working to prevent illegal activity through the enforcement of tighter laws, and illegal fishing activities are noticeably on the decline, due in part to government regulations. It is important to keep in mind that fishing is deeply embedded in Omani culture; Omanis have a long history with the sea, which has shown to make a difference in terms of reducing illegal fishing in relation to other countries that may not have the same extent of cultural awareness. This is also why fishing in Oman will never disappear.</p><h4>How is Oman Fisheries Company looking to expand?</h4><p>The goal is for Oman Fisheries Company to create a holding company with subsidiaries that are specialized in different activities and increase our productivity. We already have two subsidiary companies: Al Ameen and Sharjah FZE, both of which are 100% owned by Oman Fisheries Group. While Al Ameen is a wholesome service provider catering to warehousing, trading, and logistics services, Sharjah FZE caters to the trading activities in the GCC belt, outside Oman. Oman Fisheries is also contemplating the establishment of a separate company to take advantage of the opportunities in Duqm, the future hotspot of economic activity in Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's current strategy in terms of food security in Oman?</h4><p>A'Namaa Poultry Company's main goal is to produce 60,000 tons of poultry and poultry products per annum. Oman currently imports around 75% of the poultry and poultry products needed in the market. We mainly import from Brazil, which supplies around 80%, while the remaining 20% comes from France, Turkey, and Argentina. At times we experience disruptions in this supply chain, and this causes a problem in the market with a shortage of white meat. This is in fact an issue for Oman's national food security. We need to secure the food supply chain for people living here. White meat is the main and cheapest source of animal protein on the market, compared to other sources of animal protein. The government felt we needed to establish a company to take care of all these food projects and thus set up Oman Food Investment Holding Company (OFIC). OFIC's CEO is also the Chairman of A'Namaa Poultry Company. Our goal is to cover at least 50% of the Omani poultry market. Market demand is rapidly increasing in Oman, with an annual growth rate of around 5.4%, with tourism increasing as well by 12% annually. This raises the big question of how we will provide food, including meat, milk, and eggs, for all these people. A'Namaa Poultry Company will also create around 1,500 new job opportunities for nationals and expatriates.</p><h4>Why does Oman source its poultry from countries such as Brazil, and is this expected to change?</h4><p>Brazil is number one in the world in chicken production because it has the raw material, the feed, and it has focused on poultry by all means. We do not intend to ask the government to stop importing from Brazil. Oman has an agreement with the WTO, and we respect our agreements with our partners. Our strength will be providing an Omani product to Oman. In addition, all A'Namaa Poultry Company's products will be guaranteed halal; we have made that commitment to our customers. Thirdly, our poultry will be fresh or frozen daily. In Europe, 90% of the poultry is supplied fresh directly to the market. The Omani market needs to be changed as Omanis go for frozen poultry at the moment. However, even our frozen poultry will be fresher compared to the current supply chain from other countries that takes at least a month to arrive in Oman; our local supply time frame is just two days. In the future, we will try to shift the market from frozen to fresh poultry.</p><h4>How will A'Namaa Poultry Company's operation look in its first phase?</h4><p>We are applying a satellite concept whereby we have a main services area with the farms around it. We will have a factory to produce the feed with a capacity of 500 tons per day. We will have hatcheries that will produce chicks with a capacity of 70 million eggs per year, and a slaughterhouse and processing plant with a capacity of almost 200,000 birds per day. 75% of the cost of producing a chicken is feed. Brazil has soy bean and corn available locally to use as feed, while we have to import all our feed raw materials, which increases the price for us. The Omani National Livestock Development Company produces animal feed, but only for ruminants—cows, sheep, and goats. The type of feed we require for poultry is completely different. Our operation will also have 240 broiler houses once the project is fully completed that can accommodate around 60 million birds per year. We would like to see 50% of the construction completed by 2018 and then be fully operational and producing by YE2019. We already have the engineering consultants and supply vendors in place, and we have secured financing for the project with OMR50 million coming from the bank. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does ONLDC play in delivering Oman Food Investment Company's (OFIC) food security strategy?</h4><p>We are very proud of being part of OFIC, which is working hard toward its vision of improving food security in Oman. ONLDC has a reputation for producing the best animal feed in Oman. In May 2005, ONLDC inaugurated its modern feed mill and roughage plant at Raysut, Salalah with the capacity of 144,000 tons per year. Oman took significant steps to realize food security through enhancing domestic agricultural production, which helped the increase in the self-sufficiency rate in some products such as milk and table eggs. However, the self-sufficiency rate is still low in some other products like red meat and poultry. This is essential to meet the growing demand of food, in terms of both quantity and quality, coming from this country as well as the world as a whole. Our company's approach to the food security question relies heavily on developing domestic natural resources' potential to maximize national capacity for food production. In achieving food security, we are the part of chain in which our goal is to provide the animal feed with the best quality to the livestock in Oman, which will lead to a more stable food retail market and enhance food security in the Sultanate of Oman. We, as a leading Omani animal feed producer, are committed to making the best feeds with the finest raw materials as our contribution to the development in the livestock industry of Oman.</p><h4>What impact is your ONLDC feed mill and roughage plant having on the Omani agriculture sector and the economy in general?</h4><p>The government's economic development policy emphasizes the expansion of non-oil sectors such as agriculture, livestock, and fishing in its bid to diversify the economy and diminish its dependence on oil exports. Omani agriculture sector is growing rapidly, especially after the His Majesty's directives to establish the Food Security Committee. There has been sharp focus on minimizing the dependency on the import of food items from abroad. The livestock sector has been growing by leaps and bounds in Oman, and the requirement of animal feed has also increased the same way. Farmers are more aware of the retail value of their livestock and want to give the best to their animal in order to get high return on investments. We play the role of getting the livestock production ready by providing the highest quality animal feeds so that farmers can get the benefit when selling their livestock. This, in turn, gives the economic boost to the farmers and their vision of expansion in the agriculture sector, which boosts the economy and improves food security in Sultanate of Oman. In the near future, we also have plans to enhance our capabilities of producing higher amount of animal feed. We will also be expanding our product range by investing in R&amp;D for innovative ideas and best international practices.</p><h4>How has your partnership with Amandus Kahl impacted ONLDC's product development and production processes?</h4><p>ONLDC chose Amandus Kahl as the main feed mill machinery supplier because it is a leading global manufacturer of feed mill plants. Together with this, Kahl is a main supplier of equipment, including special flat die pellet mills designed for difficult-to-process materials, like those needed for roughage feeds. In association with Kahl, ONLDC has been able to produce top quality international standard compound feeds for animals in the main feed mill plant and has done several trials in utilizing locally available raw materials to process roughage feeds in the roughage plant. In 2017, with increasing demand for poultry feeds, an additional poultry feed production facility is being constructed in parallel with the roughage unit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Some 90% of food in the GCC is imported. How can OFIC, the government, and the private sector incentivize people to produce and consume food locally instead?</h4><p>The major drivers for investors to invest in new projects will come from their analyses of market demand. Basically, most food projects are driven by consumer demand. It is a case of doing a supply-and-demand analysis of the quality, quantities, and tastes that local producers can meet. Once international investors understand that this is a major driver, they will find it more attractive to do this here. The second factor is Oman's competitive and comparative advantages as a hub for imported food and value addition. Oman's location works to attract international players that want to unload their products here and redistribute them to the rest of the region. For example, products like rice and wheat can be brought here for sorting, re-bagging, and re-branding to fit local consumer demands. We can also use smart water management techniques to ensure available water is not undermined. We focus on smart technologies in order to preserve our water for high-value projects. These competitive and comparative advantages allow us to focus on developing major projects that at times require vast amounts of land. For example, we recently identified 60sqkm of uninhabited, marginal desert land for poultry farming because dry land is the best place to develop poultry projects. This is where we should see major projects in dairy, poultry, and red meat that we are able to produce here at a competitive price.</p><h4>How do you see Oman's red meat, poultry, and dairy markets performing in the coming years?</h4><p>Dairy and protein products are in demand. With the growth of the middle class, people tend to drink more milk and consume more meat. This is our function as a company; OFIC is focused on producing food security-related products. For products we cannot produce locally, there is another government arm, the Public Authority for Stores and Food Reserve, which works in tandem to provide the country with enough grain to survive in an emergency situation. Oman is one of the leading countries in the region in terms of our ability to feed everyone in the country during emergencies and crises. Oman is ranked 26th in the world and number two in the Arab world in terms of food security. This is what countries should plan for because food security is not only about producing food; it is also about logistics and the ability to move food to the right place, at the right time, at the right cost, and accessible to everyone. That is our role working in tandem with the other agencies like the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, and the Public Authority for Stores and Food Reserve, to ensure we are all following a common national strategy to provide food security for Oman.</p><h4>What are OFIC's main goals and objectives for 2017-2018?</h4><p>We want to complete the projects we have started in the dairy, poultry, and red meat sectors. We want to finalize our soy and date projects. We also have a milk collection project in the south of Oman to collect milk from subsistence or small farmers in the dairy sector. We want to do these projects by YE2018 and perhaps see production in the market before mid-2019. Besides these goals we want food security as a theme to become part of every organization and government institution. Beyond that, we aim to see Oman as the food hub for the entire region and the partner of choice internationally for FDI. We want foreign investors to choose Oman as the right place for starting food-related projects. OFIC, along with other government institutions, will be able to provide support, help, and advice to FDIs looking at agribusiness as an option to do business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Undersecretary of Fisheries Wealth, what are you doing to ensure food security in the Sultanate?</h4><p>Food security is one of the most important items on the agenda for this ministry and the government in general. In terms of fish, Oman is self-sufficient. We are currently exporting more than 50% of our fish production in addition to meeting local demand. When it comes to fish, we currently export around the world, including North America, Europe, and our neighbors in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Omani fish products are exported to more than 40 nations around the world. Many of our luxury products, like fresh tuna, go to Europe and North America. Other notable markets include Brazil, Vietnam, China, and Thailand. We tend to go to markets with the highest incentives and highest margins. You can find Omani fish everywhere, both frozen and exported by sea, or fresh delivered by air. We also ship fish in chilled trucks to our neighbors in the UAE, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Fish processing plants are said to be the next step for the fish industry in Oman. How is the ministry delivering in this field?</h4><p>We have achieved double-digit growth in terms of fish production, and the average growth rate over the past five years was 12.1%. That is very big for any wild fish production industry in the world; normally, growth is somewhere around 2-3% maximum. In Oman, we have an open ocean, long coastlines,  committed government, high investment from both foreign and national sources, and solid policies that ensure traders and fishermen get good benefits. For our catch to be sent to different markets, we need processing plants, and they have to adhere to international quality assurance standards. Now we have a policy to develop our fish-processing industry. We have about 114 processing plants, and at least 27 of them are accredited by the EU. Every year we inspect the facilities and, if they pass, we renew their certificates so that they can export without any restriction. We invite inspectors from Brussels to visit us every two to four years to inspect our labs and review regulations, ensuring our procedures are aligned at the international level. We are also pushing private and public sector engagement in the aquaculture industry. Aquaculture will one of the topics of discussion to streamline investment and ensure accelerated growth. We are a few steps away from creating a world-class, competitive fish industry.</p><h4>What are the ministry's main goals for the fisheries sector in 2017 and 2018?</h4><p>We are moving forward to complete every infrastructure project. There are a number of projects ready for tendering, but since there are some difficulties in terms of financing, we are hoping to attract more interest from the private sector. The port in Barka is ready, but we need more facilities. We have promoted it to the private sector and received some good offers. An Omani company is committed to investing in the port and operating it. For 2018, we want to see five or six new projects in aquaculture, adding 40,000 tons of fish to the mix. We are ambitious, as most fishermen are. We are also optimistic. It at least encourages people in Oman and the region to move forward and work together as a team. We also now have good international exposure; our only challenge is to speed up the process. The first salmon farming project is on the horizon and will produce 20,000 tons of high-quality salmon with 100% foreign investment from Norway. The investor wants to develop a site with us that will hopefully be commissioned in 2019. This will attract more projects as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[let-the-good-times-roll]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Arkan differentiated itself from competitors in recent years to position itself as a leader in Oman?</h4><p>In this difficult market, we selected clients with whom we have good relations based on our past performance and did not spread ourselves too thin on too many projects. We knew how substantial an order book we needed for 2017 and the coming year, and we very narrowly focused on these particular clients. We book projects with our required growth margin, balancing overages and profit. At this stage, we do not take on any project where there is a high risk or where we suspect cash flow problems.</p><h4>In which segments do you see the most growth?</h4><p>Right now, many clients are not moving ahead with the new projects due to some pessimism in the market. There is lot of pressure on margins, and many construction companies are ready to work even at direct cost to keep their resources engaged. For many smart investors and clients, this is a good time to start projects as low margin quotes from construction companies will improve their ROI. So, we are hopeful that smart clients will keep on building new residential and commercial projects, hotels, schools, and shopping malls. A company like ours operates in a segment where project value ranges from OMR5-10 million and where private investors are more active. Larger companies, however, need bigger projects, around OMR50-100 million. Such investments for infrastructure projects like highways and the Duqm Special Economic Zone do not generally come from the private sector, but from the public sector.</p><h4>How do you see the cash flow problem affecting the construction sector at large?</h4><p>Many companies are facing cash flow problems. During good times, it was easy for all companies as new orders kept coming along with mobilization advances and timely payments of work invoices by the clients. However, at present there are few projects in the market and same numbers of construction companies chasing those projects. At the same time, projects are facing delays in payments from the clients' side, leading to cash flow problems for many companies. Any company that does not have enough bank support to withstand this period is definitely suffering.</p><h4>Do you see the central bank's bond issuance helping this?</h4><p>I believe the issuance will be a great lifeline. The government is continuously trying its best to support private sector. There will surely be a trickle-down effect of this USD5-billion injection of foreign funding. However, the budget has already been set for 2017, and there will be a deficit. USD5 billion is some relief, but ultimately it will not be enough. Many people predict that oil prices will be up by a reasonable amount by the end of 2017 and that the government's revenue will be back on track.</p><h4>Do you have any expansion projects?</h4><p>We have a plan for the next five years. We have identified some good clients with whom to work. We understand what they are planning over the medium term, and we are focusing on those projects. We have plans to explore opportunities in Salalah, Sohar, and Duqm areas and are actively working on some tenders in these locations. As we are a board-registered, excellent-grade construction company, we are also exploring opportunities to bid for government projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy has Al Tasnim followed to position itself as a leader in the construction sector in Oman?</h4><p>Dhiren C. Khimji During the past decade, Al Tasnim has developed into one of the most reputed multi-service providers within the construction industry in Oman. This has been driven by focusing our activities toward quality and safety. By playing an active part in contributing to some of the country's most recognizable and eminent landmarks, Al Tasnim has fortified its position at the forefront of Oman's construction industry as an organization that is impelled by quality, skill, and timely delivery. Our exceptional workforce, expansive knowledge, dexterity, commitment to safety, and enormous network of resources have empowered us to become an industry leader. As a part of our quality assurance commitment, we place great emphasis on client and customer satisfaction, which ensures lifetime value to the company. A significant formula that has contributed to our success and boosted the credibility of our company has been procuring repeated orders from our clients. We are concentrating on every aspect that will enhance our stronghold in the GCC and across the Middle East.</p><h4>What are Al Tasnim Group's main focus areas in Oman?</h4><p><span></span>DCK From what started off as an equipment leasing company, the group has now become a multi-faceted, multi-disciplined titan in Oman. Since its inception, the group has endeavored relentlessly to deliver the highest-possible standards for its products and services in the construction business. Being a 100% Omani-owned group, its reputation and impressive clientele list speaks volumes of the talent and enterprising spirit of the Sultanate. With a proficient team of over 15,000 employees, the Al Tasnim Group continues to provide Oman with international-quality solutions, products, and skills to cater to the demands of the rapidly growing nation. Some of the group's divisions include cement products, civil construction, oil and gas, roto-molding, building finishes, asphalt, roads and infrastructure, MEP contracting, product dealership and trading, quarrying and mining, hospitality, and health, fitness, and beauty.</p><h4>What does Al Tasnim's oil and gas segment execute in Oman?</h4><p><span></span>Farrokh J. Masani Our oil and gas division executes multi-discipline engineering design, procurement, construction, and pre-commissioning and commissioning services. The division's largest subcontract is an off-plot delivery contract that covers all off-plot works in the South of Oman. This division currently employs 3,000 people, and its extensive track record corroborates its expertise in onshore multi-discipline engineering services. Since its inception, the division has grown progressively and rapidly to become a specialist service provider in the oil and gas sector. The range of services includes fabrication and installations of lines, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe lining, carrying out roto-lining of pipes and spools for on-plot applications, integrity maintenance, station works, multiport selector valves' manifolds, fast-tracked civil and infrastructure development, electrical and control services, and automation engineering solutions.</p><h4>How have innovation and technology helped increase Al Tasnim's reach in the oil and gas sector?</h4><p><span></span>FJM Apart from conventional technologies applied in developing oil and gas fields, we have developed techniques for preventing internal corrosion, i.e. roto-lining for piping spools, which improves the lifespan of wells. In addition to this, we have started manufacturing HDPE liner pipes suitable for internal lining for flow lines for enhancing corrosion protection. To improve our deliverables and productivity to our esteemed clients, we have inducted automatic welding technology for high-thickness pipelines. With this new technology, we have handed over a few projects before the agreed time schedule. With these approaches, we remain competitive and deliver better products with timely project completion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OTC is currently the only college in Oman specializing in tourism. How does that position you in the Omani education market?</h4><p>In 2001, the government decided to establish OTC. It was necessary to have a specialized college that would provide the labor market with qualified, well-trained, local professionals in tourism and hospitality. I want to emphasize that hospitality education and training was the main focus of the college between 2001 and 2013. OTC, as an education and training provider, plays its role very well according to its goals and objective. Its efforts were complemented with another institute specialized in providing training programs in hospitality professions. Currently, there are four or five institutes offering hospitality training programs and also a few colleges and universities offering degree programs in tourism management. The tourism sector is growing fast, and the college is moving in line with the growth of the sector.</p><h4>Given that Oman has a relatively young population, what work needs to be done to attract youth to tourism?</h4><p>The tourism industry is not that attractive to the Omani society at large; it is not seen as an appealing career path, partly because of the stereotypical image it has in the society. We have to educate society, and especially parents, to combat this perception. The tourism industry is large, and it does not only consist of hotels. There are eight sub-sectors within the tourism and travel sector. Attracting students revolves around awareness. Thanks to efforts of stakeholders in general in this regard, the number of students registered at the college and other such institutes has increased. In fact, I can say it is increasing exponentially.</p><h4>Which segments of the tourism and hospitality industry are offered at OTC?</h4><p>We have the capacity to offer any type of training programs that are directly related to tourism and hospitality. The tourism industry has eight sub-sectors as I mentioned. The tourism industry is growing in all areas, and we offer a good number of short courses related to tourism and hospitality.  Also, we offer degrees and diplomas in three specializations—tourism and hospitality management, event management, and tourism marketing—via our affiliation with Dublin Institute of Technology. Tourism and hospitality management is attracting more students, and the new event management degree program is picking up traction, attracting good attention from students. OTC is the only college that offers a degree program in event management.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges for OTC right now?</h4><p>The tourism industry in Oman is facing a major challenge in that the tourism season is barely five months out of the year. The question now is what companies and the government can do to promote tourism all-year round. Due to the seasonality of tourism, companies are reluctant to employ graduates full time. This is one of the reasons why companies do not wish to employ Omanis. They are looking at expatriates who can be employed on a temporary or part-time basis according to seasonal needs. I can understand their point of view, but this is not fair to young Omani graduates. The college is trying to attract more and more students to fill the labor market, which is projected to absorb more than 500,000 jobs by 2040 as per the Oman Tourism Strategy and about 21,000 by 2020 as per Tanfeedh program projection. But employment based on seasonality hinders these efforts. One of the things we do to mitigate this challenge is coordinate with tourism companies to offer educational programs that are more in line with specific market needs so that the graduates will be more suitable for the companies compared to expatriate workers. We make sure that students are well engaged with the industry through on-the-job training or internship training. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The first phase of OCEC was launched in October 2016. What are the next steps in terms of the remaining phases and the delivery of the completed project?</h4><p>We opened OCEC with our first event on October 10, 2016. OCEC is just over a year old now, and within this year, we have hosted 93 events. The current building has five exhibition halls with a total area of just over 22,000sqm, 10 hospitality suites, an extensive concourse, the main production kitchen that covers an area of almost 3,000sqm, and parking for 4,000 cars. That is Phase I of the project. By the end of 2017 or early 2018, we will have Phase II ready. This will comprise an auditorium for 450 people, 13 breakout rooms, and two multi-purpose ballrooms that can be used for banquets, breakout sessions, weddings, small exhibitions, and many other types of events. The showpiece, a main theater with seating for 3,200 people, will welcome its first visitors a little later in 2018.</p><h4>What have you and the government done to differentiate Oman, and specifically OCEC, from competitors in the region?</h4><p>When you come to Oman, you get an authentic and unique experience that you may not have had before. You are going to meet local people. 76% of OCEC's team members are Omani and from various parts of the Sultanate. They are very proud of their country's achievements and keen to share their experiences with visitors. This interaction with locals from the host country is an important part of the experience for international delegates. Added to this, Oman is a beautiful destination. There are so many places to go and see in Oman before or after a conference. Oman has been voted one of the top-10 must-see destinations in the world by several publications, as well as one of the best places for expatriates to live. Talking specifically about the OCEC facility, this well-designed center will be one of the easiest facilities to navigate and offers a wide range of meeting spaces along with essential support services including IT, audio and visual, and five-star catering. The delivery of our services by a dedicated team of professionals will enhance each client's experience and leave a lasting impression.</p><h4>Does Oman have further plans for convention and exhibition centers in other cities to capture the MICE tourism market?</h4><p>As operator of OCEC, AEG Ogden has concentrated on the OCEC project. But this is part of a precinct, and there are two hotels that are almost complete right beside us. The four-star Crowne Plaza will be ready in the next few months, and the five-star JW Marriott hotel will be finished in 2018. There will also be a business park, shopping mall, and residential area in this precinct. In turn, our precinct is going to be part of the much larger 7.4 million sqm Madinat Al Irfan Urban Development Project.</p><h4>What are OCEC's main objectives for 2018 and how do you plan to achieve these?</h4><p>The main objective for 2018 is to attract more exhibition business and make sure we have enough regional and international business for future years. Our long-term objective is to have a positive sustainable economic impact and help Oman's diversification program. The economic impact is not just about money coming in, it is about facilitating knowledge transfer and exchange through our events. It is also about job creation. Once the whole OCEC precinct is fully operational, it will have created around 4,000-6,000 direct jobs. We also want to support SMEs, so, where possible, we source locally from Omani companies. Around an operation like the OCEC, there are so many activities for which we rely on a range of suppliers to service the conference and events sector. Supporting SMEs and creating jobs is one of the objectives of building a convention center in Muscat. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sailing-toward-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Oman Sail's role in the development of the country?</h4><p>Oman Sail was established in 2008 with His Majesty's blessing to rekindle Oman's maritime heritage, promote the Sultanate of Oman through sailing, and provide long-term learning opportunities for the youth of Oman. Our ultimate aim is to use sport to contribute to Oman's socio-economic development. Over the past few years, we have built a solid foundation around three main pillars: sports, tourism, and commerce. From creating a clear pathway for Omani children to become world-class athletes to hosting the most prestigious sporting events in Oman, all our activities have one underlying goal, and that is people development. Oman Sail provides both men and women with an equal opportunity to succeed in sports and contribute to their country. We have a very talented, energized, and 86%-Omanized workforce, all working toward the same objectives—success in sports, promotion of the Sultanate of Oman, and creating sustainable businesses within our areas of expertise.</p><h4>How does the organization boost tourism to Oman?</h4><p>Sailing is a sport that typically attracts international followers from the upper-segments of the economic sphere. Sailors are often cultured, nature-loving, discerning travelers who are willing to spend money on holiday. These are exactly the audiences that have been targeted by the Ministry of Tourism. Oman, with its beautiful coastline and ideal sailing conditions all-year round, is the perfect destination for any sailor or sailing enthusiast. Our contribution to tourism is through hosting international events in the Sultanate, creating rights-owned sailing events to gain exposure for Oman, competing in high-profile sailing races in the Ministry of Tourism's key markets, and managing strategic communication and marketing campaigns to promote Oman with affluent sailing audiences. We work very closely with the Ministry of Tourism and its market-based representatives to ensure that our messages are in sync and our key markets are aligned.</p><h4>What new initiatives are you also developing?</h4><p>Sports tourism is a high priority for both the Ministry of Tourism and the national diversification initiative, Tanfeedh. The Sultanate lends itself to a variety of sports that can be practiced here at scale. Based on our previous successes at hosting international events in the Sultanate, Oman Sail has been identified as the implementer of the Sports Tourism Strategy on behalf of the Ministry of Tourism. We are delighted by the opportunity and look forward to adding further value to the Sultanate of Oman through the expertise of our teams. We started this by successfully managing the Al Mouj Muscat Marathon this year with the Muscat Roadrunners, and have many more events to come over the next few years. We have also started two businesses to commercialize our expertise and reduce our reliance on government funds. One initiative is SEAOMAN, which offers quality boat charter, diving, sailing, and watersports services in the country. We have also started a new Corporate Personal Development (CPD) business, which utilizes our experience in delivering high performance sailing teams to instill interpersonal skills and build capacities in young Omanis through experiential learning.</p><h4>What are your aspirations in sport? </h4><p>The youth are the future of the Oman Sail program, and we are working hard toward equipping them with the right skills to raise the Omani flag and succeed internationally. From there, our youth sailors can take many directions, such as qualify for the Olympic Games, race in some of the world's biggest offshore races, or gain qualifications and work in the marine leisure businesses that we are creating. The global market for sports and adventure tourism is growing, currently valued at USD7.8 trillion. Oman is perfectly positioned to be a success story within that market, and our aspiration is to build a legacy around the sporting events that we host. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will middle-income projects, when compared to other high-end integrated tourism complexes (ITCs), further assist in the development of Oman?</h4><p>Middle-income projects are the strongest segment in the country. They have the purchasing power that keeps the country moving. The high-end segment normally constitutes 1-3% of the offerings in the market. However, affordable and social housing are the predominant segments in the real estate market; this is always where the market moves. The government has also realized this and is embarking on its own offerings in terms of integrated residential complexes (IRCs). It will offer the same formula to the public here. The next step is arranging strong partnerships between the government and real estate developers to develop such products, especially with developers like us who have experience and expertise. The entire country is moving toward offering affordable housing for Omani families that not only feature a home but also an integrated community.</p><h4>What amenities are you implementing in order to attract youth and middle-income families?</h4><p>Generally speaking, the first thing is our product and product range. This calls for smaller units that are more efficient and attractive for younger people as well as smaller families. The expat community in particular is shrinking and smaller units will be much more in demand than larger ones. Our ITC will have all of the relevant amenities such as shopping and entertainment as well as our own water park. We will also have dedicated land for a school. We also have an attraction at the main lagoon of the whole development. The combination of commercial, educational, recreational, as well as entertainment space will be the heart of the development. Because the project is not in a densely populated area, we have to create all that within the project so that people will enjoy living there.</p><h4>When is the Al Nakheel project due to begin construction?</h4><p>We just signed the development agreement with the Ministry of Tourism. We aim to break ground in early 2018. It is a seven- to 10-year project, broken down into three main phases. In addition to this project, we have a large land bank that we will develop eventually. However, between the current projects—like Al-Waha, which is a large project of approximately 690,000sqm of land that we also have in Barka, and another 500,000 available sqm—we will have our hands full developing these two areas.</p><h4>What steps should be taken in order to set up a one-stop shop for the real estate sector?</h4><p>One key aspect is to identify a certain entity, which is the caretaker responsible for the real estate development sector in Oman. This could be in the form of the Ministry of Housing or a division within the ministry, which is the Real Estate Development Authority currently. They are in a position to take the lead in establishing this one-stop shop for all developers based on their capabilities, categories, and land size. The Real Estate Development Authority is key to developing the legislative formula for this to work and have some sort of leading role in setting the projects on track from the onset. They are currently developing a concept whereby they are to be approached as the main point of contact, and they will do all the needed communication for initial approvals on the development companies' behalf with all of the other relevant entities. They will give companies preliminary approval so that they can take their project further. Once companies obtain that preliminary approval, everything should be smooth going from there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Muriya's key milestones over the past year?</h4><p>In 2017 Muriya celebrated 10 years of having a solid presence in Oman and five years of contributing to the hotel industry, with almost 900 hotel rooms between both our Hawana Salalah and Jebel Sifah destinations. With this we take pride in being the largest single private sector contributor to the four- and five-star hotel segment in the last five years. Needless to say this progress, and continued financial investment by our shareholders, Orascom Development Holding and Omran, occurred during a difficult international economic climate, which witnessed an economic crisis, the Arab Spring, and a regional oil crisis. For us to succeed during these past five years is in itself something for which we are proud. Our efforts extended beyond benefiting our own destinations. We did not only build hotel rooms to expand Oman's tourism sector, but through a solid partnership with Oman's Ministry of Tourism succeeded in transforming Salalah into a year-round tourism destination as opposed to a seasonal destination that was primarily an attraction for Gulf citizens during the months of Khareef. Tourism in Salalah during winter was small and limited. Muriya, with our fruitful relations with international tour operators, helped attract direct charter flights from Europe, and we now have six weekly flights coming from European countries, primarily Germany, Italy, Poland, and Slovakia. This did not exist five years ago. This influx of European tourists is not only benefiting our Hawana Salalah destination, but also other four- and five-star hotels in Salalah. As such, we are contributing to the overall tourism growth of Salalah at large. As a direct result of that, the recent report by STR Global, the source for premium global data benchmarking reports, analytics, and marketplace insights, has shown that in 2016 Salalah witnessed a 13% growth in tourism revenues.</p><h4>What are some of your upcoming expansion plans or projects?</h4><p>Construction of the Hawana Aquapark is already underway and due to launch at the end of 2017. In May 2017, we had the soft launch of our nine-hole Jebel Sifah golf course, with the official opening planned for September. We are adding an additional 120 hotel rooms in Hawana Salalah, with a plan to add over 300 rooms over the next three years within all our projects. Additionally, there are sub-developers and investors investing in our projects, building hotel rooms among other leisure facilities. On the real estate front, we are launching new residential neighborhoods at both our Hawana Salalah and Jebel Sifah projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have been taken to position Al Mouj Muscat as a leader in the ITC segment in Oman, allowing the company to receive awards locally as well as internationally?</h4><p>It is simple; we try to deliver quality results in a timely manner. Our goal is to constantly push ourselves to achieve international standards and discover new horizons. We always strive to bring new concepts and services to the country that will improve our customers' lifestyles. Focus and attention to detail is of the utmost importance to us, which is why we team up with the best architects and operators in the market to deliver the best results. Our most prestigious project at the moment are the Zunairah Villas, which won the best single unit award in the region at the most recent Arabian Property Awards 2017 in Dubai. Meanwhile, The Walk is perhaps the first urban dining retail experience in Muscat, and we are the first to develop a private promenade. It will consist of 3km of promenade and walkable area complemented by dining facilities within that space. We sought to achieve not only an enjoyable dining experience, but also make it a place where people of all ages can celebrate art and music. We seek to give the younger generations in particular a platform to express themselves and showcase their talents. At the heart of The Walk, we are building a public square that will include an open amphitheater and stage for local and international talent to perform while people enjoy the F&amp;B offerings. Creating that sense of community is what makes us different.</p><h4>How are Omanis reacting to your offerings, and how will the hospitality segment impact this reaction?</h4><p>Our offerings are a complete package, both in terms of the pricing and amenities. One aspect in particular where we try to differentiate ourselves is through community and lifestyle living. Any developer can offer the best design; however, how the community bonds and lives is much more important. Furthermore, since we are an ITC, it is extremely important to make every component, which has different requirements, work together in harmony. We have managed to deliver an internationally awarded tourism infrastructure such as Al Mouj Golf and Al Mouj Marina. These facilities in Al Mouj Muscat have enabled the country to increase in touristic appeal and allow it to host international sport competitions such as the America Cup, Extreme Sailing, and European Golf Tour to name few. We have also recently opened our first hotel, Mysk Al Mouj by Shaza, a four-star, 195-room hotel, and the Kempinski Al Mouj Hotel, which consists of 310 rooms and is expected to open by 1Q2018.</p><h4>Do you have any projects in mind for the near future?</h4><p>Approximately 50% of our land is currently occupied, and we will thus continue to work on new concepts and new mixed-use developments, apart from residential. We seek to have an international school, for example. We will also bring entertainment options for the younger generations. There is a great opportunity there, as there are not many entertainment options in Oman at the moment.</p><h4>What are Al Mouj Muscat's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>One main goal is to continue our vision and best utilize our ITC license. We started actively going overseas to do roadshows for the first time in 2016, as our customer base is 50% Omani and 50% non-Omani. We have grown our overseas customers base from 5 to 27% between 2015 and 2017. Every time we go abroad to sell, we are successful. However, there are many challenges, and we have developed many attractive ways to explain Oman and what it has to offer to people. All of us need to do a better job in marketing Oman if we want to attract tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Oman's comparative advantages in tourism over neighboring GCC countries?</h4><p>Oman is a competitive tourist destination with a fascinating history and culture that dates back well over 5,000 years. Our country's pristine, diverse landscape is dotted with mountains, sand dunes, an incredible coastline, adventure activities, a rich history and cultural heritage, and luxury hotels. The Sultanate has diverse tourism elements that mix modernity with the past and meet the desires of tourists looking for a luxurious and recreational holiday, without neglecting those interested in exploring historical, cultural, and archaeological landmarks. Oman is often referred to as the 'true Arabia,' because its ancient culture has been so beautifully preserved. In the Sultanate, one can still find souks selling silver, frankincense, and pottery as people have for thousands of years. Our people also have a well-deserved reputation for being amongst the world's most hospitable. </p><h4>What is the Ministry of Tourism doing to attract more foreign tourists?</h4><p>The ministry is coordinating and collaborating with other countries within and outside the GCC to promote Oman as a unique tourist destination. The Sultanate is being promoted as a year-round destination for tourists by dint of its water sports, mountain escapes, and luxury hotels. We are also keenly focused on business travelers, special interest groups, and MICE tourism. To that effect, the Ministry of Tourism has developed a long-term vision and developed a comprehensive strategy with a clearly defined plan and implementation program. As a result of the ministry's continuous efforts to promote the country internationally, the Sultanate has been listed as a top destination in the Daily Telegraph, Harper Bazaar Arabia, CNN, Vogue, BuzzFeed, and San Francisco Chronicle. We have also participated in major travel exhibitions such as ITB in Germany, the Arab Travel Market in Dubai, and the World Travel Market in the UK. </p><h4>Which regions are the most visited by foreign tourists and will they continue to be? </h4><p>Al Jabal Al Akhdhar (the Green Mountain) in the Wilayat of Nizwa; Jabal Shams, located in the Wilayat of Al Hamra in the Governorate of Al Dakhiliyah; Al Kasfa Spring; Wadi Bani Khalid, one of the most famous valleys of the Governorate of North Al Sharqiyah; and Wadi Dhiqah, another beautiful valley in the Wilayat of Quriyat, are some of the most popular tourist regions in the Sultanate. Another popular and important tourist site is the Governorate of Dhofar, which is famous during the monsoon season. <br>Which projects are most expected to boost the sector in 2018?<br>More than 3 million tourists visited Oman in 2016. The number of hotel establishments in the Sultanate reached 352 by June as a result of the ministry's efforts to develop the hotel sector. The ministry has granted approvals for a further 81 hotel establishments that will supply the sector with 5,279 rooms. These include 38 new hotels in Muscat, three new hotels in Dhofar, seven in North Batinah, and five in South Batinah, among others. </p><h4>What are the ministry's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>As a part of its 2020 Vision, when the highly anticipated USD4.8 billion Muscat International Airport is expected to open at the end of this year, the Sultanate aims to attract more than 5 million annual visitors to the country. Everything that makes it a year-round destination will come into play, since Oman has something for everyone. Our cluster approach combining the Omani touch and reflecting local culture and heritage will help Oman continue to highlight various areas such as the unique coastal area of Musandam; the Hajar Mountains; the Frankincense Trail in Salalah; cosmopolitan culture in Muscat, and adventure activities in the desert. Each area will offer accommodation, culinary experiences, transportation, and other unique Omani experiences for travelers of every budget. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy to achieve your goals and what distinguishes it from other players?</h4><p>Our main strategy is to provide third-party logistics services with world-class standards. Our backbone is our high quality human resources. To accomplish this, we established the infrastructure, main warehouses, drop-points, and entire supply chain. Other important aspects are software, IT management, cold chain, monitoring, and tracing, which are all maintained at international standards in our everyday practice. We have been ranked among the top-25 logistics operators in the GCC for the past five years. This helps us remain competitive over other local and international players in the country. Currently, we are focused on providing high-quality cold chain services, and we provide a guaranteed cold-chain and tracking system to our clients that is maintained throughout all stages of transportation and storage. We have many expansion plans and are planning to build new warehouses in other regions to cover demand for high quality logistics services. In terms of dry port services, we currently operate the only dry port in Oman under the name of Muscat Container Depot.  We are also considering investing in the new dry port project at Khazzaen in the South Batinah region, which has great future potential for being the main logistics hub.</p><h4>Al Madina Logistics runs the Muscat Container Depot, the first and only inland port in Oman. How has that given you an advantage over other competitors?</h4><p>This was an initiative we developed to help the main economic market at Muscat and nearby regions be connected with Sohar Port, in addition to providing CFS services. The Muscat Container Depot (MCD) has been playing a vital role in providing competitive services to importers and exporters through the Sohar Port, including CFS, fumigation, and frozen-fish-export container services. The depot works as an independent unit of Al Madina Logistics. To avoid conflicts of interest, Al Madina Logistics does not interfere with clearing and forwarding services at the MCD. This to support all freight forwarding and clearing companies. MCD provides all the supporting infrastructure for the customs authority and other government agencies, local freight forwards, and clearing companies to provide services to local importers and exporters. In terms of competition, there are few companies that provide similar services; however, MCD still has over 90% of the market. The competition is a healthy sign as it helps us improve our services and lets clients get the best services at lower prices.</p><h4>What has been the effect of the cut in subsidies and rising fuel prices on the industry?</h4><p>The cuts have had a large impact on our profits. The transport industry was highly competitive before the subsidies were removed. With the economic slowdown, the challenges increased.  Our main challenge is to maintain high-quality transport services while absorbing the additional cost of fuel. We try to do that through focusing on clients that value quality supply chains and reliable on-time deliveries.  </p><h4>What steps should be taken by the government and private sector to improve the transportation sector in Oman?</h4><p>There is a great deal of room for improvement, especially in terms of road infrastructure and safety designs, as poor conditions and unsafe designs increase operational costs for the industry. Another area of improvement is developing transport laws that give the industry proper guidelines. The railway project can greatly help to provide more competitive and safer transportation services. The railway stations will also increase demand for the truck transportation as they provide services to and from railway stations. The current focus of the railway is on building routes from mining sites to the ports, and will definitely expand as the economy grows. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Oman play for the company, and how will setting up base in Oman help APL Logistics move forward?</h4><p>When we entered the country in 2003, we partnered with an agent that would help our businesses move forward. We were doing purchase orders for it out of Walmart because it has a fairly large portion of retail business across the globe and at the time used to manufacture and source from Oman. We were interested in growing in the country, and our JV partners approached us to make the brand more visible at a time when the country was promoting supply chains and the creation of a logistics hub in Oman. The geopolitical environment in Oman is excellent; it is in a great location, there is a stable government, and it is an incredibly safe country. The government is currently promoting trade and Oman as a logistics hub, and we are fortunate given our global expertise in regard to trade. We have four main verticals—automotive, consumer, industrial, and retail—and we find them to fit well with Oman. Nevertheless, most of the retail segment is still serviced out of neighboring countries. </p><h4>How has the demand for your services evolved in the past few years in Oman?</h4><p>We have received several requests for global business opportunities, although we have only been in trade since July 2017. There is a great deal of multi-party communication that gets added to a supply chain, which adds great complexity to doing business. This is exactly how APLL has helped its customers from Oman, fulfilling all their needs like a door-to-door service. Customers, unfortunately, have always been at the mercy of traders, believing they will service them with no actual guarantee. Now, in order for customers to benefit in terms of supply chain, it is always better for them to control their own costs. The way to do so is by choosing a company such as APL Logistics that will manage their cost from end to end. We give customers market visibility, and with our network and tie-ups with large shipping lines there are various additional benefits we can provide. APLL can go to multiple shipping lines, and not just rely on one; at the end of the day, what APLL brings to the table is its manpower and technology. </p><h4>How will the creation of ASYAD impact your progress in Oman?</h4><p>ASYAD is a great initiative created by the Ministry of Transport because it gives companies a body to look up to. It will set up many visible steps, such as working committees, which will strongly impact the market in the coming years. I am personally part of these committees and, given the lean state facilitation in regard to logistics, projects such as these will better evolve in the future. ASYAD's entry into the market will also help organize all available integrated solutions and help bring the required stakeholders in to fulfill this integration.</p><h4>What are your main objectives as a company for 2018?</h4><p>Our focus will be on marketing our brand. Secondly, we will continue to promote many solutions for the supply chain segment that were missing in the Omani market. There will be a huge focus in 2018 on promoting our end-to-end solutions in terms of technology, people, and the knowledge that we bring to the table, especially throughout our four verticals. There is currently a great deal of government promotion going into the retail sector, which is mainly tourism; when the Mall of Oman opens, we will bring a great deal of experience to the table in terms of running retail visibility. We have the capability and experience to manage large regional hubs in terms of running warehousing, contract logistics, and distribution operations.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led Muscat Bay to rebrand, and what impact will this have on the company?</h4><p>The main reason behind the rebranding was to make it easier for people, especially tourists and expatriates, to pronounce our project. We also wanted people to link the site to the area itself and reflect the demography of the site and its location on the bay. The shape and colors of the logo itself also reflect the water and the mountains.</p><h4>Where do you currently stand in terms of the development, and when is the project expected to be completed?</h4><p>We are currently reaching the final stage of construction of Phase I. We have completed the entire infrastructure related to the project for both phases, though in terms of construction we have only finished the first phase. We already started delivering some of the units in some of the zones, shortly we will also start delivering the rest of the units. The first half of 2018 will, therefore, be extremely important for us, and we will transition from a development stage to an operational stage. We are developing 206 units at this stage for phase I, and the rest of the 435 units will be developed during Phase II.</p><h4>Where do you currently stand in regard to the development of your two hotels, Resort and Boutique, and what impact will they have on the overall development?</h4><p>One of the hotels is almost ready and is reaching the completion stage as well. We expect it to be ready by the second half of 2018 with a soft opening in June or July. Jumeirah Muscat Bay Resort Hotel will consist of 206 rooms, which are all sea facing. For the other hotel, we already cut into the mountain and have prepared the site for the construction phase. We seek to complete one hotel first before fully focusing on the other site. Both hotels are five-star deluxe hotels, and all the rooms will have a sea view and balconies. We are bringing a new offering to Muscat, where we have both regular rooms and villas attached to the hotel; guests can request a villa with a private pool, as well as have the beach at their disposal. The hotels will be part of a larger amenity-driven picture; the development will also include a recreation area in the heart of the development called Village Square. Village Square is a retail developments linked to a 30,000-sqm park with amenities such as a pool, playgrounds, children areas, and outlet areas. The Park and Village Square will be ready by 4Q2018</p><h4>What has been the response from investors thus far?</h4><p>The response has been great. We have had interest from Omanis as well as people from all over the world; we have investors from Europe, the US, and Asia. The current ratio is around 50% Omanis and 50% non-Omanis, including the GCC and other parts of the world.</p><h4>What are Muscat Bay's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be our turnaround year; we will start moving from a development stage to an operational stage. We hope to start operating the hotel the operation of the entire residential area as well. We will also complete the other areas, including the park and the recreation area. Our developments add great value to the national economy, and we are developing a place where people can enjoy and have a nice time. It is also the first time that the Jumeirah chain of hotels is entering the Omani market, and this will add value due to the promotion of true Arabian hospitality. We will deliver a new product to the market, and this will also attract a different clientele to Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Oman's first budget airline, what does SalamAir represent?</h4><p>SalamAir grew out of a need in the market. Today, travel and aviation have developed so much that it is important to keep up with demand. However, many people here were using other forms of transport, so the airline came to provide an alternative, both domestic and international.</p><h4>What competitive impact does SalamAir expect to have in the region, and how does it differ from competitors such as flydubai and Air Arabia?</h4><p>We complement them and build on their success. The companies have been extremely successful, not only financially but also in supporting their local economies. It is important to contribute to the growth of the country, one of our main objectives as a company. The country has invested heavily in the aviation sector, making it a perfect time for SalamAir to join the market. We see infrastructure coming up, such as the fantastic new airport terminal in Muscat that will boost the Sultanate's tourist capacity. Although there are many requirements to fly people in and out of Muscat, SalamAir gives everyone the opportunity to fly to many destinations at an affordable price.</p><h4>How will the delivery of the new terminal in Muscat and the new airports in Sohar and Salalah impact SalamAir's operations in Oman?</h4><p>The main reason for the new airport was to increase passenger capacity. The current airport and terminals have been at their maximum for a while now, and were even stretched to meet growing demand. The people running the airport are doing a fantastic job; however, it is now time to move to the new world-class terminal. This project will definitely put Muscat on the map for having an efficient, top-of-the-line terminal in the region. The terminal in Salalah is also efficient, and plans are being made to increase its capacity. In fact, SalamAir was one of the first airlines to operate from Sohar. These two cities brought in high demand, and the local communities were welcoming. Although other airlines operate on a seasonal demand, we decided to offer these routes year-round. Today, we even have two flights from Sohar to Salalah, allowing people to travel during the weekend; this has been welcomed by the local community, as it bolsters both business and personal travel plans. Other foreign carriers started to fly to Oman after they saw our success in Sohar.</p><h4>Could you tell us about your fleet, current routes, and expansion plans for the near future?</h4><p>Today, SalamAir has three Airbus 320s. These are well known for passenger comfort, efficiency, and being environmentally friendly; each has a capacity for 174 passengers. In regard to routes, the airline currently operates internally to Sohar and Salalah and is currently negotiating with the authorities to connect more domestic airports in the near future. In addition to this, SalamAir flies to Jeddah and Dubai and is looking to add Qatar and Kuwait. Outside of the GCC, we operate to Sialkot and Karachi in Pakistan and are assessing destinations such as Iran, Bangladesh, and Nepal. In 2018 we will add three or four new aircraft to our fleet, making it possible for the airline to extend its operations. Of course, the number of aircraft depends on their availability in the market. Our current expansion plans are to look into short to medium-haul flights. At this stage, we are not considering any long-haul flights; we will stay within the region and fill the three-to-four hour routes around us.</p><h4>What are the airline's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>SalamAir is going through its start-up phase. During this, the main aim is to function properly. In 2018 we need to become healthier and start increasing our operations. We are currently stabilizing the company and making changes to prepare for the next phase of expansion. We are optimistic about 2018 as we look to open new routes and add three to four new aircraft to our fleet. Once this is done, the entire network will benefit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does OAMC fit in the Sultanate's strategy to diversify the economy?</h4><p>Based on our purpose of growing gateways to beauty and opportunity, OAMC's main focus is connecting every civilian airport, creating job opportunities with social and economic value, and adding significant value to the aviation sector by excellently managing and further developing our airport infrastructure. The aviation sector should be driving the overall diversification of the Omani economy. We already have 93% young and highly skilled Omanis working for OAMC, and we are proud we were able to double our net profit in 2017. This has been possible by building strong relationships with our strategic partners such as Omanair, the Royal Oman Police, the Public Authority of Civil Aviation, and our excellent service providers. Together with our partners we are constantly working on offering our customers a world-class experience by living the values of Omani hospitality in everything we do. </p><h4>What impact will the new Muscat Airport terminal, among others, have on passenger travel?</h4><p>We are located in a competitive region with massive airport development projects coming up to push global aviation growth. Therefore, the new Muscat Airport plays an important role in our business strategy. By nature, Oman and neighboring countries are not large markets. However, Muscat Airport has been able to more than double its passenger numbers within seven short years, from around 6 million passengers in 2010 to 14 million passengers in 2017. The growth proves that we are on the right track and that Muscat Airport is becoming an economic engine that can support the logistics and tourism sector by facilitating the flow of goods and passengers. We will continue fostering Muscat Airport to be an airport hub with seamless processes and a pleasant, unforgettable experience. </p><h4>Asyad's current strategy plans on incorporating air cargo into the logistics chain. What role will OAMC play in this, and what impact will it have on the economy?</h4><p>One of our key objectives is to provide seamless supply chain services through all the stakeholders involved to improve the end-to-end logistics. OAMC's role is important when incorporating air cargo into the logistics chain in terms of providing a functioning operational platform for export and import cargo. Second, in partnership with national carrier Oman Air and other carriers, the objective is to improve connectivity. A seamless supply chain with optimized transportation and handling lead times improves the competitiveness of the country in terms of exports, imports, and transshipments. Faster lead and handling times through the logistics chain will also create competitive advantages for Omani shippers.</p><h4>What new projects does OAMC have for 2018?</h4><p>The main project will be ensuring smooth operations at the new Muscat Airport. Opening such a huge terminal of 365,000sqm is no walk in the park, which is why we have to be focused and carefully monitor our operations. </p><h4>What are OAMC's main objectives for the next year?</h4><p>Our Strategy2020 is embodied in six strategic focus areas and aimed at developing our airports into places to have a great customer experience. As a responsible airport operator we will continue focusing on health, security, and the environment, not to mention carry on building and maintaining great relationships with our strategic partners, the Oman government authorities and the wider local communities our airports serve. Operational excellence is another key driver of our long-term success. All our operational processes have to be consistently efficient and effective at the same time. Last but not least, we have to improve our profitability to be able to fund our future ourselves.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Powers Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[powers-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Atkins' strategy in the Middle East, and what is the importance of Oman in Atkins' portfolio?</h4><p>Historically, Atkins in Oman has concentrated on the property sector; this includes all buildings works and related infrastructure. However, we have seen, over the last year, the power and energy sector becoming a more robust market for Atkins along with also the client advisory services niche. Utilizing our broad Atkins Group capabilities in the power segment, we targeted and secured some work with the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP)—we managed to win the Power 2021 and 2022 projects. We are now looking to pursue some water-related projects, also for OPWP, using a combination of our group's specialist skills and leveraging our long-established local resource base. Also in our plans is to extend our energy services to cover oil and gas. To date, Atkins has to not been heavily involved in the Oman oil and gas sector. Although we have done work for BP and PDO, it has focused on the construction side. With regards to the client advisory services, we have a part of our business called Acuity, and this delivers a number of consultancy services. This, together with the engineering base of Atkins, aims to deliver our clients seamless, results-driven engineering advisory solutions for complex development projects, namely greater and more complete value added solutions. Using this new service unit, we won a key project for the Supreme Council for Planning in the continuing five-year development cycle called the Oman National Spatial Strategy (ONSS). Our role will be tying together studies carried out by four regional spatial strategy consultants covering the 11 governorates.</p><h4>How will the Power 2021 and 2022 projects help to push forward the development of the Sultanate?</h4><p>Oman requires expansion of its main power system to meet 2021 and possibly 2022 forecast demands. These projects look at all aspects related to power in Oman, including the forecasted demand requirements, available capacity, and expiring plants to determine how available infrastructure will function in five years' time and what and where new infrastructure is needed. OPWP does not construct nor operate any of Oman's power plants, but rather buys power from private-sector entities in marked difference to the region, where the government owns 15%, 25%, or 50% of these facilities. Power 2021 and 2022 are strategic projects and also, because they include technical elements, are of particular interest to us. Although we have previously not worked much in power projects in Oman, we are excited about the potential to grow considering the limited, but qualified, competition and knowing that energy is something that Oman needs. Power supply is an absolute must and we are pleased to provide related services as part of our portfolio.</p><h4>What are Atkins' main goals and objectives?</h4><p>One of our key goals is to make sure that people appreciate the in-country value Atkins is achieving with its tailored Omanization program. We now have an ever-evolving Omani skill base on par with international standards. The problem is that clients feel they need to look offshore for architectural services as they feel local companies are not comparable to companies outside of Oman. Meanwhile, our staff work on projects in other countries, for international clients. At present, some of our Omani staff are working on projects in East Africa, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. Somehow, we have to show Oman clients that Omanis are an asset, and we are an international company delivering international-standard services. From a service scope perspective, we will aim to further grow our advisory, power, and water projects, as well as transport and infrastructure works while still developing our property services. Rather than having two or three segments to build our business on, we want to have four or five established lines giving our business in Oman stability and agility. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>All Asyad's work is linked to the Oman Logistics Strategy 2040. What does that strategy entail and how will it help Oman's development?</h4><p>The Logistics Strategy 2040 looked at what Oman wanted to be in terms of logistics, the contribution to GDP and employment we wanted the sector to have, and how we wanted to be seen as a GCC hub. The consensus was that, generally, we have enough hard infrastructure apart from rail, leaving soft infrastructure as the real issue. We needed to tackle the soft infrastructure issues in a more structural way. Hence we have four pillars. The first is trade facilitation: we need to remove all the obstacles to trade and make it easy to do business in Oman, including issues such as customs clearance, inspections, and regulations and processes for setting up businesses and licensing. The second pillar is the question of the sectors, industries, and commodities to focus on to differentiate Oman from other markets. We had to look at market segmentation and identify the segments, products, or industries that we wanted to focus on. The third pillar is human capital. This is important for us to fulfill certain employment requirements because we have to find jobs for nationals. The human capital pillar therefore entails Asyad dissecting all the jobs, looking at the categories available, and working out how we train Omanis to become competitive and productive. The fourth pillar is technology. One of the differentiators for logistics and other sectors is how fast technology is adopted and how fast new technologies that are game changers are created.</p><h4>Where does the Oman rail project currently stand and what impact will it have once it is up and running?</h4><p>Currently we focus on Oman's domestic rail network. We are also ready for the wider GCC rail project and want to come to an agreement with our GCC colleagues on a start date, but the domestic rail network is our focus at the moment. This work is concentrated around opening up the mining sector because it is price sensitive and transportation is one of the most expensive elements of mining. Rail will really unleash the true potential of mining in Oman and we are working closely with the mining industry. We have looked at certain rail lines from particular mines to the ports. Now we will go through the investment elements looking at the best model to integrate mining extraction with the demand and transportation costs. We are working together with our mining colleagues to develop this.</p><h4>What improvements could the government and private sector make to facilitate better logistics here?</h4><p>We have made progress in terms of improving things much more. We have managed to reduce the customs clearance times and the system is now fully automated. We seek to integrate all the other government agencies for permits, licensing, and inspections into the system to make it easier and faster. The truly great thing is that the wave of change has started and people are on board. The process is going quicker than previously imagined. The government is moving in the right direction, though the private sector also has to cooperate and become a key player in this. When we structured our strategy the private sector was part of it. Now that we are implementing the strategy, the private sector is also part of this. Asyad's role is also to push the private sector to invest as much as possible, for example to make a reliable warehousing and trucking system available in Oman. We cannot attract businesses if this structure is not available. Fast customs clearance is of no use if there is no one to store or transport the goods after they have cleared the port, so the private sector has to do much more in terms of both the soft and hard infrastructure as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[markets-open-to-the-moon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been Al Madina's strategy to benefit from the exponential growth inside Oman's IT sector over the last 30 years?</h4><p>We are proud to actively participate in shaping IT in Oman since the very beginning in the 1980s. We always follow the latest technology trends in our solutions and services and actively seek to influence the markets in which we operate. We frequently travel to many countries and observe what they are doing. If we find something that will add value to Oman, then we introduce it into our solutions, and vice versa. Wherever we go and whatever we have done in Oman that has been successful, if we can implement it in other countries then we do so.</p><h4>What are the most popular IT trends in Oman? How do you see those involving in the future?</h4><p>The main trending topic now is e-government and getting everything online. When everything is electronic there is always a set of reports, dashboards, and analytics so that people can search, analyze, and see things with the click of a button. Going forward, everything will be more dependent on mobile devices and applications rather than traditional paper-based methods.</p><h4>What role is the e-governance service playing for improving efficiency and accountability in the public sector?</h4><p>The Information Technology Authority (ITA) has been doing a great job in instituting e-governance.  The initiative has transformed the government into a true e-government by seamlessly unifying the work and integration across different ministries and has utilized IT to service commerce, not the other way around. When everything is electronic there is always a digital record, a date-time stamp, and everything is there, increasing audit capabilities. The government, for example, has changed the tendering processes to be submitted electronically now. It widens the range of people who can tender and increases the accountability and transparency of the public sector. </p><h4>What are IT companies in Oman doing for cybersecurity to ensure digital documents are safe?</h4><p>There are many conferences and workshops. People are traveling in order to educate themselves. We have been contacted by a number of companies specialized in this to create a partnership to promote cybersecurity in Oman. This will be a big area in the next few years, especially as all data and payments are online. It is something that we simply cannot overlook. It is a major investment for companies that should not be overlooked.</p><h4>What are the main challenges you face as a company, and what are you doing to mitigate these?</h4><p>The biggest challenge at present is linked to the oil price. Therefore, the five-year plan has been slightly changed and things have been prioritized. That is a challenge here that I am working around by focusing on expanding our success stories outside of Oman into other countries. Starting in 2016, we expanded into Afghanistan and Bangladesh on one side. That is interesting because we are moving from a small, 4.5-million person market to markets of 40-80 million opportunities. It is exciting for us to have a broader reach for our solutions. We are also expanding into African countries. A lot of GCC and Middle East companies are expanding into Africa at the moment. Everywhere I go I try to take a tour and see what a normal business day is like in that country. Something that surprised me is the huge presence of GCC countries. In that sense, Al Madina Group differentiates itself from this competition by not being government-owned. We do not have any type of government influence, which gives other countries a feeling of ease as there are fewer obstacles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Cutting a Broad Swathe]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[cutting-a-broad-swathe]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advantages will a third telecoms operator bring to Oman? </h4><p>The addition of a third service provider clearly creates a solid foundation for potential long-term cooperation that will benefit not only Oman Broadband, but the economy as a whole. Aside from our fiber-optic network, we are also looking into possibilities of deploying towers, which will create yet another interesting business opportunity. Building the foundation of a connected tomorrow and unlocking the nation's potential has always been one of our core objectives here at OBC. </p><h4>What business opportunities do you expect in broadband infrastructure for 2017-2018? </h4><p>We are seeing increased market competition and thus dynamics in both fixed and mobile segments are growing. This alone will create significant growth potential for us as a company. In addition, the commercialization of the existing state-owned fiber-optic infrastructure is progressing well, allowing us to offer a new range of services in the long-haul segment, reach new locations and a larger number of potential clients in the government sector, and strongly support government initiatives. In doing so, we can also further contribute toward transforming Oman's online experience and the establishment of a 'connected' society and boost e-services, the latter of which will soon be accessible across the Sultanate. Security today is becoming increasingly important, and is a segment in which we play an important role as well. Fiber optics are inherently the most secure and safe medium in modern telecoms infrastructure. Along with security measures taken by service providers, services offered by OBC, from a security standpoint, are further proof that the network is all the more attractive and as a result making the switch to fiber. </p><h4>What is the status of your strategy to cover 85% of Muscat by 2020? </h4><p>We will reach 55% coverage in Muscat by the end of 2017, in addition to doing rollout outside of the capital into other urban areas. We are progressing exactly according to our masterplan, and the impact of our activities is becoming more evident with every passing day. We have also established strong, mutually beneficial partnerships with service providers and know that Oman's experience can serve as a role model at an international level for how different stakeholders can efficiently and constructively work toward establishing national fiber coverage.</p><h4>What is the relationship between OBC, ITA, TRA, and the ministries and how can it be improved?</h4><p>OBC maintains an excellent work relationship with everyone within the telecoms sector and public authorities. Government-owned entities in roads, sewage, electricity, and water have adopted OBC's specifications and coordinated the execution of every project with OBC in order to reap savings. We also have a strategic project with the ITA to provide connectivity to several ministries and link them to the government cloud as part of the e-government project. </p><h4>What are the benefits of broadband for the business community in Oman? </h4><p>In 2015, Oman was amongst the most expensive countries in the region in terms of broadband pricing and had low coverage. Since a third fixed broadband service provider entered the market (offering its services exclusively on our infrastructure), we have seen a good drop in retail broadband prices. At the same time, speeds have increased tremendously. Today, packages above 50 and 100Mbps are normal for end users, something unimaginable only two years ago. Such development will change how business is conducted in Oman from the ground up. </p><h4>What are OBC's main goals and objectives for 2017-2018?</h4><p>In addition to reaching our 2020 goals, we are always proactively searching for opportunities to build on new technologies. We are hoping to achieve a synergy effect and create competitive advantages that will attract world-renowned partners from the ICT industry.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From Girth to Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-girth-to-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does OTF consist of, and what strategy has allowed it to flourish in Oman?<br></h4><p>OTF, as a venture capital fund, invests in high-growth-potential technology startups. To start with and in order to build something long lasting and sustainable, it must be based on market conditions and external economic forces. At the core OTF is an investment fund where return is something that we are greatly measured on and is a paramount indication of the effectiveness of our work. However, OTF has what we call the double bottom line, which includes commercial sustainability, having our commercial returns on par with the investment venture capital industry, and having an impact on the national economy. We have to make sound investments based on the merit of each investment. It is also worth mentioning that OTF is not limited to investment in Omanis and invests in any excellent idea or innovation. Geography wise, we invest all over the world with a primary focus on the Middle East; we want investment opportunities available in Oman to be open to everyone.</p><h4>What are your main criteria for investment?</h4><p>There are three criteria for our investments. First, does the idea solve a large-enough problem? In other words, it must address a regional or global problem so that the market size will warrant the investment. Secondly, it must serve a real need; we want something that is based on innovative technology that addresses an important need. Thirdly, the economics must work in terms of how the idea is monetized. In terms of stages, OTF invests in startups at a very early stage that only have an idea and an incomplete product; we invest and provide support in terms of training and how to scale these companies. Another stage we invest in is startups that have an idea and product ready but now want to acquire customers, which requires a higher investment. We also provide investment for companies' growth in more mature tech companies that may want to go regional or global, and need an investment for this expansion. We also invest into other funds in places such as Silicon Valley, Ireland, and more.</p><h4>Where does OTF currently stand in regards to the programs it offers, and how do they differ from the ones offered by other funds?</h4><p>The idea is to have Oman as a hub to connect talent and provide venture capital money. As OTF provides multi-stage investments, entrepreneurs find receiving investments from OTF very useful as we provide a route to receive a great investment and excellent training. Our program here is run by one of the top-seven accelerator programs in Silicon Valley and the other one is run in partnership with Europe's top accelerator NDRC. OTF launched its Techween incubator program in December 2017 with 10 investments in partnership with NDRC. The application process attracted 160 applications, out of which OTF invested in 10 of them. When our first program, OTF Wadi Accelerator, launched at the end of 2017, we received 400+ applications from all around the world and five of them were deemed suitable for our investment. The OTF VC (Jasoor) made two investments in 2017, meaning OTF has invested into 17 deals overall. In addition to investment money, OTF shareholders own many companies, which gives us the ability to open markets to the startups that are sometimes more important than the funding through these companies. The combination of great program and an investment path way all the way form ideation to growth, coupled with market access, provides great value proposition.</p><h4>Which sectors does OTF regularly invest in?</h4><p>We prefer to have an investment where there is defensible technology involved. Areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics are extremely interesting to us for various reasons such as that these innovations typically solve real world problems in areas such as tech agriculture, fisheries, and manufacturing. In addition, these technologies are difficult to replicate, giving us a competitive advantage. This fits well within the five sectors that Oman has identified; IoT/Robotics can be used almost anywhere, be it in logistics, manufacturing, food processing, or even mining. The areas of interest to us also include data analytics and cybersecurity. We are also interested into food technology, as Oman has been making a substantial investment in this area. Finally, we have seen a number of new technologies rising around the oil industry due to the country's major involvement and know-how in this sector.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your YoY net profit as of September 2017 was OMR65 million. What led to these results?</h4><p>The results you have seen are from the first nine months of 2017 and they reflect a changing environment in the market, specifically relating to the telecoms sector. The revenues from the first nine months were almost stagnant and there was no major growth; this reflects impacts coming from the macroeconomic environment. The impact of low oil prices has also impacted the spending powers at the enterprise and the consumer level. The other change was reflected in the form of responses from the government, specifically relating to the current oil price syndrome; this imposed as part of the solution from a physical point of view. Further royalties are a form of taxes that are applied on our revenues directly, as well as an increase in tax. Combining the increase in royalties from 7 to 12% and the increase in tax from 12 to 15%, the effective tax rate on our company is approximately 51%, which is among the highest compared to other corporate organizations that work in the country. Because of active CAPEX spending during the last three years, our CAPEX revenue has almost touched 30%, which is one of the highest not only in the region, but also globally when compared; the industry average is around 16%.</p><h4>How will the TRA's decision to add a third operator license impact the Omani telecoms market, and how will Omantel react to this in terms of local prices? </h4><p>We are ready to welcome the entry of a third operator. In regard to price competition, there is potential for a price war. In the short term this will provide better prices for the consumer. However, we believe that the investment power of the entire sector of all the operators will be impacted as well. Investments will be impacted by the entry of the third operator to increase their taxes and royalties, and therefore unfortunately at the expense of quality. Quality and price go hand in hand. As far as our operation is concerned, Omantel has dealt with competition since 2004. Today the market is basically split, more than 15.5% for the MVNOs, which are usually the natural space that a third operator takes. There is almost a 50-50 split between Omantel and Ooredoo; technically speaking a fourth entrant could join. So as far as strategy is concerned, it will be important for Omantel to focus on its Omantel 3.0 Strategy. One of the most important pillars is to exceed customer expectations. We will continue to invest in improving and enhancing our customer experience. The second pillar is associated with innovation; it will be important that there is innovation in solutions that are provided in the market, and personalization of services that are provided alongside to the consumers. The third pillar relates to transformation; it is important that the model optimizes cost as much as possible, while maintaining the level of quality and service based on the expectation of the customers.</p><h4>How have the higher and lower segments both affected the telecoms market here in Oman, and what role do you see the MVNOs playing?</h4><p>The current structure you mentioned with two MNOs and two active mobile resellers provides choices to consumers. The premium operators and services, such as ourselves, will focus on various segments of the market; we will continue to hold the premium side of the market. The lower end of the market has traditionally gone to the MRs, but the overall impact is providing a choice to the consumer space within Oman, and operators offering design to tackle different segments of the market. The entry of the third MNO will definitely have an impact on price and price competition. This price pressure is not new in the sector, and in fact the price antics of telecoms has been declining over the last five years. This will only add to that decline, but there are short-term gains from a market consumer perspective. In addition, there are also long-term losses, mainly associated with quality.</p><h4>What main objectives does Omantel have for 2018?</h4><p>We will continue to focus on our Omantel 3.0 Strategy. There are four pillars we would like to focus on, these being exceeding customer expectation, leading the digital transformation of the Sultanate, innovating our services, and transforming into an agile Omantel. We think that the relevance of our strategy will continue to be there for at least the next two years. We have taken our first step toward providing a total ICT solution through the creation of Momkin (Omantel IoT arm), the introduction of our ICT unit, and leveraging the ecosystem of Oman Data Park (ODP) with both Momkin and ICT to provide to enterprise and government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is ITA moving forward with ICT to further develop Oman?</h4><p>ITA is the government's right arm and offers advice on how ICT can make a difference. Working on our 2030 strategy, we are trying to determine how ICT can become a better enabler for diversification as well as contributor to the economy in terms of creation. Our role is embedded within other sectors, and ICT's contribution to GDP comes from tourism, logistics, manufacturing, and more. We work with our colleagues from other sectors to ensure that their jobs become easier and more efficient as we proceed. The government is establishing logistic hubs and focusing on smart logistics. Oman has the entire physical infrastructure with ports, roads, and more. Part of our role is to start right from day one because otherwise companies will have to reinvest. </p><h4>What is the importance of forming partnerships and inviting international companies to come to Oman?</h4><p>Today, investors have many options. What we give them will impact their decision on whether to come to Oman, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, or elsewhere to set up their business. The government has a role to ensure that the service it provides to people and businesses is efficient. Our role is not to deliver the actual e-transformation, as this is the role of all government agencies; however, we need to make sure they are aligned and that we have the right standards and policies. The Invest Easy project is one of our key milestones in making sure to facilitate the investment experience in Oman. Another thing we are taking into consideration is a PPP in a revenue-sharing type of model. This is more sustainable for the government and private sector and is what we want to push our private sector to establish. We have long-term partnerships with Microsoft and other large companies such as Oracle; however, we also seek new and small companies that can make a significant difference. We have companies from Singapore, Lithuania, Estonia, and Croatia that are actually moving with us here. </p><h4>What is the initiative behind cybersecurity and defense, and how can you bring more companies on board?</h4><p>We have taken cybersecurity very seriously since day one. That is why we created the right structure that enables us to also ensure companies focus on security as they go. When we design things, we design them with security in mind. We have a strong division here that gives the government and even us a hard time moving forward without putting in place the right security measures. According to the ICT cybersecurity index, Oman is one of the countries with the right infrastructure. We are hosting the ITU Cyber Security Center, which is the regional center for 22 Arab countries. It selected Oman for a reason. </p><h4>How does ITA ensure that the ICT sector creates jobs for younger generations?</h4><p>We are working with universities first to ensure that graduates are immediately ready for the market. We are providing many facilities and developing programs between universities and companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, and Cisco. The issue today is the gap between university graduates and the market requirements. We seek to ensure that graduates are ready; although we have many IT graduates looking for jobs, market indicators show that there is a shortage of IT skills. Today, hundreds of thousands of skills are required, and these change every day; therefore, one of our efforts is working with universities as advisors to ensure their curricula are up to date. We work with them through the private sector or incubation labs in universities and have an important incubation program initiative, which was established almost three years ago. We encourage young people to establish their own companies and start working, and give them the opportunity of exposure through government agencies, the private sector, and international visitors to make sure they can market themselves in the right way.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[supply-and-command]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core areas of HTC's operations?</h4><p>Today, HTC operates in two distinct areas, the ICT and renewable energy sectors. In the mature and competitive ICT scene, it has carved out a niche in private networks, where it enjoys a leading position in the Sultanate. In the emerging renewable energy market, where market segmentation has not surfaced, HTC is participating in all key segments: engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC), consultation, advisory, and development. Our common vision is enhancement, people, and competitiveness. Whatever solution or service we provide has to have an impact in enhancing a critical aspect that our clientele defines. We at HTC have to have impact on people whether it is HTC's members, our clientele, or society at large. </p><h4>What telecoms-related projects have you developed for other sectors?</h4><p>HTC at its inception focused on wireless technologies. These are less capital intensive, require less permitting, and, as an SME, were more attainable. As such, we deployed one of the GCC's first wireless mesh networks with the Sohar Industrial Estate in Oman in 2006. With prototyping help from The Knowledge Mine, today called the National Business Centre, we were able to sell our first network through a local partner in Dubai to Zabeel Palace. We managed to deliver many more such nomadic networks to our clients. We then entered the high bandwidth market by becoming Oman's first Telecommunication Regulatory Authority-approved free space optics supplier and scored multiple wins. Our first win was with BankMuscat to whom we supplied 2x 1Gbps link between its head office and disaster recovery center. We are extremely proud that we supported BankMuscat for close to seven years with one of its most critical links. With this win, we were able to directly and indirectly offer a number of similar high capacity links to the financial and corporate sector in Muscat. HTC played a critical role in eroding the prices offered by the fixed-telecom operator for short high bandwidth leased lines, bringing them closer to regional prices, which enhances the capabilities of local companies and makes Oman more attractive to perspective foreign companies. </p><h4>How did HTC offer its clients these innovations in the telecoms sector?</h4><p>HTC operates in a client-centric manner, and our offerings can be broken down into two categories—customized and commoditized solutions. We always focus on scouting the market for common pain points that are not being addressed by commoditized off-the-shelf solutions. We would select a client with whom we can safely propose out-of-the-box solutions and iterate the design with them jointly until we reach the solution that best addresses their needs and is applicable to a wider customer base. This solution we would then standardize and propagate in the market, in effect commoditizing it. We repeated this cycle over time, which allowed us to introduce several technologies into Oman while maximizing value gains and cost savings to clients.</p><h4>What solutions do you offer regarding HTC's involvement in the renewables market?</h4><p>HTC is primarily a B2B solution provider, with strengths in engineering and project management. As such, we naturally gravitated toward the commercial and industrial segment. We are targeting the 10kW- to 10MW-size projects, whether grid-connected, off-grid, or hybrid. While our first solar deployment took place in 2007 for our Medco Energy concession private network, we only entered the market after Shell Development Oman (SDO) announced its gift to the nation for 2015-2019 in the form of Solar into Schools. The nature of this initiative is to create a safe sandbox for willing Omani SMEs to utilize their engineering ingenuity to design solutions, guiding them commercially and supervising their on-site delivery of solutions. This is a far safer prototyping environment than we had available to us in the telecom sector, and we pounced on this opportunity with full determination. Being awarded two of SDO's first phase schools was a great learning opportunity, which helped us strike our roots in the EPC segment in Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Are you looking to expand your client base locally or internationally?</h4><p>For the moment, we will be focusing on the local market, specifically on Duqm. There are developments happening there, and we are keeping an eye on the refinery in particular because it will require sea transportation. This has not been discussed yet, but we would like to provide transportation for them. It is a huge development with the Port of Duqm and the surrounding industry and tourism activities. In general, we want to focus more on the export and import of Omani products. We are under the umbrella of Oman Global Logistics Group (OGLG) now, recently rebranded as Asyad. The group consists of 17 companies, mainly in logistics. Asyad has a wider strategy to make Oman one of the top 10 global logistics hubs by 2040. </p><h4>What should be done to boost the transport and logistics sector in terms of regulations or PPPs?</h4><p>Coordination is the most important factor. We need coordination for any strategy to work. We frequently see that different ministries have different agendas or priorities. If we do not get the right priorities up front, things will not change. We need to change regulations and laws to adapt to changing environments and situations over time. There is a great deal of energy and drive; however, if people do not sit down and agree to do things together, nothing will get done. For us, it is good to be under the Asyad umbrella now, because many companies were basically doing ad hoc things without a particular direction. They were all controlled by the Ministry of Finance in terms of shareholders, but the latter does not necessarily have the in-house expertise to develop the logistics hub concept. Therefore, I am really happy about this change and hope we will have better coordination now, which is the most important thing. The Ministry of Finance is also looking at different companies  for sector-wide consolidation. </p><h4>How are low crude oil prices and the slowdown in natural gas production impacting you?</h4><p>Around 65% of our fleet is on long-term commitments, which means they are not exposed to the markets, which provides a solid foundation for us in terms of cash flow and so on. 35%, mainly VLCCs, are in the spot market. This combination is a good mix because when the market is high we can reap the benefits, and when it is low at least our steady cash flow supports us. Both 2015 and 2016 were amazing years, because when the price of oil went down, VLCC rates went up. We were earning good returns on chartering vessels. Now, although the price of oil is still low, the rates have gone down due to speculative investments and oversupply, particularly given that the world is cutting production. The rates have gone down, but we expect the situation to normalize. </p><h4>What are you doing to meet the Omanization requirements?</h4><p>One of the things we do well is train many seafarers. Since we started in 2003, we have trained over 90 Omani officers ranked between third officers and chief officer, and we still have quite a few cadets in the pipeline. We also provide students from the International Maritime College Oman (IMCO) with the sea experience and on-board training they require for their qualifications for free. Our main focus is to give back to the industry.</p><h4>What are Oman Shipping Company's plans in the near future?</h4><p>We will probably grow more in the refined petrochemicals segments rather than long-term chartering, but having our chartering desk. We already did this with our VLCC fleet at the beginning of 2017. We used to give the commercial management to a third party, but we took that in-house and developed it. We want to develop on the product and bulk cargo side. We also want to make sure we have captive cargo.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering the firm offers a wide range of legal services, which are most in demand?</h4><p>As one of the top-tier firms in the country, Al Yahyaei and Salt offers all forms of legal services. We have expertise in financial law as well as insurance law, which is why we have a large clientele in the banking and insurance industry. However, with every passing year, our work in the consultancy services subdivision has grown. We get overseas requests to provide advice. The requests range from foreign investors inquiring about incorporation of new companies to share purchasing, shareholder resolutions, general investments, and related or similar queries. We have provided legal advice to certain leading companies, which include banks, automobile distributors, and new foreign investors who are now ready to set foot in Oman.</p><h4>What legal challenges do foreign companies face in Oman?</h4><p>In Oman, the legal challenges are similar for entrepreneurs and investors, whether local or foreign. However, there are certain challenges for foreigners and the Omani administration is doing its best to continually improve as proven by the new FDI Law. However, a foreign investor may have apprehensions due to their lack  of knowledge of the legal system in Oman. Some of our clients have mentioned they would have preferred options of cheaper alternate dispute resolution in Oman. Alternate dispute resolutions, such as arbitration or mediation, are at a nascent stage in Oman. Lastly, another concern of foreign investors is compliance with Omanization rules that mandate foreign companies to recruit domestic workers.</p><h4>What impact will the new FDI Law have on foreign companies interested in investing in Oman?</h4><p>The new law is cognizant of Oman's investment obligations. These include its agreements with the WTO, its FTA with the US, and several other bilateral trade agreements with other nations. The law is expected to increase investor confidence by ensuring consistency and avoiding conflict with international trade arrangements and agreements. Other changes credited to the new FDI law are the removal of a minimum capital requirements, corporate tax exemptions, custom duty exemptions, and the bold measure of 100% foreign-owned companies. All these features will definitely stimulate foreign investment in Oman. In addition, Oman has a stable administration and fiscal state of affairs.</p><h4>From a legal point of view, what further incentives can the government offer foreign investors?</h4><p>Oman is already nurturing foreign investors by providing a wide scale of facilities, such as the development of nine industrial estates—namely Rusayl, Sohar, Raysut, Sur, Nizwa, Buraimi, Al-Mazunah, Smail, and Knowledge Oasis Muscat—and four free zones. These incentives include huge benefits to foreign investors; some even provide tax holiday up to 25 years, online management of investment, online forms to register with Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry (MOCI) and Oman Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (OCCI), and one-stop-shop facilities, wherein investors can benefit from starting a business. However, the need of the hour is to continue this trend of continuous growth, encouraging environment, and new schemes launched for foreign investors with full fervor. </p><h4>What are the firm's main objectives and goals for 2017-2018?</h4><p>Our foremost objective is to enhance and sustain our existing services and the quality of services that we have been delivering to our clientele throughout our operations. Nonetheless, we will continue to focus on expansion and growth of our firm in terms of our range of services as well as areas of services. Currently, we are also focusing on community outreach. Our goal is to thrive and also to help others via our efforts, offering pro bono legal services to disfranchised and disadvantaged persons as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What can the Public Authority for Mining (PAM) do to boost the sector?</h4><p><span></span>Dean Cunningham The new mining law will give clarity and accelerate the speed at which licenses are granted. A discussion with the government and private sector needs to happen, whereby we can openly have a debate so that both parties understand each other's long-term requirements, agendas, and what we would both like to achieve. As far as transporting gypsum, even if we build a railway line, it will take another five to 10 years before it happens. Nor can we simply build a railway network in Salalah just for the gypsum industry; it is expensive, and the return on capital is not there. Because of this, we need to find other options of how to try and bring the transport costs down and find solutions on the logistics side that will bring significant growth to the Omani mining market in this area.</p><p>DR. Salim Hamed Al Busaidi The government really needs to focus on what port facilities are needed by the private sector to be able to export mining products from Oman. Mineral commodities differ in their shipping requirements. For example, if we are exporting loose material we need to handle this in a particular manner. It is possible to run a conveyor through the sea so there is no need for the ship to dock. It is important to have these facilities. This requires government departments such as the Ministry of Transport to address the needs of companies to export their products while seeing which available products in Oman need to be transported. For example, if you transport ferrochrome it needs to be containerized, but you cannot put limestone into a container. Gypsum goes directly into the ship's hold. Some facilities have been introduced at the Port of Salalah to load loose materials onto ships using special tools and equipment, but this option is not available at Sohar Port yet. Loading via conveyor belt is better and easier.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for the coming year?</h4><p><span></span>DC For us, 2017 has been a tough year. There will be further cost reductions across the group, possibly delaying the capital expansion and pushing it out to 2018. Kunooz will also have to find smarter ways to run its business so that, ultimately, when the market does turn, we can focus on giving something back to our shareholders. In all of our businesses we are looking at multitasking across the board. We are also improving the utilization and efficiency of the existing staff in our businesses. In my experience, when the revenue line starts to pick up because commodity prices pick up, two or three months later our cost line will start to follow, which is why we have started a strategy to prevent the cost line from picking up. Though we might increase costs in some areas, I want to keep costs relatively stable. That will be the challenge for me in any revenue-improving environment. That is the one area I will put a great deal of effort into in the long term to manage costs.</p><p><span></span>SHAB The sector will maintain its growth, as the mineral opportunities in Oman are quite promising. There is always a new product being introduced to investors. I hope to see magnesium coming up in Oman one day. China is currently the main producer of this and has reduced the price significantly by lowering environmental protections, particularly in the case of CO2 emissions, whose restrictions are not the same as in Europe. The Chinese have consequently reduced the price of magnesium from USD6,000 per ton to USD2,000 per ton. Another idea is to have magnesium metal production in Oman. If there is demand and the right studies are done first, then perhaps Oman could also be a magnesium producer. Maadin Enterprises would certainly be interested if magnesium existed in commercially viable quantities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-will-to-dig]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of the mining sector in Oman, and how do you see it moving forward in 2018?</h4><p>PAM was established two years ago in a continuously growing mining sector, one of the sectors the government is relying on the most for economic diversification. We have a great structure in place to manage mining licenses and a new methodology to apply for licenses. We also want to increase the quality and competency of our staff to provide professional services to our customers. In terms of legislation, there has been significant progress, and we are almost in the final stages of the approval process. We are also conducting projects to identify mining blocks and obtain the no-objection permits from other ministries to offer them up for investment. Apart from all this, we are also investing in improving our technology.</p><h4>Which segments of the mining sector are growing the most?</h4><p>We foresee the greatest growth in industrial mining, especially in gypsum and limestone, because of their abundance. Since our country is mountainous and has high-quality building materials, resources such as concrete and sand are relevant to the Omani economy and have an outside market. We have not been doing enough in the exploration arena of metal minerals and will thus pay more attention to attracting investment for exploration and appraisal activities by providing incentives and sharing the risk with investors.<br>How does PAM assist Omani companies to become more competitive in the international market?<br>Each country has its own targeted markets. We are close to the Indian market, which is large enough to attract investors. Iran is our competitor in some resources, though ours are of a better quality. We have two factories that upgrade chromite, which enables us to sell this at a high standard on the international market. Quality is a rare commodity, and that is what we specialize in.</p><h4>How will the upcoming mining legislation specifically change the way companies operate?</h4><p>The contents of the new law are highly encouraging in terms of attracting investors in a transparent fashion. Once the law is approved, we would like to enact it within months. We are currently working on the final draft of the regulations, which is 80% completed. Issues such as taxation, for example, will be determined by the regulation and thus strengthen the market. The regulations will be specific in stipulating the entitlements and requirements for investors.</p><h4>How will the Oman rail boost mining activities and improve exports?</h4><p>Exporting hubs in Oman are well spaced; we have large ports that can support the export of minerals. Unfortunately, some of the minerals like gypsum and limestone are located in areas without the proper infrastructure to transport billions of tons 300km away from Duqm, the closest port. Oman is one of the top exporters of gypsum and would greatly benefit from a railway to increase exports and reduce transport costs.</p><h4>What are PAM's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>First and foremost, we want to get the law into the execution phase. Secondly, we want to materialize business opportunities and get them ready in 2018. We also want to promote our investment opportunities through high-tech strategies and provide one of the best services to existing license holders. Finally, we want to improve the working environment for our staff. We are moving to a new building and opening branches in other provinces. We already opened one in Salalah and will open another three in Nizma, Ibra, and Sohar in 2018. We also want to complete and start executing our mining strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you have specific niche products and clients that you have to feed separately from the competition?</h4><p>Business philosophy is what determines the difference between companies. Our main advantages are our plant capacity, production volume, and the integrated nature of our production and production quality model, which no one else can match at a local level because we have the only direct-reduced iron (DRI) plant in Oman with hot DRI directly going into EAF, thus saving substantial energy. There are companies in the UAE operating at a similar level to us but no one else has an iron-making facility in Oman. Most other companies use scrap and thus the quality of steel produced is noticeably inferior. People who can distinguish between top and low quality understand the value of our products, which puts us in a position to command a premium above our competitors. We have tremendous respect for other companies in the industry; however, we know our strengths. For example, because of our integrated system of plant operations, our operating costs are much lower. Our processes are designed in such a way that our energy needs are minimal, thus enabling us to hot charge the iron from the DRI unit to the electric furnace directly while saving energy. Our relative energy costs and CO2 footprint is far lower compared to those of our competitors and we can supply better material in amounts that allow us to meet the majority of output demand.</p><h4>How have economic conditions across the region affected demand?</h4><p>Demand in Oman has fallen because a large portion of construction activity, which was our main target, was fueled by the oil and gas industry. The same scenario on a much larger scale is observed in Saudi Arabia, where demand has dropped substantially, reducing prices that were once the highest in the region. The UAE, on the other hand, has not experienced such radical change as the Emirates are not as dependent on oil and gas as other Gulf states. Overall, however, we have no difficulty in finding demand for our products even if there are increasingly noticeable differences across the region.</p><h4>Do you plan on expanding your portfolio to any niche market demands?</h4><p>We are always expanding as any business needs to be prepared for various eventualities. If, for example, the overall rebar demand drops, we face the question of whether we are in a position to sustain ourselves. We have a multi-product strategy because we want that answer to always be affirmative. Jindal Sadeed Iron &amp; Steel has the ability to produce the best steel because no one else in the GCC has vacuum degassing for long products. That vacuum degassing gives us enormous strength to produce whatever quality of steel we want to produce and therefore that puts us in a position to produce the right kind of steel to export to various parts of the world.</p><h4>What have been the major supply milestones for you in Oman?</h4><p>Our strategy focuses on supporting our main distributors so they are the ones that compete for the project and we can supply to their projects directly. We work with a large number of distributors in Oman, supplying projects like the Mall of Oman. Our distributors are our partners, and we support them to make sure they are highly competitive and productive.</p><h4>Why did you choose to manufacture in Oman?</h4><p>The main factor affecting that choice is the high quality of life our employees can have in Oman. When we first came to the country in 2010, gas was readily available at an affordable cost and the average GDP growth was 5-6% at the time. There was high demand and productivity in the construction sector and, even though the country is facing some difficulties, that demand is still there. There are also excellent distribution logistics in place that enhance our ability to import materials and export our products. Also, we received great support from the government from the very beginning—we work closely with the Minister of Commerce and Industry and the Minister of Oil and Gas. It is a pleasure to conduct business in Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the Duqm Industrial Park project pave the way for the future development of cities like Duqm and the rest of Oman?</h4><p>Oman Wanfang is a Chinese company working on the One Belt, One Road initiative. The Duqm Industrial Park is one of 20 industrial parks for the Chinese government outside of China and enjoys the full support of the Chinese government. It is the second of its kind in the region after one in Egypt. Since last May, we signed a usufruct with the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD), and in the past year have been working on a land design plan. SEZAD just gave us the infrastructure to the boundary of our land; everything inside will be developed ourselves. At Wanfang, we are the operator and developer for the industrial park. As per the master plan, we made it with several industries, dividing it into heavy industry, light and medium industry, and mixed use. We also have a small piece of land for tourism, including a hotel. In regards to heavy industry, we plan to have an oil refinery and a gas-to-methanol plant. We also have a cement plant, steel processing factory, tire factory, and glass factory. For light industry, we are focusing on the building material market, which is considered the biggest in the region with almost 400sqm. Even though Duqm is currently under construction, we are not only focused on this city, but on the entire region since it is a harbor for building materials for every neighboring country as well. Duqm's geographical placement makes it a good distribution location. There are also some upcoming projects in solar energy, oil field drilling tools, and pipe manufacturing. In total, there are around 35 projects, 10 of which we signed in April 2017. We just started the ground breaking for the project, which means we already got approval for our master plan and are starting the land leveling and road construction part of the project. The first project should be delivered in a year, but other heavy industry projects might take two to three more.</p><h4>What impact will this project have on locals in terms of employment opportunities?</h4><p>We have already sent 39 students to China for training purposes, so we have a specific interest besides just hiring them. Given that Oman is trying to diversify and further develop as an industrial country in the GCC, we want to invest and give something back to Oman. This is why we are training students in China. It is more of a proper education than an actual training; students are learning about industrial investment for two years in our institute, completely free of charge. Once they finish, they will join our team, and are automatically employed in Duqm.</p><h4>What steps can be taken to attract more investment in Oman?</h4><p>Oman is a big country and has many industrial zones, but everyone knows Duqm is the biggest free trade zone in the region. The Omani government truly cares about the development of Duqm and announced that HE Yahya bin Said Al-Jabri would be Chairman, giving it more importance over other projects. It also has many attractive policies for investment, especially regarding taxes, import/export regulations, currency exchange, and Omanization. </p><h4>Will this project attract future Chinese investment to Oman?</h4><p>We have a commitment with Oman and will bring in many companies. Maybe in the future more will venture to this part of the world because we have many Chinese companies trying to go out and pick up more market share to be closer to their clients. Chinese companies are interested in Oman's tourism potential, for example, so that will definitely attract more companies.</p><h4>Where do you see the project moving forward in the coming five years?</h4><p>Hopefully, within five years, most of the land that we own is built on, and the main projects are up and running.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current demand for your products, and how do you see this evolving in the coming years?</h4><p>Demand comes from two areas. The first, which has been surprising, is for low-priced commodity products. There is large demand at the lower end of the segment and tremendous demand at the top end of the specialty market. Our job is to increase demand across the entire spectrum, especially at the top end, where added value, quality, and returns are higher. Our job is to move the bulk of people to this segment.</p><h4>What strategy are you following to grow this middle segment?</h4><p>The only strategy that works with consumers is to innovate, innovate, and then innovate some more. Different segments of consumers perceive value differently, so we have to find those niches and create products for them. Today, one of the fastest growing food areas is pizza, which is why we should innovate different toppings and ingredients.</p><h4>How has your partnership with Unilever, among others, helped the company grow?</h4><p>Unilever is a technology leader itself, so we follow it in this regard. However, Unilever respects our transparent and efficient manufacturing processes. Even a company that large is interested in reducing costs amongst its suppliers and rates each supplier based on the cost effectiveness of its technology implementation. This interests Unilever because cost-efficient suppliers translate into cost-efficient operations. In this context, we are performing well, and Unilever continues to utilize us. We receive a great deal of business from it because it has a strong presence in the Gulf and Pakistan, which allows us to open new markets there. This applies to other large multinationals like Kraft as well.</p><h4>What are the main benefits of manufacturing locally compared to other countries?</h4><p>Transport is a key factor, perhaps the most important one. This is why I am such a fan of the steps the government is taking in the infrastructure and logistics sector. This has been the key to our regional success. We are a regional player focused on the GCC and a bit beyond, and we feel that these government programs make our position stronger. We are in fact partnering with many logistics firms here. We have our own warehousing, and our automation system is one of only three in Oman. The DHL system is world-class, and we are using the same systems, though on a smaller scale, as them. With cloud technologies, we can integrate our operations into the systems of other logistics firms, allowing us to have seamless manufacturing and transport chains.</p><h4>Does Areej have any short-term expansion plans?</h4><p>The GCC remains our core area of operations, and we strive to increase our market share through niche markets here. There is great demand for ghee all across the globe, including Canada, but these exports are small compared to volumes in the GCC. Our biggest market is Saudi Arabia, which is three times larger than Oman, another strong market for us.</p><h4>What are Areej's main goals for 2017-2018?</h4><p>Right now, product expansion is on hold because of various market factors. For 2017 and 2018, our main objective is to secure our bottom line. Costs are rising across the board, and this is particularly acute in Oman because the government has no money to spend. Prices, however, have been held constant because of concerns from the Consumer Protection Society; therefore, we are being squeezed. Thus our major job for 2017 and 2018 is how to keep our bottom line secure. We are trying to survive these tough times, which should end by the middle of 2018, and look forward to the future. So far 2017 is looking like it will be worse than 2016 for Oman, but we are still positive. We are making decent profits despite the fact that the bottom line appears to be shrinking again. Under these conditions, consolidation is in order. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the firm's strategy to position Pepsi Oman in the region?</h4><p>Since its inception 42 years ago, Oman Refreshment Company (ORC) has established itself as a market leader in its core product portfolio in Oman. It is focused on maintaining its market leadership in the F&amp;B product segments that it operates, while sustaining its profitability levels and shareholder returns at the current level and grow upon that base. Despite the new challenges emerging from the fundamental economic conditions impacting the business environment in the region and Oman, immediate opportunities for growth will continue to be in its core beverages and food segment (PepsiCo products) with the growing local population as well as government commitment to continue spending on major infrastructure projects that have been announced and are ongoing in the country. Launching innovative products to meet changing consumer preferences and tastes are expected to attract and maintain customer loyalty to ORC.</p><h4>What has been the demand and evolution of beverage and snack products in Oman?</h4><p>Our core consumer offer is ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages and ready-to-eat (RTE) salty and sweet snack products. The demand for RTD and RTE products is growing in Oman as consumers are looking for high-quality products to fill diverse consumer needs from youth to advanced age, as is evident from their expanding space and range on the shop shelves. Though consumer preferences and tastes are continually changing, the price sensitivity of Omani consumers is playing an important role in gaining market foothold for new products and new entrants. ORC, with its large category base, is perfectly positioned to cater to Omani consumer needs in the segments where we operate. The strategy of offering good-for-you, fun-for-you, and better-for-you products is imbedded into our plans and we strive to win consumer satisfaction every day though our more than 1,000 associates.</p><h4>What is the current status of the Omani manufacturing sector?</h4><p>Although mineral wealth other than oil and gas, demographic factors, and our locational advantage in the Arabian Peninsula present a perfect case for an ever-growing manufacturing sector, real growth on the ground has not been as anticipated due to various factors. Competitive advantages offered by the special economic zones in the neighborhood at times pull potential investors away from Oman. However, new developments in the Port of Duqm and the adjacent special economic zone (SEZAD) are attracting significant foreign and domestic investments. It will be a while before we see their actual contribution to the larger economy. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators appear to be attractive and interesting, and the microeconomic indicators are reflecting the impact of short-term measures initiated to cover the widening budget deficit on account of downturn in international oil prices. The ninth Five-Year Plan, published in 2016, has identified manufacturing, tourism, transport and logistics, mining, and fisheries as the new growth engines of the Omani national economy, diversifying it away from the oil and gas sector. Recently, the government's commitment to diversifying the Omani economy has been more clearly pronounced through the new Tanfeedh program, i.e. the National Program for Enhancing Economic Diversification, which is meant to proactively link the different strategies of the targeted economic sectors of manufacturing, tourism, transport and logistics, mining, and fisheries.</p><h4>What is the status of your research and development of new product lines?</h4><p>One of the fallouts of the proposed excise tax on carbonated beverages is that it may reduce new investments in business expansion and enhance related capacities in the carbonated beverages sector. On the other hand, it may act as an incentive for companies to invest in the R&amp;D of new product lines to expand non-CSD beverages and diversify into other products, as well as expand offerings of other food product ranges. Our partners (PepsiCo and others) are working hard to identify new products that address consumer needs at all ages. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al-Ghalbi International helped develop the Omani economy in the past years?</h4><p>Since 1998, Oman's strategy has been to set up a program to develop local companies. It was set up to give local companies enough opportunities to have some business leads in oil and gas. Al-Ghalbi International started with this program in 1998 as one of the local community contractors with small jobs in cold cutting and then slowly developed to become one of the main contractors in the oil and gas pipeline maintenance and construction segment. Before, there were only three or four companies doing this job. However, in line with the strategy of His Majesty's decree, support and opportunities were given to these big companies to have good local competitors. In regard to developing the oil and gas sector in Oman, firstly we are on the ground, focused on reducing costs. The cost in Oman since 1980 has come down because there are many competitors. Oman's strategy to develop local companies is also moving forward and boosting in-country value (ICV). </p><h4>How does Omanization impact Al-Ghalbi International, especially with this diversification that you are undergoing?<br></h4><p>Being the leader of the Omanization Committee in oil and gas sector in Oman, it is one of our main responsibilities to consider all possible measures for Omanization without affecting our cost or quality. Omanization is difficult to implement, and many people are looking for jobs. Omani investors in local companies and businesses in general must think about whom they are helping. The additional costs for Omanization should be included in companies' cost structure. For Al-Ghalbi, Omanization is going well. We are above the required percentage and could establish an Omani SME company under our name that also fulfills the Omanization requirements. I train people from lower levels, such as helpers and drivers, and enroll them in free English courses. These courses open up doors for people who are certified but have poor language skills. We started with only 30 people but had around 80-100 within three months. It is important to help our staff, understand their needs, and know how to handle, lead, and talk by being close to them. </p><h4>To what extent has the JSRS system been a positive tool for oil and gas companies?</h4><p>Oman previously had several difficulties, especially registering foreign companies, but the government is constantly developing new and innovative systems like the Joint Supplier Registration System (JSRS). Now if a company is registered in one place, with all of its papers and documents filling the requirements, it will have one common window through which to access almost all contract, project, and tender opportunities. </p><h4>What projects will Al-Ghalbi International be focusing on in 2017-2018?</h4><p>With the crisis of falling prices in the oil and gas sector, we have to think about how to build new businesses and diversify. For example, we are looking to delve into logistics, information and communication technology, real estate, and some multi-workshops for oil and gas services. We have also invested in long-term projects in Abu Dhabi that will expand into other Emirates, Qatar, and other Middle Eastern countries within the near future. We are also working with the Sohar and Duqm refineries by means of joint venture strategies. Finally, we have signed multiple JVs with international companies for specialized projects in Duqm.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in the next two years?</h4><p>Unfortunately, business here in the GCC depends on government and oil and gas. If oil prices do not increase, many projects will be suspended or face difficulties to run as before. It will impact our business, if not directly then in our profits, development, or strategy. We need to basically shift from an importing mentality to producing locally and exporting. For the time being our business diversification strategies are working well, and we have been able to get more long-term contracts from major clients in the Sultanate and UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views and assessment of Tanfeedh?</h4><p>It is an excellent initiative and has real potential to give momentum to Oman's economy in these challenging times.</p><h4>You have been a part of the deliberations. What in your opinion are the two or three things that can be done to take Oman's economy to the next level?</h4><p>Three things stand out: the ease of doing business, freedom from employment regulations, and promotion of public-private partnerships (PPPs). Investors cite excessive red tape and restrictive employment regulations as the two main barriers to attract more private sector investment in the country—both foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic direct investment (DDI). Many of the Tanfeedh initiatives promote the ease of doing business and easing of employment regulations. Improvements in these two areas, in tandem with PPP as a platform for investment initiatives, shall awaken renewed interest in investing in our economy.</p><h4>The program is trying to involve all stakeholders in the development process. Will this help in meeting the current challenges in a better manner?</h4><p>Absolutely. All stakeholders must talk openly with each other, and more importantly, listen to each other. A great deal of that happened in the Tanfeedh Lab process—the government, private sector, and all stakeholders expressing opinions freely and really listening to each other.</p><h4>What measures can be taken to create more sustainable job opportunities for Omanis?</h4><p>Remove all quotas for Omanization. Match leadership, training, up-skilling, and apprenticeship programs to the jobs the private sector is creating. We must get rid of NOCs for expats, since we are losing valuable Oman-based knowledge, skills, and experience. If we liberalize employment regulations, we will see the economy grow. In a growing economy, real jobs are created that offer meaningful, productive employment for Omanis. There is no better employee in any economy than a local employee. After that, we need expats for the jobs that we do not have enough Omanis to perform.</p><h4>The program has identified certain thrust sectors like manufacturing, tourism, and logistics in addition to fisheries and mining. Does Oman offer good potential in these sectors for domestic and international investors?</h4><p>Absolutely. These are all areas where Oman has the potential to be world class and internationally competitive. In tourism, we have a fabulous country with wonderful people; in manufacturing, mining, and fisheries, we need volume to drive logistics and get more companies to become export-oriented; in logistics, there is nothing preventing Oman from becoming a global logistics hub at the crossroads of East and West, especially if we move up the World Bank indices for Competitiveness and Ease of Doing Business. Many of the Tanfeedh Logistics Lab initiatives are about getting goods and cargo to move across Oman's sea, air, and land borders in a 'Faster, Cheaper, Simpler' fashion. </p><h4>The government wants the private sector to play an important role in the Sultanate's economic development. In what ways can companies like Renaissance contribute towards this goal?</h4><p>We already do. We have taken a lead in exporting our services to other markets and we have been active in DDI for many years. We build, own, and operate workforce accommodation facilities throughout Oman's oil and gas fields. Along with our partners, we are investing in a 16,000-bed workforce accommodation facility in Duqm. This is a USD195 million investment to ensure the way Oman looks after its blue-collar workforce sets an example to the world in terms of high standards, but at internationally competitive costs through economies of scale. Given our proven profitable success and delivery capability in this area, we are open to welcoming FDI and DDI partners in future projects if this brings GDP growth, sustainable Omani jobs, and inward investment into our economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are low oil prices affecting contracting groups such as STS in the energy and industrial sectors in Oman? </h4><p>There is still a large amount of major project investment in Oman, which is a good sign. Major projects bring a lot of business to the whole market; BP Kazan and Duqm are good examples of this, but there are many more. Many of these projects do have quite a bit of external financing, but are still being executed in Oman. This is an area that is good for us because we have a fabrication and manufacturing element to our business, in addition to a certain amount of construction. With every major project there is a new process unit added to the portfolio, and that means more business for us. New processes require more shutdown and turnaround services, and we are currently the major player in large process unit turnaround and maintenance. Our clients in this area include Orpic, Oman Methanol, Salalah Methanol, Oman LNG, and Equate (Kuwait), among others.  We commenced our shutdown business back in 2007 when there was a single refinery in Oman, and the expansion of refining capabilities in the country has been an important part of our business ever since. Notwithstanding, STS is very much an oilfield-focused company; the largest portion of our revenue comes from oilfield services both in Oman and the GCC. Even in a low oil price environment, there is a certain amount of investment that needs to happen in order for the country to continue producing. </p><h4>Do you have any plans to participate in more joint ventures moving forward?</h4><p>Definitely. We are currently engaged in three, with a South African, Dutch, and American partner each. These joint ventures (JVs) demonstrate our capacity to work with international firms in a profitable and effective way. Each of our international partners offers strategic and complementary services. </p><h4>You recently celebrated 7 million safe hours of operations at one of your plants. To what do you attribute this success? </h4><p>There are two answers to this question: commitment and culture. We have 8,000 people on our payroll who everyday work in high-risk areas with great potential for serious accidents. When working in hydrocarbon facilities, safety is paramount. </p><h4>What role does your graduate development program mean for the company and the Omani economy?</h4><p>It is extraordinarily significant for us. We have a large number of graduates going through it. This program involves being deployed in the field where they can get real experience of the work we do on a daily basis. This is a major investment in the market by STS, and as time goes on the Omani private sector will need to employ more nationals than it currently does. This program prepares Omani graduates for that challenge. For us, we get Omanis moving through the hierarchy of our organization, which will hopefully lead to Omanis holding senior leadership roles in the future. What could be better than having someone who started at the shop floor working their way to the top? Meanwhile, we have invested in a purpose-built training facility in Nizwa, which is certified by CISRS. We train young Omanis in a great variety of skills that are necessary in our industry. STS is a 100% Omani-owned company, and we are invested in ensuring that young Omanis have a bright future at our company and in the wider market we serve.</p><h4>Do you have any other plans for expanding outside the GCC?</h4><p>We do. As far as Oman goes, it is our home. STS started in Oman in 1980, working with PDO. We have worked with PDO ever since getting our start, and we have serviced the entire market. It's a wonderful country and it has a tremendous future. Oman will always be our base, but we see value in business and geographical diversification. True value lies in sustainability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Gulf Energy doing to increase efficiency and productivity to meet its clients' requirements?</h4><p>Gulf Energy is a group of companies with different services and product lines. We are very diversified and provide the majority of oil and gas services with the highest service quality. One of our challenges is to bring these segments as close as possible to each other while sustaining their specific technical identity and unique position. We are not only referring to sharing resources such as finance, HR, or procurement; these have been shared for many years already. We have gone further, sharing knowledge, learning, systems, resources, and people. We have built a very advanced in-house ERP system that plays a vital role in our efficiency. Capitalizing on the synergies between our companies has substantially improved our efficiency. As a result, in 2016 Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) performed a two-week intensive audit of Gulf Energy for a letter of assurance (LOA). This used to be done for each individual company; however, in 2016 we agreed that as we are one group with one system, PDO should do the LOA across the entire group. It had to make sure every company within our system follows the same system, policies, and procedures. We were one of very few companies ranked as green, which means that for the next four years we do not need to be pre-qualified for any new work with PDO in terms of health, safety, and the environment (HSE). This great achievement adds to the award-winning LEAN projects that we have executed. We give QHSE the top-most priority and aim to be among the biggest leaders. We are in the process of receiving the API Q2 certification for Gulf Energy as a group by mid 2018. It is a more restricted and oil industry-related version of ISO. While undergoing the API Q2 internal preparations and audits, we have managed to find other opportunities to improve our system. We are now serving our clients as corporations rather than individual companies managed by a holding. We are now in the phase of providing solutions and specialized integrated services to our clients.</p><h4>What is Gulf Energy's current market share in the oil services business segment, and how do you see this evolving in the near future?</h4><p>Each business and product line has a different market and market share. For coil tubing and stimulation services we have 100% of market share with PDO for the last five years. We recently received a new contract that started last October for another five years and provide these services to other operators in Oman as well. For cementing, we serve all rigs and hoists in south Oman, while Schlumberger and Halliburton serve the north. For fishing and remedial services, we do the vast majority of the scope for almost all operators in Oman. We have opened a new manufacturing ICV facility in Nizwa to manufacture important oil and gas equipment that used to be imported. For drilling equipment services supported by a solid machine shop and testing services, we have the majority of the scope in Oman as well. We are also finalizing another casing accessories manufacturing plant and have won a 100% long-term contract with PDO for casing accessories. We also provide performance drilling, MWD, motors, and turbines for several operators, not to mention hoists, FBU services, drilling fluid services, artificial lift, and other specialized services for various operators in Oman.</p><h4>What is Gulf Energy's opinion regarding exploration and drilling activities in Oman?</h4><p>Drilling activities in Oman and in the Middle East in general, unlike the US, do not usually slow down during low oil price years. However, exploration and more expensive drilling activities sometimes do. In Oman, we have long-term contracts with most of our clients. The impact on us was more related to providing work at lower prices rather than less work. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What developments are there in Oman's liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry at the moment?</h4><p>It is an interesting time for Oman's LNG industry, which continues to evolve since its establishment by Royal Decree back in 1994 after the discovery of significant volumes of non-associated gas in the country. The volumes exceeded the needs of domestic industry, and Oman sought to monetize them through export. Shell was involved in the design and construction of Oman's LNG plant, which was completed ahead of time and under budget in 2000, and has a 30% stake in it. Oman's LNG contribution to government revenue is significant, in some years contributing almost 10% of its income, with a resulting contribution to the wider economy. The company enhances this through an active social investment policy not only in and around its plant location in Sur but across the country. In the longer term, Shell aims to help Oman ensure sufficient gas for both domestic consumption and LNG export through further exploration efforts in Oman, the proposed Iran-Oman gas pipeline, and the development of in-country renewable energy.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the new EOR technologies being explored by GlassPoint, in which Shell is a shareholder?</h4><p>The GlassPoint project generates steam directly through solar energy and is highly efficient at doing so. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and GlassPoint's development of this technology to enhance the heavy oil recovery (EOR) from the Amal field in south Oman is visionary. The project frees up for other uses a significant amount of gas which would otherwise be used for steam generation. The construction of the project, now in its second phase, followed an extensive pilot in which PDO and GlassPoint observed that, because the steam retained its heat underground, the lack of steam generation at night had little or no impact on oil recovery. There is considerable scope for renewable energy sources like solar and wind in all oil production, and Shell is interested in exploring this in Oman and elsewhere. </p><h4>What is your current involvement with SMEs, and what impact is this having on Oman's development?</h4><p>Shell has supported the SME sector in Oman since 1995 when the company launched the 'Shell Intilaaqah' program to coincide with the publication of Oman's Vision 2020 which emphasized diversification, the role of the private sector, and fostering SME growth. Shell Intilaaqah is a social investment program to support budding entrepreneurs. Intilaaqah, which means “take-off" in Arabic, is based on Shell's LiveWIRE program, which started in 1982 in Scotland and has been going ever since. We relaunched Intilaaqah as part of our 2015 'Gift to the Nation' to enhance our support to SMEs. We do this by providing more focus on guiding SMEs through the challenges they often face in marketing, human resource, project, and cash flow management, and by offering diagnostic studies for struggling start-ups and small businesses. </p><h4>What are your objectives and future expansion plans for 2017?</h4><p>There is quite a bit on our plate at the moment. We are of course supporting PDO to safely increase its oil production and continue its journey to enhanced unit operating costs in Block 6. With PDO we are examining expansion options to tap into the considerable potential of PDO expertise for the benefit of Oman more broadly. We are also focused on helping Oman LNG maintain its operational excellence. The plant at Sur has an admirable health and safety record, and it recently achieved 20 million man hours without a lost time injury, a great achievement. We are particularly focused on supporting Oman LNG to increase the utilization of the plant without any safety incidents. That is a real focus for the coming 18 months. Separately, we have signed a Heads of Agreement with Oman Oil Company Exploration and Production (OOCEP) to assist in the exploration and development of oil and gas in block 42, among others we are keen to explore.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy is PDO currently following to mitigate the impact of low oil prices?</h4><p>There is a comprehensive effort to leave no stone unturned in our drive for cost control and efficiency and value creation, including far greater collaboration with our contractors. Throughout 2016, we staged 24 Contract Optimization Reviews (CORs) focused on multi-day workshops where, together with the relevant contractor, we identified opportunities for enhancing efficiency and eliminating waste. This resulted in USD64 million in cost savings for the year and important efficiency and productivity gains for PDO and our contractors. Our strategic partnership with Petrofac has enabled us to save in excess of USD480 million on key equipment and other purchases for our Yibal Khuff mega project. For 2017, we have set an aggressive target of 30 CORs. Of this total, 20 had already been completed by the end of August resulting in savings of around USD185 million. What's more, our second Focused Results Delivery (FRD) program has identified an opportunity to simplify the regulations around our small oil and gas facility projects that could save more than USD100 million a year. We undertook this after the success of our first FRD program in 2016, which identified over 500 cost-saving improvements through the removal of “nice-to-haves" in our engineering standards. One particular area I would like to highlight is our Lean Program, which has transformed the way we work by stripping out waste and streamlining our practices across all aspects of our business. So far, Lean has helped us to generate around USD1 billion in savings, revenue generation, and cost avoidance, not to mention the more-than 5,000 ideas for continuous improvement that have been submitted by our staff. Lean has galvanized all levels of the company, delivering tangible benefits by freeing up resources and ratcheting down costs. </p><h4>Although PDO has 178 producing oil fields, 10,000 active wells, and had its highest oil production in 2016, does it have any plans to expand exploration or drilling?</h4><p>We have to work within the mandatory parameters laid down by the government in light of the OPEC production agreements. However, our focus remains on delivering our growth program with ever-increasing efficiency and staying the course in our key strategic priorities. We remain bullish about our growth prospects, as our portfolio remains healthy and profitable. We are capable of ramping up our long-term production plateau to at least 650,000bpd in the next three years but are being guided by the Ministry of Oil and Gas on future targets. I'm particularly proud of the approach taken by our exploration team, which has proficiently hooked up and monetized all exploration discoveries, enabling it to fully recover its exploration spending within the same year.</p><h4>What main initiatives is PDO currently rolling out across its multiple operations?</h4><p>In January 2017, we launched an in-house behavior-based safety system called Ihtimam in three pilot areas, which is providing a drastic change in how we manage personal safety and associated behavior. Another pillar of this is our In-Vehicle Monitoring System, which provides a combination of online monitoring, structured analysis and reporting, and consistent consequence management, and has led to significant falls in the number of road safety violations from speeding, seatbelt under-usage, and harsh braking. In February 2016, there were 14.76 violations per vehicle in the 8,500-plus PDO and contractor fleet. However, by August this year, this had fallen to 1.65 with improved compliance of around 89%. </p><h4>What are PDO's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>In a nutshell, delivering on promises and meeting our stakeholders' demands and expectations more safely, efficiently, and responsibly. We will continue our drive for the early monetization and hook-up of low unit technical cost prospects while maintaining our overarching focus on personal and process safety as we strive for Goal Zero—no harm to our people, environment, or assets. At the same time, to guarantee our future sustainability and that of the nation, we must ensure reserves and contingent resource replacement ratios are above one.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In regard to business strategy, what is Vanguard doing differently than its competitors?</h4><p>From day one, we at Vanguard have always focused on manufacturing and value addition. When we started in 2006 the first thing we did was to put a facility together in the industrial area so that we could work all the opportunities into local value addition. This has been our strength from day one, and over the last 10 years this has now taken us to the next level; we are already starting to see the benefits from this value addition. Initially, we started off capturing the market with our products and developing the market coverage before gradually manufacturing some of these products with the right technologies and bringing in good channel partners to help us with the same. Recently, we have come up with some cutting-edge technologies that have really provided an edge for Vanguard and started entering into niche areas. To be specific, we are working on several different segments of the industry, including mechanical, instrumentation, electrical, and process. These segments have certain products and services that are required by the oil companies, and we have selected a few to be mentioned in instrumentation, such as a multi-phase metering that was a critical to how oil companies test their wells. We found a partner some years ago and together have brought in some new technology to the market that we have been improving over the last two years. We are now seeing long-term contracts in this area.</p><h4>How will your technological breakthroughs impact the Omani market?</h4><p>Our competition is mostly international companies that have also been providing products and solutions over the years. They have much bigger support systems and resources available to them, so we have been beating that competition to break through with our technology. The second thing beside price is delivery and response time. Because we are a local company, we have facilities and resources available on the ground and are doing local manufacturing, which gives us an upper hand over the oil companies. At Vanguard, there are three companies in the group: Vanguard Engineering, Vanguard Oil Tools, and Vanguard Reservoir. Vanguard Engineering is mainly a job shop for manufacturing and a company that offers products and services. </p><h4>What are Vanguard's main objectives, goals, and expansion plans?</h4><p>Vanguard has planned to further build on its existing manufacturing facilities and increase the product range profiles. We will try to take products and services to the next level. We have plans to expand our facilities, and with regard to international deliverance, we are going to start with smaller projects. We do not have a production line throwing out products at a certain time and section; rather, we do customized projects that go through phases of engineering, design, and development before they actually get manufactured, so those things take time. We are working on some things internationally that should have started in 2017 and be completed in 2018. Most of these projects take about six to eight months or longer because of the long lead time of delivering items. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[One of three SROs in Indonesia]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[friderica-widyasari-dewi-president-director-indonesia-central-securities-depository]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us a bit more about the capital markets financial infrastructure and the role of KSEI?</h4><p>KSEI is one of the three self-regulatory organizations (SRO) in the Indonesian capital market, according to the Capital Market Law no 8 from 1995. The other two SROs are Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation (KPEI). KSEI represents the country as the Central Securities Depository (CSD), which provides securities central custody and transaction settlement services. KSEI commits to continuously support the growth of the Indonesian capital market by developing infrastructures and innovations. We provide a platform and system infrastructure to support the development that covers the needs of our regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) or OJK, stakeholders and also market players. Since 2000, KSEI has successfully converted the depository services in Indonesia capital market from script into scriptless (dematerialized) securities. This migration is one of the milestones in Indonesia capital market in order to support the effectiveness and efficiency of trading process. With the conversion to scriptless securities, KSEI is now able to conduct book-entry settlement supported by the high technology system, The Central Depository and Book-Entry Settlement System (C-BEST). Since 2009, KSEI has launched AKSes facility that enables investors to inquire their ownership (portfolio) and transaction through consolidated system. This system is also intended for investor protection as well. AKSes facility is the further development of Single Investor Identification (SID), a single ID which is used as investor's identity when they open their first account in Indonesia Capital Market. SID is mandatory generated for any investor.  KSEI also works closely with Bank of Indonesia (BI). In 2006, KSEI was appointed as one of the sub-registry to administer the government bonds. This appointment shows the Government's trust in the reliability of KSEI's infrastructure. Having known for its SID facility for the capital market investor, KSEI has also recently appointed by BI as the SID generator for all of the investors who owned government bonds. Beside this project, KSEI has also appointed by BI to provide the Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NCD) custody services. In cooperation with the Directorate General of Demographic and Civil Registration of the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, KSEI is able to accelerate the opening of investment accounts. By utilizing the demographic and electronic ID (e-KTP) data for capital market services, the time required to open the investment account (securities account and cash account) can be reduced from days to only less than 30 minutes. The electronic ID data is also used to verify the investor database in order to create a more reliable database. KSEI have also introduced its new mutual fund hub infrastructure called S-INVEST in 2016. The system enables the mutual fund operation services between the asset managements, custodian banks, as well as the brokers to be integrated into one platform. This development of this new system makes Indonesia as the first country in South East Asia that provides such infrastructure. The implementation of this infrastructure also contributes to the award which was received by KSEI in 2016, as the Best Central Securities Depository in South East Asia in 2016.</p><h4>The number of SIDs has exceeded 1 million. What does this figure say about the size and scale of the capital markets in Indonesia?</h4><p>This investor number has been increasing tremendously, especially after we launched S-INVEST, a platform for mutual funds industry. Previously, the number of investors which is covered by KSEI are only the one which invests any kind of securities, except mutual funds. Since the establishment of our mutual fund hub system, S-INVEST, we are now able to consolidate the number and the figure of all investor which is around 1.1 million, 20% increased from 2016. However, we think that the number of investors is still low compared to the Indonesia population that reach 250 million of people. This is because people has been spoiled by the high of interest rate, so they still prefer to put their money in the banks. However, currently as the interest rate declines, people tend to find investments which can grow their funds. In this case, our role, together with IDX and KPEI, is to introduce and educate people about investing in capital market, not only to grow their investment, but also as one of the ways to contribute to the country development. I am confident that the market will keep growing in the future, considering Indonesia's economic potential and massive infrastructure development at present. In the near future, there will be a new initiative by the government aimed to help people to be able to own houses with minimum installment rates. Law number 4 from 2016 concerning Public Housing Savings has already taken into effect since 2016, and shall become effective once the Government Regulation regarding the Implementation of Public Housing Savings is established, possibly in 2018. In order to enable value growth, a certain portion of the Public Housing Savings or TAPERA is planned to be invested in Mutual Funds and therefore shall be administrated in KSEI's centralized system for the fund industry, namely the S-INVEST. In addition, KSEI will also generate the SIDs for these investors, which in return shall multiply the number of investors up until 4.5 million SIDs for the first stages of TAPERA implementation.</p><h4>What are your initiatives to educate people on your available products (AKSes)? </h4><p>KSEI has been conducting several activities and awareness program to educate the people regarding Indonesia Capital Market, together with IDX and KPEI. AKSes Facility was established by KSEI since 2009, then in 2012 we launched AKSes' mobile application. Investors use this facility to monitor their investment portfolios online based on real time data recorded in KSEI. Together with SID and the Investor Client's Fund Account (RDN), AKSes Facility is intended to be one of the investors protection facilities in Indonesia capital market. This year, KSEI is developing AKSes Next Generation with the enhancement in some features, such as how to login, and other information services provided. The development of AKSes Next-G is part of KSEI's efforts to provide convenience and ease of using AKSes Facility. This improvement hopefully will increase the number investors who utilize AKSes Facility. In the meantime, AKSes Facility has only been utilized by 12% of total investors.</p><h4>Are you looking to have more foreign participation into the securities?</h4><p>Indonesia is a promising market to invest. The growth of the Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) is the highest among other markets, with 228% in 10 years. Looking at Indonesia economic growth, which stands at above 5%, and the current aggressive development of infrastructure, we are confident that foreign investors are keen to invest in our market. Foreign Investors are well informed about best markets to invest, so in that way, we are not worried. However, in order to attract more investor to invest in Indonesia, our approach is more to convince them that Indonesia is the best place to invest. This can be achieved by providing them the infrastructure which is aligned to international regulation, standards, and best practice. By providing them convenient environment to invest, we are confident that the number of foreign investor can also be increased in term of the number. Currently we are more focusing to increase the number of local investor through several awareness and education program, together with IDX and KPEI.</p><h4>What are your ambitions and objectives for KSEI moving forward?</h4><p>Currently, we are developing the General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) platform through electronic platform. This platform have been introduced in several countries including Turkey, India, Taiwan, and the Netherlands. The development of e-proxy and e-voting platform can be seen as KSEI's effort to facilitate investor's convenience. E-proxy and e-voting platform are the application which accommodate investor's needs and convenience as Shareholders to be able to participate in the GMS without having them to physically present due to geographically conditions of Indonesia where investors lives in different cities, even they reside abroad. This platform is expected to provide convenience for local and foreign investors and become solution for investors who have to attend multiple GMS being held at the same time but in different locations. With the number of issuers which has reached more than 500 companies, there exists the possibility that GMS will be held at the same day during a year. Meanwhile, 35% of  Indonesia's capital market investors hold multiple securities. In order to build an e-proxy and e-voting platform, KSEI has appointed Mekezi Kayit Kurulusu (MKK) — the Central Securities Depository of Turkey. KSEI plans to launch e-proxy platform during next year, while for e-voting platform will be developed in the next phase since there is the law adjustment needed. We are now also working on the enhancement of our main system, C-BEST Next Generation. It allows us to anticipate the increase in trading and number of investors. The C-BEST Next-G is expected to enhance 10 times from the previous system in speed and capacity and hopefully will be launched next year. KSEI wants to provide more services to stakeholders. To fulfill this KSEI has Financial Hub Program cooperation with banking industry as a third party. This was done to support the financial services in establishing the financial market deepening program which covers all financial sectors, namely capital market, banking and non-bank financial institutions. Our synergy with banks is expected to provide a solution since infrastructure development requires a huge investment and will take a very long time if it was to be implemented by the capital market industry alone. In the future, Indonesia capital market can develop rapidly with the availability of infrastructure which can reach remote areas in Indonesia. With the continuous development in its infrastructure, it is expected that the public can invest in the capital market more easily.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[9 million visitors to the iEN Portal]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-mohammed-alzighibi-ceo-tatweer-company-educational-services]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision on the future of e-learning and how is this key to your portfolio at T4edu?</h4><p>One of the core focuses of our strategy is digital content and we are the sole provider for the Ministry of Education in terms of blended content and digital content. We provide thousands of digital textbooks and learning and teaching resources consolidated in the iEN, National Education Portal that is customized and tailored toward the new generation of learners. We want to engage current and future generations in a way that stimulates them and captures their attention. In less than two years, we have managed to reach 1 million new active users and we have welcomed about 9 million visitors to the iEN Portal. We provide services to users both within Saudi Arabia and across the world as part of our digital education strategy. We work in partnership with our sister company, which owns and operates the LMS, and our content is embedded in their systems.</p><h4>Are you a content developer or a delivery intermediary?</h4><p>T4edu operates as both, as our content strategy is comprehensive. We develop our own content while also working with our partners to buy or collaboratively develop new content unique to the Kingdom. Our partners include the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the largest early childhood education organization in the world, the University of Oregon, and other major international institutions. We were recently tasked with creating the first sports education curriculum for girls in the country, and we are proud to be able to introduce this program in 2019. Furthermore, we work with Macmillan Education and McGraw-Hill  Education  and MM Publications to provide the entire English-language curricula materials for the Ministry of Education. Along with this, we provide professional development programs to support curricula enactment as well as work with international partners to provide teacher up-skilling programs for science and math teachers. Pearson is among our global partners to craft these programs. Educational initiatives are integrated with after-school programs and extra-curricular activities. Currently, we run 520 after-school community clubs for the Ministry of Education. We open schools from 4pm-9pm four days a week to provide students and the local communities with a place to gather and engage in useful and educational activities as we envision integrating cultural and artistic activities into these initiatives. By 2020, we aim to reach 2,000 schools. Our initial goal was 1,000; however, when we presented this goal to the government, it insisted on a more ambitious expansion plan, because wherever we open these programs, crime amongst youths drops significantly. This is part of the Kingdom's inclusivity approach, focusing on disadvantaged areas, rural areas, and inner city areas. T4edu also runs a large initiative for the government that aims to increase familial engagement with early childhood education. We have already opened 300 neighborhood learning centers, where we provide classes for families and children and organize conferences to engage the broader community. In addition, there are three science centers, and we plan on opening the fourth in September. This facility is being designed in partnership with industry leaders and it will be one of the largest in the Middle East.</p><h4>Could you elaborate on your efforts to lift the language standards in the Kingdom?</h4><p>To contribute to addressing English language proficiency in the Kingdom, T4edu recently partnered with National Geographic Learning and EF, which provided online professional development  programs for teachers. We have had great responses from teachers all across the country. These initial programs have been completed and during the course of the programs we worked closely with many other international education curricula and professional up-skilling providers. Up-scaling the level of English proficiency among the general population is a massive and important endeavor, and we continue to focus on it a great deal.</p><h4>How would you characterize your current portfolio of projects?</h4><p>Currently, we have three portfolios. The first is the King Abdullah bin Abdulazizi project for Public Education Development, which includes afterschool programs and professional development. The second is our work with the National Transformation Program2020; here, we run some programs while also contracting others for the Ministry of Education; this is a large portfolio. The third portfolio comprises a number of universities and non-profit organizations. This includes early childhood education and STEM programs and we provide equipment, content, and training for the teachers. Most of our programs are blended programs that include a strong IT component. Our teams provide content for over 5 million students and 600,000 teachers.</p><h4>What are your expectations of distance learning in the Saudi education landscape?</h4><p>Our virtual schools provide virtual classrooms for nearly 100,000 students. We provide supporting classes online that are available an open platform for students anywhere in the world. The idea is to provide these classes in the evening so they do not conflict with the teaching schedules of our staff, allowing us to recruit the best people for this.</p><h4>What are the organization's ambitions for the coming years?</h4><p>We work with two mindsets; one is our own strategy while the other focuses on the requests, challenges, and challenges of our partners, such as the Ministry of Education encounter. The Minister of Education is the chairman of the board and there are important collaborative and supporting links between T4edu and the Ministry of Education. One of our main ambitions is to enrich the Saudi curriculum. There are certain limitations on the content in the curriculum. We may face some resistance; however, we are preparing a strategy to enrich this. The second part of our strategy is to enrich our digital content. We have been in talks with potential partners to enrich our content, and our team dedicated to this initiative is working every day to enrich our current offerings. In 2019, we will introduce a new component to the curriculum: philosophy for children. This will be about creativity and critical thinking and will be designed to allow children to understand complex concepts. We are working to develop a program focused on exploring the national literature of Saudi Arabia as well, and T4edu, along with King Saud University, has identified 150 historical poets whose work we will integrate into our curriculum.</p>]]></richbody0content>

He later became the Managing Director of Dubai Duty Free. In July 2011, he was named Executive Vice Chairman and CEO of Dubai Duty Free and its subsidiary businesses, which include The Irish Village, The Century Village and the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium, home to the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. ]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<url><![CDATA[colm-mcloughlin-executive-vice-chairman-ceo-dubai-duty-free]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments and milestones for DDF in the past year?</h4><p>2017 was the highest-selling year in our history, with sales amounting to USD1.93 billion. We sold 73 million pieces of merchandise, with 27 million transactions on our registers. Our penetration rate is the highest in the world and our sales per capita is near the top of global rankings as well. In 2016 we opened Concourse D, which handles all the airlines that go through Dubai International Airport other than Emirates Airlines. Concourse D accounts for about 20% of our business and it is an attractive area, enticing passengers to come there. We are budgeting higher than 2017 for 2018; our first quarter sales reached over USD523 million representing an 11% increase over the same period last year. Concourse C is being refurbished at the moment and we will open new outlets there, of which half are already completed and the remainder will be done throughout 2018. At Al Maktoum International Airport, we have increased our retail space from 2,500sqm to 4,500sqm. Some new airlines, including Azur Air from Russia, fly there, and we are optimistic about the coming year.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of your marketing campaigns and sports sponsorships?</h4><p>Our campaigns are unique and get us exposure in different ways. We do not just organize tennis just for tennis fans but as a promotion for DDF, and we assess the value of it. Our tennis tournaments in 2017 were valued at USD920 million in media coverage to Dubai. We spend 2.5% of our top line on advertising, marketing, and promoting DDF, which is considerably more than what any other duty free spends, and it pays dividends. Several years ago Dubai Airport won an award and the customers who voted for Dubai were surveyed on why they voted for Dubai Airport. 90% responded that this was because of DDF. It is important to market our services and sponsor events locally. For every event that is held in Dubai, people fly in and fly out and they pass by DDF, so we are a big supporter of many events in Dubai. In addition to tennis tournaments, we have been a partner and sponsor of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic Golf since it started 26 years ago; we support the Dubai Duty Free Irish Derby in Ireland and have been sponsoring horse racing in Newbury in England for the past 22 years. We also sponsor the DDF Shergar Cup in Ascot every year; this is all about tapping into different markets. Three years ago we took on the title sponsorship of the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open Golf. This event is huge in Ireland and the value that the European Tour gave us last year was USD161 million in media coverage.</p><h4>How do you see the impact of e-commerce on the retail sector, and what opportunities and challenges does it entail for DDF?</h4><p>In my opinion e-commerce is necessary but does not significantly affect travel. It is a special treat for many passengers to go through a retail area at the airport and buy at great value. Still, we have to be aware of e-commerce, and we set up a click-and-collect operation in DDF two years ago. In 2017 our sales were USD19 million, and it is uncertain if these sales are on top of regular sales or merely a replacement. It is a service that we provide that in our view will always be small in comparison to our total business. The main feature will remain people shopping personally at the airport buying gifts at great value.</p><h4>What is the importance of innovative retail concepts to delight customers?</h4><p>It is important to entertain people and not just try to sell them things. We have in-house training programs for our staff, and the policy is to make sure the customer is the most important person during interactions. We listen to what our customers tell us and how they want to see items promoted. We work closely with our suppliers to create exclusive products and organize launches that reflect the duty free at Dubai. The ambience at the airport is important as well. There are children's play areas laid out throughout the airport and we have our own in-house choir called The Nightingales that have won the Corporate Choir Competition in Dubai for the last three years. At certain times of the year we have our choir performing for passengers to create a pleasant atmosphere.</p><h4>Do you see room for partnerships with airlines in on-board duty-free shopping?</h4><p>This is an interesting opportunity, and we are discussing the possibility of airline simply ordering online and collecting when travellers arrive at DDF. We have been cooperating for a long time in negotiations with suppliers, and there is great potential in expanding cooperation with airlines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Focused on Oil & Gas Transport]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[alessandro-coppa-country-manager-savino-del-bene-ghana]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Savino del Bene's story in regard to Africa and Ghana?</h4>
<p>Savino del Bene is a new reality in Africa, and the decision to open offices on this continent was due to the specific needs of clients. We opted to enter the Ghanaian market first to meet the needs of certain large customers for whom we were acting as regular suppliers in other parts of the world and who approached the West African market, specifically in Ghana. Unfortunately, the global crisis has not been helpful for the development of our activities in Ghana, though we hope for positive developments in 2018. We recently started to place more emphasis on building local content and local capacity. Savino del Bene is an Italian company, though with the right training and approach Ghanaians are more suitable to deal within their own market. In comparison to other African countries, Ghana is one of the simplest countries and it is the closest to European and Italian mentality and realities.</p>
<h4>What is your growth strategy for your business in Ghana and beyond?</h4>
<p>For over a decade, Savino del Bene has created teams dedicated to the major vertical markets that are interested in global trade such as fashion, oil and gas, renewable energies, FMCG, and pharmaceuticals. Naturally, all our subsidiaries around the world have also been duly instructed to develop the most interesting sources of traffic in the coming years. As far as Ghana goes, we are mainly focused on the transport of oil and gas, and we will continue to focus on that, improving efficiencies. Our geographical growth and expansion has always been calm and slow, and it will be even slower in Africa. This is mainly because of our difficulties experienced with regard to bureaucracies, regulations, and limitations by the authorities. Our decisions here need to be more cautious and weighted than elsewhere in the world, which goes back to why we are investing more in human resource development in Ghana.</p>
<h4>How do you position yourself within the competitive logistic sector and what are your competitive advantages?</h4>
<p>Savino del Bene has always distinguished itself for a policy aimed at customer loyalty, creating a real synergy with our clients and suppliers, working together for the same goals and results. Today's challenge is maintaining our identity as an intermediary agent of logistics and international shipments, a concept today that is increasingly absorbed by integrated structures that only care about numbers. Our services are the result of a thorough work of construction of a service and activities studied and programmed considering all possible uncertainties. Globalization is leading, perhaps too fast, to a world that is becoming increasingly smaller with a need for a speed that is not there; however, we seek to provide all the possible solutions. For example, in the event of unforeseen and unforeseeable situations, we have created teams of people specialized in the individual sectors of activity that can intervene and find a solution in the shortest time possible.</p>
<h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4>
<p>Technology is the current master in any activity, sector, or role, and it is necessary to stay up to date and adapt to the development of new technologies, though it is necessary and fundamental to provide continuity on all activities. Savino del Bene Ghana expects to be the springboard for development in West Africa for 2018. The positive trend of Savino del Bene in the last 10 years will be confirmed for 2017 and we will maintain the need and interest to continue to expand and grow our network and activities in 2018 as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[manuel-caldeira-cabral-minister-economy-portugal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Portugal's economy has seen five years of unprecedented growth. How has an anti-austerity policy mix contributed to this?</h4><p>The government has used anti-austerity measures to unleash society's existing growth potential. The policies we followed were not expansionary policies, but rather responsible, moderate policies. The first major impact of this was to boost citizen and consumer confidence, and this was also reflected in the confidence of investors, who need to see that the economy is growing. Paired together, these trends generated an atmosphere of certainty and led to not just a continuation but also an acceleration of this growth, far above the EU average. Our investment grew by 13% in 2017, the biggest increase in 18 years, mostly in private investment, both Portuguese and FDI. The signals we gave off were, first, that we are an open economy, for trade, investment, and visitors. Second, we instilled stability into the public accounts. With more growth we have more revenues and less people in unemployment, which reduces the costs of unemployment benefit and social security. We also sent a clear message about fiscal stability in our three already approved budgets: we have no need to drum up revenue by hiking taxes. We managed through better management and harnessing of the opportunities created by economic growth to reduce the debt burden, while maintaining fiscal stability. In fact, this reduction of the deficit—to around 1.3% in 2017, well below our ambitious targets—works as a guarantee of our ability to retain this fiscal stability, as we will not have more urgent needs in the short or medium term.</p><h4>How do you look to counteract the economic and social difficulties that come with low fertility rates and an ageing population?</h4><p>The demographic mix in Portugal is a challenge, though with sound measures implemented over time we can tackle this. First and foremost is job creation, and Portugal is currently second in Europe for the highest growth rate of job creation. If we look specifically at rate of job creation for youth, it is more than double than that of the overall population. This is the key in creating confidence in the younger generation and guaranteeing that they have access to career paths that give them confidence to start families. The second thing is rethinking social policy, offering more free childcare options, introducing subsidies, and so on. Then, we need to look at how to limit the numbers of those who leave the country, which was a significant problem during the adjustment years. However, this is starting to turn around, and in 2016 and 2017 the working population increased. It is also important to bear in mind that these problems exist not only in Portugal, but all over Europe, and what is different in Portugal is the change in qualifications of the young generation. In Germany, for example, the number of people aged 55-65 with a degree is three times higher than in Portugal. However, the number of those aged between 25-35 with a degree is slightly higher in Portugal. The opportunity gap between the older and younger generations in Portugal is much higher than in other countries, and this creates a singularity in our demographic mix. Furthermore, these young people are more likely to be trained in new fields such as technology or global communications. This means we are expanding our labor force not only in quantity but in quality. Finally, we are following a policy of openness to attract immigrants. We recently passed laws for a start-up visa for entrepreneurs who want to come to our country, and we have a welcoming policy for people who want to study or live in Portugal.</p><h4>Is fintech becoming a priority area for the government, and how do you envisage technology-based economic development in the long term?</h4><p>We see technology as a key factor for the evolution of the country. In terms of innovation we have launched three different programs. One of these was Startup Portugal, which streamlined fiscal rules and instruments of venture capital, matched funds to co-invest with foreign investors in technology firms, and created a network of incubators. In terms of fintech we see many start-ups going from strength to strength, with some firms already securing significant investment. The latest example was Finzay, a leading firm in cybersecurity that won an injection of EUR50 million. Another development is that fintech has allowed banks and financial organizations to reorganize their production and services all over the world. Certain large financial institutions are moving key departments, such as cybersecurity or application development, to Portugal. We are, therefore, seeing two forms of movement: new firms experiencing rapid growth and investors and incumbents eyeing the market with interest. The Web Summit, held in Lisbon, helped to considerably draw attention to the Portuguese ecosystem.</p><h4>How will Portugal capitalize on its image as an attractive hub for relocating companies?</h4><p>We see many businesses moving to Portugal in different areas. There are new investments in terms of industry, namely in machinery, aeronautics, and the automotive industry, coming mainly from France, Germany, India, China, and the US. We have several banks creating large pockets of jobs in shared services in Portugal; there are engineering companies that have built R&amp;D centers and many software companies investing here and growing fast. This has translated into almost an 11.9% increase in our exports in 2017 and a strengthening of our industrial capability because of nearshoring. One of the main of attractions of opening shop in Portugal is our robust and diverse talent pool. It is a great opportunity to find engineers, software developers, people who speak different languages, people from the finance sector, managers, and people with different competencies.</p><h4>What impact has qualified labor had on Portugal's export mix?</h4><p>We have seen considerable diversification. This used to be more centered on traditional sectors such as footwear, textiles, and clothing, though we have since seen a shift toward the machinery, automobile, aeronautics, and pharmaceutical industries. Even traditional sectors have become more focused on high quality with flexible production: producing more value with less people. Parallel to this, there has been a significant increase in technological services. 10 or 15 years ago, there were half a dozen software firms exporting; however, today the market has blossomed.</p><h4>What are the priorities for the ministry for the year ahead?</h4><p>The government is working hard on two important areas; one is to reform the capital markets, with legislation changes to allow firms to have more information about their financial situation with an early warning mechanism. This is important for SMEs and allows for a more flexible setting to avoid problems leading to bankruptcy. This is great for creditors, workers, and foreign direct investors, who can buy assets that are undervalued. We have also launched several instruments of financing firms both on credit with a state guarantee with longer periods to finance investment and more stable solutions. Parallel to that, we also launched several funds and capitalization instruments based on co-investment with asymmetric gains. This is aimed at attracting investors who want to go for venture capital in the new technological sectors, which will leverage their income in terms of success. For each EUR1 million they put in, we match it, though we allow them to profit more if they turn this project into a successful business as this will benefit Portugal in the long run. This is linked to our other top priority, which is innovation. In addition to our start-up program, which includes these new financial co-investment instruments, we have also introduced fiscal measures to promote investment in start-ups. We are working on a program called Interface, which will reinforce the interface institutions in our economy to accelerate the transformation of knowledge in our universities and our scientific community into value and innovation in the private firms. We are following the example of Catapult in the UK, holding meetings with stakeholders to design a program to accelerate the technological transfer and innovation in firms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact will your IPO have on OQIC and the economy in general?</h4><p>As a result of the IPO, OQIC increased its capital from USD13 million to USD26 million and significantly diversified its shareholder base. The IPO helped the company solidify its status as a “national" company in the Sultanate of Oman. OQIC is now well positioned to leverage its new status and brand awareness to achieve profitable growth and generate shareholder value. </p><h4>What has been your shareholders' reaction to the IPO?</h4><p>Our parent group, Qatar Insurance Company, and our key local investor, Al Hosn Investment Company, have been delighted by the positive investor response to OQIC's IPO, which resulted in the issue being oversubscribed by 140%.  </p><h4>What has been the reaction of the private sector?</h4><p>Our IPO was extremely well received by the private sector, among both retail and institutional investors. Given the economic challenges in Oman, achieving a successful IPO was an important milestone for the company. </p><h4>How have relations with Qatar affected the company in Oman?</h4><p>Qatar has a strong political relationship with Oman and business relations between the two have expanded rapidly in the past months with trade growth of over 2,000%. This will enhance confidence in the Omani economy and facilitate growth in the insurance sector. The increased investments and trade flows between Oman and Qatar will further stimulate growth for OQIC.</p><h4>What is the best balance between more branches and technology when it comes to market penetration?</h4><p>Older generations are more comfortable with face-to-face interactions, in contrast to younger ones that are more tech-savvy. While retail insurance is among OQIC's fastest growing business segments, the company is also one of the pioneers in the digital transformation of the retail business model. With just a few clicks, customers can renew motor insurance policies or buy travel insurance, and ultimately save time and money. We are constantly enhancing our digital platform to increase customer convenience. Yet, despite our focus on online insurance, we are also committed to our non-digital channels. </p><h4>What are OQIC's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>OQIC has the strategic vision of becoming a top-three insurance company in Oman within the next five years. OQIC is well positioned to benefit from anticipated growth in the life and medical insurance sectors. The company is also primed for similarly high rates in construction and energy, given the upcoming megaprojects in Oman. We have won some major accounts in the public and private sectors and strive to renew this business in the coming years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Market Fundamentals]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[market-fundamentals]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the merger with Arabia Insurance impact your goal of becoming a top-tier insurer in Oman, and how will this merger impact the market?</h4><p>The insurance market in Oman could be roughly classified into three tiers, and we are probably at the lower end of tier two. With this merger, we will move to the upper part of tier two. We are working on building a profitable portfolio with satisfied customers. We want to be the number-one 'go-to company' from a customer's point of view. As an insurance company, we are composite, i.e. we offer all kinds of insurance products, both life and non-life. With the merger, we will be increasing our retail presence. Whereas Falcon's strength was previously with corporate customers, we now expect significant progress in our retail segment. </p><h4>What is your opinion of market penetration throughout the insurance sector?</h4><p>It is clear that market penetration is low in Oman. If you take the insurance premium as a percentage of GDP, it appears to be flattering to most. Compulsory insurance is what people are taking, since there is not much penetration on a voluntary basis. Things will slowly change over the next five to 10 years. Firstly, the market has to become aware of insurance and insurance products. One of the main reasons there is not much penetration is due to the economy and demographics. There is not much insurance savvy among people. Slowly this will change. Over the last two years, the regulator, several companies, and the College of Banking and Financial Studies (CBFS) have given people the opportunity to take courses on insurance in London. The response has been so good that the CBFS asked me to teach one of the groups. It is a voluntary position so that I can give back to society. This is one side of it. The CMA also organizes a training plan for the insurance sector. It does approximately 12 high-profile courses a year, which are led by industry experts. This is the second side. From the Insurance Association, we have already gotten our own space where we have a training room with a seating capacity of 25. We are going to do classroom practical training on various operational areas for people to gain hands-on experience in how things are done from experts, including insurance underwriting and claims, Microsoft Office, and customer service, and more. </p><h4>What are the main challenges that Falcon Insurance faces in Oman? How are you addressing them?</h4><p>There are too many players, meaning there is not enough quality manpower for companies. The majority of the insuring public pays too much attention to the price alone, which then becomes the single marketing tool. Most products meet the standard. The population is also low enough, with less than 1 million, 40% of who are expatriates, and the majority of which are blue-collar. Nobody really has extra money to look at special insurance and saving products. With so many players in the sector, in theory the market is set up for consolidation. However, whether or not it actually happens is another matter. In a lighter vein, more companies are being formed in disputed boardrooms rather than being consolidated. The other major problem is with regard to the collection of premiums. </p><h4>What are your main goals and objectives for this year? </h4><p>The first major task is the integration with Arabia Insurance. We are going to have a much bigger workforce than clientele to manage. Therefore, the main objective is to ensure that no side's clients are affected, in addition to improving our client base. As for regional expansion, there are no current plans to expand outside of the country now that we are a part of the Arabia Group network, since it already has a large presence abroad. It is important to continue establishing our good name here as well as get the IPO up and running, and welcome our individual retail shareholders on board. That will involve certain changes to the way the company operates in terms of transparency and corporate governance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps have you taken in the past 20 years to become a leading leasing and lending company in Oman?</h4><p>Al Omaniya Financial Services was formed with a mission to be the best financial services provider in the country through ethics today and tomorrow. The purpose of our business is to create superior value for all our stakeholders, be they our customers, investors, or employees. The company started its business in retail auto financing, and our main objective is to provide a premium service at an affordable price to local citizens as well as foreigners and help them to get affordable transportation means. All our products are structured with a customer-centric philosophy, and we constantly evolve and adapt our strategies, products, and servicing methodologies to suit customers' needs and goals. In the last 20 years we have played a significant role in positively impacting many lives in the country. We remain flexible and adapt and plan out strategies in new directions to balance between growth and profitability.</p><h4>Your company has been consecutively paying higher dividends of 25%. Could you explain how this impacts the company?</h4><p>Our careful business strategies enabled us to redefine our market positions constantly and enhance and penetrate existing and new market areas. We continuously innovate and introduce new product lines in the corporate market from asset loans to working capital facilities, bill discounting to project loans. Our latest advent into loan syndication with banks, in combination with our strong foothold in retail auto loans and consumer loans, has allowed us to consistently earn more revenue. Our constant efforts at excellent treasury management with a clever mix of borrowing instruments with both local and offshore banking channels have allowed us to price our products competitively, which also allowed us to have excellent net profits and reward our stakeholders consecutively. As we continue to build revenues, we have not lost sight of building a solid equity base for the company, which is reflected in the high net worth and high book value for the company.</p><h4>How have market challenges  affected the evolution of services being demanded?</h4><p>Having understood the market dynamics well in advance we have taken proactive measures to streamline our business model and are currently focusing on consolidation, maintaining the quality of the book and making sure we are adequately capitalized. For the last two years we are perhaps the only non-banking financial institution to maintain a large amount of liquid assets; in 2016 Al Omaniya had over USD86 million in cash in the form of bank deposits. This has given us a solid footing in the financial sector and has given a lot of confidence to our lenders about our financial standing. We have also identified areas where there will be growth and less stress and increased our focus on those segments such as hospitality, tourism, retail, healthcare, and education, which will continue to flourish in Oman. Areas that have unfortunately taken a backseat for the time being including infrastructure-related projects and construction are where we are reducing our concentration. We are currently in the process of restructuring our portfolio to meet these new demands.</p><h4>What are Al Omaniya's main goals for 2018?</h4><p>We have identified sustainability as the key management objective. Currently our focus is not on profitability, volume, or size; rather, our main focus is on maintaining our quality of the book and making sure that we continue to render our customer services effectively. We intend to maintain our current strength, competitiveness, and quality. At the same time we want to continue our businesses in niche areas by innovative product structuring and better packaging to suit the needs of the hour and manage the resources judiciously to ensure sustainable earnings and profitability. If Al Omaniya remains strong and flexible when the economy begins to improve then it will bounce back easily to reap the benefits. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the MSM work as a tool to help develop Oman's economy?</h4><p>MSM is an integral part of the Omani economy. It was established in 1988 and has helped raise funds for many companies. Currently, the market capitalization of MSM is around OMR9 billion, with another OMR2 billion worth of bonds and sukuks. Leaving aside the bonds and sukuks, the value of shares are worth OMR9 billion, which is almost 35% of Oman's GDP. This is one of the indicators of the stock market's development. This is not as high as we would like, and there is still a great deal of room for the market to grow. This is especially the case with Tanfeedh. The government's ability to finance projects in the future will be limited due to the decline in oil prices, and these projects will require extensive investments in the markets, both foreign and local. The private sector will have an important role to play in the development of the economy by helping to establish the new companies that will be needed in Oman's next phase of development.</p><h4>As new companies enter, how do you see the MSM 30 Index (MSM30) evolving?</h4><p>In 2017, we anticipate some government companies will be privatized. There are a few companies that will come from the insurance sector. We are talking about five or six new companies that might be added to the list of companies in the market. The trading activity in the secondary market is related to the activity in the primary or IPO market. With an active IPO market, there will also be an active secondary market. There is a relationship between the two. This will help the market to improve its trading levels and increased demand will help the MSM30. There was a reduction of almost 32% in trading volumes of MSM during 2016 in comparison to the other Gulf countries that also saw reduction in their trading volumes ranging between 31% and 50% as all the Gulf markets fell in 2016 due to a substantial decline in oil prices. This was also the case in 2015. However, at current oil prices the reduction in the index and trading volumes has been absorbed by the market. I hope the privatization programs and new IPOs will give us new blood in the market and help boost trading. With Tanfeedh, we do not have enough information yet to know what financial structure these companies will have, but the market will be ready to adsorb these companies. </p><h4>Where do you see the MSM in 2017-2018, and how do you plan on achieving this?</h4><p>In the next few years we plan to demutualize. Currently, the stock market is a government entity. In 1998, when we established the Capital Market Authority (CMA) we separated the stock market, capital market, and the depository company. The stock and capital markets were government entities, with the depository company being owned 60% by MSM and 40% by the brokers. Now we plan to demutualize MSM and convert it into a company. We have to have the right infrastructure for the future. For example, in the Euronext model, there was the merger of the markets in Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam followed by further expansion in other countries. They became bigger and more independent by having such a legal structure rather than being owned by the regulator. This is the CMA's and the MSM's plan for now. We have a consensus and initial approval, though the process will be lengthy because we have to go through various legal, parliamentary, and financial regulatory steps and consultations. It will be a kind of privatization program. The other important steps we are taking is enhancing our internal trading platform and making it bigger to accommodate future listings in the market and allow more brokers to be affiliated with our platform. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the CMA actively promote investment, risk management, and capital formation?</h4><p>The role of CMA is to regulate and supervise two sectors in Oman: capital markets and insurance. By providing friendly and clear regulations that govern the capital market, we are encouraging foreign investment to come into the country. That is part of pooling capital in order to finance economic projects in Oman. We have seen great signs of that when comparing ourselves in the GCC. We have the highest amount of foreign capital market participation in the GCC; around 30% of our total capital is owned by foreign investors. We also consider ourselves the most open market in the region when it comes to ease of access of doing business and own listed securities in the exchange. On the other side, we regulate the insurance sector, which has two main functions: to insure investors and to insure the public at large. In other words, insuring belongings, businesses, and activities. It is important for any economy to have an active sector that encourages people to invest and build assets, as well as make sure the assets are insured. The insurance market also functions as a way to pool funds, by gathering cash installments. In this regard we consider the insurance sector investors in their own right, one of the largest in the market. We do look after insurance companies to ensure they are working in a fair manner and working according to the rules and regulations set by the CMA.</p><h4>What is the CMA doing to attract and retain companies in the local capital and insurance markets?</h4><p>We are trying to work with the government to prioritize some of the companies that are government owned. As part of Tanfeedh, we have discussed and deliberated over these issues, agreeing that we need to establish a five-year plan that we can apply to all government-owned companies and consider certain criteria to prioritize the companies that should come first. That depends greatly on the readiness of the company to offer IPO. We are trying to work with the government in order to implement this initiative. If we manage to bring some of these companies to the public, it would enlarge their shareholder base in the market and provide new products. The other element we are working on is sukuk. We have finished the legal framework and all of the rules and regulations are in place. The bond market is another option to encourage investors to go beyond the banking sector. We are also looking into REITs, which are another element that are promising. Many investors have huge assets here, and that huge value is locked. By adopting REITs it will encourage companies to unlock some of that value and come up with new projects.</p><h4>What are the CMA's objectives for 2017-2018?</h4><p>As regulators, our objective is to keep up with international standards and review our rules and regulations to be sure they are sound and acceptable. For 2017, we hope to see a new takeover code issued, and it is in the final stages. We are also working on the new securities laws, a huge task that requires consultation. We have already started the consultation with the public. We have put the initial draft on our website so that the public can look at it and give their feedback; to date, we have received a huge amount of feedback from investors. We have looked into it and conducted workshops to bring our stakeholders together and listen to them. We have planned other workshops to follow up on the incorporation of the feedback we have received so far. The second draft is ready, but now we need to gather the stakeholders again to explain it, get them to understand it, and buy into it. Then we will talk to the government entities for final approval. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What issues will the new FDI Law address, and what impact will it have on the Omani economy?</h4><p>With a view to attracting long-term foreign investment flows, the FDI law is being revised comprehensively. The new law will address major concerns and shortcomings in the current law. Foreign investors' rights and obligations will be clearly set out in the new law. The proposed investment law would provide dispute resolution and include international arbitration.</p><h4>What are the Central Bank's current plans regarding international bond issuance, and what impact will this have on market liquidity?</h4><p>Oman's external funding gap has been met mostly by external borrowings by the sovereign. With a view to finance the fiscal deficit, Oman's government raised USD5 billion in March 2017 through international bonds in tranches of five, 10, and 30 years. Public sector enterprises and conventional banks have also been encouraged to meet their long-term funding needs by medium-term borrowing from abroad in recent times. In regard to liquidity, CBO continued its accommodating monetary policy stance, continuously monitoring the liquidity situation and ensuring the availability of adequate credit for productive activities. CBO has also taken regulatory and supervisory measures so that banks remain well capitalized and healthy in the face of incipient delinquency as a result of the economic slowdown.</p><h4>Where does Oman currently stand in terms of government development bonds and sukuk bonds?</h4><p>With regard to the capital market, there were four issuances of government development bonds mobilizing a total of OMR450 million and one redemption amounting to OMR150 million during 2016. There was also an Ijara Sukuk by private placement amounting to USD500 million during the year. With the diversification of the economy, the corporate sector in Oman is also expected to raise resources from the market by issuing debt securities.</p><h4>What are the current guidelines for SME financing, and what modifications can be expected in the near future?</h4><p>Keeping in view the vital role played by SMEs in creating employment and developing a supply chain for the industrial sector, CBO is continuously making efforts toward promoting SMEs, which would facilitate diversification of the economy. CBO also mandated formal credit target of 5% of banks' total credit to the SME sector. The prudential requirements for banks to lend to SMEs have also been relaxed in terms of general provisioning requirements and risk weightage. Banks have made concerted efforts to increase their SME credit portfolio and are close to fully achieving the target. The definition of the criteria to classify SMEs has been modified based on the clarification given by the Public Authority for SMEs Development, and CBO is monitoring the progress of the SME credit target. With a view to enable banks to achieve the 5% target, CBO has allowed banks to reckon non-funded credit, up to a maximum of 1% of total credit within the overall target of 5%, effective April 26, 2017. This dispensation to non-fund based credit along with banks' fund-based credit and direct contributions would ease the constraints faced by SMEs.</p><h4>What are the Central Bank's main objectives for 2017-2018?</h4><p>Economic activity in Oman further weakened in 2016 in the wake of low oil prices, slowdown in world growth, and subdued global trade. The authorities have been taking policy measures to move ahead on the path of fiscal sustainability in the medium term. Reining in public expenditure, augmenting non-oil revenue, and pursuing economic diversification are the key facets of the State General Budget for 2017. In order to preserve fiscal buffers and take advantage of the relatively low cost of funds in international financial markets, the government has resorted mainly to external commercial borrowings, which elicited positive investor response and partly to borrowings from the domestic market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>UBT recently set up UBT Academy, an English training institute franchise. How has this progressed in the last year?</h4><p>The progress throughout the last year included approving the entire curriculum and recruiting the required manpower. In line with the strategy set out, UBT Academy signed an agreement with one of the largest IT consultancy firms to develop the IT policy and take it to the next level. We have developed a model for master franchises and aim to sign agreements in Bahrain, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates. UBT Academy targets six branches by the end of 2018 and another 12 branches by 2019. As soon as the model is implemented, replicating that model takes only three months, which is the same time required to develop the facility itself. Once UBT Academy is global, it will only be a matter of scale. We will either find an investor or simply invest in it ourselves, develop it for one year, and then sell it. This business and sector has enormous potential in the region. Institutes typically focus on the general public, teachers, or training professionals; however, none focus on the holistic approach of English training for the entire community. UBT Academy offers six different programs and a handful of institutes under one brand. It is an English institute, a training institute for teachers, and a school accreditation institute packaged into one franchise. The beauty of UBT Academy is the partnerships with the top publishers around the globe, creating a unique curriculum based on each country's requirements. The core business of UBT Academy is not to produce the content, but rather to adopt global best practices and leverage them. UBT Academy combines the best of the best together in one curriculum with the most qualified and competent staff and standards for assessment to create a learner experience.</p><h4>UBT Co. has been developing its own system to measure all aspects of its performance. Can you tell us more about this?</h4><p>UBT developed a model named Quswa. Currently being registered for property rights, Quswa is an effectiveness and efficiency initiative for universities that measures every detail, including water vapor, LED lights, and the cost of various activities. UBT was honored the Digital Excellence Award from Oracle in 2017, noting that UBT is the only university in the world that applies activity-based costing in its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation. Those that do not engage technology in their strategies will not reach far, sooner or later. UBT developed the ERP structure thanks to our global outreach and growth. Thus, UBT needed to standardize practices and measure both sources and resources that either incur costs or generate profits. Similar to a KPI audit, today we measure it all and are able to quantify a university from A to Z. UBT Co. is ready to diagnose any public or private university for free. UBT Co. aims to help other institutions—and society at large—to become more efficient and deliver better services.</p><h4>The Saudi economy has had a difficult year, and yet you have many new directions and programs. How are you moving forward despite fiscal tightening?</h4><p>The overall market, including that of the private higher education, is shrinking. However, UBT has not seen a drop, but rather increasing its market share. In late 2017, UBT College of Law was launched. UBT has reshaped the programs it provides, while introducing five new graduate programs. In terms of employability rate of our graduates, UBT is the pioneer in meeting the needs of the market. Based on a recent survey, 78% of our graduates are employed—leading to the highest number in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. UBT graduates receive their first full-time job within six months of graduation on average. Founded in 2011, the 4th batch of our UBT College of Advertising is graduating next term, with 100% of the students already employed.</p><h4>UBT has created a new Deanship for Research and has invested significantly in research. How does this contribute to your long-term vision?</h4><p>UBT Deanship of Scientific Research today has seven flagships. All the 250 faculty members of the University have been required to participate in two or more research activities per year. Based on a vision of inclusion, every UBT researcher is part of a group that conducts research on six different levels of the seven flagships. UBT is the sole university in Saudi Arabia that does so, focusing research on community service, economic development, business and finance, state-of-the-art technology, the environment and sustainability, and advertising. UBT leverages its colleges of law, engineering, business administration, and advertising, and sets forth the research topics to each college so that it is ready for the target industry and market. With a clear plan envisioned to the year 2050, this will play an increasing role in our UBT activities and revenues, given that commercializing technologies is a long process.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018 for the holding company?</h4><p>We are expecting to commercialize the five new developed Masters of Science (MSc) programs once approved by the Ministry by the end of 2018. We are currently building a state-of-the-art Campus for female students. UBT Academy will be responding to the high market demand for English language learning. UBT Co. works significantly on a one-to-one basis, providing an intellectually stimulating, inspiring, and innovating model. There will be a mobile application that will bring UBT Academy closer to users, who can receive feedback for every assessment and stay connected with the alumni, along with the local and global communities. These are some of our key movements for the year ahead in line with the vocational goals of Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the reasons behind the company's decision to establish a subsidiary in Mexico? </h4><p>Mexico is the most competitive market in Latin America, possibly in America. It is a market in which almost all the brands are present, with a strong influence at the corporate level from the US. There are extremely powerful automotive groups, a high concentration at the distribution level—60 distributors can be brought together to make up 70% of the market, and a high level of price competitiveness and service provision. An extremely high percentage of the 200 main Mexican leaders in all sectors drive Range Rover, which is a result of the great work that was done by positioning the brands during our period as importers. Being a subsidiary allows us to have faster logistical flows and greater representation to give more weight to the decisions that have to be made in Mexico with respect to the global total. The main part of a brand is the experience one generates around the cars for customers. Land Rover is the off-roader par excellence worldwide, and there is an almost magical universe around the brand, similar to Jaguar, though in a world of sportiness and urban luxury. One needs all the support of the main headquarters in order to convey this. Thus, being a subsidiary gives us much more capacity to be able to offer customers these unique experiences that only these brands can offer.</p><h4>What impact will the creation of the subsidiary in Mexico have for the final consumer of the brand?</h4><p>The impact on the final consumer is clear: greater stability and prices in pesos and a historic opportunity to make the brand accessible and help all those who want the brand to enjoy it. Therefore, we had to start selling in pesos and provide the service that our clients deserve, and what clients will start to feel from now on is a more regular logistic flow. We are clear that if we want to grow here, we have to make ourselves available to clients to show them a Land Rover or Jaguar and make the purchase easier. As a subsidiary, we will work on financing, our positioning, and how to make our customers feel unique so they trust us and feel part of the brand. In order to do so, we have to place all our resources on the table and be completely aligned with what Jaguar and Land Rover offer worldwide.</p><h4>How do you expect the importance of the Mexican domestic market for Jaguar Land Rover's global strategy to evolve in the next years?</h4><p>The premium market in Mexico, despite the fall of the global market, continues to grow, albeit more slowly. However, in 2017 Mexico became the first premium market in Latin America, ahead of Brazil, and this is not a circumstantial situation but rather a structural one, since the Mexican market will grow in parallel or surpass the Brazilian market in the coming years. Within the premium/luxury market, the luxury market weighs much more in Mexico than it does in other markets such as Brazil. The growth of Jaguar Land Rover as a brand was the fastest growing in recent years within the premium segment worldwide and that was achieved by being faithful to our brand positioning. We want to remain a moderately accessible luxury item; we will not be high premium. Our ambition for 2018 is to double our sales. It seems like an ambitious goal; however, it is fully achievable. In 2018, we will bring in six new products and we have a network that has an in-depth growth plan.</p><h4>What are your main objectives in terms of innovation, in particular to reduce the carbon footprint of the vehicles you produce?</h4><p>Innovation in the group for the two brands has three pillars. The first is that we are fans of cars and will not give up making cars exciting and giving drivers memorable experiences. The second is based on our customer-first policy. Land Rover's commitment as an off road brand that is in permanent contact with nature meant we could not turn our backs to the environment. Our work with respect to this is to ensure the production impact of our vehicles is as minimal as possible; one of our great advantages is that our entire production scheme is based on aluminum, which has a high recycling rate, greater than steel. In addition, a great deal of work has been done in which the plants at the production level have zero impact on the emissions in their environment, and we are also working on accelerating our electric vehicle program as well as hybrids. This point touches the Jaguar side because in 2018 we will launch the I-PACE in Mexico, our first fully electric vehicle. With the arrival of the I-PACE, we enter the universe of electric cars and in 2022 all our platforms will be electrified and they will be hybrid or electric. We will offer customers the option of a hybrid or electric in all our ranges in order to minimize our carbon footprint.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>My first goal is to increase contact with our client. We want to make sure that when we offer the universe of Jaguar Land Rover in Mexico, the client receives an offer of value identical to what he would receive in any other large market worldwide. We have to understand how those experiences evolve in Mexico, while remaining faithful to what our brands stand for. The current customer is a global client and not only local.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the history of the company?</h4><p>We started this business in Nigeria in 1994, and in 1995 we started with two breweries, one in the south and one in the north. In 1997, we took over more breweries, bringing the total to five. In 2011, we sold our brewery business to Heineken; it was the best time to exit from the sector as the large players were entering into the market. We then diversified into other areas. At that time, we had an injection molding factory and were producing the crates for Heineken, Guinness, and SABMiller. We manufacture plastic pallets and were the first to start in Nigeria as all other companies were using wooden pallets. We have two recycling plants where we recycle the crates, battery cases, and whatever plastic we get from the market is recycled. We are bringing one Pet recycling plant and two more plastic recycling plant in 2018 which have already been sourced. We have total nine industries including two independent power plants.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your ethanol plant project and its impact on local businesses?</h4><p>We recently completed the plant, and we did water trial in December. We have a distillery here; importing pure ethanol is extremely expensive as the duty is 30%, and we decided to bring in crude ethanol, the raw material for the distillery. it was completely internally financed and we have not taken any bank loans. The next phase, which will take place in 2018 after starting production, will be to produce crude ethanol from cassava. The government has given us some land for which we have found some co-producers and farmers as we will not go into direct farming. We will control the farming here and 1,000 farmers will be involved. The plant capacity is 120,000 liters per day, which requires 300 tons of cassava per day. We have formed a cooperative and once we receive the physical allocation of land from the government, we will start harvesting there. We have a malt extracting plant which is also financed internally and it produces malt extract from local produce Sorghum for Breweries like Nigerian Breweries, Guinness and SABMiller and also produces sugar substitute Glucose Syrup which we supply to Bakeries and Biscuit manufacturers.</p><h4>How does Sona contribute to Nigeria's socioeconomic growth in the long term?</h4><p>The government is encouraging local industries and the industrial agenda provides employment to people; we have a direct workforce of 3,000 people and almost 8,000 indirectly through the supply chain of transporters and so on. We also pay taxes and duties to the government as well as excise duty as we produce alcoholic beverages.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans for the future?</h4><p>We have complete confidence in the Nigerian economy and have been here since 1995. We are still expanding in the biscuit and chocolate industries as well as our packaging industry. All our machines are from Germany and other European countries; European machinery may be more expensive, though they are the highest quality and last for a long time. In 2017 we committed EUR50 million for industrial machinery for projects, some of which are under construction and others under commission. Our total investment in Nigeria thus far been almost USD650 million and we have committed an additional EUR50 million for this machinery.</p><h4>What does the government and the private sector need to do to further boost the 'Made in Nigeria' brand and import substitution?</h4><p>Items from the Far East, especially China, are cheaper. To compete with that, the government needs to provide infrastructure and better roads. The second issue is that the borrowing costs in the country are high: commercial banks charge 25-26% interest. The Bank of Industry is supposed to support industries; however, it charges 10% in addition to other charges and the fees come to almost 11.5% per annum. It also charges 15% for working capital, in addition to a monitoring fee. In other countries, the government subsidizes industry in terms of finance cost and other areas; here, in terms of finance cost there is no support from the government. Therefore, some mechanisms are needed to support industry in terms of finance. Industrialists cannot bring 100% investment here and some support is required from the industrial and infrastructure banks. Other challenges are power supply and the high cost of diesel.</p><h4>If these issues are resolved, can manufacturing play a big role in Nigeria's economy?</h4><p>The government is definitely focused on resolving the power issues; the governor of Lagos State did an excellent job in this respect, which is why the President picked him for his current role. Power supply, not only to industries but also to the market and people's homes, has improved significantly so the government is trying. It has signed some MoUs and has promised that the power supply will increase in 2018 and it will perhaps start supplying to industries as well. In terms of infrastructure, certain private companies have come to the rescue of government. For example, Aliko Dangote has taken the initiative to repair some roads to the port areas. His group has almost 2,000 tankers lying on old roads so they need it for themselves as well. The government is working on the power sector; however, it needs to do more with infrastructure.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>With the expansion we are undertaking, our growth is 100% every year. Our turnover was NGN15 billion (USD42 million) in 2015 and NGN28 billion (USD78.4 million) in 2016; in 2017 we anticipate NGN50 billion (USD140 million). The support we are requesting in terms of power, infrastructure, and finance is so that we can grow more because we are committed and have full confidence in the Nigerian economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Be'ah's current strategy to position itself as a leader in solid waste management and other related segments?</h4><p>Be'ah came into existence in 2007, and our first goal was damage control; we could not allow these waste disposal practices to continue. Even the recycling industry in Oman was too informal, and safety and environmental standards were bad. Our priority was to replace the dumpsites with proper infrastructure and engineered landfills, and then start providing municipal waste services across the country. We closed over 380 dumpsites across Oman and replaced them with 11 engineered landfills supported by around 25 transfer stations and logistical hubs. Once we have the infrastructure ready in an area, we tender for international players to come and provide the municipal waste services. Special facilities need to be built to treat healthcare waste coming out of hospitals, clinics, and to a certain extent pharmacies. We moved to an autoclave system, which is basically a sterilization process, and then we can shred and landfill the waste. Now we have four autoclave lines in Muscat, plus one facility in the north close to Sohar and another in the south near Salalah. We currently have three facilities treating almost 95% of all our healthcare waste. We are planning an integrated facility in Sohar to treat hazardous waste. Phase I will be ready by the end of 2017 and operational in 2018. We are currently floating tenders to build Phase II, which is the most complex part of the project, and it should be ready by 2020. By 2020 we will have a state-of-the-art facility in Oman dealing with all kinds of hazardous waste.</p><h4>How do you fulfill your mission, both through legislation and increasing awareness?</h4><p>One of the success factors is the legal framework. This is as important as public awareness. This is one of the challenges for Be'ah because the legal framework is not sufficient, for example in terms of policing powers. We are working closely with the Ministry of the Environment to develop the right legislation. We have a first draft under review and hopefully within 2017, we will have a proper law, which will be followed by proper regulations. Once the legislation is in place, we have to ensure there is proper policing of it. In terms of changing waste management habits, there are two aspects—education and awareness. We have a joint team with the Ministry of Education to develop and update the government schools' curriculum to make sure environmental topics are included. This will be an ongoing process where we continue to update the syllabus as developments come in. In terms of public awareness we have a dedicated community outreach team that is out every day meeting different communities, households, and schools. We have looked at what is going on around the world and have picked the approaches we think are best for Oman and adapted these for use here.</p><h4>How easy is it to find the skilled engineers, chemists, and other professional talent you need to move your strategy forward?</h4><p>It was a challenge and it remains a challenge in some areas. When it comes to engineers, they are readily available as graduates, but the problem comes with getting experienced engineers and chemists in this particular field. This is why we put so much emphasis on developing young Omanis at Be'ah. What makes us stand out among the companies in Oman is we invest heavily in people. We send them out on training programs and bring training programs into Oman. That said, we had to bring in experts from around the world, including New Zealand, Australia, and Denmark. We try to get the best experience into the company here. It is a challenge. In terms of Omanization, around 86% of our staff at Be'ah are Omani. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your current solar operations plans in Yemen?</h4><p>Yemen is where the industry will be. It is a great area for us because there is little infrastructure present. The Omani government will likely mandate a minimum of renewable energy there; it has not said if it will be 5% or 10%, though it is trying to kick off renewable energy there involving both solar and wind technology. With wind, which has no upfront investment, we can put turbines there and not be charged. We get paid not for the wind turbine but the power we sell from the wind turbine. From a profitability point of view it costs around GPB300,000 for each turbine, though over a 25-year period, the payback is anywhere between GPB7.5 and 8 million per turbine. We are looking at hundreds of them both here in Oman and in Yemen.</p><h4>To what extent are you seeing businesses eager for a change into renewable power in Duqm?</h4><p>There is no alternative because ultimately what will happen is that the subsidies will gradually be reduced and therefore operational costs will gradually increase. Whenever I present to an MD or GM, the hypothetical question I always put to them what our company can do for theirs: We can drastically reduce their operational expenses. We are in renewable energy; however, renewable energy is not all about winning awards, reducing one's carbon footprint, or being green. These are the positive secondary effects. We select a new technology where the main benefit is that it costs less. No one today will add to their costs just to get a green award. We have to demonstrate a return on investment that makes sense over 25 years and what we aim to do is give a payback period of four to five years, and a life cycle of the asset being at least 25 years so that we have either free or substantially reduced energy from renewable sources. It means everyone wins because we are not burning gas. At the moment, the government is burning gas for 96% of its electricity generation and the remainder comes from diesel. This is expensive and does not make sense to burn a national asset with a finite life. Instead of getting that cubic meter of gas and selling it on the market to make a profit we use it for electricity consumption, which is economic madness. The whole process needs to be rethought at the national level. The effects are seen when individuals and businesses put solar panels on their rooftops, as there are 342 days of sun, with some of the highest solar radiation rates in the world, all of which is completely untapped here. </p><h4>What steps are you taking to introduce wind turbines here in Oman?</h4><p>It is in its infancy here. It will be several months before we can get the manufacturing plant up; however, the fact that we will manufacture wind turbines in Oman is a major step forward. In Oman people generally live on the coast and there is a great deal of wind on the coast; however, a 2.5MW turbine makes a great deal of noise. The other side is that if one breaks down, they are expensive to repair as everything is located at the top, requiring many people and equipment to fix. Our solution is smaller: to have a dozen of them and if one has a problem then the other 11 are working. We do not have a problem with low wind as these are designed to work in low-wind situations in urban areas, and schools, hospitals, and government buildings can use them as they are not obtrusive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact has your agreement with Tabreed Oman and the new strategy to sell treated wastewater had on Haya Water?</h4><p>At the moment, we are looking for different uses for treated effluent (TE). The signing of our recent agreement with Tabreed Oman, for example, has allowed us to focus more on agricultural and industrial-related business activities. Although there was a great deal of pushback in using TE for agricultural purposes, there has been an enormous change in people's thinking in the past months; when people do not know a product and the ways in which it is used, even from a religious perspective, they may think it is not appropriate. However, this has now passed. In regard to Tabreed, our agreement will further change people's mindsets; it produces great water that can be used for all of the previously mentioned applications.</p><h4>Where is Haya Water currently using its TE and what impact has it had?</h4><p>We are proud that some malls, such as Panorama or MGM for example, use our TE for cooling purposes. In addition, Al Mouj's 'The Wave' is also using our effluent as part of their water-cooling system. We also use TE on playgrounds, and are currently working with the Ministry of Sports to meet the presidents of each Omani football club to explain the benefits of using our TE in stadiums and other outdoor athletic venues. We are also looking to use TE in car washing activities, and are actively pushing for TE to be used in the food industry. At the moment, we use 60% of TE for various applications and want to increase its use to 90-95%, hopefully by 2025. Unfortunately, we still do not have networks set up in every location. Nevertheless, this year with the help of the Muscat Municipality and the regional governorate we are producing almost 200,000 metric cubes of TE per day, 50-60% of which is being used now. Using that much TE instead of potable and desalinated water helps the government save millions of rial, as the cost of producing one cubic meter of desalinated water is high. In 2016, the government saved almost OMR30 million for using TE water for different applications, instead of potable water. On top of that, there are also multiple environmental aspects involved; desalination uses a great deal of power.</p><h4>What projects is Haya Water currently active in?</h4><p>We already know that Tabreed is active at the Pal Mall project and will deliver the TE for cooling purposes, but will also supply the water for irrigation and connect the mall to our wastewater system. On the other hand, at the Mall of Oman we have already completed the design and finalized the tender process; final approval from the Ministry of Finance is still pending, however. This project is special though; TE will be used throughout the OMR200 million project and in a hotel for cooling purposes. We also want to connect the Crown Plaza and the JW Marriott to our wastewater system. Finally, we are working with the Muscat Municipality and water resources to supply many parks with TE. Furthermore, we want to supply TE for the expressway, as there are no trees there.</p><h4>What are Haya Water's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>The main objective is to complete our ongoing projects, plus start some key projects in wastewater. We also are looking for PPP options, and have already floated a tender to hire consultants who can help us with these kinds of projects. We want to increase our connectivity. We also want to increase TE sales, and sell more of the compost product that we are making. Besides these points, we will also focus on reducing our operating costs to break even and become more competitive and efficient. Finally, we would also like Haya Water to do business outside of Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the current demand for power and water in Oman developed in recent years?</h4><p>Regional growth continues to be enormous for both electricity and water, with residential, industrial, and commercial growth driving this demand. In the last 10 years, Oman has seen almost 9% growth in the power sector every year, and reaching this demand each year was keeping us on our toes. Energy usage by the end of 2017 was around 34GWh. Water is no different; demand has grown around 6%. Desalinated water usage in 2017 was close to 400 million cbm, or over 1 million cbm of desalinized water per day. The growth of the water network itself will also make a difference. Not all of Oman is covered by the main network, and the more we expand the network, the greater demand will be. We work with Rural Areas Electricity Company (RAECO), which distributes electricity in rural areas that are not connected to the main grid. We developed a power plant for RAECO in the province of Musandam to drive down costs and improve reliability of supply. With regard to a wind project in Dhofar, we will be buying electricity from RAECO, which is the eventual owner of the project.</p><h4>How is OPWP moving forward in regard to renewable energy projects, and how are they expected to impact the economy?</h4><p>The recent development in solar sources of energy and the economies of scale of developers and manufacturers are pushing prices low enough to make it economical for OPWP to purchase. OPWP is moving ahead with renewable energy and we now have a mandate from the Counsel of Financial Affairs and Energy Resources to have 10% of our energy, be produced by renewables by 2025. Our first tender for renewable energy could easily supply between 400 and 600MW, instead of the previously planned 200MW. There is a huge interest from developers in Oman's renewable opportunities. We have done a great deal of preparation in the past five years and have collected ground data at multiple locations as we want to ensure that interested developers have a bankable project. Once the initial projects are installed and we learn through their experience, we will then accelerate our pace. We want to reach our goals for 2025 much sooner, and if possible we will try to grow beyond our 10% target. The main challenge in the coming years may be energy storage that aims to address the intermittency of renewable energy supply, which is currently very expensive. Another set of challenges are the locations of solar projects and how we can get plots of land for given projects, as they require a fair bit of land. We also need to consider the transmission investment as well. Nevertheless, we will create a road map for ourselves in 2018 in order to reach our targets as best as possible.</p><h4>What are OPWP's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>By mandate, we need to ensure that there are adequate capacities in water and power throughout the Sultanate. Power is key to our success as it is an OPWP responsibility, whereas we share the responsibility for water with PAEW. Fuel diversification is another key factor for 2018, and we need to ensure that momentum does not slow down. In the past few years, we worked in optimizing the use of gas per unit of power produced. The growth of power has increased, which is why we have been optimizing the use of gas per unit of power produced. In the last few years, we have managed to save almost OMR50 million (USD130 million) worth of gas, and we plan to work with our partners in 2018 on continuously optimizing the use of gas in power generation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of renewable energy sources in industrial growth and environmental conservation?</h4><p>The Sultanate's approach to generating electricity using renewable energy sources such as sun and wind will have a positive effect through several aspects, including reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the pollution caused by emissions and waste generated by non-renewable sources of fuel, resulting in a significant improvement in quality-of-life indicators for current and future generations. The diversification of energy sources is one of the policies adopted by the government to achieve energy security and provide what is needed in light of population growth and expansion in the industrial sector and other strategic sectors. In addition, opening the way for renewable energy will contribute to economic diversification and such projects will reduce long-term greenhouse gas emissions, diversify energy sources, reduce dependence on low energy, create sustainable growth, promote environmental awareness, reduce pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels, and enhance the energy security of the country.</p><h4>What will be some of the ministry's concerns in the coming years?</h4><p>We continuously work on development programs using the lean approach, which the ministry has already started with some of its applications, in addition to enhancing human resource capabilities at various levels to prepare for dealing with future changes. The ministry is keen to complete the process of full electronic transformation of various services provided to clients, increase efficiency and effectiveness in the methods and approaches of environmental management, and implement the recommendations of the global advisory study on re-engineering procedures to achieve further development and modernization to keep pace with the contemporary world. We will continue to activate cooperation frameworks with various international bodies and organizations specialized in environmental management and human development. In the field of environmental policies, the ministry seeks to build a culture of voluntary environmental compliance through various incentive tools to enable entrepreneurs and industry to comply with environmental laws. Also, we plan to contribute and participate in the preservation of the environment and conservation of natural resources. Furthermore, this industry will continue the work on nature reserves management development by allowing the private sector to invest in ecotourism and activating the management protection approach to provide financial resources to protect wildlife components and the sustainability of ecosystem services. Moreover, we are focusing on continued cooperation with universities and scientific research institutions to carry out further joint applied research to strengthen the scientific foundation in order support decision makers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-scratch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Chinese consortium Oman Wanfang seeks to deliver 25 projects in Duqm worth around USD11 billion. How has this progressed, and what can be expected?</h4><p>SEZAD allotted the consortium a concession area of almost 12,000sqkm for certain SME projects, including 25 light industrial projects. Petrochemicals will be part of the second phase while hotels will be the third and final phase of the project. The land has already been marked out for the first phase, and the plan is being approved for greenfield infrastructure works, such as roads and electricity. We expect to see something on the ground by early 2018. The consortium is also doing its planning and design work for the hotels, and we expect the first results in by 3Q2018. The petrochemicals phase will need gas and that will not be available on site until 2019; designs are being plotted at this moment. This project has given other parties an incentive to get involved in Duqm. For example, Indian investors have requested land and a concession, and we have given them 600,000sqm to build a "Little India" with hotels and ICT-related projects. At the moment, there are local investors in Duqm, as well as regional investors from Iran, Qatar, Dubai, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How will the Port of Duqm, Oman Drydock Company, and the other logistics projects help boost Duqm's role in creating a hub?</h4><p>There is no doubt that all these will boost the logistics segment as this location is great for any goods being transported to Africa, Asia, and elsewhere. Duqm is close to many countries with large populations, such as India, Pakistan, and China. In addition, we have great access to East Africa and a historically positive relationship with the region; many Omanis speak East African languages, for example. There are many Chinese entities that are interested in Africa, and they want to use Duqm as the main hub to access East Africa. All this will come together to help make Duqm, and Oman in general, a logistics hub.</p><h4>What have some of the challenges of transforming Duqm, and is there room for improvement?</h4><p>One of the biggest challenges initially was reaching this area. Secondly, there was not much development here. Duqm used to be a fishing village with a population, including non-Omanis, of 3,820. To convert that desert into a city with roads and other infrastructure, hotels, and houses has not been easy. This has been possible because each unit within the government fully supports SEZAD, as do all the non-governmental stakeholders and entities. We have managed to convert this village into an integrated zone today—one of the biggest port areas in the Middle East— with almost 500 hotel rooms, an airport, drydock, upcoming refineries, and investors from countries like China and India. We have all worked together to overcome the initial challenges in terms of access and services; now one can fly to Duqm every day. Another challenge was utilities, such as electricity and water, because it was a small village purely involved in fishing. Now, it is like any other city in terms of lighting, traffic lights, and so forth. Everything is new, and there are no obstacles because it is a greenfield project, which, although can be a challenge, is also a great opportunity. By 2022 most of our infrastructure will be complete and fully functional.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2018 at SEZAD and Duqm, as a whole?</h4><p>We want to achieve most of our targets and avoid any delays. However, the most important thing is keeping the refinery project on track. We also have the Ras Markaz oil storage project with Oman Oil Company coming up. It is starting by constructing a storage capacity of 25 million barrels, gradually going up to 150-200 million barrels, which will be a huge facility. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[entrepreneurship-culture]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Riyada's main strategy for 2017-2018, and how will it add in-country value to Oman?</h4><p>Riyada's main strategic focus will remain the same, which is to inspire success. Everything we do will be governed by whether or not it inspires success. Under this strategy, 2017 and 2018 are years of shifting gears. We consider the first four years of Riyada as the establishment period; now we are moving onto the years of powering up our activities and moving our operations forward. Our main focus is developing SMEs successfully such that the entire country will be inspired. We have to translate that strategic focus and philosophy into everything we do. </p><h4>How is Riyada promoting entrepreneurship and small business ownership to the younger generation?</h4><p>We are linking two mechanisms together. Internally, we are focusing on the five pillars of our strategy plan drawn up in 2015. The first pillar is to ensure the decisions and procedures relevant to SMEs that are in place are the best practices. The second is to coordinate and follow up with the bodies that are responsible for those 41-plus decisions and procedures for SME development. Thirdly is to lead in the role of informing the country about the main message of entrepreneurship. The fourth is the offer; there are concrete things we need to offer or support, such as the provision of incubation spaces and land for SMEs. The last and most important of the five pillars is to cultivate. We are in charge of making sure we instill the right entrepreneurship culture. We have to make people understand we want entrepreneurs and SME owners with the right set of values who will add value to the country.</p><h4>Which sectors are entrepreneurs particularly interested in?</h4><p>Most are interested in the services sector, though there is some interest in the manufacturing sector as well. In the first cultivation phase, young people are interested in establishing service-type businesses such as co-working spaces and private incubation. In the manufacturing sector, we hope more people will link their businesses with the existing manufacturing plants in the country. In our training programs, we are noticing a healthy mix of SMEs, but we see a dominant trend in the handicrafts industry. They are often already established in their business but need a great deal of training. In the third phase, we see many people looking for contracts. There is much more diversity in the power-up phase, and we have started seeing some medium-sized enterprises. Food and water security projects are more dominant in the third phase because these are people who are naturally entrepreneurs. They are usually people in the fisheries or farming industry with specific expertise and now want to build a business out of it.</p><h4>Where do you see Riyada in the coming years and the evolution of SMEs in Oman?</h4><p>Riyada is the facilitator of more than 50 players in the SME development sphere, focusing on education and training, financing and venture capital, and supporting organizations, corporations, and regulators. We work with them on programs and initiatives, such as the Upgrade Program for the ICT sector, the Catalyst Program in contracting and recruitment, and export programs with the Omani Authority for Partnership for Development (OAPFD). As a government entity, the smaller of a role we play in the future, the more value we will add because the spirit of entrepreneurship depends on people motivating themselves, not the government telling them what to do. When we get out of their way and they solve their customers' problems, value is added. If after a decade we continue to play a major role in the entrepreneurship ecosystem here, we have not done our job. By 2027 one of our KPIs is to see how we can do more with less. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has OAPFD evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Those who are familiar with offset, our PFD program, understand that it is mainly focused on the defense industry; however, this has not been the case in Oman for several years now. In Oman, offset is generally used to leverage large international contracts with defense and security agencies and civil infrastructure contracts to achieve national policy goals. Close to 80 countries around the world implement their offsets into defense and security. The objective is the same: OAPFD is part of the government's efforts to diversify the economy. The authority uses the offset tool to align itself with the five key sectors of the Tanfeedh initiative. Translating that into actions, OAPFD has three clear goals to contribute toward diversifying the economy: enhance defense and security, invest in human capital, and work on projects to strengthen the private sector. In 2016 and 2017, OAPFD managed to translate these obligations into projects. Currently, OAPFD has six operational projects and more than 15 projects in different stages of development, of differing magnitude and type.</p><h4>What do the OAPFD's current operational projects consist of?</h4><p>Our current projects include the Oman Marine Biotechnology Center, which was established in 2017 as an R&amp;D company in the marine biotechnology field. The main objective of this project is to explore the untapped potential of the Omani oceans and set parallel applications to the industry. Another project is related to young people, whereby OAPFD created a youth skills development program. There is also the Oman Aviation Academy (OAA), a JV with Airbus Helicopter, TANMIA, Al Hosn Investment Company, and the Ministry of Defense Pension Fund. The academy will provide Oman Air with commercial pilot training and will also open up to other civil airlines. The intention is to include basic military screening training in the second phase. Furthermore, Sohar is undergoing a major development phase, which is an opportunity for OAPFD to contribute to the Sohar community and create jobs.</p><h4>What does the PFD-ICV Online Monitoring &amp; Reporting system consist of, and what benefits will it bring?</h4><p>Within the scope of the PFD-ICV Online Monitoring &amp; Reporting system is industrial mapping and local market capability. In addition to general information on a given company, it will include company capabilities, staff, machinery, certification, and export capacity. It will give fair opportunities and a platform for the Omani manufacturing sector, mainly in industrial and special economic zones Also, large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) will also have access to the system and will be able to see local companies available in a particular industry, the self-assessed local company's strengths, and the OEM's assessment of local companies' skills, capabilities, and capacity against the large OEM's PFD project scope of work and requirements. The OEM will carry out audits on the local company and come up with a development plan mutually agreed with OAPFD.</p><h4>What are the OAPFD's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>We have been working on OAPFD's business plan with a focus to further align ourselves with Tanfeedh. We see the latter as an anchor, and there are already projects the authority is considering in the fisheries and ICT domains. There are also a number of projects in the capabilities development and government leadership training domains. In regards to manufacturing investment promotion, we look to materialize at least four international foreign direct investments through JVs in Oman, in defense and other sectors. These are projects that we hope to see implemented in 2018, and we are optimistic with the various reforms, reviews, and overall momentum that is picking up on a daily basis. Although our objective is economic diversification, job creation is at the heart of everything we do, whether directly through JVs or indirectly through training programs that increase employability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What technological advances has NCSI introduced into its service portfolio?</h4><p>We have apps for Android and Apple that dispense tourist information about Oman. Users can find hotels, ATMs, hospitals, petrol stations, and other important locations. The bank app, called Banki, provides information about banks in Oman. It details which banks provide which services to the public. The petrol app provides information on opening hours, locations, and other relevant data. This new use of data is interesting, and statistical organizations should use the information they possess to benefit the general public. They should move beyond acquiring information and knowledge and provide a service to the public. This industry requires a new approach, and ours cannot be found anywhere else. This information will also help many economic sectors such as logistics, tourism, and others. We will work with them to improve data that might be useful for them. We are now focused on the Oman map, a service that will be linked with addresses. We will also evaluate how entities can use big data to provide better services.</p><h4>Who are the partners that allow you to provide such extensive app services?</h4><p>We receive information, for example for petrol stations, from the company that provides the petrol service. It feeds us with information. If it creates a new service, it informs us. When we launched the app, we did it together. With Banki we built relationships with the banks; we usually sign MoUs with the stakeholders and partners. It is a win-win situation for both partners.</p><h4>Why has NCSI taken a special interest in logistics?</h4><p>The future vision of the country highlights the importance of logistics, because we can no longer depend solely on oil. It is necessary to create KPIs, determine where we need to start, and then move toward implementation. It comprises all services related to logistics, such as transport and storage, both direct and indirect. We took examples from countries like Singapore and the Netherlands. We wanted to understand how those countries evolved to have the logistics sector play an important role in GDP. We signed an MOU with the statistical entity in the Netherlands. We sent some staff to the Netherlands for a month of training. Logistics can be directly or indirectly related to many sectors, such as education, construction, transport, and more.</p><h4>What role do data and statistics have in improving Oman's ease of doing business?</h4><p>We are not only responsible for statistics; we are in charge of managing the national special data infrastructure (NSDI). We also created an office for the National Competitive committee. We want Oman to be a leader in many sectors. With these lists, like the Doing Business list, we evaluate in which sectors we can be leaders. Although the list does not evaluate data and is more related to procedures and regulations, it is still important to realize if there are certain regulations that do not allow the country to be competitive, and what aspects should be resolved by the government.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for NCSI?</h4><p>We must lead the private sector and government forward by showing them how they can solve their problems and enhance their knowledge. We can also provide them with information on where they should focus their efforts. Information is power. The world nowadays revolves around information. We are starting to build information dashboards for the public. There are also special dashboards for policymakers that are designed as infographics to be easy to understand because people have little time to read. We send out comprehensive knowledge on various sectors that can be relevant for people's work, and a special report in their sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does ASAAS fit into Oman's diversification plan?</h4><p>ASAAS is one of the largest real estate development and investment companies in the country. In line with our mandate, we developed the corporate strategy of the company and drafted a 10-year business plan, which aims to create OMR1 billion (USD2.6 billion) of projects. When we started our operations, we based our corporate strategy around the key economic sectors already identified by the government, including, among others, tourism, logistics, and healthcare. ASAAS' approach in developing these sectors is investing in projects that will enhance the entire value chain. In the real estate sector, we are in the final phase of developing our pilot project—a Hilton Garden Inn Hotel. The common theme among our projects both real estate and others is keeping social impact and financial return at the forefront. We are currently working on a project with Oman Air to develop a reporting terminal for its cabin crew and is expected to be ready in the first half of 2018. The project is being developed by ASAAS and upon completion will be leased to the government-owned national carrier. Another project in the tourism supply chain is developing the much-needed Hayy Al Sharq (HAS) in Barka, 45 minutes away from Muscat International Airport. At present the country lacks entertainment destinations of international standards and as a result people travel to other countries in the region for leisure, resulting in capital flight from the country. Hayy Al Sharq will bring entertainment to our doorsteps and assist in attracting tourists to the country. In addition, we are working with different government and private-sector institutions on various projects, all of which will assist in the diversification of the national economy. As a result of all our initiatives, we have been selected together with two other companies as a preferred real estate developer by the government of Oman.</p><h4>What specific projects will you be working on in 2018?</h4><p>We are working on a number of exciting projects in education, healthcare and tourism throughout the country. One such project is the redevelopment of the Institute of Public Administration (IPA) building. The first such PPP project in ASAAS, it is innovatively structured to maximize the gains of the private party whilst removing the need for the government to fund a public premises. The project aims to redevelop the IPA's premises into a world-class training facility together with a three-star hotel and lifestyle retail complex. The project will bring unique and modern architectural features to the area. Another project we are working upon is setting up a tourism experience company, which will offer extreme sports and experiences to the locals and tourists something that is lacking in the country. It is important for us and also for the sustainability of any project to ensure we have the right partners—something that requires a great deal of effort but is rewarding in the long term.</p><h4>Where do you see the most growth in the country?</h4><p>The Sultanate is blessed with an exceptional beauty and landscape, something we have a competitive advantage in over other countries in the region. We continue to believe that tourism coupled with the geographical location of the country are the unique selling points of the country and have the potential to be the most important sectors contributing to the local economy. It is important for us to upscale the offerings and experiences in the country in line with the global standards.</p><h4>What are the specific objectives for 2018 that ASAAS would like to meet?</h4><p>We have done all the ground work for a number of our projects, where we have structured the investments and partnered up with the best institutions. Now in the second stage of growth, our main objective for 2018 is to attract co-investors for our projects from different parts of the world such as the GCC, Asia, Europe, and the US. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strategic-importance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does ONSS consist of, and how is it aligned with the Sultanate's 2040 vision?</h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman has gone through a spectacular process of transformation and nation building since the early 1970s following the ascension of His Majesty the Sultan to the throne. In this extremely short period of time, Oman has achieved a remarkable improvement in its social and economic conditions. However, the country is now confronted with a number of complex challenges that require the careful attention of leaders and planners. These include the depletion of oil and gas reserves, scarcity of water, need to diversify the economy and employment, and development of human resources of Omani nationals. These challenges need multifaceted and profound changes in planning approaches and interventions. The Sultanate is addressing these issues in various ways. One of the responses has been the idea of creating a National Spatial Strategy, which aims to address the spatial dimension of challenges that have accumulated over the last decades, mainly as a result of the tremendous pace of growth. The main objective of the strategy is to develop a framework to guide sustainable development in the national and regional levels for the next 20-30 years. It will also function as a guideline and framework for all regional and sectoral strategies (e.g. five-year economic plans) and will establish the mechanisms by means of an institutional and legal planning framework and capacity building to ensure that the strategy is implemented and kept up to date. As part of the ONSS, the regional spatial strategies for each governorate in the Sultanate will be elaborated. Each regional spatial strategy will comprise a single development plan with related regulatory instruments at the local level. The regional spatial strategies will be important building blocks of the ONSS and aim to integrate them into one national strategy with one vision, regulatory instrument, and tool for implementation.</p><h4>To what extent are certain sectors of the economy prioritized within ONSS in order to increase efficiency and development?</h4><p>Economic development is a crucial part of this strategy. We are currently at the stage of evaluating and assessing the potential for every region in Oman to help increase contribution to GDP and create economic opportunities in the region. Analysis of the competitive advantage of every region in Oman will support the decisions on what economic sectors are required to develop and where.</p><h4>How will foreign investors benefit from the ONSS?</h4><p>For investors, it is extremely important to know what the spatial policies are for the long term, both in the whole country and in the governorates. After all, investors will put their money in all kinds of real estate. Their return on investments and future value depend heavily on the right location and the expected developments in the neighborhood. A well-guided spatial strategy is also of importance for offering sufficient space for the growth ambitions of the private sector and to attract new foreign business. This will contribute to a more competitive and attractive country.</p><h4>What are the main objectives for the program in 2018?</h4><p>Our goal is to complete the project and have the strategy document finalized by mid-2019. In 2018, we will develop and present various possible spatial development options on the national level to the various stakeholders; through a national debate workshop, the preferred option will be selected. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Nurturing Nigerian Talent]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sam-onyemelukwe-managing-director-trace-tv-venator-partners-ltd]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us an introduction to Trace TV and Venator?</h4><p>Venator Partners is a media and entertainment business focused on the West African regional market. We sell advertising, manage celebrity talents for brands, and produce events, television shows, and trendy short-form clips. We also have a content business focused on the newer wave of audio-visual content in the region. When I started Venator in 2010-2011, one of the first clients I brought in was Trace TV and we were representing them as an advertisement platform. Since then, we have become one of Trace's most important partners in Africa and now, we hold a Master License Agreement with Trace and work within the group on a Pan-African basis. Trace TV is a completely separate entity from Venator but there is, in fact, an overlap in what both companies do. Because of our M.L.A. (Master Licensing Agreement), we report all our revenue to Trace TV, while for television advertising there is a portion that goes on Trace channels and a portion that does not. For the rest of the business, we do revenue shares on predetermined percentages. We have been fortunate that Trace TV has grown into one of the most influential music and entertainment brands in the region.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for both entities?</h4><p>We are currently redefining our relationship with Trace TV and are looking at a few options. Venator may end up more closely related to Trace TV or we may take on new investors and focus on growing other parts of our business. No matter which one, I see us being a leader in the continued growth of the wider music and entertainment industry in the region, both from a regional content perspective and in terms of managing brands and campaigns. It is a different world now, and businesses are only starting to catch up. Today, the standard ad agency model only works for very specific purposes in the region. Competition between brands and evolving consumer tastes and habits means marketers must be fast to adapt and innovative in terms of content marketing, influence or base marketing. Many brands are catching up with this and we are well ahead of the curve.</p><h4>How can Trace TV help the music industry grow? Is it about brand awareness, ads, or other factors?</h4><p>We have a major part to play in that. Nigerian music is highly exportable and we have 11 channels that are broadcast in over 180 countries with hundreds of millions of viewers. Africa only comprises about 50 countries of that and more than a third of our viewership is outside of Africa. Our channels are broadcast in Europe, Asia, the US, and the Caribbean. When we take a video, artist, or a song and promote that, we can open ears and influence listening habits much more so than other music platforms. We are in a unique position to do this with Trace TV because the other channel brand that has this global reach is MTV; however, MTV is regionalized in its content. For example, we put a great deal of effort into bringing Caribbean vibes to Africa that people here do not normally have access to. Conversely, we take Nigerian, Kenyan, and South African content to the Caribbean. We cut across multiple markets.</p><h4>How can Nigeria harness the enormous potential of its talent and passion for music and make a business out of the entertainment sector?</h4><p>Some of the fundamental infrastructures of the music industry are not in place here in terms of publishing and music rights (mechanical, and performing, etc). The government is doing a few things, though it has not truly given that much attention to these issues to enable the industry to thrive. There is a royalty collecting society; however, it is unable to enforce its mandate because they have a limited repertoire, in addition is not supported by the government with the media companies like us that continually play content. Approximately 80-90% of the value of artists and songs is being played into the air and disappears. Beyond that, there is a great deal that could be gained by the general promotion of music here, for example by developing music tourism, whereby people come to Nigeria to check out the clubs and the live music scene. Then, there is the issue of live performances, as there are not enough venues. There should be 500 bars and clubs in Lagos where there is a live performance every weekend, but this is not the case. Lagos State is doing something about this; it has opened a second Terra Kulture in partnership with Bolanle Austen-Peters on Victoria Island. By the end of 2018, there will be six Terra Kulture centers in each of the major areas of Lagos. This means we can start to tour artists, music, plays, and more around Lagos but given our love for music and enjoyment, a live music culture could easily thrive here.</p><h4>What steps should be taken to harness and increase the impact of the music industry on Nigeria's economy?</h4><p>We need better regulations to protect performing rights (when songs are played on radio, in shops or TV), publishing (when songs are used in TV ads and movies) and to monetize music abroad (Pan African protections), to neighboring countries and Africa first, then the world. From the public sector, we need to incentive investment into the space, some good steps have been taken by The Ministry of Culture and Tourism but it could go further to small investments in performing areas (or simply in holding live performances) within bars across urban and semi-rural areas. We need to encourage artists to understand that while they shoot for the top, and the glamour of being the next Wizkid, they can make a good living getting paid 50-100K three, four, five, or more times a week, performing their music locally in smaller venues. On the digital and mobile side, there are many changes that need to be made both by the Communication Commission and Mobile operators. Granted that telcos have made large investments in their network that provide the opportunity for content distribution; however, the skew of revenue shares between content owners and telcos is damaging the content industry. The standard rate is that 70-80% goes to the telco when they sell a song or video while the remaining 20-30% gets split between the technical provider, the VAS partner, and the content owner. This is ridiculous and far from global standards, and it hobbles the creative community, COSON, the Collecting Society of Nigeria among other players is commendably spearheading a new movement to help change this. Telcos are the biggest vehicle for the distribution of music. They generate at least USD10-15 million a month just in ringtones, not including their revenues from streaming and downloads; meanwhile, the entire pool of content creators only net USD1-2 million.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the music industry in Nigeria in 2018?</h4><p>The outlook is excellent; the music industry is headed for great things. Musicians themselves have truly honed their crafts, and they know the sounds that work and have significantly matured in recent years. As a result, the music will go further and faster than ever before. We will have many huge hits and this will be a driver for the types of revenues that go through the business and therefore the industry and creator leverage to start to even out some of the issues. It will be impossible for both the public and private sectors to continue to ignore the industry and its issues, and there will be a great deal of change. We have also seen some of the global record labels come into Lagos, such as Universal and Sony.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the guidelines for preparing Vision 2040?</h4><p>The main guidelines are the Royal Directives of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, which stipulated that Oman's Vision 2040 will be thoroughly developed and precisely formulated with wide community participation and consensus. Hence, the process will entail engaging the different societal groups, so that the vision is fully integrated into the economic and social realities of Oman and objectively orientated toward the future. This will enable it to serve as a key guide and reference for all planning efforts of the Sultanate in the next two decades.</p><h4>What has been achieved so far in this journey?</h4><p>The journey started with the engagement of committees with different stakeholders representing various sectors and the Omani community at large, as this is an important project for Oman's future. Our starting point was to conduct an in-depth research on Oman's current status, followed by extensive brainstorming between the different committees, ministries, the private sector, academics, community representatives, and other stakeholders to identify Oman's national priorities for the coming two decades. Based on those priorities, we have set out three main themes for the vision, namely: People and Society, Economy and Development, and Governance and Institutional Performance, where each theme comprises a number of key pillars.</p><h4>What will the next phase of preparing Oman 2040 Vision entail?</h4><p>The next phase will involve assessing the key pillars and issues identified in the first phase against the outcomes of the foresight and scenario phase in order to decide on different directions for the pillars and key issues that will still be relevant in 2040 in order for the vision to be realized. Consequently, we will draft the initial vision and present it at the National Conference in 4Q2018. The National Conference will be designed to ensure maximum community engagement, with creative interaction methods to receive additional feedback from participants before the final vision is announced. As we progress, stakeholder engagement will continue to become wider. For example, inclusion of the views of young Omanis, women, and students will continue to be essential. Furthermore, this vision is for everyone in Oman, and we have invited other communities that live and work here to be engaged as well. While the vision is focused on socio-economic development in the coming two decades, it will also preserve our Omani identity and rich cultural heritage.</p><h4>Which sectors will become most important for Vision 2040?</h4><p>The Sultanate, via the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan and Tanfeedh, has already identified five promising sectors for economic diversification: tourism, logistics, manufacturing, fisheries, and mining. The vision will continue to focus on these strategic sectors as it does not seek to re-invent the wheel, but rather build on previous efforts undertaken by Oman. In addition, the vision will focus on other areas that Oman has a competitive edge in, which may include but are not limited to clean and renewable energy, data, innovation, creative industries, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, developing ICT will, for example, aid the development of tourism or renewable energy. ICT has an impact on all fields; it is the backbone of development. Governance is also the same. We have to consider whether Oman needs to be more innovative as a country to start things here in the region. This is an issue we need to decide on.</p><h4>What specific plans do you have to move this program forward in 2018?</h4><p>We have a technical milestone for 2018, along with other goals that are more related to stakeholder engagement. We have a communications strategy under which we have initiatives to ensure that everyone in Oman is engaged in this process. There will be consultation initiatives in the public and private sectors as well as for students and other groups in the Omani society. This will enable us to include their proposals and perspectives within the future directions and long-term objectives of Oman Vision 2040. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Celebrating 10th Anniversary in 2018]]></title>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you celebrate your 10th anniversary, what have been the major highlights in the fields of privatized government services, medical facilities, industrial production, and port operating business that Ittihad is involved in?</h4><p>Following a rough start in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, we managed to rationalize our portfolio, divesting a number of our non-core businesses and focusing on growing our investments in export manufacturing industry and privatized government services. We also developed strategies to nurture our investments in healthcare and education sector. Such strategy has yielded its fruits and we managed to grow Ittihad revenues by tenfold since its inception. Our exports today cover more than 32 different destinations and we will continue to grow in the coming years. Ittihad is now the main shareholder and operator of over 26 companies categorized into four pillars: Industrial Capital Group (ICG), our manufacturing arm, Emirates Link Group (ELG), focusing mainly on privatized government services, Medical Investments (MED-IN), for investments in healthcare, and lastly, Venture Investments (Venture-In), for small businesses and new VC-type investment. Uniquely structured for Ittihad to focus on each pillar's development, to tap in new markets and secure its financial needs to maintain its growth strategy.</p><h4>To what extent is the government turning to the private sector to further stimulate the economy?</h4><p>We have witnessed a number of initiatives toward the privatization of government services over the past few years. Government departments have realized the need to restructure their offerings in a manner to emphasize their role as a regulator rather than a service provider. Abu Dhabi has been a leader in the past years in privatizing the operation and maintenance activities for various infrastructure and municipal services. For example, the first PPP project in the GCC for water and electricity generation was in Abu Dhabi. However, we currently see further developments in the model towards BOO and BOOT projects, such as the recent announcement of the largest desalination plant in Abu Dhabi, the waste-to-energy plant in Dubai, and a number of PPPs in healthcare. We believe privatization can play a major role in the coming years to boost the economy in the GCC area, especially in municipal services, transportation, telecommunications, and healthcare.</p><h4>Can you walk us through Ittihad Investment's strategy with regard to new potential partners?</h4><p>Over the past few years, Ittihad has developed, strengthened, and grown its partnership with business leaders both regionally and internationally. Our strategy is based on a win-win philosophy and long-term partnerships. Union Copper Rod, an Ittihad subsidiary, became the core partner of Glencore in the Middle East. Our partnership with GE led to the development of our unique investment in PPP in healthcare and expanded our market offering. Moreover, our cooperation with Khalifa Port has grown from being a regular customer to becoming one of its main partners in exporting over 10,000 TEUs per year, which is likely to double by the end of 2020 with the addition of bulk imports. Relationships with local companies such as Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) enable our subsidiary National Cement Factory to be the first cement plant approved for nuclear construction. Collaborations with Fujifilm, Hill-Rom, Steelcase and many others widen our offerings and enable us to tap in new markets and ventures.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the Emiratization process and how can Abu Dhabi and the UAE strike a balance?</h4><p>Government and semi-government entities remain the focal drive in the Emiratization process. The programs offered by ADNOC, ADNOC-OPCs, Etisalat, Mubadala, and many others attract most of the talented Emiratis, be it in salary or training and career development. It goes without saying that the private sector cannot match such offering. However, we should focus on vocational training and vocational schools, and we believe we can create a new segment for Emiratization. In my opinion, UAE Emiratization Strategy does not impose a threat to the foreign talent attraction as the total Emirati workforce is less than 10% of the overall in UAE. The main challenge lies in the methodology to attract these local talents and how to develop their skillset to work in the private sector yet maintain the sector's competitiveness. In the past years, we have seen a number of remarkable initiatives by STRATA, SENAAT and the banking sector in general. We believe it is important to organize events between these entities along with the private sector to share the lessons learned, and develop further such programs. The government as well should develop an incentive program for the private sector in funding Emiratization programs and developing the vocational training.</p><h4>How is technology changing the face of trading business here?</h4><p>The disruption caused by technology varies from one sector to another. On one hand, it created bigger opportunities; on the other hand, it caused significant threats. For the latter, the biggest hit will be in the retail industry, where in the near future the whole shopping experience will be confined to the touch and feel of goods while actual sales are done online. We will soon witness the fading of a number of brands, and the rise of hypermarket and Amazon brands. This will cause industries to struggle to maintain their brand's presence. The effect of AI is yet to be seen, though it has potential to be the next big revolution, be it in the medical field or in product research.</p><h4>Where do you see the biggest challenges and opportunities for the growth of the Emirate's economy?</h4><p>Abu Dhabi urgently needs to rebrand itself to focus on what makes it an attractive place for investors. To start, it needs a new business card. It used to promote itself as a tax haven and a place with inexpensive electricity and labor; these are no longer valid. Perhaps, we should start promoting Abu Dhabi as a place with a secured and reliable energy, modern infrastructure, and the flexibility of regulations. However, Abu Dhabi needs to put more emphasis on connecting the dots and fostering harmony across all sectors to streamline efficiencies throughout industry, real estate, and energy. We need to leverage on the speed of taking decisions, as we have a dynamic structure that can allow us to be ahead of our regional competition.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>2018 will definitely bring its own mix of new challenges and experiences. In 2018, Ittihad will continue its export-focused strategy and we expect to grow our export volume by at least 20%. <br>Moreover, 2018 is a special year for Ittihad as we will be celebrating our 10th anniversary and will mark the commercial operation of Union Rebar Factory in Jebel Ali, the inauguration of our first Private Public Partnership (PPP) in the medical field, the inauguration of Ittihad Paper Mill, the expansion of Crown Paper Mill, the expansion of Union Chemicals Factory, and the inauguration of our first waste recycling plant in Dubai. These strategic projects among others will certainly carve in stone the name of Ittihad among the market-leading companies in the region, and will reinforce our momentum for growth and exemplary performance. With strong determination and ability, we will definitely add this year to our success story.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mandate of the SCP in development plans and future visions?</h4><p>SCP was established by virtue of Royal Decree No. 30/2012 on 26 May 2012 and is chaired by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said. SCP is mandated with the power and authority to develop the strategies and policies that are required to achieve sustainable development in the Sultanate of Oman. It is also mandated with setting the regulations required to give effect to such strategies and polices and to apply the same in an endeavor to achieve the economic diversity and optimal utilization of the available natural and human resources. SCP is responsible for setting a sustainable long-term national strategy based on the available natural and human resources and sustainable development needs and requirements; setting future concepts, general tendencies, and the policies and mechanisms required to achieve sustainable development; setting the national urban strategy and approval of the general policy for urban planning in view of the approved development plans and in accordance with the economic, social, and environmental considerations; setting the national strategy for statistics, census, and information; setting standards and criteria to determine the priorities of the developmental plans and methods of developmental planning in such a manner to guarantee the balance between the economic and social aspects of development; approving the annual developmental budget; approving the five-year developmental plans and their financial allocations; periodically evaluating future strategies and plans in addition to the general tendencies and five-year plans in view of the economic, social, and other variables; setting principles for economic communication on the regional and international level; and all other tasks and duties entrusted thereto by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said.</p><h4>Considering the forecasts and priorities for the country, how will planning for Vision 2040 take into account unknown variables, such as oil prices and new technologies?</h4><p>As an oil producing and exporting country, where oil revenues still comprise a major share of total government revenue, Omani economic policy considers the vulnerability in international oil prices, and all precautionary measures have been taken. These oil price challenges have necessitated the financial authorities—especially when implementing the next plan and Future Vision 2040—to move toward adopting substantial fiscal consolidation methods, as well as prudent fiscal sustainability policies. These measures will maintain the overall fiscal balance by gradually establishing the specialized fiscal institutions, maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability, promoting financial sector development, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy, and adopting a structural balance system so as to smooth oil price volatility. Such structural balances will help in the assessment and solutions of the impact of the oil cycle on revenues and expenditures. The financial authorities are currently reviewing said approach and moving toward establishing a gradual fiscal adjustment program and strengthening fiscal institutions to safeguard the economy from fiscal vulnerabilities due to oil price fluctuations and ensure long and medium-term fiscal sustainability.</p><h4>Where do you see the Omani economic diversification campaign heading in the next five years?</h4><p>Oman seeks to accelerate the pace of economic diversification in a manner that reduces the national economy's reliance on oil whether in revenues or exports and mitigates the repercussions of external shocks resulting from the fluctuation in oil prices in the global market. This requires reconsideration of previous economic diversification policies and altering the approach to benefit from the achievements realized in previous development plans. The achievements realized include those in areas of infrastructure and logistic services, and those provided in terms of ports, airports, and transport services, in addition to maximizing the usage of natural resources in the Sultanate. At the same time, we seek to benefit from the unique and advantageous geographic location facing the countries of the emerging economies in East Asia, and also acting as a gateway to East African countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the efforts behind making Telefónica the leader of LTE 4G in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We have had a clear vision of what we needed to do in the country. There have been three pillars that have taken us to our current position. We are the second carrier in the Costa Rican market and a referent in LTE technology. The first of these pillars has been deploying a robust network, particularly in LTE 4G. In fact, we were the pioneers of developing this technology throughout the country. Currently, we cover 83% of the population in terms of 4G and 98% of the population for 3G. Another of our strategies has been developing innovative products that truly adapt to the needs of customers. A third element, which is one of the most important, is ensuring customers have a great experience and are satisfied with our services. Our investments have not been only toward deploying our network, but also on availability of service and ensuring that customer experience and service are satisfactory. In six years of operations, we have invested over USD600 million.</p><h4>How has Movistar impacted the telecoms market in Costa Rica?</h4><p>In our six years of operations, our main focus has always been the customer. Developing our products has resulted in over 2.3 million customers. On top of this, our focus on service has helped expand our market share. According to SUTEL, we had 25% of the market share in 2016 and estimated 27.1% in 2017. This has allowed us grow rapidly, positively impacting the Costa Rican market, since we have deployed our service to regions outside the GAM, providing our customers with greater connectivity and benefits. Some of the greatest effects on the market have been the development of innovative products and a robust network, and we have been pioneers in products and services that our competitors have followed. Another of our main focuses has been facilitating the lives of our customers, giving them the ability to auto manage their accounts and providing a satisfactory service. We are at the top of rankings of SUTEL for customer satisfaction, while other studies such as Open Signal have ranked our network as the best in the key terms such as network availability and latency. We recently won 40 MHz in the last spectrum auction and with large investments in the first quarter of 2018 we will use this spectrum to improve our mobile networks and increase speeds.</p><h4>How has Telefónica innovated with its B2B solutions?</h4><p>We have a customized and differentiated service, depending on the type of customer. In the B2B segment, we developed a robust portfolio of services for large, medium, and small companies, as well as for the government. We develop services that boost their business and facilitate the operations of companies in a productive way. In our catalog, we have fixed-data solutions, mobile data, cybersecurity services, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, and mobile applications, as well as new services, such as sponsored data. We also have a fleet management service in order to control and measure the use of transport fleets. We are also developing IoT and working with municipalities on the subject of smart cities. There is a significant number of B2B services and that is because we have the support of Grupo Telefónica, which develops them and we adapt them to the Costa Rican market. We have grown 45% in the last year in B2B services in Costa Rica and our bet is to continue to focus on innovating our digital solutions to offer to the corporate segment, so we are able to compete with the major operators of the market.</p><h4>What is your perspective of the telecoms sector in 2018?</h4><p>In 2018, we will continue to develop innovative products. We have prepared a portfolio of services for 2018, with which our customers will find benefits and will be able to choose from. Our objective remains clear: to take care of our 2.3 million customers through customer service, innovative products, customer experience and user-friendly interface, and, above all, products that allow us to be an integral operator. It will be an interesting year for the telecoms sector and mobile operators due the need to anticipate customers' requirements and being competitive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering that expatriates make up 45% of the Omani population, how does MoM ensure their employment while maintaining the expected levels of Omanization?</h4><p>MoM continues with the development of the mechanism of Omanization and replacement programs in light of the development of the labor market in the Sultanate through the work of Omanization sector committees, which endeavor to provide employment opportunities in private establishments to employ Omanis. A total of 12 sector committees led by officials from the private sector in the construction, oil and gas, selling and distribution, industry and mining, automobile, electricity, financial brokerage and banking, transport and telecommunications, education, health, and agriculture and fisheries sectors work in this respect. The task of these committees is to draft general policies in light of the development of the labor market, training, and employment to achieve Omanization targets and meet the private sector's requirements for manpower with its various levels, skills, and specializations. They also submit proposals for the re-structuring of the sector committees to be chaired by specialists from the private sector and with the membership of the three production parties: the government, employers, and employees.</p><h4>What is the current state of the Labor Law, and how will it help bolster the Omani economy?</h4><p>The Labor Law has reached an advanced stage, and the amendment of this law takes into consideration the current labor market and expected future changes. Work on the amendment of law is underway through a partnership and dialog between the various production parties. MoM extends remarkable efforts to develop the services offered by its labor, technological, and vocational education sectors with the aim of developing our human resources. They are the cornerstone of economic development in the country due to their vital role in supporting the national economy and continued growth to realize the future visions of the Omani economy. Our people are key components of Oman's aspirations to build a modern economy based on knowledge and increase production by investing in its people and utilizing their potential and capabilities to contribute to sustainable development.</p><h4>What new processes are being introduced to offer the private sector easier, faster, and more transparent means of hiring personnel?</h4><p>MoM coordinates with the private sector and endeavors to meet its actual requirements for manpower. The ministry's electronic services package was meant to ensure the shift to e-government and facilitate the provision of services offered to private sector establishments, national workforce, and all beneficiaries of the ministry's services. The new services include: electronic licensing and nomination, salaries' protection system, “We work" application, and the employment contracts signing service. Such electronic services have reduced paperwork and enabled beneficiaries of the ministry's services to finalize about 85% of services. The electronic services have varied and are being developed according to the latest internationally applied technologies, resulting in the development and streamlining of employment in the private sector.</p><h4>What steps are being taken between the MoM and the private sector to ensure that Omani workers are sufficiently skilled?</h4><p>The ministry has worked with the private sector in drafting policies and projects aimed at developing human resources, striking a balance in the labor market and ensuring its stability, and linking education and vocational training with the labor market to further contribute to economic development. The curricula and specializations of the technological vocational training have been drafted in coordination with the private sector. The ministry has spared no effort to introduce several initiatives with the private sector to provide thousands of employment opportunities for job seekers and ensure the stability of local workers in their jobs. Thus, it has worked toward linking the outcome of technological education with the labor market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the ministry's main milestones for 2017 and major plans for 2018?</h4><p>The ministry will continue expanding its Invest Easy platform in order to facilitate trade and investment. We hope to sustain at least 2.5% GDP growth for 2017 and 2018. We continue to work with other government agencies in order to ease doing business in Oman. This is crucial under the circumstances of falling oil prices and increased costs of manufacturing. Energy efficiency is another aspect that the ministry watches closely. From January 2017, it was important for the government to introduce cost-reflective tariffs for electricity, primarily to large manufacturers and service providers. The ministry, therefore, has been promoting the use of solar energy in industrial estates. In fact, increased electricity tariffs on midday during summer would open a range of investment opportunities. Businesses can consider energy mix alternatives as well as better utilization of the off-peak lower tariffs. Another area the ministry promotes is expanding the use of private sector finance for infrastructure projects that the government traditionally funded. In 2018, we will see more private financing in industrial estates. In fact, we inked in 2017 a OMR50 million (USD129.88 million) project to finance the expansion of the Establishment of Industrial Estates. Such a shift to private finance will continue in the coming years in order to reduce the over-reliance on government funding for industrial estate expansions. Also, as an outcome of Tanfeedh program, the ministry is now promoting the introduction of REITs. Such funds—once listed on the Muscat Stock Exchange—can become another tool for financing buildings, roads, and utility networks. Finally, the ministry is engaging with the promotion of industrial innovation. The government already provided the fund for the expansion of the Center for Industrial Innovation at Rusayl Industrial Estate and the establishment of the Innovation Factory at Knowledge Oasis Muscat. The ministry is also partnering with Sohar University to establish an industrial design center at the university. Oman is thus becoming a more outward-looking country, welcoming foreign investment. This puts pressure on easing the regulation for foreign investment, which is why we are rethinking our FDI law to make it more attractive.</p><h4>What is the current state of Oman's import and export relationships?<br></h4><p>There was a drop in our export and import values due to low oil prices, especially in 2016. However, our imports and exports were steady in 2017, especially to and from the Arab world, and we benefit from the Arab Agreement. Similarly, for the GCC, most of our imports and exports are steady; we still use many materials produced in the GCC for our industrial purposes. We also see more direct trade with Iran. Traditionally, our relationships were built on third parties; however, in the last three years we have seen more direct imports and exports. At the same time, there was significant growth in trade with Iran from USD560 million to nearly USD1 billion, which is expected to have grown further in 2017. Our business community is now paying greater attention to Africa and Asia, and we have been part of successful export promotion trips to Africa, focusing on Ethiopia and Tanzania.</p><h4>Where will the ministry see the most development in Oman in 2018?</h4><p>We will see a shift in Oman in the housing sector, and there will be a growing segment in affordable housing. The new generation will rent or lease their houses or flats rather than build their own. There is great competition for affordable housing, as approximately 30 companies are competing for South Batina's first affordable housing project. We are preparing ourselves for the next five-year plan, where government funding for houses will change as government housing loans will be mainly channeled through the Oman Housing Bank. Houses will be built by private companies instead of the Ministry of Housing, while government assistance will be in the form of reduced interest rates for those in need. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which fields are Jordan and Oman keen to boost relations in, and what economic impact will they have on both nations?</h4><p>The meeting of His Majesty Kind Abdullah II with Sultan Qaboos of Oman in May 2017 emphasized the deep and historically rooted relations between Jordan and Oman. It reflected the keenness of leaders in both countries to develop and enhance these relations in different fields, mainly in augmenting economic and industrial cooperation and increasing the volume and diversification of trade exchange, through enhancing and encouraging further cooperation between the private sectors in both countries, participating in exhibitions, and holding B2B activities as well as exchanging expertise on issues of mutual interest. Other activities include signing an agreement on mutual administrative cooperation in customs affairs and trade facilitation, including the possibility of establishing electronic networking between the customs departments of both nations. Moreover, Oman has agreed to facilitate the movement of Jordanian vendors and businessmen by granting them multi-entry visas to Oman. There will also be greater cooperation in the field of investment, by identifying investment opportunities available in both countries and facilitating the establishment of joint ventures, as well as in the academic field, as it is of a great interest to both countries being a basic pillar for the sustainable development. Both countries also discussed cooperation in the private generation projects for electricity and renewable energy projects. Jordan also will continue to import Omani crude oil, which constitutes 42% of the Kingdom's total imports from Oman.</p><h4>What measures are being taken by both countries to achieve solutions to regional crises?</h4><p>Situated in the heart of the troubled Middle East, which is suffering from the ongoing crises in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and the recent developments with Qatar, both countries have been consistent in seeking to resolve the escalating situation through diplomatic channels with an aim to put an end to the aggravating regional geopolitical instability. As a result of the ongoing regional crises, both countries have suffered economically, though each on a different scale. Despite these increasing challenges, both countries have maintained a positive attitude while looking into ways of easing the negative impact on their economies and populations.</p><h4>What advice can Jordan give Oman as it prepares to widely diversify its economy in the coming years?</h4><p>The government of Jordan, under the visionary leadership of HM King Abdullah II, has been working for over two decades on increasing the base of its economic activities, all of which have the aim to increase its resilience and reduce its vulnerability to external factors. The success of Jordan's economic diversification was based on its ability to establish strong economic institutions capable of overseeing this process, which required institutional regulatory reform and workforce development initiatives. Policies directed at the manufacturing sector sought to encourage the sophistication of their products with the aim of increasing export revenues and boosting their product competitiveness abroad. As for the services sector, which is one of the main contributors to the Jordanian economy, increased attention was given to the logistics, tourism, banking, health, and information technologies sectors by enhancing the level of education and professionalism of the workers in these sectors as well as driving policies for their growth. Moreover, diversification was strengthened through the enactment of the decentralization law that aspires to set Jordan's economic, social, and political policies on the right track toward inclusion, wealth distribution, growth, and prosperity. Jordan commends the efforts already initiated by Oman to diversify its economy. The Sultanate is on the right path with Tanfeedh as part of the country's ninth Five-Year Development Plan (2016-2020). The program brought together representatives of the public and private sectors, academia, and civil society to coordinate activities and identify the targeted sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are Oman and Estonia working together when it comes to pioneering digital solutions for better respective governance?</h4><p>Estonia and Oman have a longstanding and well-developed level of cooperation when it comes to e-government and ICT, first and foremost in creating and implementing e-solutions. It is gratifying to see how this collaboration has evolved over the last few years, and it is our hope that Estonian companies will also be involved in several ICT projects in Oman in the future. After all, Oman has achieved remarkable progress in ICT together with its Estonian partners. Estonia is well known as a highly digital society. Wider use of digital solutions creates economic growth and thereby increases the wellbeing of the population; it saves both money and time. Digitalization will lead to tremendous opportunities not only in Estonia and the EU in coming decades, but everywhere in the world.</p><h4>Oman and Estonia have both ranked in the top five in global cybersecurity. What can be achieved by collaboration on this front?</h4><p>In order to seize these opportunities for our people and companies, we first have to ensure trust and security for a digital society. Cybersecurity is crucial for both prosperity and security—security must come first. Malicious cyber activities not only threaten economies, but also the very functioning of our democracies and freedoms. As the internet knows no state borders, no single state can fight cybercrime and the terrorist use of cyberspace alone. It is a global challenge, especially as we enter the age of the IoT, in which connected devices will provide many millions more access points that hackers can target to launch cyber-attacks or plant malware. We have to address this together globally. Cybersecurity in many cases is a matter of procedures in addition to technical capabilities. Oman has been implementing many advanced information systems and cloud-based approaches. It is good to see that Oman, as a major trade hub in the Middle East, is making the best use of ICT to boost its own capabilities. Oman and Estonia together could be pathfinders or role models in cybersecurity solutions for other countries and cooperation partners in Asia and Africa.</p><h4>In which sectors are Estonian companies and individuals most active in Oman, and vice versa?</h4><p>Estonian companies have participated in a number of defense industry fairs in Gulf countries—International Defence Exhibition &amp; Conference (IDEX) and Unmanned Systems Exhibition and Conference (UMEX), to name a couple—and plan to visit the Gulfood fair in the near future as these are the economic spheres where Estonian companies are most successful and competitive, in addition to ICT. One incentive for Omani entrepreneurs to look toward Estonia, and which could boost our trade relations, is definitely our e-Residency program. We offer a secure digital identity to foreigners to run a company from their country of origin. We launched e-Residency on December 1, 2014, which 22,000 people from 140 countries have already applied for. E-Residents have established over 2,000 new companies in Estonia, and 2,500 companies are owned by e-Residents.</p><h4>What other areas of significant focus are there for bilateral relations between Estonia and Oman moving forward?</h4><p>As mentioned, Estonia and Oman enjoy good collaboration in ICT, but now are looking to widen that scope and investigate possibilities in design and cosmetics. There has also been interest for closer trade relations in exports and imports of food products, medical equipment, construction materials, and so on. Tourism, as well as cultural exchange more broadly, are widely unexplored industries that could offer up exciting opportunities for mutual engagement. There is work in progress with several agreements in order to enhance the bilateral relations of Estonia and Oman, and the honorary consuls in both countries could contribute to strengthening relations beyond the fruitful relationship we share today. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The National Program for Enhancing Economic Diversification, better known as Tanfeedh, was proposed in 2016 and has come to be the catalyst of all the Sultanate's efforts to diversify the economy and reduce dependency on oil exports during a challenging point in history. Tanfeedh is a core element of Oman's Ninth Five-Year Development Plan 2016-2020 and includes recommendations from the public and private sectors, as well as individual citizens.</p><p>Tanfeedh has raised hopes as new sectors begin to flourish. New companies—large corporations and SMEs—are setting up shop in Oman, international investors and FDI are flowing into the country, and tourist and expatriate numbers are at an all-time high. Tanfeedh is currently beginning implementation of Phase I, which will focus on the manufacturing, logistics, tourism, finance, and employment branches of the plan. This will be the first step of many that will help assure that the Omani economy is diversified and that dependency on crude oil is slowly reduced.</p><p>Duqm, a small fishing community of 10,000 fishermen, is being transformed into a world-class logistics hub that will pave the way for other sectors such as mixed industry, petrochemicals, renewable energy sources, and tourism. Projects to highlight in Duqm include Oman Wanfang's USD10-billion Sino-Oman Industrial City, the Chinese USD94-million, 1,000-MW solar panel project, and the Duqm Refinery, a USD7-billion JV between Kuwait Petroleum International and Oman Oil Company.</p><p>On opposite sides of the map, Sohar and Salalah continue to expand, bringing new opportunities and business to the special economic free zones available in each city. The Oman Rail Network, which is expected to transport goods and passengers, will bridge cities throughout the country while connecting mining operations with the most prominent ports. Furthermore, projects such as Orpic's steam cracker project in Sohar, and the Liwa Plastics Industries Complex, are looking to integrate new infrastructure to maximize efficiency and profit margins.</p><p>The Sultanate's special focus on food security, for example, has led the fisheries segment to grow by 11%, while many other countries in the world are growing at about 2-3%. Parallel to fisheries, three main food security projects are expected to come online in the next two years; the Oman Food Investment Holding Company will focus its strategy on developing self-sufficient poultry, red meat, and dairy plants through Al Namma Poultry Company, Al Bashayer Meat Company, and Mazoon Dairy Company, respectively. Combined, a total investment of OMR237 million (USD613 million) is expected for these projects. In addition, a special initiative to make manufacturing an attractive sector of the economy has seen a surge of both local and international companies manufacturing locally instead of transferring their operations abroad. In this sense, in-country value continues to grow.</p><p>The new Muscat International Airport terminal is also expected to be completed in 2018, a 580,000-sqm facility expected to handle 12 million passengers per annum. Also, the new Salalah International Airport will be able to handle 1 million passengers per annum. These two airports will be the gateways for foreigners coming into Oman and will help increase the Sultanate's tourism capacity.<br></p><p>Tanfeedh is off to a great start; however, continued investment and efforts will be required to follow through on long-lasting economic diversification, a goal to which Oman is showing real commitment thus far. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your experience here since you entered the market?</h4><p>We entered the Indonesian market by acquiring two existing concessions. One is Sokoria, a 30MW project with a power purchase agreement (PPA) in Flores, and the other is Sorik Marapi, a 240MW project with a PPA located in North Sumatra. At Sorik Marapi, we completed the acquisition process in August 2016 and started drilling almost immediately, finishing exploration in July 2017. That was a record: finishing exploration in that amount of time. We knew it was a great location and the project has an excellent PPA. Comparatively, we are ahead of the game here. During the exploration period, we had two rigs drilling simultaneously; something that I believe no one has done before in Indonesia.</p><h4>ORKA has effectively pioneered an entirely different model of geothermal exploration. What is different?</h4><p>One of the reasons we are different is because we have a fundamentally different business model. The traditional model is based on a conventional power plant project finance model, where preliminary surveys are done first. Then the traditional approach is to target the first well where center of the heat sources is. After that traditionally companies start looking for the boundaries of the resource. The idea here is that exploration is focused on determining the size of the resource. Once that is determined, the rest of the project is planned, including the power plant. The assumption is that bigger is better. The problem is that it is difficult to get financing for exploration drilling from banks so generally exploration is done using all equity. Banks then require between 30% and 50% of “steam under wellhead“ before they are willing to lend to the project. So for example, for a 100MW project, banks would require 50MW of steam already be drilled. Traditional project financing would then cover the rest of the project, from drilling to power plants. The problem is that it takes a long time to get all this completed before a power plant can be built. It is bad economics and risky, not to mention time consuming. We do not do this; instead, we follow an incremental development model. Our surface exploration is the same: we attempt to identify the center of the heat source but once we do we do not start looking for the boundaries. If we are successful with the initial wells, we continue to drill in the same location. We also use smaller modular units called wellhead units. For us exploration wells are production wells. We do not drill wells as a science project; we want commercially viable wells from day one. Because we use wellhead units, whatever steam we get we can use, which cannot be done with conventional units. Once we find the resource, we develop it in that location; we put a power plant on it and get it operational. Then, we revise our resource model and follow the resource, and then do it all over again. We have our own proprietary power plant technology, which gives us the flexibility to customize our units and the ability to use more of the energy we find. We have very few if any wasted wells and we can develop projects much faster. We are two years ahead of schedule at Sorik Marapi, and we are asking to deliver power early, not later—this has never happened before here in Indonesia.</p><h4>What is the status of your two projects?</h4><p>Sorik Marapi already has 14 wells finished, and we are already installing the first power plant on one well pad. We are on track to be the geothermal project with the fastest commercial operation date (COD) in Indonesia; it is scheduled to start generating power in March or April. These are smaller units. The first unit will be 15MW and the second 20MW. With Sokoria, we have already completed exploration and are currently working on drilling the third well. We have not tested the wells yet, and when we do so we will reevaluate our model if necessary and then start designing the power plants. Our financing for both projects all comes from China. We have not done traditional project financing on either project; it is financing at the project level mixed with corporate financing. The idea is that once the units are operational, we will project finance the units and recycle the capital. Our Chinese partner, Kaishan, provides all the power plant equipment, which also gives us more flexibility and the ability to move faster, as well as to provide excellent pricing. The equipment is mostly manufactured in a factory then boxed and shipped here, where it is then reassembled and commissioned. Such delivery is becoming more common because we can control quality and cost, and it is much faster. This is far better than building bespoke onsite.</p><h4>What do you have in store for future projects?</h4><p>Since we acquired these two projects, there has been a significant change in the regulatory regime that has had a negative impact on the attractiveness of projects here as a whole. Broadly speaking, there are three areas that are now of concern. One is regarding procedures, where the new regulations stipulate that PPA negotiations cannot start until exploration is finished. Exploration requires USD10-30 million. The government is effectively asking investors to invest that much money without any idea of what the price or quantity will be, let alone the terms of the PPA. Many investors simply cannot take that kind of risk. Additionally, what makes it more worrying is that state-owned electricity company PLN has announced its desire to become a major geothermal generator, which means it is a competitor as well as monopoly offtaker. AsPLN is also interested in acquiring geothermal concessions, there is now a conflict of interest. There seems to be no acknowledgement of that conflict of interest, which is worrying. The second issue is pricing. The new pricing system sets a ceiling on the price based on PLN's average generation cost. This places geothermal in competition with large coal plants. The simple fact is that in some locations this makes geothermal not viable. The practical ramifications are that it is now difficult to build geothermal projects in certain locations due to the price. The other part of the price aspect is the uncertainty. It is one thing to have a set price for a certain location, then at least there would be a clear standard. Unfortunately now there is only a maximum price. Thus, even if we think a project will work at the maximum price, there is no guarantee that we will actually get that price. The third issue is the actual terms of the PPA. There are new regulations change a number of issues that PLN did not like with the prior generations of PPAs. These aspects have stayed in the PPAs all these years primarily to keep the PPAs financeable, in terms of both equity and debt. A number of the changes are simply not financeable; banks will not lend money to PPAs with those terms. If certain provisions are not changed, these PPAs will not be financed and thus, the projects will not be built. As far as I am aware, no new geothermal PPAs have been signed since the new regulations.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>Our main objective is to double the size of our portfolio, in terms of megawatts under development. Currently we have 270MW, and we want to more than double that by the end of the year. Some of the new projects will be earlier stage projects, such as our new project in North Sumatra near Lake Toba. We also expect to acquire at least one later stage project. We continue to look at new preliminary survey areas. We are putting our money where our mouth is and we expect the government in turn will be cooperative and figure out a way to make these new regulations work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Saudi Arabian industry compare from a regional and international perspective, in terms of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issuances?</h4><p>Since its establishment over 45 years ago, SASO has played a major role in adapting international standards, to act as the national standards body serving the industry and the ministries. As part of ISO, we believe that as part of the international community we must come up with and adopt international standards. Since 2006, we have driven a great shift in terms of the number of standards adopted. We started with a strategic mandate to adopt more international standards, and today we have more than 25,000 standards, with more than 70% of them international. We will continue with that because we believe it will increase our exports and keep our products competitive. It will also ease the process of importing and exporting goods to and from the Kingdom, as well as improve the quality of the products that are coming to our market. There is a great statement that we use in ISO, which is “one standard, one test, one conformity assessment procedure“ so that we do not repeat steps. To understand this aspect of industry, we harmonize international standards with our climate and make sure it conforms with our laws. We recognize that, if you do not follow international standards, you are isolated from the global market. That is why we participate in ISO communities and do our best to benefit from the ISO standards and adopt them, as well as other international standards such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). There is one more aspect that is representing the Kingdom with ISO standards, and that is that there are many ISO standards that target administrative management systems, such as ISO 9001, ISO 27000, and ISO 17000. Each group of standards is targeting a certain group of services. Adopting these standards is not the end of the story; we have to implement and motivate other organizations to adopt them as well. Adherence to these processes allows them to improve their business management. Based on that, there is a certification process that goes along with the implementation of each standard. We do our best to accredit the certification bodies. SASO is a special certification body because we are responsible for many functions that some other similar bodies internationally are not responsible for. We are responsible for the development and adaptation of international standards, but we are also responsible for accreditation and metrology in the Kingdom. Operating the National Metrology Center is an important function for us here and within the world of standardization. As well, we are responsible for conformity assessment procedures, as well as stimulating a culture of quality in the Kingdom. The combination of these roles together is fairly difficult. I hope that the by participating in the ISO Council, we will have an opportunity to represent the region and the Arab world, as well as to present our concerns related to standardization and improving the quality of life in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do you envision collaboration among other GCC nations in terms of standardization regionally?</h4><p>SASO is the oldest standardization body in the region and took the lead in establishing the GCC Standardization Organization (GSO) in 1981, hosting GSO within SASO for the first 15 years. We need to harmonize the standards across the country and the region. More than 70% of the GSO standards were originally adopted by SASO. We will continue playing that role because we believe that we have a responsibility to our neighbors to improve Gulf standards and lead the region toward adopting international standards and improving the quality of products and services in this region. We have continuous and very strong partnerships with GSO to make sure that our directions are aligned. One very important area in that regard is the Gulf building code, which is based on the Saudi building code, for which I head the committee. We have to share whatever progress we have made with our neighbors in order to reach better and quicker results in terms of improving different types of standards.</p><h4>SASO issues the King Abdulaziz Quality Award (KAQA), which recognizes quality and productivity. Looking at recent trends, which sectors or industries have you identified as being most eligible for this prize?</h4><p>We consider KAQA a stimulator to help companies adopt quality standards and improve the excellence of their optimizations. In the past, we used to only have four categories: production industries, small-medium and large, and service industries, small-medium and large. In 2017, we included three more sectors: private education, healthcare, and higher education. This year, we will continue with these seven sectors and also add quality and excellence in the government sector and NGOs sector. In the government sector, we will target healthcare and education, specifically higher education institutes and large hospitals. 2018, as the fourth edition, also marks the first time we are including NGOs. We want to enable different entities to compete. Through that, we are covering all of the different sectors in the Kingdom, and we will continue improving the criteria for selection, as well as the marketing of the KAQA award as an economic stimuli. In the third edition, almost 50 organizations competed. After that, we launched a survey to alert any other interested parties that they can register, and now we have more than 270 organizations signed up. That means we have gained better exposure, and that is one of our strategic directives going forward as a national entity.</p><h4>What ambitions have you set to translate the Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 agenda into a SASO agenda?</h4><p>We have to understand the role of standards, the same as any country. We consider ourselves a technical enabler for economic and social growth. Based on that, we have reviewed the Saudi Arabian national quality infrastructure, and we are focusing more on different components of that, whether it is through standards, accreditation, conformity assessment, regulations, post-marketing surveillance, or metrology. It also involves issuing the goods conformity index, which we have started as part of the Vision 2030 initiatives. Having that solid and strong base for our national quality infrastructure, and improving every aspect of it, definitely will give us the opportunity to improve our service and make a big impact on the economy. We also have two strategic initiatives within some of the subcategories of Vision 2030; one of them is the “goods saved“ initiative, where we focus on reviewing the framework for conformity assessment of goods that are produced here or imported from abroad. Through our review of the regulatory framework, and we have achieved a better system that is risk based, focusing more on high-risk products and making sure that they are monitored carefully. Changing the regulatory framework will help us focus more and improve the quality of products that are available on our markets. Another initiative within the transformation program centers on legal metrology, which means the improvement of gasoline pumps, electrical meters, scales, and water meters.This transformation will translate into fairer trade and protection of consumer rights without harming traders. In addition to that, we are participating in the national program for the development of industry and logistics infrastructure. We will not be able to diversify our industry and make it more competitive unless we adapt a good standard, which is a international standard. By implementing that in our industry, it will improve the quality of the products and give them a more competitive advantage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[andy-holmes-vice-president-starbucks-mena]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the scale of Starbucks' operations in Saudi Arabia today?</h4><p>Since our entry into the market in 2000, Starbucks has grown rapidly and has become the market leader in coffee. We have introduced a new culture of coffee to Saudi youths. Today, we have over 140 stores in locations across the country, of which 50 are located in shopping malls, 63 are spread across the city's prime locations, 10 are exclusive drive-through outlets, five are set within hospitals, eight are in the most popular travel destinations, and four are located in well-known educational institutions. Our growth is accelerating, powered by the strong support of Alshaya International Trading and the demand from young Saudis for great coffee in a welcoming environment.</p><h4>What does it mean for a company to have a 'social impact agenda?</h4><p>For more than 40 years, Starbucks has built its business with a social conscience and proven that doing what is right makes great business sense. We were one of the first major companies to introduce Café Practices, which ensures that Starbucks sources sustainably grown and processed coffee by evaluating the economic, social, and environmental impact of coffee production. We have extended this approach into our neighborhoods, stores, and partner relationships, sharing a responsibility to give back to the communities we work with and serve.</p><h4>How does Starbucks' social impact agenda play out in Saudi Arabia today?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is undergoing a fundamental transformation in its social and economic structure. More than 60% of the population is under 30, and the jobs and economy of tomorrow will be substantially different from what we see today. Vision 2030 and the NTP2020 are deeply rooted in this transformation. Starbucks has identified key areas where our own agenda aligns with the long-term plans of the Kingdom. Achieving the ambitious goals laid out in the Vision 2030 will require widespread collaboration in workforce entry education, service sector training, basic leadership and management skills, as well as changing the mindset regarding service sector employment.</p><h4>Vision 2030 strives for localization and the creation of meaningful employment for Saudis. Could you tell us more about your initiatives in this regard?</h4><p>Fundamentally, our brand and our social impact agenda are inseparable. When we say we must hire over 400 Saudi youths in the coming period and transform the face of our business, this is not just about social impact—it is business critical. The economy of tomorrow will be powered by the service sector, and if we are to be a part of it, we need to start now by empowering youth through employment, training, and career-oriented growth. By 2020, Starbucks aims to localize 35% of our workforce and accelerate training of Saudi partners at all levels. Our success will be measured not simply in the cups of coffee we pour, but in the areas of hiring and retention, when we show our partners a path toward a career, or in the ways that we recognize and reward young partners for their contribution. We are training and preparing Saudi youth for the economy and the jobs of tomorrow. This is a great challenge and responsibility.</p><h4>What are some examples of the programs that you are working on currently?</h4><p>Starbucks is excited to take up the challenge of youth employment and make it a core part of our business mission. We have launched a number of programs aimed at youth in Saudi Arabia, each focused on accelerating workforce training, empowering the youth to take leadership roles in the service industry, and transforming the way they enter their first jobs out of university or high school. These include our quarterly Opportunity Café program, which is designed to teach employable soft skills to interested youth. In the coming months, programs with Education for Employment (EFE), some major national universities, and a social media campaign and microsite will all come together to offer Saudi youth a new vision for employment and opportunity in a new and opening Saudi economy. The best outcome for us will be more Saudi youth recognizing service jobs as real training opportunities, stepping stones, and paths toward long-term career fulfillment.</p><h4>What is your vision on women empowerment and enabling greater participation in the workplace for them in Starbucks Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Wherever we are in the world, Starbucks is committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming work environment. In Saudi Arabia today, that also means women; in fact, they are among some of our most enthusiastic training participants and committed Saudi workforce. Starbucks currently operates seven stores across Saudi Arabia—four in PNU and one each in Riyadh Office, Business Gate, and the British School in Riyadh—that are operated by immensely talented female partners developed through both the Starbucks and Al Shaya Retail Academies. Meaningful employment is a powerful tool for women to become partners in the economy and society, and we are delighted with the progress of our current initiatives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[PPA’s investments diversified globally]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[he-mohammed-bin-talal-al-nahas-governor-public-pension-authority]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the PPA participate in the sweeping changes in the country?</h4><p>PPA participates by aligning itself with the different strategic objectives, targets, outcome-oriented initiatives, and commitments achievable through public-private partnership (PPP) efforts currently underway. PPA will take advantage of deal access and priority privileges to participate in the different investment opportunities arising from the privatization efforts of previously government-owned assets and services. To further enhance our ability and readiness to take advantage of new opportunities, PPA has also invested in strengthening its internal institutional and human capabilities as well as studying new best international models and practices for pension funds' investments.</p><h4>How have recent economic and budgetary changes affected PPA's returns, and how has it changed its management to reflect this new era?</h4><p>Undoubtedly, the recent economic environment has impacted the performance of our pension portfolio; however, PPA's investments are well diversified across asset classes globally, thereby offsetting to some extent the impact of underperformance of our local market on the overall portfolio. This strategy will continue in exploring new investment opportunities coupled with developing a stronger risk management function.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has made extensive commitments to green energy. How might the PPA participate in this aspect of the country's development?</h4><p>PPA has already demonstrated its support of initiative in this sector through investment in ACWA Power, a unit of ACWA Holding Company, and we will remain open to investment opportunities that emerge in the renewable energy space.</p><h4>There is a shift in the country from the public sector providing much of the capital for major projects to the private sector playing a leading role. How will this change the PPA's investment strategy? Will you seek international and local partners for investments in a different way?</h4><p>Vision 2030 strongly promotes private sector involvement in both old and new sectors and provides myriad opportunities spanning social and community-related projects—such as housing, health clubs, and public facilities—and the education, healthcare, municipal services, tourism, energy, environmental, industrial and manufacturing, oil and gas, technology, and transportation sectors. PPA will continue to view and evaluate investment opportunities both from a micro and a macro perspective by taking advantage of local and international investment opportunities identified through our research that fall within the constructs of PPA's strategic investment objectives.</p><h4>There are reports that the King Abdullah Financial District may be sold to the Public Investment Fund (PIF) in the medium term. What is the future of that project, and does real estate remain a sector of focus for PPA?</h4><p>King Abdullah Financial District is still under negotiation, and hence we cannot really expand on that comment. However, we have other real estate projects, such as the 7,345-unit development in Jeddah and Digital City in Riyadh. Real estate is an important part of an efficient investment portfolio and therefore we will continue to have an allocation to it as long as valuations are attractive.</p><h4>Although pension funds have performed well locally, they are still an emerging industry when compared to capital per capita and percentage of GDP measures for countries such as the UK. What changes are key to spurring growth in the sector?</h4><p>Growth in the sector is mainly a function of the size of the participants within each pension scheme, changes in demographic profile of the contributors and pensioners, and the scheme structure. It also depends on the ability of the scheme to adapt to various local ambitious development plans and global economic developments, and manage its investment portfolio suitably.</p><h4>What are you plans and expectations for the year ahead, as well as your most immediate priorities in that timeframe?</h4><p>Our immediate priority is to implement our goal of creating a new asset management company that will run leaner, and be more focused on becoming a trusted leader in investments, and to deliver the services needed by our contributors and pensioners though various channels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[ADNOC Distribution 10% listed on the ADX in 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-sultan-al-jaber-ceo-adnoc-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With USD851 million raised, ADNOC Distribution's listing became the biggest IPO on the ADX. What does raising capital mean for Abu Dhabi's economic environment as it progresses towards Vision 2030?</h4><p>The 10% listing of ADNOC Distribution at the end of 2017 was the largest in Abu Dhabi in over 10 years, and the first public listing of an ADNOC company. It represents a tangible step in the execution of our new value creation strategy and demonstrates a clear example of the more proactive management of our portfolio of assets and capital. We have a very solid, focused, long-term business and growth strategy for ADNOC Distribution, executed by a highly experienced management team, which we believe will deliver long-term, sustainable growth and value creation for the company, for the benefit of all shareholders, as well as the wider UAE economy and, of course, our customers. The IPO represented a further step forward in the diversification, growth and development of the UAE's capital markets and specifically the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, attracting significant demand from both local and world-class international investors, and adding to the profile and liquidity of the exchange in a considerable way. The listing of companies like ADNOC Distribution are important events, as they bring new, large companies to the exchange and help diversify the investment sector offering to investors. The IPO attracted significant foreign direct investment into the UAE, with good take up from leading international institutional investors. It was multiple times oversubscribed on the qualified investor tranche, and the original size of the retail tranche was oversubscribed by 22 times. On the first day of trading, the stock rose as much as 16 per cent and continues to trade well since its float.</p><h4>The Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) recently approved ADNOC's plans to pursue international downstream investments for the first time in the company's history. What was the driver behind this decision and where do you see the greatest opportunities in both refining and petrochemicals?</h4><p>Our upstream will always remain a fundamental and core part of our business, but you are correct, as part of our 2030 strategy, it is a strategic priority for us to significantly expand our petrochemical production to meet the growing demand for higher-margin products, such as polyolefins which is set to grow 150% by 2040. We intend to double our refining capacity and triple petrochemicals production capacity to 14.4 million tonnes by 2025, up from 4.5 million in 2016, while adding new products, including Aromatics and Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB) to our mix. And as a tangible demonstration of our strategic intent to grow our downstream business, approximately 40% of the $109-billion-dollar five-year capex program, that was approved by the SPC and announced in November, is dedicated to achieving this very important objective. Through a new and ambitious domestic and international investment strategy, aimed at taking advantage of the demand emanating from global growth markets, ADNOC will become a leading global downstream player. This will be achieved by building on our already strong foundation in Ruwais, which we will expand to become the largest integrated refining and chemical site in the world. From this site we will refine nearly half of our crude and convert 20 per cent of that portion to chemicals and petrochemicals, which will offer a hedge to oil price fluctuations, while allowing us to meet growing global demand for higher value products. Our expansion plans for Ruwais are on a world scale, will contribute to the diversification of the UAE's economy and will also create thousands of jobs. We see great potential for overseas investment and expansion in Asia, where we are strengthening strategic relations. We recently signed the first concession agreement between the UAE and India, awarding a consortium of Indian oil companies a 10% interest in Abu Dhabi's offshore Lower Zakum concession. This mutually beneficial partnership will help India meet its growing demand for energy and refined products, create opportunities for ADNOC to increase its market share in a key growth market, and build a solid foundation as ADNOC explores potential international investments, particularly focused on downstream opportunities. We see growth throughout Asia. Since 2010, we have achieved a four-fold increase of sales volume into the region. We are therefore increasing our commitment to China to allow us to be even closer to our Chinese and Asia region customers, and to develop our relationships with our Chinese and Asian partners further, which will only bring about benefits to both sides. We are confident that our transformative value creation strategy will create a balanced and highly integrated Upstream and Downstream portfolio to secure ADNOC's long term and sustainable future for years to come.</p><h4>Aside from Borouge 4, ADNOC holds strategic co-operations with Spain's Cepsa, BP, and with Germany's Linde through its Elixier JV. How does your new partnership model reflect the evolution of the challenges and opportunities in the oil &amp; gas industry?</h4><p>The global energy industry and market dynamic is changing at a rapid pace. Global demand for energy continues to grow — forecasts suggest by at least 25 per cent by 2040 — and this demand is shifting from West to East, with non-OECD countries expected to account for more than 70% of the world's demand within this timeframe, and, as I have mentioned, petrochemical demand will grow even more sharply, at more than 150% over the same period. Over the last two years we have taken a bold and ambitious dual track approach in our response to the evolving energy landscape that has helped ensure we are increasingly more resilient to market volatility and well positioned to capitalize on emerging and future growth trends. This dual track approach comprises a rationalization and culture transformation program aimed at: maximizing operational efficiency, optimizing our unit costs per barrel, enhancing profitability, and strengthening our overall performance. In parallel, we have launched a bold, new finance, investment and partnership strategy, which will greatly enhance our capital structure and returns, unlock and maximize value, accelerate our growth and performance, and secure new market opportunities. And we are of course seeking partners who can help us secure better access to our key target markets and customers, but we are also looking for partners to bring access to financing, business and operational expertise and knowledge, and technological innovation — all vital factors in ensuring we can create long term, sustainable and mutually beneficial partnerships. In the upstream we are exploring the creation of new partnership and co-investment opportunities in some of our services businesses, while at the same time looking for value-add companies that may also seek to partner or invest alongside us in other parts of our value chain. We are also developing innovative investment structures and ventures for further selected ADNOC infrastructure assets that we think might be attractive to both investors and business partners and that will provide compelling investments and returns. In our downstream business, where as I said we are looking to significantly expand our business and capability, we are also looking to create a number of new business and investment opportunities with long-term partners to help us drive growth, efficiency and knowledge transfer to generate greater returns from our assets, while also allowing us to develop and launch a number of new downstream business and product lines. The expansion of our downstream business will create a number of exciting new partnership opportunities in the years ahead.</p><h4>How can the oil and gas industry remain ahead of the technological innovation curve—brought by big data, AI, and digitalization—and gain benefits across its whole value-chain? </h4><p>In a world that is being transformed by new technology, we are also very focused on attracting different type of partners, not necessarily from the oil and gas industry, who can bring innovation, ideas and the application of cutting edge technologies to our business. We have already seen artificial intelligence transforming industries as diverse as manufacturing, retail and finance, and this technology is now being applied to the energy sector, where the possible benefits include minimizing disruptions, reducing costs and optimizing performance. The application of predictive analytics, for example, has the potential to enhance electricity grids by instantly evaluating terabytes of information to anticipate demand peaks and system stress. At ADNOC, we are leveraging the power of Big Data to augment visibility into our operations both below and above ground. As part of our ongoing transformation, we are exploring how AI could help further improve efficiency, make us more agile and drive profitability. We are keen to study how breakthroughs from other sectors, such as mobile technology, might be applied to the energy industry and specifically to ADNOC to help us lower costs and increase efficiency and performance across our value chain.</p><h4>What is the strategy for the UAE to remain at the forefront of driving sustainability efforts across the world?</h4><p>We believe that renewables and hydrocarbons complement each other in a relationship that makes perfect economic sense. The UAE, through Masdar and other initiatives has been at the forefront of developing and globally promoting a truly sustainable diversified energy mix. Masdar is a key investor in the largest wind farm in the world, the London Array and around the world we have invested in one gigawatt of solar power in projects spanning the UAE, Oman, Jordan, Mauritania, Egypt, Morocco, the UK, Spain, Seychelles, and the Pacific Islands. This commitment will continue. In January, Masdar completed the financing for Jordan's largest solar project, Beynouna, which will add 200 megawatts of capacity to Jordan's electricity grid.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[jaroslav-gaisler-ceo-home-credit-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What made Indonesia such an attractive market, and what was it like building a presence in the country?</h4><p>Indonesia is a great opportunity for the consumer finance business. Home Credit Group was founded 25 years ago in the Czech Republic, and we have been expanding internationally ever since. Local banks tend to focus on certain socioeconomic groups and leave out a large majority of the citizenry. We want to bring in organized lending services for groups that are underrepresented. Our efforts began in Russia, and we subsequently expanded into Kazakhstan, Vietnam, and China. In 2012, we entered India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. We are treating Indonesia as an equal partner, clearly a subject of its development, not an object of our business.  Providing huge jobs opportunity must be here and supporting economy by creating multipliers effects. We sought to get a feel for how business is done in Indonesia and wanted to develop a winning formula for this opportunity-rich environment. We found a local partner in the area and opened shop. We partner with retailers across the country, placing our own employees in their stores and offering financing for major purchases. Once we develop a large-enough customer base, we begin cross selling other products based on our services and customers' needs. We have a suite of products that we can offer through our license. This is our point-of-sale distribution model. We are the largest point-of-sale (POS) player in the world and have nearly 400,000 locations across the 10 countries we operate in. Here in Indonesia, in January 2015, we had about 800 POS while today we have grown to almost 13,000 POS.</p><h4>What are your screening practices and how do you maintain credit repayment?</h4><p>Our system relies heavily on the tools that we have developed over the last 25 years in various countries. We take the strategies we learned and localize them. In India, over 70% of our core customer base had no experience with the formal lending sector. In Indonesia, it is around 40%; few people have previous experiences with such lending mechanisms. Consumer finance existed previously, though we bring to the market a different way of operating. Our competitors relied heavily on slow, burdensome physical channels, whereas we offer easy, centralized, and fast service. A large portion of our decision and assessment procedures are automated, and we currently make lending decisions within three minutes of receiving an application. We rely on the information the customers provide as well as a credit report provided by the government and other data sources. My goal is to continue to improve the speed, automation and detail of our underwriting. In Russia, we currently use an average of 57 sources for our underwriting and we seek to bring a similar level of detail to Indonesia.</p><h4>How do you finance your lending in Indonesia?</h4><p>We finance through a combination of our equity and local banks. When we started, we used mainly equity and support from our parent company plus one willing local bank and later started working with other local banks. Getting support from the first bank is always the hardest because we had no credit history; however, once we performed well with those debt obligations, other banks were eager to work with us. We are currently working with six local partners in our joint financing scheme. We also have international banks that are our partner banks across a variety of countries.</p><h4>Are there any specific product categories that have had an outsized impact on your growth?</h4><p>Phones have been the major factor; 70% of unit growth and close to 65% of finance volume have come from phones. Mobile phones are still the number-one source of growth in the marketplace. The expansion is due to the turnover in cellphone purchases—people buy new phones with great frequency.</p><h4>Will growing consumer confidence in 2018 change the makeup of your lending?</h4><p>It will. We introduced a mobile app in 2017 that will become a centerpiece of interaction between the company and our customers. We are currently building and introducing new features for our customers. In 2017, our volume tripled, though our productivity per shop improved only marginally. This means our growth came largely from increased distribution—we now have 24 city offices covering 85 cities. We are changing some of our processes to improve our productivity and introducing a number of new strategies into our portfolio. We expect to more than double growth in 2018. We plan to cover an additional 46 cities that are mostly tier-2 and tier-3 cities. By the end of 2018, we should cover 130 cities.</p><h4>What have you seen in terms of repayment and what is your typical interest rate?</h4><p>Due to the riskier nature of our clients, we have to charge slightly more; however, we are not out pricing ourselves from banks. In terms of acquisition, our rate starts at 0% for customers. A typical rate on a mobile phone for example would be 1.5-2.99% a month. The price depends on the channel, type of phone, and geographic location. We use a risked-based approach.</p><h4>What percentage of non-performing financing (NPF) have you seen in the last three years?</h4><p>We continue to improve every year, though not as fast as we would like. Our NPF fluctuates between 0.3-0.7%. We look mostly at vintage delinquencies and other risk indicators to give us a better understanding of our NPF, and these levels are normal for the type of state we operate in. We run our business such that our margin can sustain a 100% increase in our risk cost. As a group, we have been through a number of business cycles, allowing us to create a system that can withstand shocks. We need to have a sufficient cushion to handle unexpected events.</p><h4>What are your other expectations and what do you hope to achieve in 2018?</h4><p>We are mainly focused on profitability. We need to ensure that we have a business model that is flexible enough to compete with traditional players and emerging fintech. I welcome competition, though I worry about unregulated fintech because not all firms operating in that space are equal. Established players have an obligation to report to the debtors' databank, while unregulated players do not. For us, it is critical to ensure that we do not over debt the customers. We saw this in Russia and it was undesirable. We want to ensure we have excellent data about exactly how much money people have borrowed, so we can ensure that our operations remain stable. We also expect to double our lending levels and expand our partnerships with local banks. Our growth will come from cross-selling products to customers who have established excellent credit histories. These loans typically grow to four or five times the original loan amount, increasing our volume and extending the repayment period.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[nicole-reich-de-polignac-ceo-bnp-paribas-cardif]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your targets and expectations for the medium term?</h4><p>Insurance is a building business, particularly in our business model, which is a B2B2C model; therefore, we need to establish partnerships and build a future together with our partners. Since I joined in 2014, we have more than doubled the business size.</p><h4>How have recent technological innovations transformed the face of insurance in Mexico?</h4><p>Technology will completely change the way industry works in the world; however, Mexico will not evolve as quickly in that area, even though we want to advance as rapidly as possible. Most of the innovations today are focused on customer service more than on the acquiring part of the business, and we are evolving faster on the service aspect than on the sales aspect. Still, we have developed many tools to help with the sales platform, and there will be a full digital ecosystem for insurance that will help customers as well as partners. We need to serve partners because of the B2B2C nature of our business. In Mexico, this process is evolving slower because the market is still operated by agents and face-to-face oriented. However, changes are coming, and BNP Paribas Cardif, particularly, is developing together with its partners the digital ecosystems that the final clients demand. We are well positioned for this because we have over 6 million insured people and do not have a single agent, which is rare in Mexico.</p><h4>What is your strategy to create strong partnerships with other businesses that help you sell insurance?</h4><p>We do not see ourselves as providers, but as partners. Every time we sit down with a partner or a potential one, we try to build win-win relationships. Our goal is to help our partner earn the loyalty of their customers and have the customers satisfied. We design strategies in workshops together with the partner who is involved from the beginning.</p><h4>What role does data analysis play in the company?</h4><p>Data analytics is a top priority and we have appointed a Director reporting directly to me in charge of business intelligence and strategic planning. There are three pillars that are important for us: data mining &amp; analytics, predictive models, and emotional segmentation. These are well structured because we use our business intelligence to determine how we can sell more, when and how, and so on. Data mining and predictive models help us to understand the best moment to sell, the best product to sell, and so forth. Emotional segmentation is needed because social demographics aren´t enough to properly target our customer's needs.</p><h4>How do you price your products?</h4><p>In insurance business, that is an art; if we do this wrong, we lose a great deal of business.  At BNP Paribas Cardif, the prices are set in conjunction with the commercial and the actuarial areas. We do not price just an insurance coverage, we price overall insurance solutions. This is important because most of our products are not just single products, but products with an offer and may include assistance and more benefits. For example, we have an important retail customer that wanted insurance; however, it is a low segment and in order to penetrate the market, we need to convince people. We thus designed a complete offering; we provide not only life insurance but also give them the opportunity to call a doctor if they have a terrible allergy and discounts at the pharmacy. We design offers to fit the needs of customers and make the product more real and tangible. BNP Paribas Cardif in Mexico serves three main groups of customers. There are banks and financial institutions, which have certain needs. We are also a significant player in the auto finance industry in terms of providing insurance for finance captive companies of the automobile insurance. Finally, we serve retailers. Therefore, the price depends on the customer, the industry, the package, and many other things.</p><h4>How is the market education here in comparison with other countries in Latin America?</h4><p>We have a tremendous opportunity to grow the insurance business in Mexico. The penetration of insurance versus GDP is 2.1 in Mexico and has remained between 1.9 and 2.1 for the last decade, although it grows around 11% a year. In terms of auto insurance, only 30% of automobiles are insured here, while only 7% of the population has home insurance. There is also a huge opportunity for health insurance. Banking penetration is low in Mexico and insurance is even lower compared to other Latin American countries where insurance vs GDP have bigger figures than Mexico. For example, Chile: 4.7; Argentina: 2.8, Brazil: 3.1: Colombia: 2.7.</p><h4>Will the recent earthquake have an impact on the market?</h4><p>It depends; there was a great deal of damage, though it could have been much worse. Thus, the insurance sector will not see a huge impact because most of what failed were houses and the number of insured houses is low. The impact on the insurance sector is not important but unfortunately, the impact was strong on the people and the country to rebuild. I also believe this is an opportunity for the population to generate more consciousness about being protected with an insurance solution.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We have been building towards profitability, because in insurance, the more one grows, the more they invest. I hope we will continue to be a company that is proud of the service it provides for both customers and partners, and continue to have high ratings among our employees. These are extremely important goals for me in order to have a balanced company. Hopefully, 2018 will also be a big year to continue advancing with technological developments. We are in the process of defining all the goals; however, I hope 2018 will be another year of solid growth and consolidation of our businesses with our partners and customers. Another important achievement in 2017 was that, for the first time, our employees were active in helping communities, and in a country like ours, such initiatives are impo</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Portugal at a Crossroads]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rene-mia-global-editorial-director-thought-leadership-economist-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following its much-reported four years of successive economic growth, how do you assess the country's national competitiveness? </h4><p>Portugal has made important strides in terms of reinforcing its competitive fundamentals while also putting the house in order from a macroeconomic point of view. The economy's return to growth has boosted market opportunities while structural reforms have improved the efficiencies of its factors markets, including the labour. Red tape has also been eased and basic drivers of competitiveness such as infrastructure and primary education are in good shape. On the negative side, political stability and effectiveness could still be improved. The current political setting, with a minority administration, is more prone to disruptive policy changes. What is more, despite a stronger fiscal position (with a lessening of the sovereign debt load) and better GDP growth, the country remains vulnerable to market turbulences and the banking sector continues to be affected by numerous weaknesses. Finally, for Portugal to be able to sustain growth over time, generating innovation is going to become increasingly important. Reinforcing the ecosystem for that will be key, including putting in place a conducive education and training system, generating synergies between the academia and the industry, investing in R&amp;D, and further improving market efficiencies at all levels.</p><h4>Following Standards &amp; Poor's increase of Portugal's rating to investment grade, are we seeing a corresponding increase in interest in private sector investment in the country?</h4><p>in our Business Environment Ranking, which assesses countries' attractiveness for investors. Within our European sample, Portugal ranks 15 out of 18, which underlines some further progress to be made in terms of relative competitiveness compared to its regional peers. The country's performance is rather even in terms of attractiveness factors. It benefits from a stable political environment, although polls show that any shift away from austerity could generate concerns amid investors. Still, the country retains business friendly policies for private enterprises, competition, and foreign investment. The macroeconomic environment needs to remain a focus, as does the labour market and foreign trade and exchange control. On top of this, the size of the market is relatively small. A focus on reinforcing these elements and ensuring that the fundamentals for long-term growth are in place will be crucial for attracting and sustaining FDI.</p><h4>What do you expect to see in terms of Portuguese contribution to the EU—economically or otherwise—over the next few years?</h4><p>With the appointment of Mário Centeno as head of the Eurogroup, Portugal is upping its influence within the EU. Hopefully it will continue to reinforce the EU's institutional underpinning, and play a key role in the current push for further integration of the economic and monetary union in a bid to shelter the region from external shocks. A decision on reform proposals will be made at the EU summit in June 2018. Some suggestions include the transformation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)—the euro zone's bail-out fund—into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), which would provide a backstop for the banking union; setting up a fiscal capacity with a stabilisation function for the euro area; or appointing a euro zone economy and finance minister who would serve as vice-president of the Commission, and potentially oversee the EMF. More generally, Portugal's economic success coupled with its diverse culture and current success in attracting tourists will hopefully further boost its soft power in the years to come.</p><h4>The Lisbon Summit 2018 sees Portugal “at a crossroads." Which debates do you foresee coming to the fore at the conference, and what is the best recipe for public and private sector actors to transform this kind of debate into action?</h4><p>We are hoping for an insightful debate on the challenges and opportunities Portugal faces in the current international conjuncture dominated by uncertainty and disruption. How can the country create and leverage disruption in its business and production models to create sustainable growth going forward? How can the country further improve the business environment and leverage new technologies to become an international hub for entrepreneurship? What are the challenges ahead, and how can the country leverage his strengths further, including its “cool factor?" We hope the summit will facilitate a fruitful discussion on the concrete steps that need to be taken, offering the space for creation of innovative solutions from all relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors.</p><h4>Which sectors will play a key role in allowing Portugal to consolidate and stabilize its economy's growth up to 2030?</h4><p>Portugal's economy is dominated by service sectors, which account for over 75% of its economy. Financial services and tourism are among the most important sectors for the country's growth. The outlook for financial services, currently in the middle of a period of fragility, will partially improve on the back of moves toward shared regulatory structures in the euro zone. The boom currently experienced by the tourism sector, boosted by price competitiveness and security concerns in some competing destinations, could continue provided investment is made to improve tourism infrastructure in the country and supply income from key source countries doesn't become too much of an issue and/or can be mitigated by further diversifying these with strides into new markets. The industrial sector has been struggling in recent times amid low competitiveness and low domestic demand; however, the resulting shift from traditional low-cost activities to medium technology sectors, such as vehicles and automotive parts, and pharmaceuticals, among others, is positive in that it has upped the country's competitiveness fundamentals. This now needs to be sustained by a further focus on innovation and technology readiness.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Three Legs to Lean On]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[three-legs-to-lean-on]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements as Minister of Tourism, and what policies do you want to have in place for your successor?</h4><p>When I started, we defined a tourism strategy: three legs of the stool. The first leg was improving air connectivity, as tourists will not come if there are not enough flights. The Costa Rican Tourism Board (ICT) has had a strategy in place for a few years and we want to focus on that more aggressively. At the same time, we wanted to diversify the market. About 40% of all of our business comes from the US, an extremely large market just two hours away, and we want to improve our relationship with it in terms of getting more visitors. On top of this, we want to diversify in terms of expanding to new markets. We have been increasing the number of flights over the past two years and now have direct flights from Spain, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, Amsterdam, and Zurich. A case in point is our Liberia airport in Guanacaste, which grew 40% in terms of passenger arrivals in 2016. Demand grew 32%, which is also a huge increase. The second leg of our strategy after securing flights is to attract people. We did studies on the best prospects in 10 markets, not just North America, and now have nine more with great prospects: the UK, Spain, Germany, France, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Peru. We also have five public relations agencies in the US and Europe. We also continued with a better presence in trade fairs in different parts of the world. We are showing the world a more complete Costa Rica; it is not only nature and adventure anymore, but also culture, gastronomy, and tradition. We also introduced the people of Costa Rica, which happens to be the number-one attraction according to our surveys. With that, we presented a new touristic identity for Costa Rica, “Costa Rica, My Choice, Naturally" that has been successful thus far. For the third leg, we are focused on investment to ensure the sector continues to grow. We also wanted to increase the quality that international markets bring to Costa Rica. For the first time, we did a conference on investment in sustainable tourism, the only one of its kind. We are clearly sending a message to the more than 100 different companies and investors who came to the country. We had developers, lawyers, banks, designers, architects—all the people who had to do with development in tourism were here, and all from different areas. There were also about 100 Costa Ricans to do the networking that is expected at these types of conferences.</p><h4>What programs do you have in place to help local people benefit from this activity?</h4><p>In 2016, we conducted the world's first study to measure social progress in tourism with the Social Progress Index (SPI) methodology. In our particular model, 94% of people in the communities we studied reported that tourism had benefitted them, so people are supportive of the industry. They are not just sitting and watching the progress go by; they are part of it and are involved.</p><h4>How do you reconcile your growth goals with the environmental impact inherent to development?</h4><p>When we say we are sustainable, it is not just in terms of the environment. For Costa Rica and the tourism industry, sustainability includes three areas: the environment, society and culture, and the economy. To make it sustainable in all three ways, the local community has to be involved, and we also have to take care of the environment. Costa Rica was dedicated to protecting the environment 20 years ago, long before it became trendy. This is why Costa Rica is considered the leader in sustainable tourism. This is not something we merely call ourselves; it is how we are internationally recognized. We have stayed true to our vision for two decades. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[transferable-skills-for-a-transnational-world]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the ministry adjusting study programs to the requirements of the economy?</h4><p>One of the goals of our strategic agenda is to have an integral curricular reform from programs designed by objectives to ones based on competencies and skills that students need to succeed in the 21st century. That has been a major change because this new curriculum is oriented toward students developing competencies and skills for their professional life, promoting self-learning and critical knowledge. This reform also spells a radical change in the way teachers work, since more dynamism allows students to discover new methodologies, solve problems, and develop new strategies, instead of memorizing content. A clear example is our foreign language learning programs. We have increased the number of English teachers with the aim of internationalizing education in the country with programs designed under a European framework. At the moment, we have also implemented a Mandarin program in 10 schools and discovered that there are many companies searching for young people who speak Portuguese, and thus have already begun to teach this language in six public schools. We have also focused on developing a globalized awareness that allows students to have a strong national identity while being open to the world, so they can take advantage of the opportunities in the global market, since we are a small country with a large international presence. Furthermore, some of our biggest concerns are the education curricula at the kindergarten and primary levels, because we strongly believe these first steps are essential for successfully advancing in the educational sector. We have some important innovations here, first, a new curriculum including the newest trends in teaching and required technology. We are going to see the results of all these efforts in 10 or 15 years. On the other hand, another relevant topic is the Dual Education Program. We have a pilot program with the automotive sector and have also been preparing two more for tourism and telecommunications. The main objective of this is to deepen technical knowledge in these areas of the country's technical educational institutions. The Dual Education Program works under the philosophy that knowledge has to be developed both in schools and in companies. It constitutes a strong collaboration with the private sector and is being implemented in technical schools. </p><h4>How is the government working to improve the infrastructure of institutions in Costa Rica in order to standardize education?<br></h4><p>In this aspect, we have different challenges. One of the main activities is a strategy called “Yo me apunto," which is meant to reinforce permanency, reincorporation, and educational success. This program works with the most marginalized schools in the country and intends to overcome exclusion with strategies that help detect students at risk of dropping out and combat its causes. Moreover, we have increased the number of scholarships at the primary and secondary levels to promote social inclusion. This same program works in collaboration with the minister to provide childcare so that parents can study at night. The ministry is also supplying night schools with food and transport services, which has improved students' long-term attendance rates. We have also expanded our food support to secure an inclusive education in Costa Rica. As opposed to 2016, when the previous government could not make its scholarship payments by the beginning of the year, this government paid them in January so that families could send their children to the schools from the get-go.</p><h4>What alliances does the ministry have with other local and international entities?  <br></h4><p>We have important partnerships with public and private bodies, not to mention foundations, including the Gente Foundation and the Asociación de Empresarios para el Desarrollo. We have also signed alliances with the CRUSA and Monge foundations and are working together to grant scholarships to young entrepreneurs. We also have partnerships with entities such as UNICEF and UNESCO and with countries like Chile, Panama, and Germany. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of ULACIT?</h4><p>ULACIT began to operate in 1987 when it grew out of a technical school first established in 1936, four years before the first public university was founded in Costa Rica. It is a proprietary institution founded with the objective of offering science, technology, and other related programs. ULACIT was the third private university founded in the country. Our mission is to educate and prepare leaders to serve the world. We are not a university for everyone, but seek to attract the best performing students in the country and prepare them to be leaders in business and public life. We have a high focus on activism and serving the community, and our teaching model encompasses that concept of service. That is why we have been ranked the best private university in Central America for six years in a row.</p><h4>How do you prepare leaders for the challenges they have to face in the world?</h4><p>The first step is to recruit and select leaders. We visit every town in the country and ask community leaders if they know people with the skillsets we seek. We search every corner to scout for talent. People come up to us and we analyze their credentials, leadership abilities, and interview them to assess their talents. We give full scholarships, a free ride for the entire program, to 100 students a year. This allows us to select the best of the best in the country. These are not just students with high academic standing but also students with musical, sports, art, or other talents, and also a strong leadership orientation, a history of activism, and a spirit of service in their respective communities. Those are the key qualities we look for. We are also seeking to engage a diverse range of students: people of different ages, ethnicities, political and religious affiliation, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, and abilities. We build a special community where people can come and learn from those who excel in many different fields. They learn not only about leadership, but are exposed to a rich, diverse, and multicultural environment. </p><h4>What programs do you offer?</h4><p>We have programs in three basic areas: engineering and design, social sciences, and business and economics. We are expanding in engineering and design, which is what the world is moving toward. We are not known just for the variety of programs we offer; we are known for the way we teach. We do not use exams like traditional universities, but use project-based learning methodologies founded on inquiry, research, problem-solcing, and service, which is based on the Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework developed by Harvard's Project Zero. We localized that teaching model to ULACIT. We have an Americanized curriculum, with aspects like Freshman Seminar, First-Year Experience, and Gen-Ed (general studies, or liberal arts). We are the only university in Costa Rica that incorporates a liberal arts curriculum as it is understood in the US. That means we include 14 courses, 28% of the curriculum, that are general studies, and students have to learn how to reason verbally, quantitatively, morally, and aesthetically. </p><h4>What is the importance of internationalization for ULACIT?</h4><p>Internationalization is important to us. Our students can decide to take 50% of their learning requirements abroad. They can decide to do that by paying local tuition at ULACIT and taking courses at partner institutions outside of the country. That is a huge advantage for students who cannot pay USD3,000 per credit; they can study in 30 different countries. We facilitate those exchanges through our Global Education Office (GEO). Furthermore, we are the only Costa Rican institution that is a member of the National Student Affairs Association in the US. Beyond academic studies, we also have other support services to help students get the best results they can in terms of finding jobs and getting started on their careers as well, just as other American universities do. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is behind the success of healthcare system penetration in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica has been building its healthcare system for a long time. For example, we have had a Ministry of Health for 90 years now, not to mention a labor insurance program for the same amount. The Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social (CCSS) celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2016. We have also had strong nutritional programs for children for 66 years now. For example, the budget of CCSS is USD5.7 million, a large sum of money for merely one institution in a country like this. The third is that we have been able to train enough health professionals to provide high-quality services to the population. We have developed strong legislation that regulates the way we build houses, produce food, and industrialize consumption products that have contributed to the healthcare system, allowing it to be recognized internationally. We are also in the process of becoming an OCED member and have its approval in health policy affairs. It was the second sector that was approved. We have had universal coverage for at least four or five decades, with a strong institutional effort and investment in healthcare.</p><h4>Are there still challenges to overcome?</h4><p>We still need to make sure most of the inhabitants have access to the healthcare system. There are still people we should cover with official insurance, though this only applies to about 4-5% of the population, including foreigners. We have about 69 hospitals, more than 100 clinics and what we call “health areas," which are local administrations, and nearly 1,000 public local healthcare centers. These basic organization units require at least a physician, nurse, and technician as a part of their team and require a huge financial and political effort to build up in a country like Costa Rica.</p><h4>What is your strategy to ensure that you have an adequate supply of medicine and devices?</h4><p>We have a large offering of services to the population. Of course, we still have a huge problem guaranteeing people have access because there is a long waiting list for specialized services such as diagnosis services, specialized treatments for cancer, and surgeries. We still offer public and official institutionalized services and would love to develop an institutional policy to provide high-quality services to everyone as well as standardized services in every part of the country, which we have yet to reach. In order to ensure that we can provide all the medication or resources required, we need a large sum of investment in those affairs, even though CCSS already makes large investments. It is one of the largest parts of the budget that is in fact growing currently because new treatments are specialized and expensive, and remain one of the main concerns of the people who run healthcare systems in most countries, even in Europe.</p><h4>How does CCSS benefit from all the investment coming into the country?<br></h4><p>We seek to introduce a high-quality standard into the buying process in a technical manner. We are, for example, trying to develop and improve the technical requirements of each specific product. We have had many problems in the past in terms of the quality of the product and services we have received and do not want that to happen again. In Costa Rica, we have many options in terms of providers, which is great, though we have to ensure we provide the population with top-quality products. </p><h4>What are your goals for the next year?</h4><p>CCSS is recognized as a macroeconomically efficient organization. When we go to the micro level, there are many challenges, such as long waiting lists and other small access problems. Thus we hope to develop new infrastructure, go forward with certain projects, and launch new clinics, hospitals, and services.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Corbana play in supporting the banana production industry in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Corbana is a non-state public institution working on the development of national banana production by strengthening growers and the production and marketing of bananas. We began in 1971 and focus mainly on research but also give loans and have labs for soil analysis and other services. We also provide climate information through Banaclima Corbana, with 70 stations where we issue information to the growers daily.</p><h4>What factors contribute to the viability of Costa Rican bananas in the global marketplace?</h4><p>Of course, the taste and look of a banana is important; however, it is more important how it is produced, and the social component of that related to the workers. We try to give our workers the best conditions possible, maintain a strong adherence to the best environmental practices, and mirror global standards such as those of the EPA in the US. Moreover, we try to reduce the application of chemicals in production. In 2017, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the construction of a laboratory for biological control and molecular biology. About 75% of our research is dedicated to biological control.</p><h4>The industry is facing challenges such as fungus and climate change. What are some other concerns, and what is Corbana doing to contribute towards a remedy?</h4><p>The main challenge is trying to remain competitive whilst upholding strong social conditions for workers and environmental efforts. We offer higher salaries to workers than producers in competitive countries, and to offset this we work to keep up our productivity. Costa Rica has the highest yields in the world. We have reached already 2,800 boxes or 18kg per hectare. This higher productivity is the way to compete and maintain good conditions for our workers and environmental practices. Another challenge faced not only by producers in Costa Rica but worldwide is fusarium, a fungal disease. The industry has organized an international congress in Miami where well-known scientific researchers from five continents were invited to discuss the matter. We have also partnered with a large German company to develop a bio-solution to this disease.</p><h4>How are you trying to reach new markets?</h4><p>Traditionally, our main exports are almost 50% to the US and about 50% to the EU. We also have fruit going to the Middle East, Japan, and so on but in small quantities. We are trying to reinforce these markets in an attempt to export more. Logistics play a large role in this; therefore, we are working on this challenge. It comes down to distance and preservation. The industry is structured by trade companies like Del Monte and Chiquita, and our banana growers produce on 45,000ha, which is less than 1% of Costa Rica's total territory and close to 25% of the total area devoted to banana production. Most banana growth takes place on the Caribbean side, although there are three farms in the South Pacific.</p><h4>How will growth in the logistics sector help as you tackle your logistics challenges?</h4><p>Agriculture and marketing were a topic within a recent congress. There were people from the Panama Canal and APM Terminal. We realized with this port we can compete, otherwise it would be difficult as facilities were not the best. New facilities will help the entire sector, not just bananas.</p><h4>Has Corbana worked with any technology firms to improve production efficiency?</h4><p>We have drones and an agreement with the University of Costa Rica for research purposes as well as the use of its technological equipment. We also have agreements with universities in Taiwan, the Netherlands, the US, and elsewhere. Innovation is the only way to compete and improve. We also have close relations with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Trade, and Ministry of Foreign Relations. Out of necessity we are, in a way, a combination of a private firm within the public domain, a public-private partnership. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Dos Pinos' market share in Costa Rica?</h4><p>According to recent surveys, Dos Pinos is the most important brand in Costa Rica, well above the included global brands. That is a reflection of our permanent commitment to fulfill our value proposal to consumers. We are the absolute leaders in the dairy market in Costa Rica, with large market share in most categories. In Panama, where one of our brands, Chiricana, is the most preferred dairy brand, we are also the leaders in the UHT segment. In Central America, Dos Pinos is one of the 10 most preferred brands, and we enjoy a significant market share. We are very relevant actors in the region. </p><h4>What is the significance of being a cooperative, and how does this affect your business model?</h4><p>We are proud to be a cooperative because we have been able to create a model that promotes social development and the democratic distribution of wealth for our cooperative members. Another important factor is the impact the cooperative has had on consumers in terms of the health and the social development of the country. Dos Pinos represents around 2% of the country's GDP, and we have about 2,000 members that are the owners of the cooperative. Most of them are small and medium-sized farmers. Out of these, around 1,500 are farmers and 500 are employees of the cooperative. Therefore, we have this balance between our farmers and workers who all participate in the ownership of the cooperative. We also have more than 5,000 employees in the region and have a direct impact on more than 60,000 families linked to activities related to our business. We have a set of values as a cooperative, including commitment, adaptability, honesty, solidarity, and the discipline to make every single day the best at fulfilling our customers' and owners' requirements. Dos Pinos has been contributing for 70 years, not only to its growth as a business, but also to the country and the region and the health and social development of its people. It has also greatly impacted the development of otherwise hard to access and develop rural areas. </p><h4>What motivated you to expand?</h4><p>In 2014, we developed a new strategic plan in which we decided not only to focus on our core business, the dairy industry, but also to diversify and expand our activities into other market segments. One of these is food and beverage. This is why we decided to buy our own beverage facilities, in addition to Gallito, where we see the synergy of bringing in new lines of business built on our existing scale, logistics capabilities, and knowledge of the market. In addition, we wanted to be relevant as a regional leader not only as a dairy cooperative, but also as a food industry player.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the typical Costa Rican consumer, and how does this profile make Dos Pinos innovate in terms of market offerings?</h4><p>Dos Pinos is the most valued brand in Costa Rica, a position we have been able to maintain over the years. The Costa Rican consumer is smart and exigent in terms of quality, and we have been able to consistently provide them with quality, variety, and innovation. This is good news for the customer, who is always looking for the next thing from Dos Pinos. Every day we are working to bring something new to our consumers; this is why we introduce to market on average  60 new products every year, ranging from teas, yogurts, cheeses, ice cream, and more. We are always focused on our customers' needs, using innovation and R&amp;D to satisfy our customers. This is our daily challenge.</p><h4>What are Dos Pinos' plans and goals for 2018?</h4><p>Dos Pinos still has an aggressive plan for growth, innovation, and diversification. We are going to keep growing in the food industry, especially synergizing Gallito with Dos Pinos, which will bring new products and combinations into the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Torres Paseo Colón project progressing?</h4><p>The project is about 96% sold, though it took us some time to sell the second tower. When we did the bidding for the second tower, it went up 30% in dollar terms. In the middle of the crisis, everyone was doing what they had to do to get jobs, and the prices of materials and builders were low, which led to significant savings for us. We proved that people wanted to live in high rises and downtown. After this project, we moved back to the east side of the city and built a seven-story building there even though others were building outside the city. We have been working for years to bring people back to live in San José. We have not done anything in the heart of the city yet as we have not found the right property at the right price. We would love to build a high rise; however, it just has not happened yet.</p><h4>How is it dealing with the local government, and what are they doing to spur development downtown?</h4><p>The city of San José went through a major improvement in zoning a few years ago. When we built Torres Paseo Colón, it was the maximum height available for a building. Urban planning in the city was very restrictive, but then Johnny Araya Monge came along and changed many things. Now in certain areas of the city we can build more than 50 stories because the zoning has been changed. The city of San José is pro-investment and truly helps developers to achieve such projects. It provides a tax credit if we build in certain areas of the city. San José was in a terrible state 10-15 years ago and has significantly improved since then. The main avenue in San José has been transformed; all the parks and signage were redone and key government institutions are back downtown. Security has also improved significantly downtown, and there has been a great deal of renewal of buildings there. The Hotel Costa Rica, which was the main hotel 40-50 years ago, is undergoing renovations. There will also be a Hilton hotel next to the national theater. An American company built another five-star hotel as well. This is great news for the city because all these projects bring upscale tourists back into the heart of San José. There is the national theater, the art theater, museum areas, and many other nice things happening downtown.</p><h4>Is proximity to resources or to workplaces the determining factor for buyers?</h4><p>Proximity to their work is a main driver. There is work downtown because there are many government offices. Now with the heavy traffic and abundant conveniences, people want to move into the area surrounding downtown because they can find everything they need, including supermarkets, restaurants, and so on. People no longer need to have a car to have a high quality of life in an urban space. More people are interested in spending time in their homes instead of sitting in traffic. Costa Rica went through the same thing as the US; everyone moved to the suburbs. The suburbs in the US are well planned, ours aren't since we did not have the infrastructure to do so. Now things are improving.</p><h4>Are you seeking plots of land downtown to build something?</h4><p>We have found land that we like, but as of yet it is too expensive. A successful project is all about location, location, location—and the right price. If it is too expensive and we are unable to build as a result of external forces, then we end up with a piece of property we can do nothing with. Moreover, if the price of the land is high, then we have to charge more when we sell the condos. The value of the land cannot be more than 10% of the total cost of the project. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Cuestamoras transformed itself in over a century of existence? </h4><p>Cuestamoras has a colorful history; we were one of the first general stores in Costa Rica. We innovate in order to create opportunities for everybody, and these innovations have taken us into several different businesses. In 2012, we decided to develop a multi-business company that would develop strategies in different sectors to enable us to fulfill our innovation purpose. Therefore, we started looking around and thinking about areas of the economy where we could make a difference. We were looking for fairly mature industries with a need for innovation, so we started with real estate. Rather than just being a developer, we wanted to be a builder of communities and provide a better life for inhabitants; therefore, we developed a strategy to create organic, vibrant, and sustainable communities in Costa Rica and other countries where we operate. Our second business was energy, which we wanted to start from scratch. We saw an opportunity to start expanding internationally, so we started an energy trading company in Guatemala that now has operations in El Salvador and will soon be in Panama as well. Recently, we have acquired a couple of companies in the health sector because we thought this was fairly mature, but not dynamic enough. Therefore, we acquired Cefa, the leading medicine distributor in the country, and Fischel, the main pharmacy chain in Costa Rica. Several months ago, we completed the acquisition of La Bomba, the leading low-cost pharmacy chain, with the intention of growing the business.</p><h4>Regarding real estate, what are some of your most iconic developments?</h4><p>We are currently developing Oxí­geno, a large mixed-use development in Heredia. This is what we call “a Human Playground," a concept of our own making in which you can shop, be entertained, eat, exercise, or just hang out with your friends in a much more integral way than your typical commercial development. This is a unique concept not found anywhere else in the world. The architecture of this development is organic and flexible and based not so much on the hard elements of design, but the soft elements that can be customized to different scenarios and situations. There are extensive green areas since the landscape is extremely important for us, and we are integrating it with the community. Of course, it includes sustainability. Santa Verde is another mixed-use project in Heredia with 1,200 units. Here again we are trying to create a neighborhood rather than a development and integrate green spaces and landscapes with other structures. We also believe that security is not a matter of barriers; rather, what really prevents crime is human activity. We want the development to be open for the public through technology and without physical barriers. These two developments will be ready by 2018.</p><h4>Why are you acquiring companies in the health sector?</h4><p>We need to create opportunities for everybody. If we are in the health business, we can help as many people as possible. Often medication is expensive; therefore, we are trying to understand how we can get more first-class medicines to more people in need. We have La Bomba in every province in Costa Rica, which represents tremendous growth. </p><h4>What is the strategy behind growing your energy business in Central America?</h4><p>Central America has the particularity of being a small region, but one of the things the market doesn't do is to treat it as a single region. Doing business is difficult because of the different currencies, laws, and governments; for example, there are significant barriers to trade. However, the exception is the energy industry. The Mercado Eléctrico Regional (MER) is a wise initiative that was launched years ago, all that is needed is a power line and a legal framework in order to have a regional market. What we do is connect the people that generate energy with the people who need it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[thriving-in-booms-surviving-through-busts]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was GCI Ingenieria formed, and where is the company today?</h4><p>We started the company in 2005. We decided to start something different, although the plan was to be in consulting for the engineering sector, including civil, structural, electrical, and mechanical engineering; we wanted to provide project management services as well. We also wanted to have something that was more organized in terms of following standard procedures using professional project management best practices. We decided to certify our services with the ISO 9001, which helped us be more standardized. The period from 2005-2007 was the last phase of the real estate boom in Costa Rica. There was a great deal of work in Costa Rica at that time for engineering consulting because many people from the US and Canada were moving to Costa Rica. Fortunately for us, we got a part of that business. We began doing our work and grew from a team of six people to about 65.</p><h4>Are you moving away from public work toward the private sector?</h4><p>It varies because the political cycle in Costa Rica means that, at the end of every term, we see more work coming from the public sector. Currently, we are preparing for a new term and expect public work to be accordingly somewhat slower. Construction is cyclical, and as engineers, we need to prepare for that. We need to have people ready when we expect growth so that we have the capacity to start right away. A decade ago, we had three months to design a project. Today, clients want the same design in one month, so you need to have the tools to do it. For example, we use BIM for all our projects. We need to have a strong capacity to be ready to do the work. By the same token, when work slows down, we need to be ready to downsize.</p><h4>Are there any government infrastructure projects on your radar?</h4><p>There are some projects coming. One project of particular interest is the dry channel from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It will resemble the Panama Canal, though it will comprise an eight-lane freeway plus a railroad connecting the two main ports. That is a megaproject that has been talked about for several years. It is realistic, even though there have been delays; there are environmental concerns to be addressed, and it has to be done under a concession model. We first need interested parties. It would be the largest project that Costa Rica would embark on in the next 10 years, along with a subway. The government needs to partially subsidize the subway; the fares and number of people using it will make it economically unfeasible otherwise. In Panama, for example, users pay less than a dollar, which is subsidized by the government. The price that would make it economically feasible is higher than the actual fare. A subsidy could work here, given that we do not have a huge volume of people to generate the income that would make a company interested in doing the project under a concession scheme. We need to see who will win the election and find out if they will push for the subway project.</p><h4>What are the general challenges of doing business in the real estate sector?</h4><p>Bureaucracy used to be a big issue due to permits. Typically, a designer is in charge of securing the permits for their work. It used to be a nightmare; however, fortunately the College of Engineers (CFIA) has made some efforts to make it an online process, which has certainly improved things. However, one of the challenges is the presence of less formal companies that do not always compete with the same rules. More importantly, we hope the government will continue to push for more infrastructure so that the thousands of engineers in Costa Rica continue to have work. The private sector alone is not enough for all of us to survive; we need the government to promote more projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From the Soil Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[from-the-soil-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company get started?</h4><p>This company got its start in the US 30 years ago. Geopier is part of Tensar Corporation, another big company in the US. It has licensing companies in almost all of Latin America. We solve soil problems, such as trying to make it harder and more resistant when building. In 2009, Geopier was trying to find a partner in Costa Rica, so it approached me. I did not begin until 2012 because I was using the intervening time to teach construction companies and engineers structural design. From 2012 to date we have been doing projects and have demonstrated that we can solve problems with less money. We provide the solutions. During that time, we have also tried to invest in many machines. </p><h4>How do you see the construction sector evolving?</h4><p>Our company has been growing over the years, but construction in Costa Rica has not increased at the same pace. We are working with businesses in the free zones and San José area. However, there are not many projects outside of San José, which will be a future challenge. We try to do developments outside San José; however, most of the construction is for exporters of goods or services. We are already doing some commercial centers, but there are still many opportunities to build more.</p><h4>Why did you decide to take over the business after Geopier approached you?</h4><p>I like to try and explore different things. I am not young, but I have a great deal of experience, and everybody needs to innovate. I started with construction in the 1980s; when you grow old you need to find different things. In my case, I like to visit places and see what is happening in the world and replicate that in Costa Rica. </p><h4>What makes the solutions Geopiers offers in the Costa Rican market unique?<br></h4><p>In Costa Rica, the soil is soft, which means there are usually several solutions. One is installing pipes, which is a high-cost depending on how deep they need to be. The other solution is to remove and replace the soft soil. We are between both of these solutions. We have a technique at Geopier that consists of expanding the soil with a short pipe that is enough to support the building, a unique solution in Costa Rica. The cost is cheaper and the solution better and quick. </p><h4>What are some of the projects and developments where you have offered your solutions?</h4><p>We have done various commercial, office, hospital, and infrastructure developments, including Citimall, Cafetal Office, Zona Franca Lima, Costa Rica Convention Center, several data centers, residential condominiums, and part of the access road to the APM Terminals. </p><h4>What is the profile of your clients?</h4><p>Right now, it is construction and design companies. Our clients look to reduce their costs and make savings on their projects. We are the best solution in terms of cost and efficiently. We have worked with Garnier &amp; Garnier, Van der Laat &amp; Jimenez, Edica, Proycon, and MECO, among others. </p><h4>Construction costs in Costa Rica are increasing. How will this affect your business?</h4><p>Everything is increasing, but we are part of the solution for saving. It is not going to affect us because it is an opportunity to be there for people. However, we need more opportunities and different kinds of jobs. New projects are built only in the metropolitan area, and we need to export some projects out of it. At the end of the day, there is nearly nothing left to build here, and we need to explore more things outside the area; that is going to be the future. </p><h4>Will the sector improve in the next five years? </h4><p>Around 25 years ago, Costa Rica was different in terms of construction methods; now, it has become more professional and will only continue to grow all the more so.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[real-talk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements in your three main business units?</h4><p>Infrastructure is still our main and biggest unit, with both private and public sector projects. Our public sector projects are some of our biggest, like the airport in Liberia, Moin Port on the Atlantic coast, and five main bridges of Highway 27. Currently, we have contracts that cover the maintenance of over 60% of all paved roads in the country, more than 3,000km in total. In the real estate division, we have several projects, five of which are in the process of commercialization. We are constructing and almost finishing Q-Bo, a project of over 300 residential units. We are currently planning Sabana Capital, which will be the tallest building in the country, a 150m, 40-floor mixed-use building. We have about 25 projects in all in real estate. In the energy division, we have consolidated a 200MW portfolio. Our core business is still infrastructure, accounting for about 70%, with 20% in real estate and 10% in energy.</p><h4>What trends do you see in the real estate sector and how do find solutions to shifting demands and needs?</h4><p>In Costa Rica, we are at a point where regulations in municipalities and lifestyles have merged to make it possible to build high-rises. This was not possible 10 years ago. There is, therefore, a back-to-the-city movement, with people wanting to live near where they work, seeking to cut commuting time and avoid traffic. People seek convenience right now, and neighborhoods are changing and gentrifying rapidly to answer these needs—places like Barrio Escalante, which is rapidly gentrifying and becoming the So-Ho of Costa Rica. We believe in a compact, functional, and connected city, and all our projects seek to address these needs, a city where people can live, have fun, and work, all within walking distance. That is what we aim for. Whether it is commercial, retail, residential, or office, we always seek to make a mixed-use project.</p><h4>Infrastructure is a big issue in Costa Rica. How are you contributing to modernizing the country?</h4><p>In the private sector we concentrate on the densest areas to be the most efficient. We concentrate less on cars and more on people in urbanized areas. In the public sector, we are one of the only companies that participates in every kind of infrastructure bid the government puts out. We seek projects for the country's interests, offering the best price possible. In the energy sector, we are trying to help create sustainable development and energy practices, to make the price of energy more efficient and more competitive.</p><h4>What are the most important and urgent needs of Costa Rica?</h4><p>There are mass transportation projects in the pipeline. The urban train will transport a lot of Costa Ricans in the capital. We have won a contract for the Circunvalación Norte, which is the last ring road around the city, so all the trailers and trucks coming from the port and going through the country from north to south can use this without entering the city. That is a USD200 million project and will be important in terms of directing large trucks and trailers out of the city.</p><h4>What are the sources of growth for HSOLIS in 2018?</h4><p>In real estate, we see massive growth with high rises in the Sabana area, specifically with the Sabana Capital project. In the energy division, we are trying to consolidate our projects; therefore, we are not expecting big growth there for the time being. We are waiting for more bids from the government, though we do not see any big bids in 2018. In the infrastructure and construction division, we are expanding throughout the region, especially in neighboring countries. Nicaragua is interesting right now with many large bids in the last few months, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you establish a broad presence across Central America?</h4><p>Some of our clients began operations in several countries in the Central American region. Pleased with our services in El Salvador and Costa Rica, they asked us to accompany them into Guatemala and Nicaragua. This is how it all started, though we have also done some advertising and won local clients in each of those countries as well.</p><h4>Which market is currently growing the most?</h4><p>Costa Rica and El Salvador are the largest, but Nicaragua and Guatemala are growing steadily, though not as quickly. The political situation in Guatemala has affected us. We have also grown in Honduras through a correspondent with whom we have worked for the past eight years.</p><h4>In which sectors are you growing the most within Costa Rica?</h4><p>Services and construction. There was a slump in the Costa Rican economy due to many factors, some of which were due to fears of a large devaluation of the colón, which may happen in 2018, but there is also a great deal of uncertainty because of the government's large deficit. The government has to make large cuts in its expenses, as it is spending money it does not have. 2018 is also an election year. These factors all affect investment.  Some companies are entering Costa Rica while others are leaving. Panama, on the other hand, is a growing economy and doing fairly well. Some of the companies leaving Costa Rica are opting for Panama or other Central American countries that have cheaper labor, even though Costa Rican labor is better qualified, if more expensive. </p><h4>How would you rate the quality of the judicial system in Costa Rica compared to the region?</h4><p>Costa Rica has a fairly sound judicial system that has suffered some recent bad publicity; still, it is the soundest system in the region. There is some corruption, but people have a great deal of faith in our judicial system and believe they will see fair results. Unfortunately, however, judgments are not given in a timely matter and often take 5-10 years to be handed down.  </p><h4>How effective is contract law?</h4><p>Contracts in Costa Rica are legally enforced. The Supreme Court has made an effort to speed things up. It has incorporated technology and improved in many ways. However, judges still take too long to render their final decisions, at least in the civil and commercial courts. 20 years ago, a law was passed incorporating alternative dispute resolution methods into the system, including arbitration and mediation. These take a load off the judicial system. Hence, we always include an arbitration clause in our commercial and civil contracts. Once submitted to arbitration, matters should be resolved within one year. If the arbitral judgment is questioned before the Supreme Court and a judicial enforcement procedure follows, the matter may be resolved within four or five years.</p><h4>What are some of the disputes commonly seen in Costa Rica?</h4><p>There was a specific period where there were many defaults in construction contracts from 2007-2010 because of the crisis in the US. Before the crisis, there was a great deal of construction on the coastline. When the crisis hit and buyers defaulted, developers could not continue to build and there was a domino effect. Currently, there are not that many defaults on contracts. Some clients have had contractual disputes, but we have tried to solve them through mediation and always include an arbitration clause in our contracts.</p><h4>How can the system be improved from a general legal perspective?</h4><p>There have been many recent changes, such as a recent amendment to the Civil Procedure Code. When that comes into force, such cases might take less time, though we have to wait until it actually comes into effect to understand what will happen. Mediation and arbitration have also been incorporated in labor-related cases in the recently approved Code of Labor Procedures. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has happened in MATRA during the last year?</h4><p>We added new brands to our portfolio, the most important of which is Volvo Trucks. Volvo owns Mack Trucks, and we have represented Mack since 1953. This expansion of our portfolio in the trucks business enlarges our focus and footprint. There are Volvo products that will allow us to compete in new market segments, such as buses, which signals another expansion opportunity for us. We already represent Zhong Tong buses, a more economic product compared to Volvo, a higher-end one. </p><h4>Why is it important to diversify your portfolio of brands?</h4><p>It is important to add value, but it is more important to have the critical mass to be able to compete in each sector. MATRA is undeniably the largest dealer of heavy machinery in the country, and the only way we can justify our investments in the last few years is by having different products for the industries we cover. Being the largest dealer means our customers expect more from us: more presence throughout the country, more inventory, and shorter lead times. It also means investing in resources so that our employees are better trained and able to solve problems quickly. In contrast, we could concentrate on certain industries and try to just perform those, which means having a smaller company. We chose to have a larger company with a larger footprint.</p><h4>What is the importance of secondary cities such as Limón?</h4><p>Limón will likely be the fastest-growing area outside of San José in the next few years. There will be exponential growth because of the dynamics of the logistics industry. As a result, other sectors of the local economy will grow, especially those related to primary services. Executives will start living there; there will be a need for more hotels, restaurants, schools, and so on. The government will have to look into the logistics and infrastructure. The other area that will continue to grow in the north is the surrounding areas of San Carlos. We also see big expansions of business in the agricultural and agro-industrial sectors. It is already a dynamic area, and primary services should also continue to grow. </p><h4>How do you see this infrastructure problem evolving in the future?</h4><p>I do not see it evolving, since nothing has happened in the last 12 months. It is a matter of analyzing what has happened and how we incorporate those facts into our budgets. On a positive note, we hope the 57 agreements achieved by the nine main political parties become a reality. In the end, whoever wins the next election will have to work toward accomplishing those agreements. For the first time in 20 years, political parties are agreeing on common subjects and concentrating on ways to execute what the country needs. One of those subjects is infrastructure. We all agree we need to build more roads and finally solve the problem of mobility, especially within metropolitan areas. We hope the next government will be able to do it.</p><h4>Has the boom in construction impacted MATRA's business?</h4><p>It has positively impacted the industrial part of our business in particular. We sell power generation, and every building built needs a power generator. The services and specialized manufacturing industries are growing, especially those related to free zones. Forklifts and power generation play an important role in these sectors. If the pace at which the country constructs buildings and free zones was equal for roads, bridges, and dams, we would be in a great shape.</p><h4>Why should customers choose MATRA?</h4><p>We are the best at what we do. The relationship with our customers does not end when the equipment leaves our facilities; that is when it starts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[out-to-meet-the-rising-tide]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What conditions led Yobel to establish itself in Costa Rica?</h4><p>With over 50 years of experience in logistics and supply chain management, we began our operations in Costa Rica in 2003 after considering the significant growth and development projections it presented with the second-largest GDP in Central America. We are currently capitalizing on our investments to gain more customers and serve other potential customers in the country. The capacity required is now higher, even compared to  five years ago. In order to support that growth, we need additional capacity in housing and employees. In the past three years, we have achieved double-digit growth in sales; that is our plan for the next five years. Our current challenge is to increase revenue by 2022. We focus on strengthening our core processes and quality, and making sure we have the right people in key positions in order to achieve our targeted growth. </p><h4>Which sectors do you typically work with?</h4><p>It is somewhat diverse, though many of them are related to customer care and things like prepared foods and technology. One niche we now concentrate on is life sciences and medical devices, one of the most dynamic sectors in the country. We recently won contracts to manage all the distribution services for Johnson &amp; Johnson, for example. For these particular sectors, we have to comply with FDA standards and perform specific tasks to be compliant with their strict requirements. We also have closed contracts with important multinational companies and were granted the distribution of all Mexichem products in Costa Rica for a five-year period.</p><h4>How can the company set itself apart as a leading player in the market?</h4><p>We work with a philosophy that is specific to Yobel SCM: speed, transparency, efficiency, and adaptability. Speed is what our clients need in terms of service. We must be transparent so that our clients see us as a reliable partner and more efficient than our competitors. We are not just a logistics provider; we are a reliable partner for clients and help them reach their commercial goals and targets. Another area we focus on is adaptability. We are flexible and can adapt to the operations, supply chains, and requests of clients. We must be flexible and adapt to the changes in local and regional markets. This is our competitive advantage. </p><h4>What are your goals for the next five years?</h4><p>Our main target is to achieve double-digit growth in each of the next five years. Our challenge is to continue achieving that growth across the different business units we have, including distribution, warehousing, manufacturing, consulting, and other areas. We also want to ensure that growth is sustainably achieved, namely that we have the right processes and quality in order to ensure that growth is well supported by our operational structure.</p><h4>How do you see the logistics and e-commerce segments evolving in the medium term?</h4><p>E-commerce is evolving in Costa Rica and around the world. The trend is for it to gain momentum and penetration every year. Costa Rica has a high internet penetration rate compared to its neighbors in Central America, and the average income of the Costa Rican population is relatively higher than its regional neighbors. Those are the key drivers of e-commerce. Costa Rica has all the capabilities and is thus the best-suited country for this growth regionally. In order to be prepared for that, a company needs to have all the solutions in place to support that growing customer base. Gaining expertise in doing last-mile deliveries to customers instead of merely to businesses is one of the steps that we are taking. It requires the flexibility of managing large volumes of customers and individuals with small and flexible requirements, as well as large businesses. Yobel has been cultivating this over time and is able to support that growth. We are doing all we can to ensure that when the time comes, Yobel is prepared to support the needs and demands of e-commerce customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the evolution of your specific market niche? </h4><p>Used car dealers in Central America used to have to travel to the US to bid for cars in person; a one-stop solution was needed. 19 years ago, our founder Anabel Panayotti saw an opportunity whilst working with Dole at one of its ports in Delaware. She opened a one-stop shop for used car dealers that would handle everything for them. Dealers would purchase the cars, and we would bring them from the auction to their facility, deal with all the customs, titles, and receipts, load the cars onto the containers, and ship them to their final destination in Central America. Used car dealers, therefore, only needed to go to the auction and bid for cars, after which we would take over. The synergy with steamship companies is that they have cargo going northbound to the US to unload and would return with a load carrying our clients' vehicles back to Central America.</p><h4>Were the vessels previously returning to Central America with no cargo?</h4><p>The steamship companies that owned the vessels would have to find cargo for their south-bound route; however, in many cases the containers returned to Central America empty, which was an added cost for them. Our Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) license allows us to book and ship cargo on these vessels. As an NVOCC, we must fully comply with all regulations set forth by the Federal Maritime Commission; therefore, we have all the legal rights and can operate as per any shipping company.</p><h4>Has your model been imitated by the competition?</h4><p>It has. For many years, we have been the main exporter out of the Port of Wilmington; however, we are not unique and have other competition. There is one main competitor and another one or two smaller companies, though we pioneered that niche market out of the Port of Wilmington.</p><h4>What is the main driver of growth, the supply of vehicles or local demand?</h4><p>Growth is based on local demand in Central America. We rented a larger property that we later purchased and have been expanding and acquiring more land. We currently have 23 acres of land, two warehouses, and office space. Out of Delaware, the maximum capacity we can store is about 2,100 vehicles and we are currently receiving an average of 500-600 vehicles per week and are easily shipping 150-200 containers per week just out of Wilmington.</p><h4>Are those volumes trending upward?</h4><p>They are, and it is interesting how business evolves. Since the early 2000s, 90% of our clients do not even go to the US anymore. They just do all the bidding online from their offices here. Technology has changed the business over the years, and in the past three to four years we have experienced significant growth in the Central American region. YoY growth, measured by containers shipped, has increased 30%, a significant figure.</p><h4>Which market contributes the most to that growth?</h4><p>The two main markets are Guatemala and Costa Rica, which make up 75-80% of total shipments over the years. Most of the vehicles will be for smaller car dealers. Used cars meet an important part of our society's needs as the middle class is growing and not everyone can afford a new car.</p><h4>Do you anticipate any government measures to stem San José's congested traffic?</h4><p>The traffic problem in Costa Rica happens everywhere to different degrees and how the government tackles it is important. One way is to set up import restrictions through tariffs or limiting certain cars from going into the city center on certain days. These might help in the short term; however, in the long term it is all about investment in infrastructure. In some cities, there are many cars on the road but no traffic jams so it all depends on the quality of infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[transoceanic-prowess]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the impact of the recent partnership with the Chilean seaports company on Caldera Port?</h4><p>51% of two concessions, the Sociedad Portuaria de Caldera and Sociedad Portuaria Granelera de Caldera, which manages the construction and operation of the multipurpose terminal at Caldera Port, is owned by the Chilean SAAM Group. Of the remainder, 9% is Colombian (M&amp;H Inversiones) and 40% is Costa Rican (21% owned by Grupo Saret and 19% by Logistica de Granos). SAAM is the second-largest port operator in Latin America, with a presence in 84 seaports ranging from Chile to the US. Now, we are partnered with one of the largest seaport operators in Latin America, which has given us important competitive scenarios. We have been able to link the seaports, learn from each other, and interchange good practices from Fort Lauderdale to San Antonio in Chile. We are now part of a large enterprise, and SAAM is part of Quiñenco Holding.</p><h4>It seems like a great moment for having a large shipping company going to China. Why is this so important?</h4><p>The future of seaports will be in the Pacific because of the influence of free trade agreements with Asia. For example, the Chinese market has great demand for Latin America products such as Costa Rican pineapples. Traditionally, Costa Rica was focused on the US market, but now it and other LATAM countries are exporting to China and elsewhere in Asia, where demand is so high it is often hard to meet. The Asian market demand forces our countries to modernize and improve our seaport capacities and management systems in order to be able to handle these larger cargo flows and serve larger ships.</p><h4>What new products and markets represent opportunities for Caldera Port?</h4><p>We could generate alternative and cheaper services meant to handle cargo without having to pass through the new extensions of the Panama Canal. In Central America, the only country that has developed and improved its facilities to offer this option has been Guatemala. It has modernized its Pacific seaports as a viable option in the market, whereas Costa Rica has not. However, we have a USD150-million modernization project in the works, currently awaiting approval from the government. The idea is to become a transfer service provider and develop the capacity to receive larger vessels for direct routes to Asia.</p><h4>What is the comparative advantage of Caldera Port?</h4><p>The most important advantage is that we are the nearest port to Panama and could handle alternative cargo from there. We do not pretend to replace it, but the market does need transshipping services; therefore, we could have a hub that feeds from Asia to Costa Rica and then facilitates shipping to the US. Our main advantage is that we know how to operate seaports. </p><h4>What challenges do you face operating in Costa Rica?</h4><p>The main challenge is overcoming the upgrading barrier. Costa Rica is a small country that requires better ports, not necessarily mega ports, but a modern terminal and first-generation ports on a smaller scale. For example, TCM on the Caribbean side is developing a port that merely has two piers, whereas Caldera has four. The most important challenge for Caldera is being great enough to support the commercial flow. We need to modernize Caldera Port and improve our service supply to the extent that Caldera becomes a viable location for Asian countries.</p><h4>How would you advise the Costa Rica government on upgrading the port?</h4><p>It should invest USD150 million. We need investment in Caldera, not just on the Caribbean coast, where it is already investing USD1 billion. Investing in both ports would increase the country's competitiveness. It is important to keep in mind that Limón and Caldera do not compete with each other; each port has its natural market and complement one another. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[all-power-to-the-people]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Coopesa get started?</h4><p>We started off in 1964 as a company called SALA, then owned by an American. Due to financial problems and eventual bankruptcy, it eventually dissolved. The employees of SALA, who had all sorts of salary problems, went to the legislative assembly and helped bring about a new law for the founding of a new self-managing cooperative. The employees then became owners and associates of the newly formed company, receiving various contracts with aircraft companies all around the world and became successful. The cooperative has now been around more than half a century and competes with many international companies such as Aeroman, (MRO Holdings), Lufthansa technics, Puerto Rico, and Mexicana. It has been a huge success, and we are now in the process of relocating to the southwest of the airport as part of a special government program. We have 620 employees, of which nearly 400 are associates, meaning partial owners of the overall “capital stock," so to speak. The other 220 are employees, not associates, though they have a unique culture. Coopesa is the only self-managing cooperative in the world dedicated to heavy aircraft maintenance. We are extremely proud of where we are today and who we are. We support more than 800 families through our operations and services.</p><h4>What services do you provide at Coopesa?</h4><p>We work with commercial narrow-body aircraft such as the Embraer, Boeing 737 series, and Airbus family. We are currently preparing for a new phase, seeking to go into wide-body aircraft, mainly Boeing 767 and 787s, which we expect to start on in the next two years. As for what we do, we take care of heavy maintenance for the airframe and engines, painting, interiors modifications, wireless, and line service in the airport gates. We are also currently doing jobs such as overnight special service for interiors for companies such as American Airlines. We will do the same with Copa as well. In addition, we will also do cargo conversion, which is a strong business for us, especially for 737 classics. However, our core business is heavy maintenance.</p><h4>Who are your biggest customers?</h4><p>LATAM from Chile and Brazil, Avianca, Copa, BoA, American Airlines, Cayman, Volaris, and Bahamas are our biggest customers, in addition to several leasing companies like Automatic, Nordic Aviation Capital, and GECAS. We have a great customer balance because every customer is important and we provide specialized services based on every customer's needs. </p><h4>How do you ensure client satisfaction and provide quality services?<br></h4><p>We always consult our clients and listen to their needs. We have a great deal of face-to-face meetings and always look for ways to work together to improve our services. Communication is key. In addition, we place great importance on turnaround time (TAT) for our customers, an extremely important factor for all airlines due to cost and time, especially with large ones. Some clients, such as Copa, are particularly focused on TAT to the point where it is a part of their slogan, so we have to meet those needs of all needs. </p><h4>What advantages and unique challenges does the cooperative structure provide?</h4><p>Cooperative company employees have strong rights and benefits, which mean higher costs. Besides that, the social structure of our cooperative is very flat and democratic. We have meetings with associates and employees every two or three months that are always face-to-face between groups of 50-60 people exchanging ideas, seeking to make improvements, listening to their ideas, and what not. This also enables us to more efficiently and faithfully meet and approach customer needs when we meet with our customers. All of this can be difficult; however, again, communication is key, and everyone knows what needs to be done to get the job done. Three or four years ago, we had many financial problems; however, currently the cooperative is strong, financially, strategically, and logistically in every sense. We are now in talks with associates about the path we need to take in coming years to grow, expand, and change the way we do certain things. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is the Costa Rican market for your business?</h4><p>We started the company here, and Costa Rica currently makes up 60% of our business. We have been growing by double digits overall and believe in investing in top-of-the-line technology and materials. We now have six different lines of business and a variety of products, including advertising in airports, shopping centers, digital and poster billboards, spectacles, wallscapes, buses, transit shelters, mobile digital billboards, and much more. We help the brands design and develop innovative and interactive media plans. Regionally, we are also in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Colombia. We were the first company to have a clear philosophy and transparency in price. We are the first to have a price list published every year on our website. One of our main strengths is the strategic locations we have for each of our products. We place our advertising platform in the main impact places with the most modern designs and state-of-the-art technology. We have a unique digital billboard circuit providing many advantages for smaller companies because they do not have to pay for printing, and costs are lower.</p><h4>How has advertising changed in the digital era?</h4><p>There has been a major shift from traditional to non-traditional media. According to recent studies, investments by large consumer companies that typically advertise on TV and print media—traditional media—are shifting to digital and out of home. Those are the two fastest-growing areas worldwide. Digital media has been growing by double digits, as has out-of-home media. We used to have 6-7% of the marketing expenditure and now represent close to 15-16% of total investment.</p><h4>How is this industry regulated in Costa Rica?</h4><p>The biggest weakness in our industry is the lack of regulation. The industry itself takes on the role of regulator and is working with the chamber of foreign publicity, the local government, and the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation (MOPT). There is a law and regulation in place, though they do not reflect current market conditions, so the industry and chamber are working with the government to update the law to incorporate new technologies. The speed with which this industry grows is faster than the speed with which it is regulated. There are some regulations in place, though they are not fully enforced. The backbone of the industry is formal companies, though around 30% are informal companies that come and go.</p><h4>How do you procure the land to set up these advertisements?</h4><p>The law is clear in that one can only advertise on private land. We sign a lease with private owners and put up the foundation for a billboard and need that contract to get the permit.</p><h4>Does the demand and supply for billboards match?</h4><p>Typically, it does; otherwise, we would see a great deal of empty spaces. There is only so much we can put up because the law mandates that ads be 100m apart. The ideal setup is digital and with more than one advertisement in the same space, which is why this is replacing so many static advertisements. It is flexible: we can immediately change the content and have different campaign versions at a time, and there is no pollution in terms of printing and disposing of large ads.  Although the initial cost might be higher, the investment is more efficient. It is energy saving and less time consuming, as everything is done remotely via the web.</p><h4>What alternatives for outdoor advertising are there outside of traditional billboards?</h4><p>There are many—airports, shopping centers, buses, mobile billboards, wifi advertising, and bus stops, among others. As an additional value for regional brands, we have exposure in shopping centers in all Central America and Colombia and in Costa Rica offer exclusive advertising in shopping centers and the airport. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Aerial Robotixs?</h4><p>Aerial Robotixs is a young company specializing in the business of research, development, integration, and the provision of innovative solutions using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to serve the engineering and agricultural sectors. A Costa Rican company based in San José, it has business partners from the US, Canada, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and China and is staffed with a multi-disciplinary group of professionals and engineers from Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Venezuela.  </p><h4>What products and services do you provide to your clients?</h4><p>Aerial Robotixs services the agriculture and engineering industries, with solution offerings that combine software, services, and UAV flight systems, be it either fixed-wing or multi-rotor ships equipped with the proper on-board sensors to gather imagery and/or data that facilitates the study and understanding of a particular area of interest. We are capable of covering large areas with ease and capturing survey-grade data to create a broad range of derived products, from digital terrain and surface models (DTM/DSM) to identifying pests and crop disease. Aerial Robotixs has developed software workflows that automate processing, leverage cloud-computing platforms to manage large amounts of data, and facilitate running artificial intelligence algorithms to produce analytics and knowledge that can be used to support the decision making process. For example, in agriculture, we produce information about the health of a crop or soil composition that serves as input to machine control systems that guides the tractor to perform an automated variable-dose fertilization process. We have been working with the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity (ICE), National Geographic Institute (IGN), Costa Rica Fire Department, National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the UN Office for Engineering Project Services (UNOPS), just to name a few.</p><h4>What are some of the most important projects you have participated in?</h4><p>We have been involved in the new bridge over the Sixaola River on the border between Panama and Costa Rica, line two of the Panama Metro, and the provisioning of survey-grade digital cartography for a new highway in Venezuela, an important one for the east of the country that connects the capital with petroleum-rich regions.</p><h4>What strategic partnerships do you have with other companies to innovate and create new products?</h4><p>Aerial Robotixs is currently working with Intel to develop specialized software to test our hybrid tech flight control systems, as well as DJI, a global leader in the drone industry. We are working with an international software company in Venezuela to design, develop, and deploy the architecture of our software system.</p><h4>Does the company have any plans to expand internationally?</h4><p>We are currently working on a business strategy to expand elsewhere in Central America. The market is there, and through joint collaboration with specialized local partners, we plan to provide the best service to customers with close proximity to their solution provider.</p><h4>What is the company doing in terms of research and development?</h4><p>We have been working for the last four years integrating electronic components, flight control systems, telecommunication systems, and developing our own drones (fixed wing systems), especially integrating sensors. That is the most important part of a flight system, as the sensor will capture the data. We are working, for example, with hyper-spectral sensors and are probably the only company in the region using hyper-spectral sensors for agricultural purposes. We are also working on testing different kinds of software, algorithms, and workflows to process and analyze data.</p><h4>Why should companies work with Aerial Robotixs as a partner?<br></h4><p>Aerial Robotixs is a one-stop shop that offers deep know-how from years of research and development and extensive practical experience in the field in this still young industry. Our proven track record of success in the exploitation of UAV, remote sensing, and photogrammetry proves our ability to make all this technology work in unison. This makes Aerial Robotixs the most unique ICT company in the region, with spanning capacity to operate in different countries and varied conditions throughout Latin America. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Global Dip for Talent]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-global-dip-for-talent]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief synopsis of Fiserv and its operations in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Fiserv was born in 1984 in Wisconsin and now has 23,000 associates and roughly 12,000 clients in 80 countries. Operations in Costa Rica began in 2004. It started as a small office, an extension of a team in the US providing basic services to regional banks. After some success the company started to grow, and a few years later we became part of Fiserv's Global Services division. As we grew, we not only supported Latin America but also began to do some software development and support for different parts of the globe. Right now, the Costa Rica division has over 600 associates. We offer product development, professional services, product support, infrastructure, as well as HR services for US associates and other clients. </p><h4>Is the business continuing to grow here?</h4><p>Yes, though it has slowed down in the last year and half for two main reasons. Costa Rica has become more expensive as a country and Fiserv has a large center in India. Nowadays, technology allows one to do everything from anywhere in the world. Therefore, it makes business and financial sense to use India more extensively. They have the talent, quality, and cost, so it is becoming more difficult to compete. The second reason is that rather than trying to do everything that we are asked to do, we are becoming more strategic and focusing on those services that can be better delivered from a near-shore location. We are looking to provide mostly higher value services, which are better done from here than India or other offshore centers.</p><h4>What operation makes sense to keep here?</h4><p>We are looking mostly at client-facing activities, which would benefit from Costa Rica having the same time zone as the US, as that allows us to service our clients during the day, whereas India's operations are good for non-time-zone dependent activities. Therefore, client-facing and daytime support are the main drivers. One more area we are evaluating is consumer support for some of our clients, which is something we do not have today. </p><h4>Is the overall process of doing business in the country challenging?<br></h4><p>We have a relatively positive environment, and there are solid institutions really trying to help new and existing businesses. We are in good shape today, which does not mean that we will not have challenges in the future, which there will always be. For instance, if we talk about talent, people tend to be very productive and committed in Costa Rica; that is what has gotten us to the point where we are today. We need more people with the skills required by the new global economy. We cannot take a kid out of college and put him in front of a vice president of a bank. This is not something that you can train in a few weeks; it requires experience and soft skills such as communication and leadership. And considering that Costa Rica's talent pool is rather small, this may become more of a challenge in the next 10-15 years. </p><h4>Are your clients from Costa Rica?</h4><p>They are mostly from the US, with some from Latin America—Mexico, Colombia, and Chile for the most part, in addition to some clients in the Caribbean. Recently, we have started to develop a team to sell our products and services in Costa Rica and facilitate further expansion in Latin America, so we will hopefully have a few local clients very soon.</p><h4>Why do people choose to work with you?</h4><p>We are not widely known because we are B2B: we sell to business institutions and white-label our products. Nobody sees our logo like IBM, or HP, or Citibank. When I joined, that was one of the greatest opportunities I had seen. So we started working on a branding initiative geared towards the IT community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Serving All Industries]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[serving-all-industries]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did NTT Data choose Costa Rica to establish its LatAm presence?</h4><p>The company decided to open a new nearshore center in Latin America to maximize its potential and Costa Rica was chosen after an in-depth assessment among different strong players like Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Panama; the country offers very attractive conditions: cost efficiencies, convenient time zone, geographical location, highly educated workforce, and socio-political stability, among others. We started operations officially in April 2016 with 14 employees and now we have about 100 people. NTT Data Services is a large multinational and with its headquarters in Plano, Texas. We have a presence in over 50 countries and an annual revenue of approx. USD16 billion. Our client mainstream comes from Fortune 500 companies (80% are currently part of global client portfolio), and have nearly 110,000 professionals around the world. With regards to Costa Rica, our plan is to grow to over 300-400 people within three to four years.</p><h4>Which parts of the business do you seek to grow?</h4><p>We serve all industries and the goal is to develop our local presence in consulting and managed services areas such as: digital and application services; infrastructure, financial services and insurance; healthcare and life sciences; cloud and security services; and enterprise application services. I would like to engage with the local medical devices sector to provide IT services; our company has vast experience serving this industry. In Costa Rica today, we provide IT application and production support to clients belonging to the financial services, medical, retail, and insurance industries. We also serve enterprise application services such as Oracle and SalesForce.com and that is another area for growth during 2018. One of the biggest challenges that we have encountered so far is that the talent is there, though not in the quantities we need. The demand for IT resources in the local market is quite aggressive, pushing costs up and restraining the number of available candidates. On top of that, technologies are diverse and evolving, so eventually we find out that some technical skillsets are not even present or available in the region.</p><h4>What are you doing to facilitate the growth of your employees?</h4><p>We foster personal and technical development within our culture; we possess a huge learning training platform with more than 3,000 free technical courses for our employees and a proprietary training certification institute with more than 14 certified programs (i.e. java, .net, SQL, PM, etc.). When our clients want a certain profile, they are not able to afford any extra cost to build them and we therefore have to invest. We work to pull together programs internally with our center of expertise and with universities. We also bring in recent graduates and train them via our training program, called Campus to Career. Campus to Career provides in-depth technical training in particular core technologies, for example SQL, Java, project management, and so on. Once we take that candidate into the job, the learning curve eases. Our company appraises meritocracy; therefore, we promote a “rotational" exchange program whereby employees are offered the opportunity to work for 1-2-year periods in another country so they can apply their expertise and learn from foreign cultures.</p><h4>Why should people choose NTT Data as a strategic partner to solve their IT problems?</h4><p>NTT Data is well recognized as a top player in the industry. We were the ninth-largest in IT services worldwide in 2016 by market share (Gartner), 13th largest in consulting services in 2016, and fifth in 2017 IDC Financial Insights from FinTech Rankings: Top 100. NTT Group operates 240+ data centers worldwide, processes 100 million healthcare claims annually, serves 25 of the leading financial institutions in North America, serves the top-10 automotive companies worldwide, manages more than 300 million security identities, and supports almost 4 million end users and 11+ million service desk contacts annually. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Big Data, Big Changes]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[big-data-big-changes]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Costa Rica is preparing for this new era of digital transformation, including big data and automation. How do you see Costa Rica aligning with Accenture's global strategy?</h4><p>
	It is key for us because we are now experiencing a new technological revolution. The way we approach this revolution is by shaping the future, unlocking clients' potential, and harnessing the revolution by being ready with the right skill sets and talents for the market's needs. Accenture always tries to be a step ahead in terms of the demand. We know what is trendy before it becomes trendy, and we prepare our talent for that specific disruption. We have been able to do this by shaping the talent and unlocking human resource potential through training, processes, and operational excellence. We are able to adapt whatever technological know-how and flexibility our people have. We try to specialize our people in several technologies and have experts in a lot of end-to-end processes.
</p><h4>
	What kind of processes are you seeing the most demand for?
</h4><p>
	Big data is one. User experience, cloud computing, and analytics are also trending right now. Analytics is where we are playing the most and where we are bringing in more resources. We recently acquired a company that operates mostly in big data and analytics specifically so that we can further expand our footprint and capabilities in analytics.</p><h4>What do recent investments in acquiring new companies, such as Search Technologies, represent for Accenture?</h4><p>
	Accenture is growing quickly through its acquisitions. We are acquiring companies that are innovative and offer value-added services. We are not doing acquisitions to add capacity, we care about innovation. We acquired Search Technologies specifically because of its big data skills and ability to organize unstructured data. This is something for which our clients are really looking. This acquisition allows us to organize data coming from different systems, files, and outcomes, and then make it predictable for our clients. This is bringing a lot of value as a tool to our clients.</p><h4>What trends do you see coming in innovation over the next few years?</h4><p>
	We will see more artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and automation efforts that can translate into more robotics and less repetitive work. Over the next three years, human beings are going to see an opportunity to specialize in tasks that really add value and are not repetitive and boring. It is just a matter of specializing human talents in those new skills sets that are coming. Big data is going to be a huge area for us to continue targeting at Accenture, because of the amount of content companies now receive and have to absorb. We call this the Tsunami of Content, and it is coming from sources such as social media, reporting, analytics, and expert opinions. The companies that are able to use all this information in their decision making are the ones that are going to be successful in the future.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for 2018 at Accenture?</h4><p>
	We have had a 20% YoY growth rate. We are aiming for 25% growth in 2018. We are going to keep supporting our Diverse Workforce Initiative in order to reach a 50/50 gender balance. By 2025, Accenture will be fully balanced in terms of gender equality. We believe that companies that are more inclusive and diverse are the organizations that will get a comprehensive value internally and eventually for their clients. We are also going to continue to support our low carbon economy vision. This means we will continue to bring more digital into our environment to mitigate carbon emissions. The last goal for 2018 is to be more strategic in other geographies. Providing more services to more regions for Accenture is going to be huge for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Market Leader]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[market-leader]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the efforts behind making Telefónica the leader of LTE 4G in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We have had a clear vision of what we needed to do in the country. There have been three pillars that have taken us to our current position. We are the second carrier in the Costa Rican market and a referent in LTE technology. The first of these pillars has been deploying a robust network, particularly in LTE 4G. In fact, we were the pioneers of developing this technology throughout the country. Currently, we cover 83% of the population in terms of 4G and 98% of the population for 3G. Another of our strategies has been developing innovative products that truly adapt to the needs of customers. A third element, which is one of the most important, is ensuring customers have a great experience and are satisfied with our services. Our investments have not been only toward deploying our network, but also on availability of service and ensuring that customer experience and service are satisfactory. In six years of operations, we have invested over USD600 million.</p><h4>How has Movistar impacted the telecoms market in Costa Rica?</h4><p>In our six years of operations, our main focus has always been the customer. Developing our products has resulted in over 2.3 million customers. On top of this, our focus on service has helped expand our market share. According to SUTEL, we had 25% of the market share in 2016 and estimated 27.1% in 2017. This has allowed us grow rapidly, positively impacting the Costa Rican market, since we have deployed our service to regions outside the GAM, providing our customers with greater connectivity and benefits. Some of the greatest effects on the market have been the development of innovative products and a robust network, and we have been pioneers in products and services that our competitors have followed. Another of our main focuses has been facilitating the lives of our customers, giving them the ability to auto manage their accounts and providing a satisfactory service. We are at the top of rankings of SUTEL for customer satisfaction, while other studies such as Open Signal have ranked our network as the best in the key terms such as network availability and latency. We recently won 40 MHz in the last spectrum auction and with large investments in the first quarter of 2018 we will use this spectrum to improve our mobile networks and increase speeds.</p><h4>How has Telefónica innovated with its B2B solutions?</h4><p>We have a customized and differentiated service, depending on the type of customer. In the B2B segment, we developed a robust portfolio of services for large, medium, and small companies, as well as for the government. We develop services that boost their business and facilitate the operations of companies in a productive way. In our catalog, we have fixed-data solutions, mobile data, cybersecurity services, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, and mobile applications, as well as new services, such as sponsored data. We also have a fleet management service in order to control and measure the use of transport fleets. We are also developing IoT and working with municipalities on the subject of smart cities. There is a significant number of B2B services and that is because we have the support of Grupo Telefónica, which develops them and we adapt them to the Costa Rican market. We have grown 45% in the last year in B2B services in Costa Rica and our bet is to continue to focus on innovating our digital solutions to offer to the corporate segment, so we are able to compete with the major operators of the market.</p><h4>What is your perspective of the telecoms sector in 2018?</h4><p>In 2018, we will continue to develop innovative products. We have prepared a portfolio of services for 2018, with which our customers will find benefits and will be able to choose from. Our objective remains clear: to take care of our 2.3 million customers through customer service, innovative products, customer experience and user-friendly interface, and, above all, products that allow us to be an integral operator. It will be an interesting year for the telecoms sector and mobile operators due the need to anticipate customers' requirements and being competitive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is your goal now to nurture and create more business within the US or are you looking at Canada and the rest of Latin America as well?</h4><p>My main focus is to increase our aerospace business in the US. However, we are investigating opportunities and developing a strategy for South America, and Canada will soon be our third market. In South America, our targets are Chile and Argentina, which are major markets with great growth potential.</p><h4>Why do customers choose a smaller firm like yours versus larger players in the region?</h4><p>We are really focused on the customer. Everything has to do with the customer and their perception. We have been going head-to-head with Mexican companies and lost some contracts to them as well as China. Having said that, even though companies are becoming more cost sensitive and Mexico has the shipping advantage, we have developed strategies of our own to control shipping costs, maintain quality, and focus on customer support. Shipping companies give us a great rate for returning goods from here to the US, and instead of making a profit on that, we pass along those savings to our customers. To compete better, we have learned from all these adverse experiences and created a strategy to overcome them. We do this through our team of six managers, including myself, with two female engineers. Around 85% of our workforce are women. Another reason we can succeed as a smaller company is because the regional market does not have extremely large customers. They choose smaller companies because their orders are not large. They require good customer service, including on-time delivery, good quality, and competitive pricing, and they know that their orders will be important to a medium-sized company like Camtronics. Costa Rica has managed to project itself as a country where quality and serious work practices are valued and practiced.</p><h4>How did the notion of aerospace as an economic differentiator come about and why aerospace specifically?</h4><p>Based upon data from its marketing department, Procomer came to the conclusion that there was a good opportunity for machining companies in Costa Rica to work in the aerospace industry because of its variety and volume in manufactured mechanical parts. Procomer's approach was to help various companies with free zone status to accompany them in commercial missions and, more recently, facilitate important trade fairs within the aerospace sector. The next step was to integrate all those machining companies as well as electronics and service companies into a cluster. There is a large number of machining companies with the right capabilities which have unused capacity. Once we enter into higher volume, we need quality control and more manufacturing specifications. This will place great strain on the cluster in the next year, since many do not want to take any chances. They are present in the industry and paying the fees but are too easygoing. The core problem within the aerospace cluster is that there are few companies that have an aggressive approach.</p><h4>Are some companies ripe for acquisition from someone who would make them more aggressive and competitive?</h4><p>For the aerospace cluster to become strong, there are certain phases it must go through. It has electronics and machining but it desperately needs finishing, which is lacking in this country. If we had to entice an American company to come in, we would like to go into finishing, as that will support all areas of machining and would really provide an overall lift to the industry. Currently, Camtronics is not looking for an acquisition, but rather for large, long-term customers who will allow for continuous growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of FEMSA's operation in the region?</h4><p>We bottle for Coca-Cola in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, and the Central American region at large. We also serve Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, and the Philippines. With 10% of total Coca-Cola sales, we are the largest bottler of Coke in the world in terms of volume.</p><h4>Many companies come to invest and operate in Costa Rica. Apart from lower costs, what is the benefit of doing so?</h4><p>Everything started here as a supply base for the Andean division. The other factor was the Coca-Cola Company had its operations here in Costa Rica and was, therefore, a good fit for us. Over time that division changed, and Colombia and Venezuela went on to report to the Latin America division, while Central America retained Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Costa Rica.</p><h4>Are there other potential business opportunities for Coca-Cola in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We have two plants in Costa Rica. FEMSA is for soft drinks, while the Coronado plant handles production of all non-carbonated products. With these two plants, we cover almost everything within the beverage category. We do not produce or sell alcoholic or dairy products, apart from the latter in Panama.</p><h4>Where do you see the growth of the company in 2018?</h4><p>We still have opportunities for growth in the soft drink market. Undoubtedly, there are also important growth opportunities in other categories such as tea, juices, and isotonic drinks. Another category in which we are making an important effort is with the Monster energy drink.</p><h4>How does Costa Rican soda consumption compare to Mexico for example?</h4><p>The case of Mexico is particular. This is because Coca-Cola was part of the family basket of basic goods in Mexico. For a long time, it was also sold at a relatively low price, which made it easy for people to get used to drinking. That did not happen in other countries. Mexico has the largest per-capita consumption of Coca-Cola in the world. In the case of beverages, we can continue growing through new flavors and formulas and new and different ways of marketing. For example, in Costa Rica we are growing in the cola segment at almost 5% due to the marketing campaign for Coca-Cola without sugar.</p><h4>What are the main business challenges faced in Costa Rica?</h4><p>So far, we have developed an excellent way to operate and manage our business in Costa Rica, we have had our challenges but we have overcome them all. An interesting issue arised when we launched a new formula for Fanta without sugar (Fanta Frontier). However, the Costa Rican market continues to demand the original formula, so we continue to work with both. This has been a great learning opportunity within the company and an important message from the market. For example, in California, the market continues to demand for soft drinks sweetened with sugarcane. Therefore, we have to bring sugarcane from Mexico to manufacture the product according to the market's wishes. This product is then sold for 40% more than more standardized products manufactured elsewhere in the US not made from cane. Moreover, the problem is not necessarily sugar, but excessive consumption. This is the root of so many products' problems: one must avoid excessive consumption.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2018?</h4><p>We have made a substantial strategic change during the past five months. We have worked to align our prices to the purchasing power of the Costa Rican consumer. In doing so, we have made a large investment and hope to have a return in 2018. </p><h4>What commitments are shared by FEMSA and Costa Rica?</h4><p>We are in a green country, and we support the process of environmental conservation and sustainable development here. We have several recycling campaigns and water reuse projects. Coca-Cola FEMSA is committed to generating economic, social, and environmental value for all of its stakeholders across the value chain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you compete with a company like Walmart?</h4><p>Walmart is much larger than us; however, today with our generic brands we are a close competitor. However, we are not just selling a TV; we sell solutions. A large portion of our customers do not have available credit. We also operate a consumer sales finance unit because we directly finance 60-70% of sales depending on the country. We have a portfolio of more than 1.3 million credit operations, which we call nano-credit because we operate credit loans of an average balance of around USD300. We offer financing for segments that are completely out of any banking operations in the countries in which we operate. Around 50% of our customers are clients that are not in the formal economy; they do not have a steady salary every month. In Nicaragua, for example, around 70% of our customers make less than USD300 a month. They make up the base of the pyramid and do not have access to credit. The size of the financing is so small that they are not profitable for a bank.</p><h4>Are you looking at any other new markets or are you nurturing the ones that you have?</h4><p>We seek to be humble in our interest in Peru. Peru is almost the same size as Central America and it took us a decade to expand to this region. Currently we do not have any plans for further expansion. We should focus on Peru and develop our business and consolidate our position there. Every five years we go into a competitive strategy process. The last was in 2015 and we were clear that we were not looking for another market until 2020.</p><h4>What risks are related to the financing side of the business?</h4><p>The credit business is a risk management operation. There is nothing wrong with risk if you know how to measure and project it. We know how to measure it because for 10 years we have been implementing the best practices of consumer finance to our operations and have complex models that we have developed with FICO in the US, which are the gold standards of credit score operations in the world. Currently, we are operating our fourth generation of models. We perhaps have the only set of models based on more than 6 million credit histories in the base of the pyramid of Central America. That gives us the possibility of truly measuring risk and facilitating financing for those families that would otherwise not have any other option of access to durable goods relevant to their quality of life. There is a difference in risk according to the country; we have a lower risk in Costa Rica and Nicaragua than in Guatemala or Honduras. The business model is adapted to every country and we have a sustainable model for that, though it is very different from a traditional bank. We have a risk-based pricing strategy and are extremely comfortable with offering several financing conditions adapted to every customer segment.</p><h4>Do you compete with the secondhand market with people who know how to fix products?</h4><p>That is a not a large market; there is a small percentage of resale in certain countries in tires and a large secondhand tire business in certain countries in Central America. However, there is not a large market of used products when it comes to TVs, stoves, and so on. Cellphones, for example, are more affordable today, and our financing gives even the lower-income segments the opportunity to get a hold of a new product with a warranty from the brand and from us by paying monthly installments. The availability of products at affordable prices with monthly installments is an incentive for families to purchase new products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the chamber in representing companies in the industrial sector?</h4><p>As an organization that represents the production sector, we help companies do business. This revolves around competitiveness, helping build an appropriate investment environment, generating employment, producing and selling high-quality products with added value, and competing with the world. We are responsible for helping to facilitate these things within the business environment so companies can grow. Facing the fourth industrial revolution, we have to help build the industry of the future. This has to do with innovation, entrepreneurship, and building the appropriate environment. In order to represent the interest of our members, we propose policies and work closely with the government to help create the conditions required by industrial policy in Costa Rica. We see policy as actions that help enhance the conditions of the country, starting with research, development, and human resource development, some of our strongest assets in Costa Rica but for which we need to build strategic alliances.</p><h4>How does the chamber help local companies develop and engage with international manufacturers?</h4><p>We have a special free zone regime with companies from different sectors. For example, we have the medical device cluster, which is important in Costa Rica and where leading companies manufacture products that are exported to the world. It is important to get the local companies engaged so they can play an important role as suppliers of those companies in order to add value to their manufacturing process. High added value is the most important contribution to our economy and helps keep companies in Costa Rica. We work together with Procomer and CINDE to help local companies engage with the free-zone manufactures. At the same time we help those companies develop their own export capacity. They supply companies with products and services in the free-zone regime and are then able to achieve export capacity on their own and export to the world. We will start building an industrial park in the coming months where we intend to have a second facility of the Chamber of Industries focused on education and human resources training to help SMEs grow, while also establishing the industries of the future. With this park we will grant facilitation, technology support, permit process assistance, and proximity to infrastructure, the airport, and free-zone companies so they can sell them products and services.</p><h4>What are the benefits and challenges of establishing an industry in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Costa Rica has a great environment for business, though we need to face up to some challenges. Permits are still a bottleneck we need to improve. The government needs to understand that the development of the country has been achieved by creating those conditions for companies to get properly and speedily established. Many of the challenges have to do with the generation of employment. The Costa Rican economy is growing at an average level of 4% per year; it grew at 7-8% years ago. If we go back and recreate those conditions, we can generate more employment, exports, growth, and income. We need to add value to agricultural sectors. To do so, we need to innovate and think big. To make things happen we need to work as a team.</p><h4>How do you see the transformation of the industrial sector in Costa Rica in five years?</h4><p>I do not necessarily see the industry today as that of the future. For that reason it is extremely important that we innovate. Costa Rica has a diversified economy today; however, we do not see a bright future without a strong industrial sector. The industrial sector of the future has not yet been created. The speed of technology is going to take us through innovation and new economic activities. This is why higher added value is extremely important, as well as competitiveness, productivity, and the capacity of human resources and a strong educational system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Listed on stock exchange after 39 years in operation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rahmad-pribadi-ceo-pt-semen-baturaja-tbk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a short introduction to the background of PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk?</h4><p>PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk was founded in 1974 as a state-owned company, though today it is a publicly listed company with 24% public ownership and the remainder owned by the Indonesian government. The saying that “life begins at 40" is apt for PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk because it decided to list on the stock exchange when the company was 39 years old. That same year, the company decided to add additional production capacity, and today we have a total capacity of 3.85 million tons of cement per year. The construction of our second cement plant was the fastest in Indonesian history, taking just 26 months. PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk is a niche player compared to others in the cement industry here. We have a production base in the center of South Sumatra province and our sales cover four provinces of Sumatra: South Sumatra, Lampung, Jambi, and Bengkulu. What makes this market interesting is that the production capacity in Sumatra is still lower than the demand. To be more specific, total demand in southern Sumatra is 6.5 million tons of cement per year, while our capacity, as the only producer in the region, is only 3.85 million tons per year. This means this particular market is capable of growing, unlike in other parts of the country. In South Sumatra, the growth in demand for cement is steadily increasing, most likely as a result of the government's policy to have a more decentralized fiscal regime and that is region is rich in oil, palm plantations, copper, and coffee. Thus, this region of Indonesia has been enjoying healthy economic growth.</p><h4>Is PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk currently producing at full capacity?</h4><p>We have a new plant that just came online in September 2017, and are thus ramping up our production. We expect a significant increase in our sales volume in 2018. In 2017, our sales should reach close to USD1.9 million and this looks set increase to around USD2.75 million in 2018. This is firstly because the market is there. Secondly, one of the largest projects of the government's connectivity infrastructure plan is constructing a trans-Sumatra toll road from the southern to the northern tip, which will require a great deal of cement. In addition, once that toll road is up and running, the economy will start growing along that route. When the economy prospers, basic industries such as cement will also experience a growth in demand. Thus, while there is an excess cement capacity of 40% in Indonesia in 2017, we see potential for healthy growth in our market and are extremely optimistic for 2018.</p><h4>In addition to your strategic location, what makes PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk stand out from other competitors?</h4><p>Being right in the market is extremely important in a number of ways; by being in close proximity to customers' projects, we can ensure the availability of the product and quicker delivery. Proximity also means it costs our customers less to get their cement delivered. Our setup makes us stand out and gives us great advantage over our competitors. In terms of the industrial cycle, we are coming into a consolidation period, which means the market share of the three largest players will start to decline due to new players coming in. We see this as an opportunity because market growth will exceed the capacity of the three main players. For a player like us, we see an opportunity to enter a market that has been underserved and we will expand and perhaps go beyond South Sumatra. We are looking at the various markets in Indonesia at the moment and see some potential. As a smaller player, we cannot compete with a larger regional and international players. However, there are places that larger companies have left open and those are the places we will concentrate on. We are a niche player in South Sumatra and can play the same game in different areas. We also want to differentiate ourselves from other players by being an environmentally friendly cement producer.</p><h4>How do you incorporate environmentally friendly practices into your cement production?</h4><p>This is the main area we are focusing on currently. We have invited forestry experts from one of Indonesia's leading universities to assist us in improving environment condition. We are proud to be the first company in Indonesia to implement silviculture as our method to preserve and improve quality of surrounding environment. By implementing silviculture, we are converting the land around our quarries to be healthier for plant growth, and hence the quality of environment will improve. In 2017, we did a biodiversity survey and found some endangered species and are now planning a conservation area to help protect those endangered species. We would like to prove that when managed correctly, extractive industries can work alongside and in fact improve the quality of the environment while increasing their capacity. Higher production does not have to come at a cost to the environment. This is one of the key differences in PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk's strategy and in the future customers will look for companies that look after their environment better than the rest. This is our vision—to be recognized as the most environmentally friendly cement company in Indonesia.</p><h4>What can the government do to further support the cement industry in Indonesia?</h4><p>The government can play a role from both the supply and demand side. On the supply side, with Indonesia current excess capacity, putting a moratorium on the installation of new capacity would help the industry. The way to have healthy growth is to ensure that all players are able to be healthy. On the demand side, the government's efforts toward infrastructure are a great thing. It introduces a great deal of economic activity into many places in Indonesia and we would like to see that continue. Deregulation should be a positive thing. In 2015, the government relaxed the mortgage requirements for house purchasers and reduced property sales tax from 5% to 2.5%, for up to a certain property value. Moreover, the government's infrastructure developments have definitely helped improve bulk cement sales for our industry.</p><h4>Where would you like PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk to be in a year's time?</h4><p>In a year's time, PT Semen Baturaja (Persero) Tbk would like to be not only the number-four publicly listed cement company, but also ranked number four in terms of our capacity, revenue, and more. We would like to capture the opportunities that will arise from consolidation over the coming year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you seek to accomplish during your time as GM?</h4><p>We want to continue to grow, though with high value-added processes, by developing new functional areas and perfecting the current ones. Emerson currently has many business units. For example, we are working on the product support perspective that conducts tests and prototype designs, and we would like to expand this.</p><h4>What other countries were candidates before Emerson entered Costa Rica in 2008?</h4><p>Emerson also looked at Mexico, Brazil, and Panama. It already had a significant footprint in Mexico with a relevant commercial and manufacturing capability. One of the reasons that we came here to Costa Rica was to expand and diversify.</p><h4>How has the company grown since opening its new facility in 2015?</h4><p>When we started, we had half of a floor at the old facility. Then, we were growing rapidly and required more space and thus moved into this complex. To date, we occupy four whole floors of a new building with 700 people. We have been diversifying since we started as an engineering center and are now growing in this regard.</p><h4>Has this exceeded the company's expectations of Costa Rica?</h4><p>Definitely. The original idea was to be an engineering center; however, we started to diversify into accounting, finances, and so on. We expected 2017 to be flat in terms of growth; however, we grew by double digits and expect another similar growth for 2018 as well. We are active in the oil and gas industry, power generation (including geothermal and renewables), life sciences, pulp and paper, and chemical industries, just to name a few.</p><h4>Costa Rica is a small country; is there a cap to the amount of highly skilled talent?</h4><p>There are certain areas that we would like to expand in, though we will have some limitations. We need specific profiles for big data analysis, such as mathematicians to do these analyses. One interesting thing we have learned is that in the beginning, some of the roles were designed for engineers; however, we could train technicians and help them grow in their roles. That has truly opened the way we manage the company. It is great to look for the best of the best when we have it; however, when there are intermediate levels that can help manage growth, that is extremely beneficial.</p><h4>How important is Costa Rica to the overall company?</h4><p>In terms of sales, it is a small country for the company, but it is extremely strategic. We support the Americas from here, not only North America which is around 60% of our coverage, but also Latin America with 30%, which is consistent with the ratio of sales. From a strategic point of view, we can leverage business units in Costa Rica given the fact that we are located in a free trade zone. Our clients are international which is another important element to consider.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges of working in Costa Rica?</h4><p>Mobility for our employees is becoming a challenge, especially being caught in traffic for several hours a day and being non-productive or not being able to spend time with their families. Furthermore, working remotely is not an option for some roles, especially related to innovation, because it is key that the teams work together in those cases. This is an issue for us currently. In the short term, fixing the public transport system would make a huge difference.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the short term?</h4><p>In 2018, the main event will be the elections, and it will be exciting. One of the great benefits of being based in Costa Rica as a foreign investor is that there are no large swings or changes during election periods, as is the case in other countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[betting-big]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Coopelesca evolved over time, becoming one of the most important companies in the San Carlos region?</h4><p>Coopelesca is a cooperative that was founded in 1965 with the objective of providing energy to the northern area of Costa Rica, approximately 10% of the country. In 2017, we entered the business of telecommunications with the main objective of providing internet connection and improving connectivity in this area. To date we have increased the internet penetration rate from 3% to 53%. Within this project, we also provide cable television services; almost 55,000 of our 85,000 members use those services. As a part of this change, we decided to venture in the retail market with our appliance stores in the area of San Carlos, Sarapiquí­, and Pocosol with competitive prices in the market and financing with low prices. We have also ventured into the insurance business in partnership with Insurance National Institute; we commercialize the most important insurance for our community. Our business core is energy; we not only distribute, but also generate our own energy through hydroelectric plants, representing 73% of our total energy consumption. We also have a wide project portfolio. Currently we are developing a photovoltaic project of 5MW in Buenos Aires de Pocosol in partnership with Conelectricas, the first solar project in the area. The goal is for it to be operational by 2018.</p><h4>Why did Coopelesca decide to diversify its services?</h4><p>The mission of a cooperative is to satisfy the needs of its members, which is why we supply electric energy. Additionally, we decided to provide telecommunications services because a large part of the infrastructure we have can be used for these services, and given our knowledge of the distribution of energy, it made sense to incorporate cable and the internet as well. Families require not only housing, water, electricity, and infrastructure, but connectivity as well. Connectivity is key for the development of any society in order to reach the living standards of the modern world. Furthermore, with the diversification of our services we generate other sources of revenue that translate into greater benefits to the owners of this cooperative who are all of our associates.</p><h4>Do you see changes in the way of producing energy in Costa Rica moving to more sustainable methods?</h4><p>It has to be clear that producing clean energy is not always the cheapest way, and at the moment there is strong debate in the country since nearly the 98% of the national output of energy is produced by renewable sources. However, pricing is a key issue because the government believes our prices are high and cannot compete with other countries, such as Mexico or the US, who use polluting energy sources but are ultimately competitive in price. For that reason, we need to take advantage of all possible sources that we have here in Costa Rica, such as natural gas, biogas, and distributed generation, and we need to make it work for the planet and for our country by improving the laws and the regulation.</p><h4>What are the challenges, goals, and new investments of Coopelesca for 2018?</h4><p>First, we have the photovoltaic project taking place in Buenos Aires de Pocosol, which is a large and ambitious development. Also, we plan to use geothermic energy of low enthalpy and wind energy, which can be developed in this region easily. In terms of telecommunications, our bet is on the bandwidth of the internet. Another great bet is a total redesign of the services in order to achieve four things: efficiency, excellent service to all members, greater income from our own sources, and strengthening the insurance business unit. San Carlos is a region with great potential to grow and attract foreign investment because we have many opportunities that can be set here. Finally, looking for a member participation in the consumption, the smart grid project will be an important goal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What you seek to accomplish at RECOPE?</h4><p>I am a civil engineer, and my background is in the electric energy sector. I am also the first female president of RECOPE, which represents a change in vision in and of itself. RECOPE has a strong influence on the Costa Rican economy since it supplies two-thirds of the total energy consumption of our country. Although almost all our electric energy—99%—is generated by renewable energy sources, we have an expensive system to supply fuel because RECOPE does not refine oil. Costa Rica's non-renewable energy sources, especially those required for the transportation system, are based on fossil fuels. Our national oil system is one of the best in Central America, and we have been working to demonstrate the importance of our role and the quality and performance we offer the country. It would be a great idea to refine oil in Costa Rica; it is the most important challenge for RECOPE. Another important aspect is to change the legislation that limits RECOPE to using only oil derivatives in supplying the country's energy demand. This means it is impossible to use alternative clean energy sources. In fact, for several years we have submitted to Congress requests to reform the law to achieve this openness in the energy sources used, such as alternative clean energy sources like hydrogen and others.</p><h4>As a fuel distributor, what specific role does RECOPE play in reducing the national carbon footprint?</h4><p>New regulations regarding the standard emissions nationally have been achieved. This regulation includes new parameters, specifically for gasoline and diesel. The standard itself is comparable to the Euro 4 standard, which cuts emissions by up to 60%. We also import oil with better quality specifications that generate lower emissions after combustion.</p><h4>Is there a policy or plan to impose fines or taxes on vehicles that exceed emission standards?</h4><p>There has been an annual vehicular review in place for many years that requires all vehicles to pass an emission test in order to be able to drive in the country. This is done though a company called Riteve. This company manages the whole emissions and technical revisions in the whole country. On the other hand, RECOPE's role is to supply high-quality fuel with features that allow the country to reduce its carbon footprint. One of the most important problems we have in the country, regarding carbon footprint, is private vehicles.</p><h4>How much of your total fuel import volume is used on transportation?</h4><p>We do have an energetic matrix: 20% electricity, 8% biomass, 5% firewood, 1% coal, and 66% petroleum derivatives. Of the petroleum derivatives, 82% is for transportation, 11% for industrial, and 7% miscellaneous usage. This is the reason Costa Rica is challenged with developing a clean and efficient mass transit system. In addition, the petroleum industry must operate smoothly to facilitate the renewable and clean energy sources industry.</p><h4>Do you have other objectives for 2018?</h4><p>We are working on legal reform in order to participate in the market with a renewable energy sources supply. I am focused on improving RECOPE internally as a more efficient business. We have had a collective agreement with our employees since the 1970s, and every year it is re-examined. President Solí­s asked us to check the entire agreement in order to renegotiate the terms. As a result, it was the first time negotiations led to the reduction of the associated costs of this agreement in the last 40 years. It was a responsible negotiation between RECOPE and the union. Former RECOPE administrations were dependent on the union. With this last agreement, the union's power and influence have been reduced. We have improved the organizational environment, and now RECOPE enjoys strong finance performance. I would like to see RECOPE as a company not governed by fear and supplying alternative energy resources. Importantly, I would like it to be deeply involved in research and development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Has clean energy generation technology improved in order to make electricity cheaper?</h4><p>We do not know the full effect that climate change may have on a country as small as Costa Rica. There will be an effect, namely heavy rains with potential hurricanes related to climate change. However, if we continue to guarantee the capacity of our water reservoirs, we will be able to guarantee the electricity generation required by the country. Regarding solar energy sources, we need to wait until the capacity of energy accumulators improves. As for our pricing structure, each power generation method has its own characteristics. Countries that have natural gas sources can offer a lower pricing strategy. However, we do not have such sources here. Our energy matrix gives us a competitive pricing structure in Central America and with some Latin American countries.</p><h4>ICE offers services in electricity and telecommunications. Have you considered splitting the company into two separate entities?</h4><p>We have accounting separation for both core business; there are no money transfers between them. They are two independent companies from an administrative, economic, and financial point of view. We do not plan to split into two completely different companies since there are synergies; we manage them under a business group strategy including electricity, telecommunications, and the 13 subsidiary companies that we have. These include state power utility CNFL, cloud computing provider RACSA that is mainly for state institutions services, and Cable Visión. These all report to ICE. Part of our actual strategy is acquiring companies in other countries in order to enter foreign markets.</p><h4>What do you look to achieve with the new initiative you are developing with Japan?</h4><p>We have a financial program with Japan for geothermal energy development in Costa Rica. Now, we are building a new geothermal generation power station and researching the geothermal potential for another one. The financial program used is with the Inter-American Development Bank (BID) jointly with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). We have historically worked with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE) and, to a lesser degree, with the Commercial Bank.</p><h4>Are there any plans to reduce the cost of electricity in the near future?</h4><p>If our users compare prices to those in countries with cheaper energy sources we would not be competitive. Yet, I do not know of any comprehensive study that demonstrates that our prices are not competitive. There is also a discussion regarding construction costs as we build our own power generation stations. We have analyzed our construction costs scheme and it is similar to comparative projects in other countries, taking into account our topographical and geological conditions. The discussion is mainly based on the fact we are building hydroelectric power stations instead of solar power parks. When a country has no petroleum resources, it cannot guarantee that its alternative power generation systems will be completely stable. Therefore, there must be a primary element, a power source large enough to answer demand variations. We have our strong hydroelectric power generation system to supply our country's demand; when there is a shortage for any reason, we support it through wind, solar, or geothermal power. In fact, we need to develop a new hydroelectric station to continue growth in our hybrid system.</p><h4>Are there any other exciting new energy methods that ICE is looking into?</h4><p>Hydroelectric will always be our most important resource. However, its share will lessen gradually over time. Meanwhile, geothermal, wind, solar, and biomass will grow in share. There is an important global trend in energy right now called distributed generation resources, which consists of developing electrical energy generation by means of many small sources of energy in places as close as possible to the loads. Costa Rica is working on this as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[he-uhuru-muigai-kenyatta-president-republic-kenya]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which areas of bilateral relations would you welcome increased cooperation between Nigeria and Kenya, and what measures are being implemented by the two countries to expand ties and bolster trade?</h4><p>I think an obvious sector in which we could learn from each other is oil and gas. We have also been looking at closer cooperation in trade; in agriculture and horticulture; and in fisheries and food products. In each of these sectors, we have progress to report: we had very useful discussions when I visited in 2013, and we signed a number of agreements. But it is also fair to say that we cannot rest on our laurels. We need to grow the trade between both nations; we need to open up trade to each other's products; and we could all do more to remove any barriers to the free flow of African products, skills, and capital. This is a work in progress, not least because leaders in business and government from both nations now have formal means to consider these matters and take them forward. I am confident we will grow together.</p><h4>Kenya has recently begun developing its oil and gas industry. Given Nigeria's longstanding expertise and knowledge of the sector, what role can the country play in assisting Kenya to develop its energy industry, and how are you ensuring to attract foreign investors into the sector?</h4><p>Nigeria has very substantial experience in the production and management of oil and gas; we in Kenya have only just begun to make the most of ours. I think it's clear we have much to learn from Nigeria. You have long, deep and productive relationships with oil producers, and with the markets. We in Kenya will look to learn from your experience and expertise there, and elsewhere.</p><h4>On the other hand, Nigeria's ICT sector is booming, and Kenya has exceptional experience in ICT in Africa, with the sector expected to soar over the coming years. What experience and lessons can Kenya share with Nigeria in the field, and what is the potential for collaboration in ICT between the two countries?</h4><p>I believe there's huge potential for cooperation between Nigeria and Kenya when it comes to ICT. But before I say anything about that, let me say that I have been impressed by the energy and the invention of the Nigerian ICT scene. One possible route of cooperation that stands out for me is in financial technology. We in Kenya have MPESA, which has been extraordinarily successful. Recently, we've seen a Nigerian ICT firm partner with Kenyan firms and banks to ease payments right across East and West Africa. It seems to me that that sort of connectivity—which, if it succeeds, will open up trade right across the continent—is to be very warmly encouraged. I think there is very substantial scope for cooperation along those lines, and I look forward to giving my full support to these endeavors.</p><h4>Nigeria and Kenya are two of the largest economies in Africa and enjoy a strong diplomatic influence within and beyond the continent's borders. How can this status and a deeper cooperation between the two countries benefit other African nations and foster African integration?</h4><p>I am very pleased to say that Kenya and Nigeria have long cooperated in virtually every area of endeavor that matters to our peoples. But let me single out one of many; and one in which we will continue to cooperate even more closely in years to come. We will, I believe, be partners in the reform of the African Union so that it better represents the people of this continent, on this continent; and so that it better defends their interests outside the continent. It is no secret that Africa now has a number of difficult decisions to make, both about its own future, and about the future of its relations with the world. How will we handle climate change? How can we make sure that African democracy is defended against terrorists? How should we reform the international rules that still disadvantage us? These questions cannot be answered to Africa's advantage without a strong Union; and the Union will not be as strong as it could be without Kenyan and Nigerian input.<span class="red"></span></p><h4>How do you envision the future of bilateral relations between Kenya and Nigeria?</h4><p>We believe that relations between Kenya and Nigeria will strengthen in years to come. I've mentioned some common challenges; I've also outlined opportunities for both nations. That's all to the good: we need to have a clear view of what we can do together, and how. Common interests and common challenges often bring nations together; what binds them together and turns a partnership into a friendship is a common set of values. Kenyans know, just as Nigerians do, the power of pan-Africanism. Kenyans and Nigerians understand the promise of democracy. Kenyans and Nigerians prize pluralism. Our peoples are devoted to trade and innovation. Together, we will work to clear the way for these values to triumph right across the continent we are proud to call our own.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica for the bank?</h4><p>Costa Rica is our largest operation in Central America, and we are the largest private bank in the country. We pride ourselves on constantly trying to improve in technology and mobile banking. The profile of the group is a universal bank; hence, we do retail banking as well as SMEs and large corporate banking. For many years we have focused on developing electronic payment systems for large corporations as well as individuals. One of the main things we emphasize and that differentiates us is our focus on our technology. We recently re-launched our strategy. A great deal of our focus in the last few years has been on preparing the bank and institution for all the changes going on in the industry, including mobile technology and fintech.</p><h4>What are the main products BAC offers?</h4><p>One of the main solutions and products is related to every service connected to payment systems, which we are experts in. We do credit cards, mobile, computer, ATMs, and physical solutions as well. That is one of our greatest strengths around which we have developed our strategy. We also have traditional banking products such as current and savings accounts and time deposits, and do loans and credit solutions for large corporations, SMEs, and individuals. We also try to offer a more comprehensive solutions package. Thus, we also have brokerage solutions, provide insurance products, and have a pension and mutual funds. Our objective is to provide a full solution for personal banking, SMEs, and larger corporations.</p><h4>In what ways is BAC helping the SME sector?</h4><p>We aspire to provide full solutions for this sector. We also do some things differently from other banks. We are one of the operators for Sistema de Banca para el Desarrollo (SBM), to which we devote a lot of resources. We have over USD75 million in loans to SMEs through that program and almost 3,000 beneficiaries, which respond to different strategies in the payment chain of our clients. This is one example of things we have done differently for SMEs and is something we plan to continue doing. We also have other products and solutions for SMEs, especially when they are in the value chain of different industries and products we operate in. It is a strategy that is fully integrated, not fragmented. SMEs are a large segment. They are an important part of the population and economy; therefore, we want to support them.</p><h4>What are some of the recent investments the bank has made in Costa Rica?<br></h4><p>This is a large bank in Costa Rica with around USD5 billion in assets. Therefore, our investment plan is very significant every year. We have done a great deal of investment in technology. Recently we had a re-launching of our new brand, BAC Credomatic. We have been investing to change all of the branding online and offline. It is important that we are prepared for the technological wave that is coming in mobile services. As such, we are exploring different trends such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and digital workforce projects, and we have an agenda for each of these in the bank. We rebranded the bank because we are in constant evolution.</p><h4>What are the goals for BAC Credomatic in 2018?</h4><p>The goals are to continue advancing as leaders in electronic payment solutions. Another is to continue projecting our financial strength. Hopefully we will be able to continue this growth into 2018. We should focus on sustainability, one of the pillars of our strategy. We have different things going for us there, such as a focus on financial education. We have worked with governments on this topic and have a program that is part of the high school curricula. It has been in place for 10 years now and matured into something important to the financial system. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have you helped to change in Costa Rica regarding financial systems?</h4><p>As chairman of CONASSIF, I have worked to make the financial regulation clearer and more technically robust, always keeping in mind the welfare of the financial consumer. In detail, I have been passionate about the strengthening of the corporate governance of all financial regulated firms. However, there is still a long way to cover on this topic.</p><h4>What is the feedback from your private sector experience?</h4><p>A large part of my life was spent in the private sector. Public and private participants can work together, within known PPPs. This is an excellent platform to develop business in Costa Rica. For example, some of the country's greatest needs are related to infrastructure such as roads, trains, and airports, and financial-economic PPPs can help to match funding in order to create new products and achieve common objectives. </p><h4>What are some barriers in making the above happen?</h4><p>Bureaucracy, which is often found in the mid-level of organizations, is one key barrier. We have to do our best in order to change this mentality. If we bring suitable people with innovative views and attitudes to public and private institutions, then we can advance quicker and go further. </p><h4>Which sectors are contributing to financial growth for the country?</h4><p>The four sectors that we supervise—banking, securities, pensions, and insurance—contribute to financial growth. Nonetheless, the banking assets represent a figure close to 100% of the country's GDP. In addition, the insurance sector shows consistent growth, although it is a recent—less than 10 years—competitive market in the country. </p><h4>What would you like to achieve at CONASSIF?</h4><p>I would like to see a country that facilitates new business. I would like to attain clearer legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as more opportunities from financial institutions with the same conditions as international suppliers. We have been given valuable factors in Costa Rica, such as education, health and financial-economic stability, and these elements act as a great base to invite business into Costa Rica. </p><h4>How can the country's financial system be brought closer to international best practices?</h4><p>The private sector has to play a relevant role. If the government is the only one trying to make this happen, it will not work. The private sector has an important role to play, not only in the financial sector. We are in a great position in the Central America region, with comparatively strong economic conditions to develop financial-economic opportunities. One of our greatest challenges is how to change ingrained mentalities to seek that one plus one be more than two. Moreover, private and public education has to change as well; the situation today is different than what it was 40 years ago, and the curriculum needs to be updated. Our legal framework also has to modernize; some of the legal and regulatory framework is old and needs to be updated to the 21st century. Finally, the financial system needs to be able to find, train, and keep suitable professionals to grow and make valuable things happen.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

He was appointed as the Chairman of Istanbul Gold Exchange in 2005 and served at this post until his appointment as a member to the CMB Executive Board in December 2006. After serving six years at the CMB Executive Board, he was appointed as the Chairman of the CMB in January 2013. He played a leading role in drafting regulations on real estate investment trusts (REITs) and company mergers and de-mergers in Turkey, and also chaired the team at the CMB which prepared regulatory and technical infrastructure of the private pension system in Turkey.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does the CMB come in terms of regulation in the fintech space?</h4><p>The areas within the responsibility of the CMB may be classified into three main groups: primary markets, secondary markets, and financial intermediation. With regards to fintech regulation, CMB focuses on the potential benefits and risks fintech could bring to these main areas. Fintech activities such as distributed ledger technology, institutional trading platforms, retail trading, and investment platforms may be related to abovementioned activities that the CMB regulates. The latest regulatory attempt to have emerged from the growth of fintech is crowdfunding. There is an apparent funding gap, especially for early-stage companies in Turkey, while certain types of investors seek different projects to include in their portfolio. To respond to these needs, an amendment to the Capital Markets Law is being drafted to allow the operation of crowdfunding platforms in Turkey. The draft law has been prepared in a way to amend several articles of the Capital Markets Law.</p><h4>What technological solutions have been put into practice by CMB as a regulatory response to technological innovations in the last decade?</h4><p>CMB introduced the Public Disclosure Platform (PDP) in 2009. PDP is used by public companies and capital markets institutions such as investment firms and investment funds to timely disclose information to all stakeholders. PDP also serves as an electronic archive. Another solution is found in the Turkish Commercial Code, and holding general shareholder meetings on electronic platforms is now compulsory for companies on Borsa Istanbul. The Central Registry Agency developed and put into service the electronic general meeting system (e-GEM), a pioneering application for listed companies and their investors. Using e-GEM and personal e-signatures, operations can be carried out by accessing and reviewing meeting documents, registration, attending concurrent meetings, assigning delegates, receiving and giving voting instructions, pre-recording (pre-registration) of votes, offering suggestions, expressing opinions, asking questions, voting, and receiving voting results instantly. To increase competition with respect to fund distribution, the Turkey Electronic Fund Trading and Information Platform (TEFAS) was established as an electronic platform in January 2015. It provides access to all mutual funds operating in Turkish capital markets via single investment account, with the exclusion of mutual funds subject to special conditions. TEFAS is a fund supermarket easing access for the investors to the desired mutual funds. TEFAS is also designed as a fund data platform that enables performance comparison of funds by investors. Both retail and institutional investors can use TEFAS. Finally, Borsa Istanbul has established its co-location center, enabling market participants to place their own trading systems/servers at Borsa Istanbul Data Center. Market participants—especially HTF traders—have the opportunity to access the market systems in a faster and more reliable manner. These are some of the technical innovations that have been introduced aiming to increase efficiency, speed, and interconnectedness.</p><h4>How do you keep up with the fast-moving developments in the fintech space?</h4><p>Financial technologies play an important role in delivering innovative products and services in capital markets and have the potential to transform capital markets by offering investors easier access to better financial services. On the other hand, some products may not be suitable for certain investors. Therefore, our main objective as a regulator is to ensure that consumers are adequately protected while supporting innovation. In this regard, to keep up with fast-moving developments in the fintech space, we try to explore how regulatory requirements and technology can be aligned through financial technology. We are also reviewing our regulatory approach with the aim of encouraging and supporting fintech, assuring it will not erode consumer protection or the integrity of the our regulated financial system. In this regard, we work together with all the market participants in the industry—from asset/fund managers to FMIs and investment firms—to ensure efficient technological infrastructure and effective regulatory environment.</p><h4>What is the role of traditional finance institutions vis-í -vis the role of new players in the market, and how much does regulation need to adjust?</h4><p>Over the past several years, technology has revolutionized the banking and financial services sectors. The costs of developing new technologies have fallen significantly over the past decade. This improved the competition and efficiency in the market and has enabled new actors like crowdfunding/P2P platforms to enter the market. Crowdfunding is an ideal venue for small businesses to access funding to fuel growth. P2P equity and P2P lending can stimulate growth through a fast and cost-effective mechanism; on the other hand, they may pose some risks to the financial markets. Therefore, we are working actively to facilitate and regulate crowdfunding because of its potential economic and social benefits but remain aware of potential threats to our financial markets, especially with regards to financial consumer protection. We are not against the idea of companies operating like intermediaries as in the case of P2P equity and P2P lending. The fast growth of crowdfunding over the past years would not have been realized if P2P platforms were operated only by conventional financial institutions. Taking into consideration the increasing role of crowdfunding in financial markets and the attractive growth of the P2P platforms, it is obvious that conventional financial institutions cannot be oblivious to the evolution of crowdfunding. Options for conventional financial institutions for the future may be to start their own online P2P platforms, buy out these P2P platforms before they have a chance to gain too strong a foothold in the industry, or to cooperate with one of these platforms. Also, current regulations that are prepared considering the infrastructure of conventional financial institutions will not be adequate for this fast-growing industry. Regulations need to be adjusted to take into consideration the characteristics of this industry while securing the appropriate degree of protection for investors.</p><h4>What role can CMB play in realizing Turkey's ambition to become the world's first cashless society, and what role will fintech play in that process?</h4><p>The vision endorsed by Interbank Card Center of Turkey (BKM) is to have a 100% cashless society by 2023: it is an aspirational way to celebrate the 100th year of the Turkish Republic. In Turkey, there are over 120 million debit cards, 59 million credit cards, and 2.3 million POS machines in the market. Additionally, the country launched its first-ever national payment scheme, Turkey's Payment Method (TROY), in 2016 that can be deemed as an innovation in the local payments market. Payment schemes are mostly related to the banking sector. From the capital markets' point of view, cashless payment schemes are instrumental in easing and securing transactions. For instance, we may expect payment systems to play an integral and crucial part for the operations of crowdfunding platforms. With the use of cashless payment in crowdfunding, people will be able to fund particularly startups by electronic payment schemes by taking advantage of speed and security both for the investors and entrepreneurs. There is widespread use of credit cards in Turkey. Additionally, growth in smartphone ownership along with advancements in mobile payment technology has changed the way people conduct their financial transactions. Although the use of mobile payment technology gradually increases, payment culture is still dominated by credit cards in Turkey. 54% of contributions in private pension plans are paid by credit cards, according to 2016 statistics.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated Grupo Guerrero to move to Costa Rica and start this project?</h4><p>We have over 30 years of experience in free zone and industrial park developments. We started developing industrial parks in 1985 and are part of the group that supported the initiative of the private free zone law in El Salvador. We started developing our first free zone in El Salvador in 1990 and continued with the second one in 1998. We have about 60 companies in El Salvador working with us between the two of them and around 15,000 employees. We decided to come to Costa Rica as a strategic move, since El Salvador has developed more of the textile industry, regional distribution centers, and logistics, whereas Costa Rica has developed in a more technological way. We decided to move into a more sophisticated market to help us attract foreign investment in different sectors. We were deciding between Panama and Costa Rica, but decided to invest in the latter because we feel more comfortable with the manufacturing than the service industry. CINDE is another one of the reasons we came here and with whom we have been working for a couple of years.</p><h4>How will this park help in the country's development and growth?</h4><p>We are a vertically integrated company. We do all the land movement, construction, and everything that helps us deliver the final product at a better cost. We have more competitive prices than other class-A level parks; therefore, we can certainly help the competitiveness of Costa Rica. Our location is ideal, just five minutes away from an airport and close to other free zones in the most important industrial sector of the country. We have identified the types of investment coming into the country; one of them is a supplier-based industry for companies already established in Costa Rica. This will not be a huge park and will have around 56,000sqm. We are a flexible company that is important in this business. We are able to deliver buildings that have the flexibility to install different types of companies, no matter how large or small.</p><h4>What kind of companies and sectors are you trying to attract to this park?</h4><p>We specifically look at the life sciences, electronic, pharmaceutical, and logistic sectors. We already have a supplier for the medical industry and a pharmaceutical company coming in. Since we are close to other already established industries, suppliers can be based here and supply other parks in less than five minutes.</p><h4>Why did you decide to make this park different in terms of sustainability?</h4><p>That was always part of the plan. For us and the country, sustainability is part of the future; it is necessary that we support this initiative. In El Salvador, we have already implemented many green aspects. We produce solar energy in our roofs. In one of our free zones, 30% of total energy is solar-based. We want to make a difference in the present and future; we are not the same kind of free zone or industrial park you find elsewhere. Our motto is green, human, and reliable. The reliable part comes from our experience; however, the green and human parts are what make us different.</p><h4>What sets this park apart from other free zones here?</h4><p>We were born and are truly green; however, the human aspect is what makes the biggest difference. This is how we treat our clients: they are not just one more company inside the park. This is why this is not a huge park; when there is a manageable number of clients, things are easier to control, and we can serve their needs in a better way. This is more like a boutique free zone that it is more customized and personalized. Companies are part of the family here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is AyA working to supply a more efficient service in order to facilitate more investment in the country?</h4><p>AyA is the technical rector in potable water supply and sanitation services, as well as an operator. The figure itself is a little different; however, that was the way it was approved by law in 1961. We serve over 50% of the population, and we have delegated 28% coverage by means of community associations—we call these groups ASADAS. ASADAS cover 28%, and local governments cover another 15%. Thus, Costa Rica has a total water supply coverage of 99%. From this 99%, we supply 87% as potable water. We have high quality safe potable water that is attractive for foreign investors. There are few places throughout the country where an investor or tourist does not find potable water. However, over the last three years, we have had fairly tough challenges. We have suffered a continuous drought; many of the sources of water that we use, regardless of AyA or ASADAS, were affected by El Niño, and we had considerable reductions in flow of 50-60%. There have been important investments throughout the country on projects to expand the intake of new water sources in order to avoid a water deficit. </p><h4>How is AyA contributing to the simplification of procedures regarding permits?</h4><p>We have a commitment to the Ministry of Economy to simplify procedures and have been complying with each of the steps of this simplification process. Another important aspect was that previously, all the paperwork was done in person at the office; now many procedures are digital. There are still complaints, and there are things that should be able to be resolved more quickly. We have also been doing a series of training workshops, especially in regional offices, in order to better explain the regulation's scope and interpretation. Now, we have clear rules and with these rules anyone can come and invest in a more secure and reliable way.<br>What projects or international alliances does AyA have to promote the institution's improvement?<br>We are in the Central American Forum for Potable Water and Sanitization (FOCARD) and are present in international platforms such as the Sanitation Water for All (SWA). We have projects with Korea, Canada, Tunisia, and Ghana focused on sustainable development objectives, where we share information on how we are working to reach these objectives. We have positive relations with the Public Services Company of Medellí­n, Colombia and with the Public Services Company of Sío Paulo (SABESTI) in Brazil. From the Spanish cooperation agency, we received a donation of USD20 million to build communal aqueducts.</p><h4>How is AyA promoting the proper and efficient use of water?</h4><p>There is still much to be done, especially in terms of climate change and sanitization. A few years ago, Costa Rica was ranked fifth in the Yale University Environmental Performance Index. Then, in 2015, we went down to 54th because the index started to include water treatment infrastructure capacities. We have been making improvements and are now at 48th. We are working with the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the Ministry of Health on defining a sanitation policy for AyA and other operators. We have a program for sanitation in the Metropolitan Area of San José for USD345 million. Also, there is a program for sanitation in priority cities for USD175 million. We are setting the program, the policy, and the investment plan and have worked on creating a National Direction of Sanitation. We have specialized engineers focused exclusively on sanitation systems design and feasibility studies. We also have a major project of around USD300 million, funded with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, in conjunction with the German KfW Development Bank. It is a project of reduction of non-revenue water. In Costa Rica we have a 50% rate of not-revenue water, which is high. It is not necessarily caused by leaks, but also by updating cadastre records. This project is in full execution now.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AmCham's members account for 80% of the country's exports. How do you support your members?</h4><p>Our 370 members enjoy a great relationship with the government, and many have received incentives and support to bring their businesses here. They are investing in a country that provides profitability by supporting democracy, the rule of law, and a great human capital resource. The chamber works together with the Costa Rican and US governments on initiatives that we find to be important to our members and especially to promote better competitiveness indicators for the country. We achieve this with the help of the technical inputs of our 16 committees and forums, which work on analyzing laws and legislations, giving us opportunities to meet with congresspeople and representatives from the executive branch in order to share our observations. These workgroups also share best practices and provide training in several areas such as CSR, tax policy, regulatory improvement, tourism, real estate, economy and finance, trade, and so on.</p><h4>What challenges does the private sector here face?</h4><p>We need to maintain the incentives for bringing companies into the country. That helps us with our GDP and with the employment situation. We also need to start looking at the curricula that we have in universities to provide the education for the future jobs. We know that the landscape of employment is changing and we need to have them adapt quickly, so when people graduate they can fill those jobs. The emphasis on security is also imperative; we need to make sure it is known that Costa Rica is a diamond of Central America, as well as invest and continually seek government support to see that this country maintains its image of being safe and secure. In addition, we want to take a look at the infrastructure. The electric train project is imperative, as it will help reduce traffic on roads and, most importantly, provide secure and efficient transportation to our associates and students.</p><h4>What is AmCham doing to promote fair and legal trade?</h4><p>We have an enlisted committee specifically for this purpose. AmCham has developed an app for consumers to register points of sale of illicit products, which will help us work more closely with the government in giving vital information to be able to execute a prosecution program. We brought in the government branches of the training program and specialists from around the world to come and train them on how to identify these products. We need to continue to work with the executive branch in making sure this critical topic stays on the agenda. We need to see that our laws are continually enriched to ensure fairer treatment. We also need to expose the consumer and the government to the products that may not be well understood; while we know what cigarettes and alcohol are, some goods contain other products that are coming through such as pharmaceutical items, and some of them are dangerous.</p><h4>Why is this country attractive for investing in and creating new businesses?</h4><p>The environment of the country for international investors, especially from the US, has been extremely productive. Costa Rica's number-one strength is human capital; the workforce is extremely educated, positive, and has a great work ethic. In addition, the government and the administrations in the past have been favorable to international investment, and we hope this continues. Organizations like the American Chamber and the Industrial Chamber are key organizations that greatly support international investment. We also have CINDE and Procomer, which are an extension of the government that are there to help foreign investors. The environment here is extremely positive, and more importantly, if we take a look at the companies from different countries that have invested here through all these years, they all have a proven track record of success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the country moved from being an agriculture economy to an industrial and services-oriented one?</h4><p>Costa Rica is an example to the rest of the world of how a country can make a real transformation of its economy. We were exporting four basic agricultural products with no value-added to a limited number of countries around the world in the 1980s. Today, we export 4,500 different products to 150 countries around the world, many of which are value added with a high level of sophistication. Products and services make up half and half of our exports, with USD10 billion of the former and USD8 billion of the latter. Our transformation and evolution from a basic economy to a more sophisticated one are based mostly on IT and IT-related and enabled industries, including software development, gaming, mobile applications, customer support, finance, accounting, HR, and cybersecurity. All these new areas did not exist 15-20 years ago.</p><h4>What sectors are currently the most attractive for foreign companies in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We can divide them into four large sectors. One of the most popular is life sciences. It is a sector with a great deal of dynamism that continues to grow, hire more people, increase it footprint, and cultivate its ecosystem here. Another is advanced manufacturing, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, and other types of industries. It is not volume-based, but rather low-volume, high sophistication products. We cannot compete with Mexico or China in terms of high-volume industries. However, we are delivering highly sophisticated electronic components for Tesla. The services sector is split in two: everything IT related and enabled, such as software development and testing, internet, mobile, gaming, and cybersecurity; and everything that has to do with shared services, such as finance, accounting, supply chain, and customer support. And the last sector is light manufacturing and the food industry.</p><h4>What is CINDE doing to promote the STEM areas of learning?</h4><p>We have an entire department dedicated to the investment climate. Its job is to work on all of the areas that help us improve the investment climate so more companies will come to Costa Rica. It starts at the human talent side of the equation. We need to work on infrastructure, electricity costs, bureaucracy, and red tape, though the most important area is human talent. If we continue to develop the right human talent, companies will keep coming. We work with the Ministry of Education closely through its programs to help improve the level of English taught at public schools and to bring STEM education into public schools and technical colleges so students graduate with a wider range of skills. All 70 private and public universities in Costa Rica are well known and respected. We also work closely with them to ensure students graduate with the skills needed by companies investing in the country. This ensures careers are aligned with the needs of the market.</p><h4>CINDE was ranked the best promotion agency in the world in 2017. What were some of the successes that have led to that achievement?</h4><p>Few investment promotion agencies in the world help companies throughout the whole process—from the moment they are prospecting to the moment they are making a decision, helping them install, and once they are here, helping them understand how to grow horizontally or vertically and expand their footprint, and never letting go. All companies that have launched operations in Costa Rica through CINDE continue to operate here. We have forums for them to participate in HR, training, and R&amp;D. That sets us apart, because companies see us as their partner more than a government agency just doing what it is obligated to do. We use a great deal of technology to provide better services and invest in innovation to be on top of the newest trends, though those are all part of a single strategy that is to be a reliable partner for growth and success. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is behind Procomer's success as one of the best trade agencies in the world?</h4><p>For three years in a row, Procomer has been ranked the number-one promotion agency in the world. This is a ranking carried out by International Trade Center (ITC), an extension of the World Trade Organization (WTO). What they assess is the impact the agency has on the local economy and society, as well as how it is managed, the business practices, corporate governance, the work environment, the technology that is being used, and succession planning. One of our strengths is being modeled similarly to a PPP: we are governed by a board of directors and a private majority that represent different export sectors of the economy. It is not an agency governed by politics; it is an agency driven by technical decisions. We have long-term strategic planning and work as if we were a private corporation. Our challenge is to open the path for Costa Rica's future trade strategy. Of course, we have short-term tactics, goals, and deliverables; however, we also have long-term vision. As part of these challenges, we have to keep developing the service economy. We expect that in a couple of years, exports of services will surpass that of goods, and we need to be building the right platforms, tools, and resources for that service economy to continue to expand. Services include everything from IT and corporate services to film, fashion, and green services and design. </p><h4>What sectors export the most?</h4><p>We export over 4,000 different products to over 150 countries around the world. Agriculture and industry are important, but we do not depend on either. Mining and oil are non-existent. We are properly diversified. Therefore, we do not have one particular target country for 2017 and 2018. Our strength is to focus on many.</p><h4>What is Procomer doing to increase the diversification of Costa Rican products?</h4><p>Bananas are our chief product, accounting for 9% of goods and services exported. Additionally, services account for about 5%, which is not bad in terms of risk management. Our priority is to keep developing other products in the food industry as well as services. We have several programs and have increased participation in international fairs; we are also opening a distribution center in Miami to support the food industry. We are developing certification processes for agricultural and non-traditional companies. We are also betting on e-commerce, as we have agreements with Alibaba and Amazon, and are promoting incubation and acceleration programs. We have programs to identify new exporters around the country, since most of our programs are intended to help SMEs. </p><h4>What other projects or alliances are relevant to the success of Procomer?</h4><p>Costa Rica exported about USD20 billion worth of goods and services in 2017. The paths, channels, and sources of that wealth cover many areas in our productive ecosystem. Therefore, we are forced to have strong relations with everyone. Two strong allies are the Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Industries; with both of them, we have a strategic alliance program in which we sit and agree on the deliverables each year; things that we are going to do in common, things we are going to do on our own, and things we may work on separately but in a parallel fashion to support the sectors they represent. We support all of the exporters. Some need support for the free trade scheme, some need support in country branding, others in market intelligence. We also have a clusters strategy. Clusters intend to join forces and work as a team and share a strategy with convened milestones, objectives, targets, priorities, and so on. This has been effective as we have been able to support a group of companies, instead of just one or two individually. They then share knowledge and customers and collaborate rather than compete. We have aerospace, flowers, plants, food, agriculture, animation, and fashion clusters. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts does the Panamanian government make bilaterally with its counterpart in Costa Rica to strengthen tourism in both countries?</h4><p>On May 5, 2017, the first meeting of the Costa Rica-Panama Association Council was held in San José, which discussed issues that facilitate tourism in both countries, including migration, security, border issues, health, education, connectivity, business issues, and economic affairs. In December 2016, the tourism authorities from both countries met to establish guidelines on the development of tourism in the border area. Another issue to be highlighted is the initiative for a Border Integration Program (PIF), which aims to strengthen the competitiveness of Panama's foreign trade through the modernization of infrastructure, equipment, and border systems in the three border crossings with Costa Rica—Paso Canoas, Guabito, and Rí­o Sereno—seeking to ensure efficient and effective coordination of controls. This initiative ensures better conditions for tourist movement between both countries.</p><h4>How has security on the border between Costa Rica and Panama evolved, and what efforts remain to be made?</h4><p>We held periodic meetings in the border area of Paso Canoas before registering massive irregular flows in the last year. In this sense, our security forces have reinforced their presence in the border area in order to prevent criminal activity in the area, which already produces great results. In Rí­o Sereno, we are establishing a permanent position in joint work with Costa Rica. The joint task force of the security forces coordinated with Costa Rica the transfer of more than 4,000 Cuban migrants who were in the border area to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Efforts still need to be made to adapt the infrastructure to avoid permeability in the area where people transit through the border sector.</p><h4>How do you see the evolution of Panama's relations with the Central American region, in particular Costa Rica?</h4><p>Bilateral relations between Panama and Costa Rica are at the highest level, which allows us to expand and strengthen existing links. Costa Rica and Panama are moving toward a process of integration. It is increasingly common to be on the bilateral agenda with inter-institutional meetings to analyze the progress made in customs, migration, medical emergencies, education, health, and the delimitation and densification of border landmarks. At the political level, the foreign ministers of both countries chaired the first meeting of the Panama-Costa Rica Association Council. There is a close link between the political, commercial, and social agendas. Additionally, Costa Rica and Panama coordinated the plans and programs to be developed within the framework of the Pro Tempore Presidency of Central American Integration System (SICA) and jointly address security, migration, and cooperation issues. Our relationship is aimed at protecting the peace, security, and harmony between brotherly peoples who live in the region and seek to guarantee the rights of their inhabitants, respecting international norms. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your interpretation of the country's foreign policy and its key challenges and priorities?</h4><p>Since Costa Rica does not have an army, our main foreign policy focus is multilateralism; we rely on international law and organizations to defend ourselves and promote our interests. As such, we have strategic bilateral relations with traditional partners like the US and the EU, and non-traditional destinations with whom we have tried to focus on three areas. One is Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Brunei and Malaysia, who were never on the radar of previous administrations. Of course, China is another important player; until recently we were the only country in Central America that had diplomatic relations with it. There are other important areas such as Central Asia, particularly Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. The other region we have paid special attention is in the Middle East Arab countries, in particular the UAE, where we are opening a new embassy. Before the end of this administration, we will have at least four new embassies in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Abu Dhabi, and Australia.</p><h4>How is the government fostering multilateralism?</h4><p>Since we do not have diplomatic presence in every ASEAN country, we will participate actively in the FEALAC meeting in Seoul at the end of August. We hosted the meeting, which is still the only forum for dialog between Latin America and East Asia, in 2015; hence, the level of participation between the two regions must really be improved. Currently, one of our most important pillars is disarmament in all its forms, especially nuclear, which is why Costa Rica held the Presidency of the United Nations Conference to draft a treat to ban nuclear weapons, which approved a final text on July 7, 2017. The principles of democracy, freedom and human rights, and the environment are key. We have been critical of the Central America integration system and have pointed out the need for more transparency, accountability, and results. We had the presidency during the first semester of 2017 and worked hard on institutional reform, pragmatism, and closer relationships with observers. Security policies are also important for us, and drug trafficking in particular is something that is hitting the region hard. Costa Rica has been used for transit purposes, and we need to patrol more efficiently in the Pacific. In Costa Rica, 65% of murders are drug-related. Therefore, we are working closely with Colombia and Panama to tackle this problem and be more efficient in the fight against drug trafficking. We have also established a closer relationship with the US, and President Solí­s has visited the White House twice within a period of eight months.</p><h4>In what way has the country benefited from abolishing the army, and what are the strategies to ensure security in the country?</h4><p>If we put this in the context of 1948—the pattern of Latin American dictatorships, the civil war in Costa Rica in 1948, and invasion attempt of 1955—then it was a bold decision. We did it coming out of a civil war that only lasted one month but killed many people. This made it even more difficult to imagine such a decision. That it was in the constitution merely a year later makes it even more difficult to imagine. However, this liberated many resources that used to go to the military and could now be invested in human development, which differentiates Costa Rica from many other countries in the world. We defend ourselves by relying on international law; an example is our relationship with Nicaragua, with whom we have fought several cases in the International Court of Justice. We also need strong relationships with our traditional partners while always adding new ones. We are currently working hard to achieve the sustainable development goals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about Rimo International Lestari's recent acquisition of Hokindo Properti Investama?</h4><p>RIMO was once one of the largest retail department stores in the country back in the 1990s. Fierce Competition from other Retailers and Online Shops had made RIMO suffer big loss. Being listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), Change of Ownership and Management was inevitable. In March 2017, New Management changed the business strategy by acquiring PT Hokindo Properti Investama (HOKINDO), an integrated Property Landbanker and Developer, by issuing new shares in the public valued at IDR4.1 trillion (USD 300 million). In December 2017, from a loss-suffering company, RIMO made approximately Rp 430B in total revenue and Rp 145B in net profit. Stock price increased by 50% in nine-month period of time.</p><h4>Would you give us a brief overview of Rimo International Lestari's current activities and key projects?</h4><p>In Jakarta, we have two projects; one is the apartment building in Kuningan and another is in Gandaria and is still in the planning stage. We are preparing the master plan and applying for the development permits at present. We also have one project in Cianjur, West Java, which is 200ha of land where we will build a golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus. We will sell villas at that development and build a five star hotel.</p><h4>Will the golf course development in West Java be your biggest investment currently?</h4><p>No, we have larger investments. Low-cost housing is in fact the largest investment because we will build 30,000 houses for a housing project in West Kalimantan in Pontianak. It is a 800ha development site and we will acquire more land to bring it up to 1,000ha. We will build affordable, low-cost housing to support the government's One Million Houses program.</p><h4>Will low-cost housing projects become a major profit center for Rimo International Lestari's given that this is a continuing government program?</h4><p>Of course, we want to make a profit; however, we also want to develop the region because once we build in West Kalimantan, the area will become more developed and we can sell higher-priced houses there as well, which will reap greater profits.</p><h4>How does the financing work for the government's One Million Houses program?</h4><p>There are in fact no government loans for the construction of these projects; however, there are subsidized loans for consumers who want to buy the houses. They receive government-subsidized interest rates on their loans and the down payment is only 1%. Homebuyers only pay around half the usual mortgage interest rate under this scheme.</p><h4>Why did you choose West Kalimantan as the region for this development? Was it through your own feasibility studies or was it a direction from the government?</h4><p>West Kalimantan is strategically important for the government because it is close to Singapore and Malaysia. Given its strategic location, the government intends to build many projects there. In fact, the government wants to move the capital city to West Kalimantan and also wants to build a large port, new bridges, schools, toll roads, railways, and other infrastructure there. It wants to develop new infrastructure to support all the palm oil plantations in the region as well. When we chose West Kalimantan for this low-cost housing development, it was purely on our own initiative; however, we directed it specifically at the government's housing program. We believe we have to be involved in building this low-cost housing.</p><h4>What is the timeline for building these 30,000 low-cost houses?</h4><p>Beginning in December 2017, we will start Phase I and build 1,000 houses. It is not just local people in West Kalimantan that need these houses. Personnel from the army, navy, and police force also need housing and they qualify for these government loans too. We have a number of other smaller projects around the country as well.</p><h4>How would you compare the real estate opportunities in Jakarta compared to other parts of Indonesia?</h4><p>It is only possible to build apartment buildings in Jakarta because land there is extremely expensive. However, outside Jakarta there are still great opportunities to build houses, especially low-cost homes. They are considered like consumer goods—everyone needs them. In particular, with the government subsidy it is like the government giving houses away to people. Therefore, anywhere and anytime a company builds houses it will sell.</p><h4>What is the current state of the Indonesian property market at the moment?</h4><p>Some say the real estate sector in Indonesia is slowing down currently. However, it all depends on the type of real estate being built. The market for low-cost homes is not slowing down. No matter how many houses are built they will always be sold. In terms of medium to high-end apartment developments, it all depends on the quality of the buildings and the location. Today, there is always new construction technology being introduced, and we have to be efficient and innovative. Even when we build low-cost housing it has to be of good quality and attractive. We use the latest technology to build houses faster. We must always follow new construction technology, for example, using prefabricated components for walls, floors, and roofs in order to build houses quickly.</p><h4>How will you finance your future expansion and what direction are you hoping to head in?</h4><p>Financing will come from the bank as well as from our shareholders because we are a listed company. This means we have access to strategic partners and financial investors. Today, our share price is quite remarkable; RIMO is one of the most active shares on the stock exchange right now, giving us access to funding either through bank loans or financial investors and strategic partners from the capital markets. In terms of the company's direction, we are still open to new things, for example perhaps buying hotels in regions where we already have a base.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Nigeria is 6th-largest gas flaring nation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-emmanuel-ibe-kachikwu-minister-state-petroleum-resources-nigeria]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Nigeria overcome the issue of relying on the imports of finished products?</h4><p>The government is very committed to have as much processing of crude oil as possible within Nigeria and we hope that we can reach a point in the medium term where we can start to export products. Our strategy is to repair our existing refineries and encourage new investment in refining by the private sector. We see great interest in modular refineries and have also received at least four proposals for large world-scale refineries to be established here. We have enough production to support this, although we expect production to increase. We project new refining capacity of about 50,000bpd added to the current capacity and the existing refineries to be up and running within the next two years. If you add the revamped refineries to this, we should have enough to respond to our domestic needs. As for exports, that will likely take several years, when other refineries start production.</p><h4>What are the ministry's views on gas flaring and monetizing gas?</h4><p>This government has come up with clear policies toward flare gas monetization and flare gas elimination. We have taken a holistic view; we want to provide third parties that have the technical commercial solutions with access to the flares. There is about 700 million scf of gas being flared daily, making Nigeria the sixth-largest flaring nation in the world. If we can capture some of that gas flaring, we can use that toward power production and industrial use. In addition, the government has committed in the Paris Climate Change Agreement to nationally determined contributions toward the reduction of greenhouse gases. For the petroleum sector, our commitment is to elimate gas flares. To this end, we have designed a comprehensive program called the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Program through which we want to make sure that the  flare issue is behind us by 2020.</p><h4>How will the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) open a new chapter for Nigeria's oil and gas sector?</h4><p>It will completely change the ballgame as there will be more clarity for investors. Currently, big investment decisions cannot be made, and until we bring in legislation, people do not know how things will turn out. Following that, we need a tripod of reforms: policy, which we have now made, legislation which is about to be completed, and next, we need to build institutional capacity for implementation of policies and the legislation. The next stage of action on the bills is concurrence, which means both houses have to look at the differences, reconcile them, and come up with final bills for enactment.</p><h4>What is the role of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in developing local content and talent?</h4><p>If the experience did not come from international oil companies (IOC) then it came from NNPC. Agreements between NNPC and its partners require localization. It has worked reasonably well, though there is still room for improvement. Now that we have the Nigerian Content Monitoring Board, this will help even further. Nigerian content is improving. We now have a strong regulator that is reasonably independent and will strengthen that system. There is still a large amount of technology developed internationally as it is an international industry; however, we have Nigerians working all over the world in industrial sectors and the international oil economy. That could flow back if we have a better managed industry. As the industry broadens, we expect to see more Nigerians coming back and getting involved. We are building strong Nigerian upstream companies.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges companies in oil and gas will face in the coming months?</h4><p>It is important for upstream that we have clarity around the fiscal regime and that works both for the government and investors in the upstream. There is no policy until we actually implement fiscal policy and the earlier we implement them the more clarity one has because it affects investment decisions. For service contractors, and even in upstream, efficiency in contracting will also be a major issue that we have to work on so that decision-making can become quicker and costs are lowered. The way that we procure costs for projects is an issue for us currently on the government side. I want to ensure everyone is efficient in keeping costs to rational levels. We expect tighter rules around cost management and cost containment, which will have an impact on the service level. Service providers must now be more efficient and competitive, because if we put more pressure on the upstream to be efficient cost wise then they have to put pressure on service providers to also be competitive and efficient. As the country grows, we want to make sure we do not leave money on the table when that is not needed; and we want to make sure that what could have been wasted cost-wise goes to the treasury. If we have contractors or upstream operators that are not efficient, then it is important that we do not bear the costs of that inefficiency.</p><h4>How will the new OPEC quota limits affect the industry?</h4><p>We still have a buffer because a fair amount of oil production is condensates, which are not counted, and we will still have headroom for another year if we produce another 300,000-400,000 barrels of oil. We produce more crude oil than condensates; therefore, we can still produce more crude. It will not affect us for another 300,000-400,000 barrels of oil, which we have capacity to produce.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) will produce more oil and we expect overall production to increase. We expect to have completed developing gas tariffs before the end of the year and new legislation for the industry in 2018. We expect to have resolved the network code and tariffs for gas this year and to increase gas supply. This is the culmination of all the hard work that we have done in the last three years that should start kicking in by the third or fourth quarter of 2018.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Treating roughly 1.5 million people per year]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-abdulrahman-mohammed-al-muammar-ceo-king-saud-university-medical-city]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your vision on healthcare clusters via medical cities and how it can enhance efficiencies and the allocation of staff and equipment?</h4><p>This is one of the major moves by the Ministry of Health in the way it envisions distributing health services equitably across national geography. Currently, we have constraints in planning our services due to difficulties in defining our catchment area. Some hospitals serve patients triple their serving capacity while other hospitals have underutilized capacity. The ministry seeks to make every hospital committed to a certain area linked to a defined area, providing population specific services. In this way, hospitals can serve based on their capacity. This has been a long awaited move since we treat roughly 1.5 million people/year while our effective operational capacity is roughly 600,000-800,000 as our catchment area is not defined and we receive referrals from all over the country. The cluster will also help hospitals to plan for expansions according to the real catchment areas. It will reduce competition that currently exists between health sectors as sometimes there are two facilities expanding with the same capacity, sub specialty, and catchment area. This will facilitate proper allocation of resources throughout the country and I truly believe it is a promising move.</p><h4>How do you allocate your investments to build specialty centers?</h4><p>It goes back to community need; when we define the community we are serving, then we are able to determine the real need. Rural places are different from urban places in terms of the burden of diseases; certain geographic locations have more congenital diseases than others. It is essential to conduct comprehensive community assessment to define the catchment area in order to decide on the services based on the needs. At times there are advanced tertiary cases that can be referred elsewhere, and if we do not have referral access, we will develop the capacity ourselves.</p><h4>What is the hospital group's vision to address and enhance preventative care issues?</h4><p>Most of it is awareness and public education, either through different workshops and exhibitions or through social media. Our intention is to develop a family medicine center and serve the KSU population, which is about 250,000, including all employees, students, and families. The current plan is to build a database for the KSU population through the family medicine center and through that database we will reach out to patients and do the necessary screening and intervention, the necessary education, and introduce technological solutions to access all the population in the most efficient manner. In this way we hope to reduce, for example, instances of child obesity through nutritional education for families with high instances of diabetes or hypertension, in order to facilitate early detection. If we prevent this at an early stage, we can minimize the long-term complications. We are also encouraging campaigns for smoking cessation and advocating for exercise; these are the major areas that we aim to work on.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the interaction between education and healthcare and the focus areas for research?</h4><p>Every time we do a project or make a plan, we take into consideration its impact on educational research. There is a huge gap in family physicians and people specialized in family medicine and this gap can be bridged by the family medicine center. We need more graduates and training opportunities in the field to bridge this gap. Most research is focused on treatments with a combination of medicine, therapy, and surgical interventions, focusing public health research. We have a public health unit and with the necessary support we want it to grow and start tackling public health issues on a larger scale to determine the bigger interventional opportunities. We want to introduce technology with a new system of accessible healthcare and establish a virtual clinic with an experienced healthcare staff on call. We will also make accessible at home devices for people with diabetes, who will be able to scan their blood sugar levels with a smartphone application that sends the information to the clinic. When there is an abnormal reading, we can have them come to the clinic and adjust their medication; the same thing applies for blood pressure devices. This will reduce the need for patients to come to the hospital while allowing us to see more patients within the timeframe. The information can also be used for research and highlight people who are at risk, allowing us to intervene early to prevent complications.</p><h4>How have you advanced with private sector collaboration?</h4><p>Within research, we are branching into two arms, and we have a clinical trial unit established where we expect to attract big pharma companies to run their own trials on the Saudi population through this new reliable standardized facility. This should show us where we can intervene with drugs and new devices, and support our basic research lab through attracting companies also to come and initiate basic scientific research. The leveraging of technology presents exciting opportunities and there are many areas to develop, especially with smartphone applications. We started 13 applications for our patients and employees, to better gauge their experiences, define policies, and determine utilization so that we can optimally serve patients.</p><h4>What is your outlook and ambitions for the hospital group in the next year?</h4><p>We strive to improve our emergency services and are working with the case management unit to enhance it. Another target is to enhance overall patient experience, at all levels—communication, environment, care, and quality—and we place great emphasis on it. For our staff, we are establishing a new program called the staff experience program, to better understand staffs' atmosphere at work and their needs, as this strongly affects all our projects. We plan to maintain our stride and work within the budget restrictions, as this is a current challenge that we are willing to tackle.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Central Bank has set clear regulatory caps on consumer finance and loan-to-value ratios]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[peter-england-ceo-rakbank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is SME lending being encouraged in the UAE?</h4><p>There is a lot of talk about SME lending here at the moment. We ourselves have seen some results through the Mohammed bin Rashid Innovation Fund. We have dispersed one loan through the fund already and we are working to increase our cooperation. There is also talk about some kind of SME guarantee scheme being developed. From my experience, these things can work; however, ultimately the most powerful partnership is where the client and the bank work directly together on a risk participation basis: The client with their equity, and the bank with its funding, and the ensuing interest. That is the most effective model going forward. The risk of any guarantee scheme is that people may not be as committed, since they feel that someone else is going to step in if something goes wrong. The best model is where both the business owner and the bank are committed to the relationship.</p><h4>How do you qualify the level of financial education in the UAE?</h4><p>Historically, this has been a big area of weakness. The banks have overstretched borrowers and have not focused on consumer education. In the last three years, there has been a major push by the regulator to get more serious about proper financial education, disclosure, and helping clients understand the implications of the financial decisions that they are making. There has been an improvement there, but there is still room for growth. The Central Bank has done a tremendous job in terms of setting clear regulatory caps on consumer finance, loan-to-value ratios, and property settlement. Most things have been effective, and it is regrettable in a way that it needs to be regulated, but that is the nature of the world in most markets. In the next couple of years, there will be more progress regarding personal financial management, whether that be through a digital offering or through some fintech scenarios that are being developed. For example, there are a couple of comparison websites in the UAE and they will become increasingly common. On these websites, people will be able to look at independent views and then make their own decisions as to which provider to choose. This means that banks have to be competitive, transparent, and disclose the right thing.</p><h4>How are banks in the UAE adopting fintech in order to stay ahead of the curve?</h4><p>Fintech is the buzzword at the moment. The word is new but financial technology has been around since the inception of the ATM. I am seeing more hype than reality in the UAE at this stage. At RAKBANK, we started to use blockchain technology through a company called Ripple to do our transfers and payments to India. For this, we have a strategic partnership with Axis Bank in India. We have an instant money transfer platform called Rakmoney Transfer. We are planning to have more direct host-to-host links with banks in the Philippines, Pakistan, and Nepal. The problem is that the banks on the other side need to invest in having the same technology that we use, and that takes time. Historically, this is an area where banks have not been interested. The trick for these things is finding and effective cost to serve model for those clients that you may not necessarily be doing many things with. Those particular clients might typically earn a low salary and send a high percentage of their income back to their home country. We came up with a cost-effective solution that is largely digital to be able to bank those customers effectively and still build a relationship.</p><h4>To what extent is there going to be a level of consolidation in the UAE's banking sector?</h4><p>There are too many banks in the UAE. On top of that, taking aside the population that we have found a cost-effective way to serve, the so-called bankable population for traditional banking is maybe 3-4 million people maximum. To have 50 banks to serve that number of people is just not logical. There should be consolidation that makes sense to everyone. It is just a case of whether at the end of the day the individual shareholders of those organizations feel that it is in their interest to consolidate or not. From a purely economic standpoint, there should not be so many banks; it is just a case of finding banks that have a logical fit.</p><h4>What will be the economic driver for Ras Al Khaimah in 2018 and why?</h4><p>In Ras Al Khaimah, tourism will have an important role. In addition, real estate will continue to grow because there are new areas that are ideal for overseas investment. Obviously, the potential development could speed up with the expansion of Saqr Port. Ras Al Khaimah itself has a good future in terms of room for growth. For the rest of the UAE, it is more of a business as usual approach. Moreover, Expo 2020 is starting to get some traction and we are starting to see some flow of development for that.</p><h4>What role can free zones play in the developing of the banking sector in Ras Al Khaimah?</h4><p>In this regard, we have signed a MoU with RAKEZ. The idea is to work together and when new companies come to the free zone, RAKBANK should be the bank of choice. That is not to say we will bank all of them, but we effectively have first right of refusal. The entire intention is that RAKBANK should be the bank of choice.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[22-growth-in-2017]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the drivers behind Mercedes-Benz's growth figures, and what is your strategy to continue to break records every year?</h4><p>Mercedes-Benz has been around for over 130 years, and we have always been the leader in innovation. It is always the matter of representing a brand that is interesting for the premium market from the perspective of innovation, safety, and services, which are all important to the consumer, and it is sexy from the point of view of design. It has also become more important for our employees and the public to not only see our products and services but also how we behave, what we give back to society, how we get involved in issues in Mexico specifically, and so on. The success of the brand first and foremost has to do with the product. Five years ago, we introduced the new A Class, a new generation compact car (NGCC), and people truly love its design, sportiness, dynamics, and performance. We have done our homework not only in the compact segment, but also have impressive growth in the SUV segment, with 50-60% growth in SUVs depending on the country. From a global perspective Mexico is one of the top five countries in terms of growth. In 2016, we had 36% growth and in 2017, a 22%. We are number one in the Premium market in Mexico.</p><h4>What are the reasons behind your decision to construct a manufacturing facility in Aguascalientes?</h4><p>There are two reasons for being in Mexico: to be part of NAFTA, which is important for the American, Canadian, and Mexican markets, and because Mexico today is number five from a manufacturing perspective worldwide and is one of the big players with excellent quality, great labor laws to be fast and flexible on decisions, a large pool of young people, and great support from the different regions and the Mexican government. Overall it is a great country to invest in; the local market is growing and is close to the NAFTA markets and it also has great trade agreements with the European community; therefore, it is an interesting place to invest in.</p><h4>How do you foresee the NAFTA renegotiations impacting Mercedes-Benz in Mexico?</h4><p>I expect there to be a discussion on the level of numbers and not on emotions. The main point is the US' large trade deficit and the issue is not Mexico but Asia—specifically China. At some point, it needs to look at the real issues. I do not expect major changes and we still have WTO even if NAFTA is cancelled or things end up differently. I am in fact largely unbothered because I hope people understand the business and we are positive overall. We will proceed with our project in Aguascalientes and with our strategy for the future.</p><h4>What have been the results of Mercedes' innovation processes?</h4><p>Our AMG cars, which are our high-performance cars, have 25% to 30% less fuel consumption compared to the previous model; traditional engines are being optimized. We recently introduced hybrid cars into the Mexican markets and will introduce more in 2018; therefore, this is the next step before fully electric cars arrive. Electric cars are the future and will arrive fairly quickly so innovation will be essential, not only for Mercedes-Benz but everyone. The entire automobile industry is changing and we do not want to become like Nokia or Kodak; we are currently successful because we are adapting. One positive thing is that we are earning profits and are investing in new technologies. Cars are evolving into multi-media products and we need all kinds of different people working for us: more millennials and digital experts, and perhaps less engineers looking into the engines, especially in the future when we are talking about electric cars. Many things are also changing for our dealer network and retail; retailers will be needed, though perhaps in a different way and this will be from the perspective of commercialization. Connected cars and shared electric cars will be the future. We also launched a company called CASE, a year ago that is working on all these areas: Connectivity Autonomous, Sharing and Electrification. We are talking about a different kind of product in the future and this is a real challenge globally that will affect Mexico and we need to be prepared. On the one hand, we need to be operationally excellent currently and be careful with our execution; however, on the other hand, my responsibility is to get my dealer network prepared for the next decade at least because the future is rapidly approaching.</p><h4>What new ways of using cars will arise in the future?</h4><p>The expectation will be that we need to offer things like a shared platform for families and friends. A house of four will want to own three or four cars and we need to offer a solution of how we manage these four cars, who uses what, and who pays for what. There will be different models in the future and people will perhaps want to own less and share more cars. A large part of the population will likely want to own their cars and the question is if today's millennial will behave in the same way. There are many other question marks, such as Mexico being behind with the infrastructure, streets, and quality of infrastructure. The infrastructure for electric cars can be implemented quickly; it is more about the streets and pavements and we need a certain quality of streets and signs, which seems to be the challenge.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for 2018?</h4><p>Looking at the past 15-20 years, the Mexican economy has become independent of politics, which is different from Argentina or Brazil, where there is a huge dip in GDP and car sales when there is an election. This does not happen in Mexico and should not be the case in 2018. For the automobile sector, specifically, I do not expect a dip. Mercedes-Benz targets interesting growth and we are still in an offensive mode to introduce many new products to the market. Our dealers are extremely positive and want to go ahead. We wake up every day working to sell more cars.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[prof-dr-nila-f-moeloek-minister-health-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the implementation of the national healthcare scheme in Indonesia?</h4><p>Indonesia has taken significant steps towards universal health coverage through the development of an integrated national health scheme. One in particular is the social health insurance scheme called National Health Insurance (JKN) launched in 2014. The aim of JKN is to provide all citizens with access to quality health services, including prevention, promotion, treatment, and rehabilitation, while also protecting them from health-related financial hardships. The evaluation of the implementation of JKN includes issues such as membership coverage, healthcare providers, the financial aspect, healthcare utilization, and healthcare quality improvement. Indonesia has committed to achieving universal health coverage in 2019. In November 2017, JKN membership has reached 183,579,086 people, and the JKN scheme had reached approximately 73% of the population. Of this, 59.9% are from lower-income groups, 16.1% are informal workers and the unemployed, and 24% are formal workers. JKN involves public healthcare providers—community clinics and public hospitals—and private healthcare providers—private clinics and specialist clinics, individual physician practices, and private hospitals—as they are contracted by the Healthcare and Social Security Agency (BPJS Kesehatan). As of November 2017, BPJS Kesehatan has contracted 21,771 healthcare providers across the country, consisting of 5,900 primary healthcare providers and 2,261 referral healthcare providers. In 2016, there were up to 192.9 million visits using JKN, which is an almost 100% increase compared to 2014. In 1H2017, BPJS Kesehatan reported that the number of healthcare visits under JKN reached 106.2 million, which demonstrates that JKN has succeeded in improving access to healthcare for citizens. In terms of quality improvement, the Ministry of Health has implemented a healthcare referral system to ensure that all healthcare providers have a national standard. All referral healthcare providers must be accredited by 2019 and all primary healthcare providers—public health centers—must accredited by 2021. The Ministry of Health also set national clinical practice guidelines for both primary healthcare and referral healthcare.</p><h4>How has BPJS Kesehatan contributed to a more inclusive healthcare landscape?</h4><p>JKN is integrating the many fragmented insurance programs and covering the poor and near poor, civil servants, military personnel, police, pensioners, state enterprises, informal workers, and private formal workers; it is ensuring that the entire population will be covered under a single national health insurance program and brings Indonesia closer to achieving universal health coverage. BPJS Kesehatan is responsible for managing the national health insurance program. It has been operating as a “single payer" across the country and its role is recruiting the members, collecting premiums, accrediting healthcare providers, making payments to contracted healthcare providers, and handling complaints. The Ministry of Health, as the regulator, is responsible for setting regulations related to the implementation of JKN. In addition, the ministry is also responsible for ensuring healthcare provider availability, including health facilities, health workforce, medical equipment, and medication, by working together with local governments and the private sector.</p><h4>How do you envision the role of the ministry in attracting investment into the medical equipment and pharmaceutical sectors?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health aims for Indonesia to be more self-reliant in the field of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in order to meet healthcare needs at a more affordable price. High levels of imports of pharmaceutical raw materials and medical devices may affect the cost of health services in the event of economic fluctuations at a global level. Indonesia's pharmaceutical industry is promising for both domestic players and foreign investors. The Ministry of Health aims to accelerate the development of the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry. We released an Action Plan for the Development of Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Industry that was established by Regulation of the Minister of Health in 2017. According to the Presidential Decree No. 44/2016, pharmaceutical foreign industries that produce patented medication or high technology can use up to 85% of FDI while those that produce pharma raw materials as well as high-tech medical devices can use up to 100% FDI. This investment policy is expected to attract more investment to produce pharmaceutical raw materials and high-tech medical devices as well as reduce dependence on imports. Since 2016, there have been several new foreign investments in pharma and medical devices. Furthermore, the ministry has developed certain policies to attract investors, both from local and overseas, such as accelerating the licensing service, facilitating technical regulations, and promoting local medical products through exhibitions and workshops.</p><h4>How do you strive for inclusive healthcare and address public health issues given the sheer size of the country? </h4><p>The geography of the country is a big challenge for us. Therefore, our strategy is to address this challenge by improving coverage and community access to comprehensive and quality healthcare services and achieving the highest levels of community health. For this purpose, we have established a system which provides a health center for every 20,000 people. At present, there are 9,274 health centers across the country. Every health center provides public health services and medical services served by a team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists, sanitarians, pharmacists, and other health professionals and administrative staff. There are between 20-30 staff in each health center. Additionally, each center has its own satellites comprising Sub-Health Centers (Puskesmas Pembantu), Village Health Posts (Poskesdes), Village Midwives (Bidan Desa) and Village Health Posts (Posyandu). As the working area of a Health Center can be very large, mobile health centers are provided for outreach activities. The mobile clinics can be in the form of vans or small boats in the case of people that live on remote islands. Currently, we are strengthening the outreach activities of health centers by introducing the Family Health Approach (PIS-PK) whereby Puskesmas staff are carrying out home visits to detect health problems in the family, controlling health risk factors of the household, and referring patients to the health center should there be any family members who get sick. Recently, we are also starting to develop “Flying Health Care" for remote areas unaccesible by land or sea. To address the the financial constraints of healthcare access we have started the Social Health Insurance Scheme (JKN) since 2014 and we are now working toward universal healthcare. With regard to primary public health issues, Indonesia is now facing the double burden of communicable diseases and increasing rates of non-communicable disease. We are also still working on improving nutritional status and environmental health status in some parts of the country. Finally, I should mention that the Ministry of Health is intensifying promotional and preventive efforts such that the burden of healthcare for curative and rehabilative efforts can be reduced and health financing can become more efficient. We do this through the “Healthy Life Style" (Germas) program, which encourages physical exercise for 30 minutes per day, enough fruit and vegetables each day, and a medical check up every six months.</p><h4>How do you strive for synergies between public and private healthcare facilities?</h4><p>Private investment is essential to ensure access to and quality of healthcare. In order to optimize the referral system, the Ministry of Health has assigned 14 national referral hospitals, 20 provincial referral hospitals, and 110 regional referral hospitals, all of them public hospitals. Synergies between 948 public hospitals and 1,847 private hospitals can be seen in the provision of healthcare services under JKN to achieve universal health coverage by 2019. Private hospitals contribute by increasing access to healthcare and providing more beds and specialists.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the healthcare sector?</h4><p>Under the flagship of Healthy Indonesia Program, and in line with the President's vision and missions, we have invested those priorities in the Ministry of Health Strategic Planning Year 2015—2019. The plan includes accelerating, synergizing, and advancing preventive efforts for a healthy lifestyle using the Family Approach technique. Additionally, we encourage other sectors to support us through the Healthy Lifestyle Movement that emphasizes initiatives to improve the quality of life. We empower the central and regional governments, as well as community groups to promote a healthy lifestyle. We are also improving health access for the community, especially in term of infrastructures in remote isolated and border-line areas as well as islands</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[maryam-eid-almheiri-ceo-media-zone-authority-abu-dhabi-twofour54]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the role of twofour54 in Abu Dhabi today?</h4><p>twofour54 was established a decade ago to play an instrumental role in developing the media sector in Abu Dhabi. We do this in three ways. The first is that we attract content creators and media companies from all around the world to Abu Dhabi. The second is we support these companies by providing a vibrant ecosystem that offers all the facilities they require to grow their business, and a community of like-minded individuals to collaborate, innovate, and create. The third way we help develop the media sector in Abu Dhabi is through talent development initiatives that offer training, internship and job opportunities for the next generation of media professionals. We are proud that as we approach our 10th anniversary we have attracted more the 460 regional and international companies, while 37% of our partners are Emirati owned and we have contributed to the economy of Abu Dhabi by creating jobs and driving value. Equally, we are proud that the content that has been created in our ecosystem has entertained and opened the hearts and minds of people across the world.</p><h4>How does film production fit into the media strategy of Media Zone Authority - Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Film production is at the core of our strategy. Attracting big production studios and filming blockbusters in Abu Dhabi has a huge impact on developing the media sector. From a positioning perspective, movies such as Disney's Star Wars and Universal's Fast &amp; Furious 7 have put Abu Dhabi on the global map as a versatile and attractive filming location. Indian blockbuster Tiger Zinda Hau alone exposed Abu Dhabi to a staggering 592 million Bollywood fans. There is also the positive economic impact from filming in Abu Dhabi. It has been estimated that for each dirham spent through our 30% cash rebate programme, an average of AED3.1 is returned to Abu Dhabi. Moreover, these film productions attract companies within the supply chain as well as talent, growing the ecosystem even further and supporting it with access to great opportunities.</p><h4>How is the education sector in Abu Dhabi involved in fostering talent in media?</h4><p>Everyone understands the important role media plays in our day-to-day life and in business and politics. Many universities and educational institutions in Abu Dhabi have dedicated programmes for media and the creative industries. And we at twofour54 have relationships with all of them as part of our internship programme I mentioned before. We are also working closely with these entities to align the curricula with the rapidly changing needs of content creators as well as change the perception of the industry.</p><h4>How does the media sector fit into the economic Vision 2030 for Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Media is one of the 12 sectors identified in Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030 as the growth sectors that will help the Emirate achieve its agenda of economic diversification. As such, the government has committed to invest in the best technology in the world to ensure the media sector not only flourishes but stays at the cutting edge of innovation. And we are already reaping the rewards from these investments. If we look at job creation, in twofour54 alone we have 4,000 jobs including freelancers. And the economic contribution of the twofour54 community reached AED1.5 billion in 2016. In addition, we are storytellers, creating content that showcases Abu Dhabi and its achievements to the world.</p><h4>What UAE values would you like to see promoted outside and inside the country?</h4><p>We firmly believe that the four values the nation is celebrating in 2018, the “Year of Zayed," namely wisdom, respect, sustainability, and human development, should be the foundations for all nations. Respect is a key value of the UAE; many discussions on this issue began when the Ministry of Tolerance was inaugurated. However, for us at twofour54, respect is about more than just a ministry; it is embedded in our genes, and with 200 nationalities in the Emirate, we welcome everyone to call this their home. In our community, twofour54, and the media sector, we always aim to bring people together and create stories about who we are. We need to make our narrative and voice stronger to bring people together. Equally, developing people is a vital part of plans to develop a diverse, knowledge-based economy, and, of course, sustainability is a value everyone on the planet needs to have close to their hearts if we are to preserve our environment for future generations. If the children of today grow up and hear and learn the values of His Highness Sheikh Zayed, we will not only be investing in the future of media, but will be building a stronger world. And let's not forget, none of this would be possible without the wisdom of our nation's leaders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Focusing on tenants, suppliers, and employees]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bonny-budi-satiawan-ceo-mega-manunggal-property]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You came on as just CEO last year and had a year of aggressive expansion, including major investments and profit increases. What drove your returns?</h4><p>In 2017, we had a significant project come online that increased revenues considerably. That project was a 30,000sqm warehouse for Lazada, an Indonesian e-commerce company. The margin for each individual built-to-suit warehouse is high because our costs are only insurance, property and building taxes, and technicians' salaries; hence, our profits increased. Other key moves that allowed us to increase profitability were efficiency in payroll; almost 50% of our operating expenses come from salaries. We managed to recycle employment so when people retire we hire new ones that meet our needs. By the end of March 2018, we will have three more warehouses totaling 100,000sqm. If one warehouse at 30,000sqm increased profits by 15%, you can imagine what three times that volume will do.</p><h4>Your business is capital intensive. Do you prefer banks or capital markets, and what is the reasoning behind your recent rights issue?</h4><p>We have not taken on much bank debt. We have about USD37.4 million of debt and USD339 million of liquid equity. As a result, we have kept our debt low and opted for the rights issue. There is something interesting that we do when we need to borrow: we build a warehouse using equity money, wait until we have started to generate cash flow, and then we borrow money using the assets as collateral. This lowers the rate. We have about 35ha of land at this point in time, to develop it we need to borrow money.</p><h4>What changes have you brought in since you became CEO?</h4><p>When I started as CEO, I changed many things. One of the things is I told everyone that we need to focus on three aspects: tenants, suppliers, and employees. Tenants bring you profit and revenues, the supplier brings you yields, and the employees execute. Then, there are the yields that our shareholders want. Fourth is the funding, fifth is land banking, and the last is execution. We have a team here that takes note of the risk; every business decision we make is passed on to this division. We look into the resources and limitations, and what we need to do to make sure it is sustainable.</p><h4>Between leasing out an entire space to one client (BTS) and having a multi-tenant arrangement, what is your preference?</h4><p>My preference is for BTS; however, we cannot deny there is going to be a balance between the two because BTS locks you in for five to 10 years. However, multi tenants require you to set a price. BTS provides security and safety of your finance and cash flow. The difference between BTS and multi tenants is simple, if you have a location in a prime area, you do multi-tenants because the price of the land is expensive; however, many people will go to that location. You can then charge a higher rate because of this, and you also have to spend more to market it, but its profitable.</p><h4>You have rapidly gotten commitments for all of the new spaces that you build. What is driving demand in Indonesia today? </h4><p>First, we had to educate the market, because our warehouses are not traditional warehouses, which are low in terms of height. In ours, you can stack up to eight pallets, which is double the volume. Our price is based on square meter, so it is higher than others, but with this per square meter rate you can stack up a great number of palettes, which makes us appealing. In terms of trends, FMCG will continue to grow, but there will be a point where it will not grow anymore. There will be a lot of changes in terms of SKU's etc. FMCG is still doing well and capacity continues to grow. Ecommerce is interesting, but the only thing that worries me is that none of it is making money. Therefore, the way we mitigate risks is not to avoid them but to make sure our design caters to other sectors. It's a volume game.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for 2018? </h4><p>I am quite optimistic. The business plan I submitted in 2016 was that 2017 would be tough, and this was the case. Our strategy is to get into land for future growth, because when things are slow there is a lot of cheap land. We have 35ha and we can develop a greater volume in 2018. If you look at the cycle of warehouses, then at the end of five years people want to consolidate everything. If you are centralized, it is efficient; we are seeing that happen now. As of now, we have roughly 70-80% more enquiries compared to 2017. These are for delivery in mid-2019 to 2020. I assume that in the second half of 2018 things will pick up, because I can see who the tenants that come to us are—all the large multinationals. Effectively that means large growth in revenues and capacity. Then much later, once we have developed this 35ha, we will sell our completed projects to REITS to finance more construction. This is how we will manage cash flow and stay profitable in the long term. We are going to have five warehouses delivered in 2019 with a total capacity of around 240,000sqm. We will do this in phases to fill the capacity at a consistent pace. Certainly, logistics and warehousing isn't going anywhere, and consumer spending will pick up this year. We see ourselves as a much larger and more profitable company shortly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[From USD10 million to ~USD10 billion over 40 years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sri-prakash-lohia-group-chairman-indorama]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider to be Indorama's main achievements?</h4><p>The Group has grown from USD10 million to almost USD10 billion over the last 40 years. We are extremely proud of our history and our origins in Indonesia. The people of this country and company are the ones who make the real difference. We employ over 10,000 people in Indonesia and over 30,000 people worldwide. Indonesia is where it all began for us. This is a great country and one that supports industry. We are a large producer and exporter of products. To produce industrial goods, a company needs great people. We have continuous production and we export to almost 80 countries around the world. We are competitive, and a great deal of the competitiveness derives from our relationship with Indonesia.</p><h4>How would you compare the ease of doing business between Southeast Asia and Africa, where you have operations?</h4><p>We operate in most countries according to the local market situation and the strength of its exports. Every country has a different philosophy. Manufacturing is manufacturing; a company has to produce goods at the lowest cost. It must have its customers' trust. There are specific issues to each country. In Nigeria, for example, we have a power plant that generates electricity because the local supply is unreliable. Indonesia, on the other hand, has a strong grid and we are pleased with the infrastructure available to us here. We also have some power plants to support our activities here, though in general infrastructure is first class. This lowers costs for us.</p><h4>How has demand for your products evolved in the last few years?</h4><p>Demand for our products is growing worldwide. It has grown around 5-10% YoY over the last 40 years. Our growth is in line with the GDP plus a little extra. The local market is also growing. Our plastics business are growing particularly well as they are used for basic consumer goods. Fibers for textiles are also strong. Fertilizers are doing well, and demand is growing around the world. Many of our Indonesian products are export oriented.</p><h4>What are the strategies that allow foreign companies to succeed in Indonesia?</h4><p>Indonesia is a transparent place, and people welcome foreigners. This is a great advantage. They want foreigners to come and succeed. We are pleased to have had a great relationship with our Indonesian counterparts for the last 40 years. The quality of the people and the community has truly been one of the secrets to our success. In some places, manpower is an issue; however, in Indonesia it is a strength. The most important thing is to have people produce high quality products while not messing around; if productivity is great, companies will be profitable. The Indonesian workforce is well trained. We recently built a world class engineering polytechnic principally the underpriviliged children of our local community as well as of our Indonesian employees, which is heavily subsidised by our Group as well as our partners. We currently have 240 students and this allows us to give something back to society. We want to improve skills of these students, create knowledge and illustrate how grateful we are.</p><h4>What are your investment and development plans?</h4><p>We have a large CAPEX for new projects as well as to upgrade our existing operations. We need to continuously upgrade and replace our plant and machinery . We must have faith in the country and the business and must continue to invest. We always reinvest our earnings in the business , which is why our product is of such high quality and why our people are so pleased. We want to keep costs down while improving production and efficiency.</p><h4>As a businessman, what legacy would you like to leave in Indonesia?</h4><p>Our legacy is demonstrating that those from other countries have succeeded while believing in and supporting local culture and people. This is a free country and anyone can succeed in business. Hard work is the key to success in this country. The national infrastructure and government structure are also key, and they have been supportive. We are a public company; however, our family is the majority shareholder. The most important thing is to run a family company like any other corporation. We must have rapid decision-making, hard workers, and a focus on lowering costs. A company also needs to have a long-term focus. It needs great financial management and people should trust the company. Both its employees and banks should trust the company.</p><h4>How do you expect the company and the economy to change over the next year?</h4><p>We hope the Jakarta Metro will start operations in 2018. We also hope all the infrastructure projects in the country will be further along, which will put a smile on our faces. Traveling in this country can take a long time and we hope to see this improving. We have an overburdened system, though this is the price one pays for industrialization.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[100% Local Expertise]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ernest-azudialu-obiejesi-executive-chairman-obijackson-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Obijackson Group is currently one of the leading conglomerates in Nigeria. What advice would you give to your peers and investors looking to enter into business here?</h4><p>It was important to us to look at areas of the economy that were emerging or where opportunities existed at the time. We focused our attention on those areas and developed our business from there. Our businesses in the oil and gas sector are the result of the opportunities that emerged. Nigeria used to be one of the leading producer countries in the world and has been producing oil for over 50 years. In those 50 years, most Nigerian companies were not involved in oil production; there were mostly overseas and international companies working in the sector. We saw opportunities for Nigerians to enter the oil business and participated by developing a company to provide oil and gas services: this is how Obijackson Group started. From the services business, we progressed into the oil production business. We have other companies within the group that have been created out of the opportunities that arose at the time we were doing projects for major oil companies. This is why Obijackson Group currently has a portfolio of diverse companies covering different aspects of oil and gas. Because we have a production company as well, we are more or less doing the same work as international oil companies (IOC) such as Shell, Total, and ExxonMobil. The difference is that we are 100% local and use local Nigerians to grow the country's production. This is extremely important because we want to continue to build capacity in Nigerians. Over time, Nigeria has started doing this work well.</p><h4>What are some of the most important projects and investments you have undertaken?</h4><p>We have investments in the oil and gas area, though we have also invested in other parts of the economy, including the power business. We are currently trying to conclude a deal for a mega power plant planned for east Nigeria where we will use gas from our oil fields to power the plant. We have invested some money in that. Over the years, we have also invested in other areas of the economy, such as telecommunications and major construction companies. In the construction sector, we developed a company in which we are the majority owners. Our investment in telecoms is in Smile Communications, which was the first Nigerian company to offer 4G. The company is also present in Tanzania, Congo, and several other West African countries. We look for new opportunities as the economy diversifies and also seek ways to get out of the oil sector because oil will not be there forever.</p><h4>Three of Obijackson Group's subsidiaries were included in the LSE's 'Companies to Inspire Africa' report. What does this mean for the Group and for Nigeria?</h4><p>This was a great result for the Obijackson Group. It was inspiring for us to have LSE deem three of our companies as the future. For us as a Group, it was a sign that going public is something we are moving closer to both in Nigeria and London. More importantly, these businesses that are being talked about in London are businesses that we need to develop a succession plan for. We need to remain focused on getting these companies into the market. Also for Nigeria, this is the beginning of transformation for certain indigenous companies that aspire to be listed. Other companies will look at this acknowledgment and realize what we have done is a great way to go about growing their businesses as well. For us, the next challenge is looking at coming to the market as soon as everything is ready.</p><h4>What else should the government and the private sector in Nigeria do to send a more positive message to the international investor community?</h4><p>Nigeria has a lot to do to send the right message to the international community in terms of attracting investment into the country. First, the regulatory authorities need to ensure that all the legal bottlenecks that affect and make doing business difficult in Nigeria are addressed; there are too many regulatory bodies involved in the process. The government needs to align all these to encourage more foreign investors. Once the policy is achieved, Nigeria's currency also needs to be stabilized with a mechanism to cushion and guide it, similar to most currencies around the world. Large currency fluctuations have to be eliminated. The government has to monitor the economy in such a way that it becomes more investment friendly. That, along with removing the bottlenecks and complicated regulations, will create a safe environment for those who want to come and do business in Nigeria.</p><h4>What is your outlook at Obijackson Group for 2018?</h4><p>For Obijackson Group, 2018 is a promising year because we expect to consolidate on the gains we have achieved over the years. Nigeria has just emerged from a recession and we are now beginning to show signs of growth. Most of our companies' projections for 2018 are promising because we have a stable economy and foreign exchange rates have stabilized somewhat. With this, most of the losses and pains from the recession are behind us and we will now build and make our mark. Most well-structured businesses in Nigeria will do well in 2018. It is a promising year for the Group in oil production, construction, and more. The price of oil has stabilized somewhat. In terms of developments between OPEC, Russia, and the US, all the signs are that oil prices will remain around the USD60 mark, which we are comfortable with. Most of our major income in the Group comes from our exploration &amp; production (E&amp;P) business and in 2018 we want to ramp up our production by at least an additional 30-40%. Oil and gas is still our dominant business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[7.1% GDP Growth in Medellí­n in 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[sergio-escobar-executive-director-aci-medellin]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the agency evolved over the past 15 years given the transformation of Medellí­n?</h4><p>We have been working extremely hard in the past 15 years to create a better city, not because we want a better reputation in the world, but because we want to provide a better quality of life for the people who live here and for those who visit us. We have been working in two different businesses, attracting international cooperation as well as national and international investment. We are doing great, not only because we have solid numbers, but because those who bet on a new field of expansion are able to find the human talent they need here. We want to be different; we will not compare ourselves to other Colombian or Latin American cities. We want to give foreign investors the confidence that Medellí­n is the ideal place where they can create a platform to open new local, regional, national, and international businesses.</p><h4>In October 2017, ACI Medellí­n went to Mexico City for the event 'Why Medellí­n?' What are the main highlights of this event?</h4><p>We have one tool to attract international investment, and we call it 'Why Medellí­n?' which seeks to capture the attention of businessmen, entrepreneurs and investors and let them know they have to come to or find out more about Medellí­n. We want to demonstrate that we have and know how to play in the international field. We went to Mexico because it is an important player in international business. Today, we are partners in the Pacific Alliance that we created seven years ago and it is working extremely well. Medellí­n will be where large projects in different fields, such as manufacturing, services, logistics, and education, will take place. We will renovate the city's downtown area and invest COP4.2 billion until 2019 just on this project. We want to make our downtown different and enjoyable, similar to Madrid, Florence, or Rome. This will be a public-private partnership and both the private and public sectors are working hard on this. During the Mexico event, we also noted that even though Colombia, Mexico, or Latin America are not seeing great growth, there are cities such as Medellí­n that are doing extremely well. Colombia's GDP for 2017 will likely be around 1.7%, while that of Medellí­n has grown about 7.1%, and in the region, GDP growth will be close to 8.3%. We are working hard to show that we are not stopping here.</p><h4>80% of the investment that reaches Medellí­n comes from abroad. Which are the main markets and what others is ACI Medellí­n looking into?</h4><p>We target special countries, though there have been investors from places we have not promoted Medellí­n to before, such as Singapore, South Korea, and so on, which is a pleasant surprise to us. Thus far we have received investment from the US, Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, as well as other atypical countries such as Switzerland, Guatemala, the Netherlands, the UK, and Panama. We have conducted research to determine what to do in 2018 and have found certain countries of interest such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and even Ghana in which could be a great option to promote Medellí­n as an investment destination.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the end of this year and which sectors show the most potential?</h4><p>We targeted total FDI of USD200 million in 2017; however, as of September 30 we reached USD372 million and still have three months to add some numbers. In terms of sectors, innovation, manufacturing, and agroindustry are the key fields of investment that have come to Medellí­n. For many decades, this was an important manufacturing city; however, today we are working to be a services city as well. We also target services in different fields such as health, energy, construction, S.T.I., and recently the aerospace industry. We seek to provide maintenance services to the different types of planes flying in Latin America. We are currently improving an important aerospace industry cluster that is taking place in this city. Its headquarters are in the international airport and today there are 16 different private companies providing these services that have already been certified by Airbus, Boeing, and other key private air companies and airlines. Today, we have on our list 10 more companies that seek to be new partners in this industry in Medellí­n. We will see huge numbers in the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Leading oilfield services since 1972]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hussam-ali-marafie-chairman-ceo-gas-oil-field-services-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you introduce the history of GOSCO and the scope of its services?</h4><p>GOFSCO is one of the leading oilfield services companies in the country and was established in 1972. In the beginning, the company focused on upstream services for Kuwait Oil Company (KOC), and has since evolved and grown exponentially following the changes and developments in the market. Our slickline services started at a time when there was a large demand for preventive maintenance on the numerous wells being drilled here. I joined GOFSCO in 2005 and the company has been substantially revamped since then. The number of employees has increased from eight to 450 today and this is largely due to the strategic plan put in place to achieve our vision for the company. Part of this plan is to ensure that our workforce was world-class thus allowing us to bring many talented individuals on board. We also made considerable investments in our equipment and infrastructure to ensure that we were indeed able to service the industry in Kuwait in the best way possible. These calculated steps that we have taken have enabled GOFSCO to become one of the pillars of service companies in the country. We provide what clients want and speak their language. At the moment, we hold approximately 40% market share within our sector. Upstream to midstream oilfield services in Kuwait are our core service line, and we offer wide range of the oil field services that local market demands. Most of our services in Kuwait are served onshore, and the offshore market is completely new in Kuwait. New concessions should be awarded in 2018 and activity will follow after that. Our personnel and equipment backed by our long-standing experience are able to support both onshore and offshore oil field markets, and while having we plans to offer a wide range of offshore services to cope with the demand that will come in that segment in a year's time. The government also plans to make substantial investments in the country's hydrocarbon assets. Around 30% of these assets are offshore, and GOFSCO will certainly be part of the offshore expansion that is happening. We are very diverse in our company culture, we are very dynamic in changing our strategies to meet the new targets and to be aligned and cope with our country leadership vision.</p><h4>As a local company with 45 years of experience, how has GOFSCO contributed to Kuwait?</h4><p>Being a local company, we have to rely on our local resources to provide our services in a high-quality assurance and safe work environment. We own our equipment, bring the best talented workforce on board and train them, and provide services and solutions based on our long experience. Due to our long relationship with our clients, we have created a strong bond of trust, especially with KOC, which is our main client and is responsible for 90% of our work activities; we consider our relationship as a partnership rather than customer relationship. Another large client we have here is Kuwait Gulf Oil Company (KGOC). We take pride in being dynamic and flexible in providing our services to the local market. We have employees who have been with us for more than 30 years and this continuity gives us an advantage over any other player in the market. We are here to stay and have built up a strong knowhow and trust with our clients. We stand shoulder to shoulder with them to ensure they are able to reach their targets and fulfill their vision. One of our targets for the next three to four years is to increase the number of locals working in our company to over 70%. This is in fact is a win-win situation because the more competitive the market becomes, the more we want to keep our investment in the country. There is a high turnover of foreign staff in the oil and gas business because expatriate workers move around to new jobs internationally. Locals typically stay in the country until retirement. Provided the company plans properly, hiring more Kuwaitis will prove to be the right strategy. Localization gives us a more sustainable employment base in terms of turnover and our clients appreciate this stability as well.</p><h4>How are you strengthening your position to become the preferred business partner for primary operators operating in the region?</h4><p>GOFSCO's strategy is to have experienced people on board and ensure we have the most reliable equipment. We invest a great deal in both our people and equipment. We try to align ourselves with the challenges of our client and predict how we can fix any new issues they might have. For example, to adhere to our clients' production goals and schedules, we have equipment to test and service wells, both when they are producing and when they are shut off. Our assets and equipment have been able to accommodate all the changes that have happened in the market over 45 years. We understand the trends because of our experience here and have developed a strong database of market trends and client behavior. We also ensure all our equipment is state of the art. We position ourselves as a company with high standards that is comparable to any of the international players in the market. There are major players in the oil and gas sector that have their own R&amp;D centers and produce their own latest technologies. In comparison, we draw on the numerous sources of new technologies that are available in the market today. We have a dedicated team that looks for changes and enhancements in technology for us to adopt. We also create a number of customized competitive solutions for our clients. What differentiates us is the 'flexibility' factor, to bring any proven technologies and solutions by importing them to our country.</p><h4>How does GOFSCO ensure a constant commitment to the highest health, safety, and the environment (HSE) standards?</h4><p>HSE are our core values and part of our culture at GOFSCO. We ensure on a daily basis that the safety culture is part of every employee's approach to work. We have a dedicated team, including certified people, who look after HSE. Every quarter, a team in charge of safety practices performs a site visit for spot checks to ensure all our safety standards are being applied and followed. Any accident—day or night—is immediately reported to me as part of our HSE procedures, and we have a fast response safety team. Every day the head of the team at every site holds a safety meeting to remind our onsite working employees about the safety procedures they need to follow, because we deal with high pressures and toxic gases on a daily basis. We also have a system of safety observations where staff can note down any safety issues that arise and we address these during a weekly staff meeting. These procedures have helped us avoid accidents.</p><h4>Are you considering expanding internationally?</h4><p>We are still evaluating the markets outside Kuwait. The most attractive markets as of now are Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Libya as they are less saturated with competition and are less complicated to bid in. Because of the turmoil in the region, we have revised our five-year plan and will focus on Kuwait. We have long been an integrated oilfield services company, though our local clients have opened up more doors to turnkey solution companies in recent times. Clients used to ask us to stick to what we know; however, their demands are changing. Currently, we attract experienced partners that can teach us in services that we did not do in the past. Working outside Kuwait is on hold at this stage while we concentrate on building our strengths inside the country and closing any gaps in our capabilities. My vision is to be a local oilfield services company that can be a strong arm for the country, providing all the solutions that are needed. We can acquire technology or close joint ventures with companies that can bring their know-how here and thereby help us create more opportunities for locals. Some 90% of Kuwait's income depends on oil and gas, and our young people should be aware of and understand the changes and challenges that are happening in this sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[abdulaziz-bin-ali-al-tuwaijri-chairman-board-trustees-dar-al-uloom-university]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you fit into the higher education landscape of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>DAU has been following a strategic direction to position itself at the cutting edge of higher education in the region, and this was largely through attaining the accreditation of the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment (NCAAA) in 2017. Achieving accreditation was the culmination of years of hard work and development. DAU has invested heavily in recruiting and retaining high-value faculty who are considered leaders in their fields. This high caliber of faculty allows for groundbreaking research in our colleges. The combination of our faculty and their research facilitates DAU's partnerships with local and international giants of education and industry to come together to continue to ensure DAU provides sustained and valuable services to the local community. DAU is proud to be considered a leader and trendsetter in the higher education landscape of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Your curriculum is developed in consultation with King Fahd University of Petroleum and Management (KFUPM). How has this collaboration developed, and what is the impact on the development of students?</h4><p>KFUPM is one of our distinguished partners, and we are proud of our mutually beneficial relationship. In recent years, there has been universal acceptance amongst leading universities that teach soft skills, and critical thinking is of paramount importance and needs to be a core component of a student's learning experience. DAU ensures that core soft skills, such as citizenship, innovation, and the development personal values, are clearly embedded into curricula to ensure DAU graduates have the highest value in the market and are fully capable of meeting the demands of the 21st century society and the responsibility of Vision 2030.</p><h4>How do you envision striving to align graduate employability with industry requirements graduate employability, particularly in line with Vision 2030?</h4><p>DAU relishes the heavy responsibility that Vision 2030 places on higher education. DAU graduates already enjoy tremendous rates of employability; however, the university is in a continuous process of increasing alignment between DAU graduate skills and workplace requirements through a blend of strategic partnerships and learning communities. DAU strives to fill the gap in the market by constantly developing and creating solutions to market challenges and producing the graduates needed to meet the goal of Saudization and Vision 2030. DAU consultations with the business world allow direct input from industry on curricula content and projects, and a significant budget is allocated for serving the community through research. For example, in recent years, DAU responded to the market and now operates two new colleges: the state-of-the-art College of Medicine and College of Dentistry. Vision 2030 demands the highest standards from DAU, and we ensure these standards through successfully achieving external validation through accreditation by bodies such as the NCAAA and, for its college of law, the High Council for Evaluation of Research and Higher Education (HCERES). Furthermore, DAU encourages students to actively participate in learning communities to promote personal development before they graduate. This blend of external and internal strategies makes DAU optimistic with regards to achieving the objectives of Vision 2030.</p><h4>Furthermore, Vision 2030 aims to build a knowledge-based society. What role does research play in your university, and what are your primary focus areas?</h4><p>Vision 2030 will ensure the Kingdom is a knowledge-based society, and DAU is playing a critical role in this regard. DAU has invested heavily in upgrading the education and skills of its students to enhance the Kingdom's human capital. DAU has always been committed to serving the community and regularly participates in training programs, debate competitions, and other community service programs. Furthermore, DAU also views its partnerships with industry essential to building a knowledge-based community. DAU's dynamic partnerships ensure industry help develop curricula to prepare DAU students for swift employment, and DAU's faculty cultivate student's skills and capabilities through its cutting edge educational instruction and programs.</p><h4>A global trend in education is to have more digital classrooms and blended learning facilities. What is your vision for digitalization and innovation within the university?</h4><p>DAU understood several years ago that remaining relevant and a leader in higher education requires continual leverage and exploitation of new digital technology tools. DAU developed a strategy to ensure digital technologies are part of every department and technology opportunities are open to all students and faculty. At DAU, every student and staff member has access to a state-of-the-art online platform for all their academic and professional needs; they can access the platform any time and from any place in addition to our world class digital library. DAU's strategy does not see its digitalization efforts as a stand-alone component, but rather, it is at the core of the organization's business strategy. In this age, DAU believes that universities that do not prepare themselves for the digital era will be left behind. Those who are determined to remain leaders in the sector know that the time to act has already begun.</p><h4>What is your agenda with regards to internationalization of staff, students, and programs?</h4><p>DAU's strategy is not simply to expand its internationalization initiatives, but to maintain its existing position in the higher education field, and our recent success in achieving accreditation from the NCAAA will support our efforts. DAU has always built and developed its internationalization programs to students and faculty. DAU has invested in attracting the most qualified and experienced educators to collaborate with our distinguished national faculty members, which has allowed DAU to successfully obtain internationally recognized accreditation for our university and also our College of Law. This allows a blend of national and international culture, knowledge, and experience to support DAU students throughout their time with us, exposing them to the real, multicultural world that awaits them upon graduation. DAU students are a diverse group of national and international students who share experiences and social mores together building modern, forward thinking individuals capable of making a positive change in the world.</p><h4>What are your primary ambitions for the years ahead?</h4><p>DAU's ambitions for the years ahead are a continuation of the core beliefs of the university since its inception: quality of education through national and international program accreditation feeding into production of valuable research to serve the demands, needs, and rights of the community. DAU will work continuously to support Vision 2030 and will be a guiding light to the Kingdom and beyond. DAU will continue to grow its culture of quality throughout every step we take, from the planning to the implementation of everything we do. DAU will not tire from seeking further internationally recognized accreditation for its various programs and colleges and is looking forward to the third successful visit by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) in early 2018. DAU will strive to create and promote research opportunities for faculty and support, through funding, the research process, serving the local community and contributing to the development of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its citizens.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The work there has been very difficult. Nigeria, of course, has suffered from the drop in the oil prices. Things are just now getting better, but the conversation we need to have with Nigeria, I believe, is in many ways related to the theme that I brought to the table just recently, which is investment in human capital. The percentage of GDP that Nigeria spends on healthcare is less than<br>1%. Despite the fact that there is so much turbulence in the northern part of the country and hit taken from the drop in the oil prices, Nigeria has to think ahead by investing in its people and investing in the things that will allow Nigeria to thrive. A rapidly growing, private-sector led economy in the future is what the country has to focus on right now. It cannot rely just on oil prices going back up. It has to think: what are going to be the sources of growth in the future for Nigeria, in what will surely be a more digitalized economy? And this is true for most of Africa. If you look at the numbers in terms of how successfully African countries have invested into human capital versus other regions, there is a real issue. And so, over this next year, not only in Nigeria but in all of Africa, we are going to focus on accelerating investments in people—in human capital we call it—including health, education, and social protection so that Africa can prepare itself for the next phase in economic development. One of the real questions that we all have is regarding our traditional notions of economic growth, which include agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry, and how many countries in Africa will actually experience that. We must question, do we need to really think about another kind of path to economic growth that is focused on a SMEs and entrepreneurship as they have in other parts of the world? We still do not know that. However, the one thing we know is that better health and education outcomes will be critical no matter what the global economy looks like. Therefore, yes support the recovery and peace building in the north, hope that as commodity prices stabilize, oil prices come back up and the economy will grow a bit more, but very much focus on what the drivers of growth in the future will be and on mobilizing domestic revenues for investments in people.</p><h4>One of the key features of the African economy today is the rise of start-ups and young entrepreneurs. What kind of support is the World Bank giving in terms of assistance to support this group of young people?</h4><p>It is difficult for major institutions such as ours to give the relatively small amounts of money that are required for SMEs. That is why we are working with companies like Alibaba. Alibaba in China has developed a system where within five seconds, literally within five seconds, they can provide loans to SMEs for up to USD160,000. And they do that solely based on the online activity. So, online activity for Alibaba is a better measure of credit worthiness than the traditional processes that we call “know your customer" (KYC). We are looking to see if we can utilize some of these methods, these rapid disbursements of capital to SMEs, in Africa. Right now, the answer is not yet, because we do not have enough information on online behavior. Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba, recently visited Kenya because it is probably the one country that has the most information on people's online behavior, as 98% of Kenyans do some form of financial transactions online. Within Africa, we have to be much more creative. We are looking at future drivers of growth, and whether they will be traditional drivers like industry or something less conventional like investing in human capital. And then, we are looking at innovative ways of moving capital, moving capital quickly and efficiently to people who are going to start promising businesses, is probably a major direction we have to go. Right now, it is still pretty slow and difficult because we are always working with financial intermediaries, which makes things much more difficult for us.*</p><p>*Excerpted from his remarks at the opening press conference in Washington, DC in October 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[2nd Unit of Geothermal Plant Operational in October 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[shinichi-aburaya-chief-executive-sarulla-operations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In October 2017, Sarulla commenced the second unit at its geothermal power plant, after the first unit opened in March 2017. Could you tell us more about this project?</h4><p>The second phase generates 110MW and construction went smoothly because our contractor learned a great deal from the first phase, which took a little longer than expected. We are pleased that the second unit went operational on October 2, seven weeks ahead of schedule. Each unit of the three phases consists of seven generators: one steam turbine generator from Toshiba (Japan) producing about 60MW and the remaining six manufactured by ORMAT Technologies (USA). With those six units, we produce another 50MW and the combination is called an integrated geothermal combined cycle (IGCC) that uses both steam and hot water, which is called brine, at a temperature of around 200 to 300 degrees Celsius. The third unit is scheduled to be operational by May 2018. It will add another 110MW to the total capacity. The Sarulla area is brine dominated, and the energy coming out is high-pressure steam and high-pressure brine (hot water). In other parts of Indonesia, most of the areas are steam dominated. For brine-dominated resources, the ORMAT equipment (called OEC, Ormat Energy Converter) is suitable and energy can be extracted from the brine, which is not possible just using a steam turbine generator. For nearly 20 years ORMAT, together with ITOCHU, has been promoting this system in Indonesia. In 2004, government decided that PLN as a new owner of the project had to invite interested developers to bid to take over the previous development made by UNOCAL. MEDCO, the second largest private oil and gas company in Indonesia and the second largest next to PERTAMINA, raised a hand as it wanted to grow further in the renewable sphere. They found the Sarulla bid as a great opportunity. MEDCO approached ORMAT, who sought the support of ITOCHU, and a combination of MEDCO, ORMAT, and ITOCHU formed the original consortium. In 2004, Indonesia was still considered by many international banks not quite ready for large infrastructure projects, which is why it remained difficult to get financing with reasonable rates. Around 2006 onwards, the consortium felt it was time to further promote Sarulla, invited KYUSHU Electric (Japan) to join and started pursuing a viable financing proposal based on the support from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) as well as Asian Development Bank (ADB). We had to amend certain portions of the original contracts executed by the previous developer, which unfortunately took much longer than expected; however, in 2014 we could start construction. From the initial bid, it took 10 years until the start of construction. In 2015, INPEX (Japan) joined the consortium by acquiring a part of MEDCO's project interest.</p><h4>How environmentally friendly is geothermal energy?</h4><p>We do not waste too much energy and with IGCC technology we return almost 100% of the energy that we extract from 2-3km underground except for a small percentage of non-condensable gas. We do not need to let the steam vaporize from a cooling tower as we adopt an air cooling system and we can circulate the steam condensate in a closed cycle. After extracting energy for electricity, we re-inject the steam and brine coming out at a temperature of 200-300 degrees Celsius back into the ground at around 100 degrees Celsius. In the long run, we inject still relatively hot water that will be reheated by geothermal energy, which can then be recycled, making it literally 'renewable' energy. The geothermal technology is not that sophisticated; however, the potential areas are limited to volcanic regions and not so widely spread all over the world. The geothermal power industry is not as large as those for other types of power generation like thermal and hydro because a number of opportunities are relatively smaller.  In many cases, potential areas are located in the middle of volcanic mountains and those are the areas of deep forests, national park or where endangered species may live. So, there needs to be always a fine balance between preserving the neighboring environment and constructing geothermal power plants. Therefore, it is not that easy to rapidly develop geothermal power plants, especially in countries like Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines.</p><h4>What can the government do to further support the geothermal industry in Indonesia?</h4><p>The ministries in charge of energy and environment need to further clarify and streamline the procedures and licenses to allow part of the forest to be developed. The tariff needs to be reasonable and provide not only affordable energy prices for consumers but also a reasonably attractive returns for investors. It took us 10 years to execute the project, though it was an exception since we had to renegotiate old contracts that did not match the project financing scheme. In general, it takes time to drill and find resources to ensure they will be there for 20-30 years before we build a power plant. Building a power station takes two to three years at least but a company has to allow for a longer period for investigation, planning, drilling and financing arrangement. This takes another three to four years and thus, even without unique contractual issues such as Sarulla, it may take five to seven years. Now, after our example, there are several new projects that are being developed on a project finance basis following the success of Sarulla.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities of investing in Indonesia?</h4><p>For geothermal development, the challenge is that in this country there is not much reliable subsurface data. The government has not invested enough to find resources by itself and has been relying on private investors to do so. This is because the start of geothermal development in this country was closely linked to oil and gas development and Indonesia was then developing geothermal concessions under PERTAMINA, a state-owned oil and gas company. In other countries such as the Philippines, the government itself is deeply engaged up to a certain stage of exploitation activities to ensure that there are resources and then tender the rest of the process. However, in Indonesia, private companies are expected to do everything. The regulations have become more reasonable than those in the past and there are some successful examples, including Sarulla, with many keen investors and interests from banks. However, the basic scheme has not changed much, which is one of the remaining challenges.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year?</h4><p>By May 2018, I hope to have the Unit 3 completed and toward the end of 2018 we will conduct a preliminary feasibility study for the expansion of Sarulla project for around 200 to 300MW (Sarulla II). By the end of 2018, I hope we will be able to start discussions with our partner, Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) regarding the potential, size, tariff, and development schedule.  Then, I hope that PGE and SOL can start negotiations with PLN for Sarulla II.  The development may take some time but if we start discussing around the end of 2018, I expect the first unit of Sarulla II to be built and generating electricity by around 2024 or 2025. Sarulla geothermal working area is large and the potential is massive; therefore, we should not stop at only 330MW.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Postobón evolved since its establishment and what has been its role in the development of the country?</h4><p>2018 will be our 114th anniversary and we continue to be one of the most successful private companies in Colombia. It is clear in our strategy that in order to achieve growth, we have to support the growth of the country, including that of the population. As a result, our business knowledge base is nationwide and we have an intensive footprint both in manufacturing and distribution. Postobón made a decision to change and expand its portfolio, and have thus been working on a multi-category concept that covers above and beyond what we have done in the last 114 years. That is the reason why we are investing in beer market and have signed a JV with a Chilean group, CCU, to invest in Colombia. We are now taking a step forward to penetrate the beer industry, which is a great opportunity for us. We are also trying to understand the kinds of opportunities we can tackle based on our knowledge of logistics and distribution and our capacity to build brands and categories.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the main initiatives the company is taking to reposition itself?</h4><p>We understand the market trends. Innovation is a must be for us. Everyday work in I&amp;D to reconfigure our beverages. Our portfolio is truly varied and we really do not depend at all on just CSDs. 50% of portfolio sales are low-calorie or zero-calorie products. 30% of our portfolio consist of zero-calorie products and any products that grow the most are not related with carbonated soft drinks (CSD). Obesity in Colombia has many different reasons; however, the per capita consumption of CSDs in Colombia is low compared to other countries and blaming CSDs for obesity is unjust. We have conducted studies by independent and esteemed consulting companies that have shown sugar from CSDs is less than 2.5% of the total sugar intake of Colombians on a daily basis. We are confident that regardless of the regulations—which we welcome because it is necessary—we are in a great shape.</p><h4>In 2016 Postobón registered 14% growth. What is the strategy behind this growth?</h4><p>The strategy is simple: we work every day to conquer the hearts of Colombian consumers. It is our inspiration for the company. The reason why we have had double-digit growth in the last few years is because we have a great variety of portfolio, especially in terms of options, so we are able to understand all the segments, from value to premium. We have all types of products for all types of consumers in every category. We never increase prices and work hard to design great products for every segment of the population.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be a challenge for Colombia because we are in the middle of a political situation that is extremely complex. The government is working hard to settle the peace process and there is a great deal of confusion around that. Therefore, 2018 will not going to be an easy year in terms of consumption, though we are optimistic that we will keep the peace process in great shape and that there will be healthy growth for us.</p><h4>Do you plan to establish new partnerships or expand into different markets?</h4><p>Postobón is a local company and most of our income comes from our sales in Colombia. We have been working to understand opportunities abroad into the natural market for us, namely within the region, and not Europe. However, there is a market that demands our products and this is the reason why we have agreements with European distributors. Our focus is more on trying to capitalize on opportunities within Central America and neighboring countries in South America.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your goals for making the company more sustainable?</h4><p>In terms of sustainability, the economic portion is fundamental, though we also have social programs with the community. The environmental sector is fundamental to us because we are sell and put packages into the industry every single second of the day. We have a large truck distribution system and a great focus on packaging and transportation to reduce our carbon footprint. In packaging we use different elements such as glass, plastics, Tetra Pak, and so on and have a solid program to use recycled content in every single package or bottle that we use every day. Today, our bender of glass can guarantee that at least 40% of every glass bottle that we use is recyclable. We continue to make investments with our PET suppliers to continue to increase the percentage of recyclable material in every bottle. Today 50% of each CAD bottle is made of recyclable material, and Tetra Pak is doing the same. With Tetra Pak, we use different alternatives to recycle and produce, for example, furniture for schools and so on, especially because we have an aggressive agenda for 2024 in terms of our environmental reduction without carbon footprint. On the transportation and distribution side, we have many trucks on the streets and we want to continue to take steps forward to reduce our carbon emissions. We already have low consumption fuel trucks and electric vehicles and will continue to add more electric ecofriendly transportation systems.</p><h4>What is the main benefit of doing business in Colombia?</h4><p>We struggle every day to make institutions more solid. It is a great country with close to 50 million people and the middle class will continue to grow. About 30-40 years ago Colombia was poor, with small provinces across the country. Today, the country is making great progress. Progress could be faster though we are optimistic that Colombia will be great, which is why we continue to invest and believe in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[10 years in operation in Qatar]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rami-rishmani-deputy-general-manager-globemed-qatar]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Qatar a pillar in GlobeMed's activities across the Middle East and Africa?</h4><p>GlobeMed was among the first TPAs to operate in the region. We started operations in Lebanon early in 1991; since the beginning, we set bold expansion plans targeting first the GCC region, and eying Qatar in particular. We saw huge potentials for growth in the Qatari health insurance sector particularly that Qatar's healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East, and the country has an excellent and well-developed healthcare infrastructure. Furthermore, Qatar has become a hub for major businesses and operations in the Middle East, therefore it was essential for us to be part of the Qatari health insurance market. Consequently, in 2007 GlobeMed Qatar was established and obtained its TPA license from the Qatar Financial Centre Authority. We started off small, but now GlobeMed is proudly serving a large portfolio of insured members.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the introduction of the Third Party Administrator (TPA) model to the Middle Eastern market?</h4><p>As health insurance sector started growing in the Middle Eastern market, there was a need for a strong and robust entity to support this growth. Hence, the introduction of the TPA was inevitable. As I mentioned earlier, we were pioneers, being the first TPA in the Middle East back in 1991 when this concept was still new to the market. At that time, most of the functions that a TPA does were being handled by the insurance companies themselves. However, with the changing dynamics in a highly competitive market, there was a strong need for a TPA which serves as efficient back-office assisting healthcare payers in providing quality service and allowing them to redirect their focus to the revenue driven processes instead of handling the cost center functions. As a TPA, GlobeMed's role evolved from the traditional claims processing to managing healthcare benefits. Our solutions provide healthcare payers with the necessary balance between cost containment and quality of service; this is what made us stand out from other TPAs in the market. Automation is at the core of our work; and today we have managed to automate 80% of approvals, thus the patient has faster access to the required medical service while the potential for human error is significantly decreased. Supported by our ARC (Actionable Rules Control) rules engine, our solution enhances the claims processing accuracy, and helps accelerate payments to healthcare providers and members. Furthermore, when it comes to healthcare, wellness is the top trend these days and at GlobeMed, we now put more emphasis on wellness care thus moving from sick care to more well care. Accordingly, individuals can achieve a better quality of life through healthy lifestyles based on informed choices and healthcare payers will be able to better manage the increasing cost of healthcare.</p><h4>How does GlobeMed Qatar plan to capitalize on the opportunities the new health insurance scheme will open up for the insurance market?</h4><p>Our portfolio of private health insurance companies has been growing steadily ever since we got our license to operate in Qatar by the Qatar Financial Centre Authority in 2007, and which currently consists of around 100,000 insured members which is considerable for a relatively small market. After the government has decided to shift the previous national health insurance scheme for Qataris to the private sector, we are yet to hear any official news about the business model and the anticipated dates. Nevertheless, and after our experience in Qatar for the last 10 years, we are currently ready to cater for such a large size of insured population at both technical/system readiness side as well as the know-how and expertise side. From the technical point of view, our system is highly scalable thus capable of handling great amounts of load efficiently. It is optimized to deliver high performance while accommodating a growing insurance portfolio.</p><h4>How do you assess the value of your pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) solutions to improve the pharmacy's benefits plans?</h4><p>The PBM is one of the valuable tools that GlobeMed offers and it has become a must now in the medical insurance sector. Our PBM is a state-of-the-art pre-authorization &amp; adjudication platform with advanced clinical programs including generic substitutions, step therapy, chronic medications management, and other programs to control costs for both acute and chronic prescriptions and to ensure high quality of care. The solution helps healthcare payers to manage and analyze costs and utilization for their prescription benefits program. At the heart of the solution, lies a set of pre-designed rules, ARC, which checks new and refill prescriptions for indications and contraindications, alerts for therapy duplication, medication overuse, and various forms of drug interactions. ARC rules are based on algorithms with a dedicated committee of pharmacists working on updating them continuously.</p><h4>How do you assess the potential of the takaful insurance segment in Qatar?</h4><p>Takaful insurance has been growing exponentially for the past couple of years and there is still room for further growth. This is particularly the case of Qatar, because there are many employers that consider themselves takaful entities even if these are not financial institutions. At the end of the day, these companies will require insurance coverage. The central bank has been drawing some guidelines to create a framework for these companies. Now, conventional insurance companies, which want to sell takaful policies, have to get a specific license and set up a separate entity. GlobeMed Qatar is servicing both conventional and takaful companies. Despite that we have grown our portfolio exponentially during our 10 years of operations in Qatar, where insurance penetration is still on the low side, there is obviously room for further growth and greater penetration in the market, specifically in the medical insurance segment. I would say that lack of awareness is one of the factors leading the slow penetration in this market, and this is why GlobeMed Qatar is constantly trying to find ways in collaboration with its client insurance companies as well as with various stakeholders to increase awareness on the health insurance need in Qatar.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>The economic forecast in the region and in particular in Qatar has been unfavorable and challenging since 2016. We have witnessed the impact of this in the insurance market. Despite the challenges, we were able to sustain our steady growth and we expect this to continue. By the fourth quarter of 2017, we anticipate to see some positive indicators in the Qatari market. GlobeMed Qatar is doing well and we expect this performance to continue during 2017. This is a year of preparation as we anticipate a lot of growth coming up and we want to make sure we are ready to provide the best services possible to our clients and to the population of Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[62% of Bogotá GDP generated by service industry]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[juan-gabriel-perez-executive-director-invest-in-bogota]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the evolution of the business environment in Bogotá over the past year? </h4><p>Bogotá maintains an excellent business environment. Our agency has been named for the third consecutive year one of the best investment agencies in Latin America and the Caribbean, which is already a sign of this excellent business environment. Bogotá is in the Latin American ranking as the fifth (Miami is ranked first) most attractive economy to do business, according to America Economia. Bogotá is an attractive city to invest, although there is a small economic slowdown, and the Colombian economy is still one of the fastest growing in Latin America. Bogotá continues to be a city with one of the highest economic growth rates in Latin America. We are reaching a turning point and believe that 2018 will be better since the peace negotiations in Colombia will begin to bear the fruits of economic growth and stability. The company has also been awarded Best Project in Latin America and the Caribbean region at the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) in Dubai.</p><h4>Which sectors are currently the most attractive for investors?</h4><p>Sectors such as medical devices, consumer products, pharmaceuticals, software &amp; IT, and building materials are still protagonists of the investment, but perhaps it is worth mentioning the service sector. Approximately 62% of Bogotá's GDP is generated by the service industry. Right now, we are promoting a sector that has to do with the creative industries, which is already giving its first results. Incursion in this sector is a great bet, and we have already had achievements; for example, HBO has already entered Colombia to carry out cinematographic and television production work. In addition to others that have already entered the market in Bogotá, such as FOX and some Spanish companies. We have also incorporated the health services sector; a large Chilean company has entered the market here in Bogotá. It offers telemedicine services. We are optimistic for the development of infrastructure projects for the city to continue improving our competitiveness such as the Bogotá Metro, improvements to Bogotá airport, a wastewater treatment plant, airport-city tram, public hospitals, cycle paths, public parks, and more. For all these projects, foreign investment is also contemplated given that they are public-private partnerships (PPPs).</p><h4>How has your Strategic Plan 2017-2020 evolved since we spoke last year?</h4><p>From our beginnings, we have supported more than 290 FDI projects in our city, and more than 32,000 jobs have been generated thanks by these new companies. In 2018, we expect to get 40 new projects including new interesting sectors as, creative industries, infrastructure for city projects, biotechnology, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, professional services, construction materials, and processed food sector.</p><h4>What is the main challenge for a company that wants to invest in Bogotá?</h4><p>The most difficult thing for companies is to first identify business opportunities, and it is there where we help as well. There are few companies that do not invest in Bogotá after our advice. Most companies continue the investment process and less than 5% end up not investing; that is the statistic we have maintained over the last 11 years. The subsequent challenge is to grow in the national and international market, that is, to use Bogotá as an export platform, and our challenge is always to look for companies that generate the greatest added value to the city and that generate more and higher quality jobs and finally, that take advantage of the export platform offered by the city. These are our three main challenges to attract investment. We are proactive, we go out looking for companies, and we do not wait for companies to come looking for us. We do more than 30 promotion campaigns and attraction of investments in Bogotá, of which more than 20 are abroad.</p><h4>Bogotá is estimated to grow above the expected 2-2.5% national growth in the coming years. What are your prospects in this regard? </h4><p>We have a strategy that has several components; the first thing is to bring new investors to the city. Generate impact projects in the sectors where we are interested, and that, I insist, include added value, quality employment, innovation and that such projects use Bogotá as an export platform. This strategy also includes attracting anchor companies that is, bringing companies that attract other companies based on the principle of productive chain. We also identify the companies that have already invested in Bogotá, and that want to re-invest, which are currently around 1,600 companies. We have two new challenges for 2018, one of them has to do with capital funds to facilitate technological investments, and the other is how to generate growth opportunities for foreign companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The need for construction at that time was immense. We started with designing specific industrial buildings and structures that were critical to the country, such as silos, cement factories, chimneys, and the cooling towers of power plants. These buildings used to be built by foreign companies, but as the war broke out just after the Islamic Revolution, there was no time to obtain the knowledge from these companies. Marine structures were also among our early focuses, due to the 5,800km of coastline that Iran has. We sent five engineers to the Netherlands to study marine structures, and two years later we became operative in this sector. As Iran's oil and gas fields are located near the sea, there was a logical synergy, so we increased the scope of our work to oil and gas operations. When working for big projects there is a need for technical investigation about land before engineering, so we moved into geotechnical projects. We then increased our knowledge about flood control systems and established our water and environment division. Our entering of new fields of expertise has been natural, by following the needs of our clients. Within the projects in which we are involved, our abilities are not limited to just one process. We can deliver from A to Z in marine and oil and gas projects.</p><h4>How important is the oil and gas sector for Sazeh Pardazi?</h4><p>The Iranian economy depends on oil and gas. The cost of producing one barrel of oil in Iran is USD15, which is relatively low. Still, we need an oil price of around USD50 per barrel in order for the government to start to fund new infrastructural and oil and gas projects. Below this price, the priority will be to finish uncompleted projects, but for these projects the consultancy firms have already been hired. In the past year we have unfortunately not seen an increase of new tenders, so all contractors are hoping for a better market environment. The solution lies in investments in the oil and gas industry, but so far the interest in Iranian petroleum contracts (IPCs) has been disappointing, partly because of the uncertainties about the future of relations between Iran and the US. Yet, there are positive signs. During the sanctions period Iran only exported 700,000bpd, and at the moment we are exporting over 2 million bpd. We can feel the economic growth that this generates, although it does not yet meet our expectations. Our energy industry was on hold for 10 years, while our competitors continued, and we have to get market share back. Even though the sector suffers from insufficient funds, it is, for Sazeh Pardazi, still the sector with the most potential for growth. The Port &amp; Maritime Organization, which is the government organization responsible for the construction and operation of ports, stopped the funding of all projects two years ago for financial reasons. It is in need of investments and because there are still problems with bank transactions, we cannot provide sovereign guarantees from our central bank to them.</p><h4>Drought in Iran has increased the need for smart water management solutions. How can Sazeh Pardazi play a part in addressing this and other environmental issues?</h4><p>Sazeh Pardazi was the first Iranian consultant in river engineering and flood protection control systems. Climate change creates a big water crisis in Iran. We have projects to construct dams and transfer water from wet to dry areas. Environmental and water projects are not considered as important as electricity or oil and gas projects. The clients responsible for maintaining water structures do not have money. Again, investments are critical here. In oil and gas the investment proposition is clear. You can invest in a refinery and get a return on investment by selling the gasoline or methanol you produce. For water projects the return on investment is not as evident. Sazeh Pardazi still has many projects in water because we are well known in this field. At the moment the government is focused on border rivers because these are critical. If neighboring countries construct dams on common rivers, the portion of water in Iran decreases. After implementing policies on border rivers, we can go toward the mainland of the country.</p><h4>How can your company enhance its presence in foreign markets?</h4><p>We established our company in Iraq and Oman because they are neighboring countries. Our engineering technology is acceptable there and the traveling costs are low. In Iraq we stopped our activities again because of the crisis. In Oman we want to proceed, but the market is difficult because of the long presence of well-known foreign companies that have their own office and employees. These companies often work with Indian engineers who are relatively cheap, and it is difficult for us to compete with them. We are trying to get port and oil and gas projects in Oman and closed a partnership with a well-known local partner for two geotechnical projects. One is in Salalah and the other in Muscat.</p><h4>Are you looking to establish new partnerships with foreign companies?</h4><p>We were active in the design of the Chabahar Port together with Royal HaskoningDHV and are still in touch with them. Sazeh Pardazi is also registered in Oman, where we work together on a gas pipeline between Oman and Iran with Fugro, an offshore geotechnical contractor. Foreign consultancy firms are also interested in partnerships. Based on Iran's regulations, overseas companies that want to work here should have a local partner that has over 50% of the local contract.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>We expect to see some improvements in the following year, especially in foreign markets. This is why we are keen to move into overseas projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-abdullah-al-alshaikh-ceo-advanced-water-technology-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Al Khafji Solar Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) project proceeding?</h4><p>Al Khafji started commissioning about three months ago and we have started producing. We have the capability to produce the whole quantity of 60,000 m3/day. We are operating at almost half our capacity now. There has been a slight change in the policy since we started this project. Previously, we thought we could produce all the power within the same zone, adjacent to the plant. However, we found out it would be more economical and viable to have about 10-15MW of PV power sourced nearby, and the remaining power from elsewhere using the grid system that is already there. But, the idea is that whatever power we need to produce water from this plant will be produced by a renewable method, namely solar. This is why we call it a zero-carbon emission plant.</p><h4>How has AWT's role developed in this project from engineering and design to project management to Developer?</h4><p>The Al Khafji project has gone through several stages for us. In the beginning, AWT was mostly doing project management. About a year later, in mid-2016, we were faced with some difficulties with the EPC contractor, so we stepped in and did all the work ourselves. This means we now have good hands-on experience of how to build a plant like this. We are proud that this plant implements the latest technology in terms of energy consumption. The energy consumption is 3.8KW per hour to produce one cubic meter of desalinated water. That rate is one of the lowest in the world. Most plants are above 4KW per hour to produce 1m3 of desalinated water. This illustrates how efficient our plant is and we use many techniques to achieve this result. Also, we are applying intermittent dosing techniques with the chemicals that results in drastically reduced consumption compared to conventional chemical treatment techniques.</p><h4>How has innovation been taking place under AWT's R&amp;D and technology transfer partnerships with global leaders to create the low emission and low energy consumption solutions you have created here?</h4><p>The starting point is under the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Initiative for Desalination Powered by Renewable Energy, in this case using solar energy. This initiative was started about five years ago and there are four stages involved in it. The first was building the Al Khafji plant, which had an initial intended capacity of 30,000m3/day of desalinated water that was doubled to a capacity of 60,000m3/day when we realized the level of demand. Given the success of this project there may be a chance to go on to stage two where we build a much bigger plant on the Red Sea of 300,000m3/day. Then we can replicate the 300,000m3/day plant in a different location as a stage three. Further, if we can drastically drive down the price of water production through the use of renewable energy we may be able to think about applying this to agriculture, as it would become economically feasible. This would be stage four. Currently we are talking about an operational price below SAR2.00 (USD0.50) per cubic meter of water produced, which is currently low for this size of plant. But we see that through the use of renewable energy and advanced desalination technology it will be possible to keep pushing down the price.</p><h4>How does AWT assess water management and wastewater treatment opportunities, and what are your strategies going forward?</h4><p>A decision was made by the government two years ago to make the private sector more involved in producing water and electricity and now we are seeing the results of this. All the big plans that have recently been announced by the government will use the build-operate-own (BOO) model. This means having independent producers with the government guaranteeing to buy the water. For the government this will remove the big burden that comes with financing such a huge project. The government will pay for the water, but not the construction. Of course the developer will also gain something over a long period, as these concessions will typically be for up to 25 years. This model is practical and used worldwide.</p><h4>Does AWT have ambitions to be an operator or equity owner of some desalination plants?</h4><p>We have a lot of ambitious ideas and projects for the near future. We have already joined a consortium as a developer with three big players and are bidding for a 600,000m3/day desalination plant that is planned. Furthermore, we are looking at another two projects, so the opportunities are huge now that we have proven our ability to manage and develop such a plant. AWT's role in the future will continue as a developer and equity owner, operator and technology provider, not as an EPC contractor, carving out a niche in sustainability. We are also looking at using solar to go into downstream. We are trying to bid for some downstream projects for sewage treatment plants that have been announced by WEC (Water &amp; Electricity Co.). We would be involved both as developer and operator.</p><h4>Aside from solar-power, what other technological innovations have you applied to operate in a sustainable way?</h4><p>State-of-the-art technology today can be labeled green because of the focus on energy efficient components in new plants that are at such a state of advancement compared to even five years ago. The definitions of conventional and green are changing. Green is embedded in current state-of-the-art “conventional plants.“ It does not necessarily have to be solar powered. Green efficiencies run through the whole process, for example with the chemical dosing and energy recovery systems. In order to be truly sustainable in water supply, we have to utilize a source that is sustainable in of itself, like seawater as opposed to ground water. Secondly, we have to use something that does not pollute the environment, either through energy supply, the use of chemicals, or the discharge. Thirdly, we have to continue to innovate in the processes of water production. The process of desalination is not that old. It only started at a scalable level about 40 years ago and at that time the cost was extremely high, but even so, desalination was a must for a region like the Arabian Gulf and Saudi Arabia. Now, as the cost has fallen, desalination is used in many places around the world. The world's rising water demand is really forcing us to accelerate innovation in desalination and to develop sustainable desalination techniques, and AWT intends to be in the forefront of this movement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Huawei's main projects in the country and what impact does it have on the ICT sector?</h4><p>Three years ago, we entered the government and enterprise space, whereas before we were focused on the carrier space. We launched the first 4G LTE network in Nigeria with three major operators in 2016 and now we operate almost 60% of the market in partnership with them. In the last few years, we have launched a number of products in the ICT domain. The first was the Business Enabling System (BES) system, which changed the telecom business. Our BES projects provide real-time experience for clients. The younger generation wants things on demand and we seek to provide this. We offer clients a fully online experience that is completely reshaped. This is the first project of its kind for Huawei overseas. We still lack some fundamental infrastructure in Nigeria, though in the next few years we will play a major role in upgrading the network for Nigerian subscribers. On the enterprise and government side, we are focused on security. We want to help develop smart city solutions. We have helped to create an emergency command center for the government and now want to help reduce crime and make emergency services more efficient. We are building the national broadband backbone for the government and have completed the first stage of the plan that will link most ministries departments and agencies (MDAS). We are also doing something similar to Amazon; in the future, we want to be the Amazon of telecom, whereby all e-government services are based on our infrastructure. There is a great requirement for data storage, and we see this as a great opportunity. National broadband will be extremely important, and we will provide services via the cloud. Mobile money will also be important and Huawei is working on a number of mobile money projects in Nigeria. The user behavior of our latest generation has changed rapidly, and they are ready for such technology. Bank card penetration is low, and we want to bank people by allowing them to use this new technology. In Nigeria, there are still major coverage issues; more than 40 million people do not have access, and we are working to correct this.</p><h4>As a foreign investor, how is your relationship with the Nigerian government?</h4><p>Our role in the ICT domain is extremely important. We offer great value to the country and believe the digital economy can add 10% to the GDP. Our role is be a consultant to the government. Doing business in any country including Nigeria without support from the government would be extremely difficult. We are close to regulators and are always keen to influence policy in a way that promotes innovation and development in the ICT space. We want to be close enough to maximize communication. There is a perfect position to be in, and we want to find that place.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>We want to see large-scale government support for the entire ICT sector. Foreign investors are afraid of the uncertainty that we sometimes have to contend with. Currency fluctuations have been particularly impactful, and we want to see an improvement in this area. If the Central Bank increases liquidity, that would be better for us. Stabilizing the currency is directly related to the health of foreign businesses. With a stable currency, Nigeria is still the most attractive place for foreign investors.</p><h4>How important is Nigeria within Huawei's global portfolio in 2019?</h4><p>Though Nigeria was recently hit by a recession, there is still huge potential in the country. It has a large and extremely young population. GDP is huge as well, which means Nigeria will remain Huawei's most important market in Africa. The government and enterprise area represents great potential. If the oil price remains stable, then business in Nigeria will remain strong. We expect it to remain the number-one global market for enterprise business. Huawei is not as interested in consumer goods in Africa after the devaluation of the currency; our consumer models are too expensive for this market. Starting from 2018, however, we will review our structure and work to reduce costs to enter these markets. For example, we will soon launch a special phone for the African market that is redesigned and more affordable.</p><h4>What role can Huawei play in the future development of ICT in the country?</h4><p>We have launched a Global Connectivity Index (GCI) and Nigeria is in the initial stage of development, which we are working to improve. We see our role as building a healthy ecosystem for the entire ICT sector. We want to develop a platform that can support innovation and development across the board. This will create more diversity and growth in the sector. The industry will need more investment, and we can bring the key stakeholders together to transform the space. We need a strong ecosystem that includes strong participation from the government and regulators. We always apply the latest technology to emerging markets, and are excited about the opportunity to do this in Nigeria. We have to use the latest technology to convince the government and our clients to invest in value. This is how we will drive the technical evolution to the next level. We are optimistic about guaranteeing this in Nigeria. We have also been working closely with the Central Bank. We want to make digital baking and wallet services easier to implement across the country. We will also see more over the top (OTT) companies entering the market. Large technology companies are keen to develop the African market, and we hope to see a way of operating that is more diverse and enriching. We view these developments as opportunities and can embrace our ecosystem and platform strategies.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>This will be an exciting year. A year ago, in early 2017, my answer would have been extremely negative. We made preparations for the worst possible scenarios; however, over the course of 2017 we saw great developments. The economy has become vibrant, and oil prices have been rising. Additionally, oil production is more stable and the industry is more secure. Security measures have been effective and have given international investors a great deal of confidence. Furthermore, the government has improved the standards of living for people all across the country. If the oil price and production level remain stable in combination with broader developments in the economy, then Nigeria will be in an excellent position moving forward. 2018 will be an excellent year for Nigeria and Huawei in Nigeria. We are increasing our presence in the country and expect to invest even more in the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[timur-suleimenov-minister-national-economy-kazakhstan]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Kazakhstan stand today in terms of how 2017 progressed and which macroeconomic factors have contributed to this positive outlook?</h4><p>We have seen growth of 4% in the first 10 months of 2017, which is excellent and is in line with our positive scenario. The contributing factors include the rise in oil prices. Whether we like it or not, we have to acknowledge that the oil price plays a significant role in our economy. The improved price for oil and commodities in general was a gain, as was the increased production from the Kashagan oil field. In mining we see huge additional excavation works going on, likely directly attributable to the increased commodity prices. Oil and gas and mining together are growing at about 8-10%. In addition, we are also seeing a significantly big increase in manufacturing, which has grown over 7%. The pharmaceuticals industry is in fact a champion of the economy and is growing at about 37%. Another great contributor of Kazakhstan's GDP growth is trade. External trade has picked up tremendously, growing by about 35%, and we see our trade balance improving greatly from 2016. There has also been an increase in investment, with a relatively stable growth of about 5%. We are tracking not only investment overall, but also those in the private sector, and the economy is growing not only on the back of state-run and sponsored programs. Private investment is also boosting the overall performance of the economy. FDI is a great contributor as well, and total FDI stood at about USD12 billion for six months.</p><h4>The Ministry of the National Economy's Strategy 2025 targets GDP growth of no less than 4.5% within eight years. What are the main drivers and keys to achieving this goal?</h4><p>We want the private sector to play a more active role in the economy than it is currently. Privatization will undeniably improve the quality and volume of growth. Hopefully by 2025 we will have fully privatized to the level that we want to, including KazMunayGas (KMG) and other Samruk Kazyna assets, and we will not have any non-core assets at the regional and municipal levels. Another driver is moving from a centralized economy, where all the decisions are made in Astana, to a more decentralized model. We would like to give our regions more economic freedom and, with that, the means of achieving their goals. We do have some local taxes, though in our budgetary system currently only four regions are donors to the republican budget—Atyrau, Almaty, Mangystau, and Astana. We have to funnel large amounts of money back into all the other regions and we would like to change this. The way to do it is to give them greater taxation authorities, though we have yet to finalize the mechanisms we will use for this. This change will not only provide additional tax revenues and mechanisms for the local authorities, but also incentivize them to work closely with taxpayers and investors. We also want to focus more on exports; we cannot run our economy and sustain economic growth based solely on the consumption model we previously relied on with the influx of big oil money and consumer spending. While exports will play a large part, we want to add another component to this with non-natural resources exports.</p><h4>What opportunities will reforms to the PPP laws bring in the long run for private-sector involvement in the economy?</h4><p>Many countries have been trying to implement and harness PPPs. It is tough, especially for countries with a Soviet background where everything has to be controlled and repeatedly checked for accountability. We thus have to change the mentality and the law, and the way we operate our models is new as well. It is tough and somewhat subjective to define a fair return for private sector investors; it is not written in the budget code or government resolution. It depends on negotiations or otherwise the investor will walk away. This is holding back significant PPP implementation in Kazakhstan. Hopefully potential investors will see our dedication toward reform as a positive sign. We see a large increase in PPPs on a local and regional level, for example for kindergartens and small sports centers and waste management plants. We are introducing many changes to our budget code and laws on PPPs; for example, we have cut back on the time and procedures required and introduced a more efficient sharing of risk. We have also shared our responsibility with the regions; obligations up to about USD20 million can be taken at the local level.</p><h4>Overall, what can we expect from the Kazakhstani economy in 2018?</h4><p>We will grow from a higher base in 2018 compared to the 1.1% we had in 2016. Therefore YoY growth will be more difficult in 2018 because we will have to expand more in absolute terms than we did in 2017. Hopefully, inflation will be lower and real GDP growth will help in that way. Growth of 3.5% or perhaps 4% is manageable for 2018. In terms of emerging sectors, I have been positive about our financial sector for a while now. Our program to assist banks to become more solvent and ready to lend is on the way and with any luck the financial sector will be much more active. Everything else should be business as usual. Certain key assets will be privatized, which is great for investors. In addition, it will create better governance, transparency, and management of those companies according to international standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Mexico wants 50% clean energy by 2050]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[guillermo-garcia-alcocer-chairman-energy-regulatory-commission]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The flow of investment into the energy sector has been significant. To what extent is this due to a stable regulatory framework?</h4><p>The Energy Reform has been able to promote investments in Mexico. There is trust in the system and trust in the way the regulation and the laws were written. A way of measuring that trust is in the investments that have been drawn to Mexico. Currently, we have USD83 billion of investment in place, most of it in the upstream arena, although, in the future, there is great potential for other parts of the value chain. We have identified more than 130 companies from 19 countries, out of which 51 are Mexican, that had never been here in the past. We are in the business of getting the market to trust the system and that has been extremely successful in terms of showing to potential investors that the regulation was built in a collaborative manner, we listened to the industry's concerns, and we are not afraid of making adjustments to the regulations. We are afraid of setting regulations that are incorrect, do not set a level playing field, and do not set the right conditions for investors to come and be comfortable with projects. We have an open relationship with companies and there are rules of contact that are similar to the US Sunshine Act. This is a great example of what transparency and good contact rules can do for an industry.</p><h4>How would you assess the impact of the liberalization of these markets for final consumers?</h4><p>What we have gained from this process is something that we have in all the other markets in Mexico: competition. There was only one gasoline service provider. By now, we have over 27 brands and are adding one each week or every two weeks. For example, we have BP, Chevron, Shell, Gulf, Glencore in partnership with Group 500, and Costco opening service stations. We have Arco, for instance, which used to be Tesoro, a large refiner from the US. We have all of these brands and most of them are including additives that make the product different from what PEMEX offered traditionally. Nevertheless, PEMEX is the wholesale seller at the present for all these brands. Competition will become a reality in the wholesale market coming into the country by the coasts and the border. In the center, some things are happening due to the railroads that right now have permits from CRE. Things are moving from the center by trains, from the coasts by boats, and from the border by pipeline as well as trucks.</p><h4>What are the main obstacles left to be able to meet the 2050 goal of 50% of clean energies?</h4><p>We have a great deal of opportunities. The decision of some countries to move away from green energy provides Mexico an opportunity to be the leader here. We are being realistic and the country has a great deal to offer. Most of our country has the solar potential; the areas where we have less potential for solar energy are equivalent to the solar potential in Spain and almost twice in Germany. If we took 1% of the territory of Sonora, which is a large state, and used that to build a solar facility, this would generate all the energy the country requires. It is flexible and that is why there are projects all over the country. Most of the 52 projects are solar. However, there is a complementary area in Mexico that is attractive for wind in Tamaulipas, Oaxaca, and Yucatán, and this is a way of decentralizing the energy. Wind projects are also successful in Mexico so that is also great news for the development of this country. It has been an interesting discussion in Mexico because when we started the reform there was a strong opposition from industry against green energy, not because it was bad but because it was expensive. They understood it was beneficial for the country, but it was also expensive and they were unsure if it would contribute to their competitiveness. However, soon there were many auctions conducted worldwide and suddenly it was clear that solar was not only inexpensive but cheap. There was a major change in technology and Mexico was one of the countries where the prices of solar energy dropped earlier. We are in a great shape to maintain the pace of projects.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the energy infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>We have identified areas in which there is congestion; the wind projects in Tamaulipas and Oaxaca have experienced congestion and the full potential for renewables cannot be reached unless we develop new infrastructure. That is why we are working on a superhighway, which we call the Oaxaca Transmission line that is a direct current system. We are also working to get a line into Baja California Sur for a transmission line that would connect the generation of solar to the consumers of Baja California. There is a new scheme for developing these projects that was recently announced in which the Ministry of Energy becomes the leader of the auction. The priority is to relieve the congestion in the system and continue to promote these projects that make renewables more attractive.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about clean energy certificates (CEL) and the role they play in supporting this market?</h4><p>This will start in 2018, and it will foster a free market and prices will be set by a counterpart. We need to know that suppliers have a certain percentage of the generation from renewable sources. The goal was set at 5% for 2018 and 5.8% for 2019. Therefore, 5.8% of the energy sold in the country through the market has to have a backup in the renewable energy generation. The system was designed in collaboration with USAID. Most of the renewables that we see currently that are in operation are from the law that was changed. We want them to migrate to the new system because the new renewables and the new generation that is in the market needs to have this backup. CEL will be a system in which suppliers will register and will have a certificate; we always have to know who the owner of the certificate is.</p><h4>Is Mexico sharing its know-how in renewable energies with the rest of the Latin American region?</h4><p>Mexico was chosen as the country where the World Forum on Energy Regulation will be held in 2018. Mexico has shown that in a few years a country can make a 180-degree change. This is an important forum, with more than 100 delegates from around the world attending. We will discuss on the empowerment of consumers; we are focused on empowering consumers through solar roofs and give them the freedom to choose the gas station that best suits them. To achieve that, we have the Gasoapp so they can compare prices and it can determine their location. We already have more than 57,000 users. Moreover, we will share our experience concerning how to be regulators that do the minimum regulation required and allow technological change.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mexico's strengths and weaknesses as a health tourism destination? </h4><p>Mexico has great potential as far as medical tourism is concerned for various reasons. First, we have access to the best diagnostic and surgical medical equipment infrastructure due to prevailing multilateral trade agreements.   There are hospitals that are equipped to the same standards as the best hospitals in developed countries, such as the US, Canada, and some European nations. Second, we have highly qualified medical personnel. For many years, Mexican public universities have had great medical, chemistry, and nursing faculties. Many Mexican doctors and nurses graduated from those universities are capable of providing high-quality medical services. Mexico exports a lot of talent to other countries and our challenge is to keep those professionals in Mexico. The third reason is our incomparable geographical location, neighboring the largest market for medical tourism (US and Canada). Although NAFTA is currently under review, it has substantially increased the exchange of goods and services between those markets and Mexico. We welcome medical tourists seeking cheaper and high quality medical services. Mexico has great hospital infrastructure in both public and private sectors. These hospitals are certified by the Mexican Health Council and by international entities such as the Joint Commission and the Canadian Accreditation Council, keeping up the highest standards of care.</p><h4>Private and public players both have a role to play in fostering Mexico as a destination for medical tourism. Who is taking a leadership role in this regard?</h4><p>We need coordination and a greater effort from our government to help connect relevant players in the medical tourism industry. The federal government is the only one capable of structuring the basis for growth in the industry and they have fallen short in this utmost important task. Many of the officers in charge of preparing public policies are not following the right path for they have no experience nor show any interest in the industry. They very unfortunately reach those positions for political reasons rather than genuinely pursuing benefits for the industry. The government should coordinate the different branches and implement a coherent policy for widely promoting medical tourism both for the private and public sector. As explained, Mexico should ignite its vast potential in the world medical tourism industry.</p><h4>What is Amerimed strategy to attract foreign patients?</h4><p>We began as a company that provided high-quality medical services for tourists who visited Mexico via cruise ships. We have had the main cruise ships as clients for many years: Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Princess and Holland America. We have grown over the past decade by establishing our high-resolution boutique hospitals in the main touristic destinations: Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta, Cozumel, and Cancún. Right now, we are building a brand new hospital in Playa del Carmen. In November 2014, we sold our facilities on the Pacific Coast to a Spanish hospital chain. We kept the ones that are located in the Riviera Maya. We specialize in intensive care but feature mostly all medical specialties, ranging from emergencies to kidney transplants. All of our hospitals are very well equipped with MRIs, CT Scans X-Rays, Cathlabs, laboratories, and pharmacies. Our staff is bilingual and take pride in keeping the highest standards in providing medical services. We aim to have a hospital in the main Mexican touristic destinations. About 35% of our patients are foreigners and represent more than half of our total revenue. We have an excellent relationship with most of the international insurers and are the hospital chain that receives the foreign patients in Mexico.</p><h4>How do you articulate your health offer with other players of the tourism industry?</h4><p>We enter into agreements with most of the hotel chains and international cruise lines. This is a strictly commercial relationship. We also welcome foreign investment in our business. This does not mean that we are exclusively focused on foreign patients; we have Mexican patients, but would like to cater more to the foreign market. We need to be present in the most frequently visited touristic destinations in Mexico. We are committed to providing high-quality medical services; hire the best doctors and have the best-equipped facilities in Mexico, even though we have small hospitals with less than 40 beds each. We have very ambitious growing plans for the next five years. Soon we will be entering a joint venture with a private equity fund to gear ourselves into the world medical touristic market. We take challenges and are committed to invest in Mexico.</p><h4>What was the reason behind entering the joint venture with a private equity fund?</h4><p>To grow and develop our marketing ideas. We know how to operate hospitals and have fun doing so. We believe we have a comparative advantage as far as investing in and operating hospitals is concerned. Our mid-term plans include opening new facilities in the pacific touristic destinations.</p><h4>To what extent do you use telemedicine in your offering?</h4><p>We have an agreement with several hospitals not only in Mexico, but in the US. Many of our doctors of various specialties do not have residency where the hospital is located, and many others are traveling and do consultations through telemedicine. We have used it over the years, and it is becoming more and more popular.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[100 million customers within 5 years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[charles-kie-managing-director-ecobank-nigeria-limited]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the digital transformation  helping Ecobank Nigeria achieve its target of reaching 40 million customers?</h4><p>The banking industry is fundamentally changing. In recent years, we have seen a trend related to the disruptive role of fintech companies in the industry. Banks are also now putting more emphasis on financial inclusion. It is clear that the only way that banks can scale up their activities is by ensuring that they have the easiest access to the largest population possible, through means of communication that are simple and inexpensive enough to be made available to the masses. This is all riding on the back of a platform that is reliant and secure enough to make them comfortable in dealing with banks. Nigeria in particular has the largest population on the continent; therefore, we need to use our vision to direct our efforts in becoming a key player in this market. We must ensure  we make easy financial services available to as many people as possible, hence the target that we set for ourselves. As a group that    goal is to achieve 100 million customers within the next five years. In Nigeria, we would like to achieve 40 million. Banking today is not just about having an account. It is about having access to financial services by all means, particularly mobile. It is clear to us that mobile is going to be a driving force in that respect.</p><h4>Is digitalization the bank's main focus today?</h4><p>Yes, and we have made that clear. It is not just about digitizing our customers. It is also about digitizing ourselves. It is important that the way we interact with our customers and optimize our businesses internally are linked, and communication between external and internal parties is flawless. We are not only looking at our own internal processes in order to automate and digitize as much as we can, but we are also making sure that our customers, for whom we want to be sure have access to the digital services we are providing, also use all of our digital channels—mobile, internet banking, QR code payments, and POS. All of this is now made available to facilitate communication with our customers.</p><h4>What is your view on the banking sector in Nigeria today?</h4><p>The fact of the matter is, given the recession the country has gone through, as well as the issues around the situation of the country in 2016 and part of 2017, the portfolios of banks in general have been impacted. NPLs have increased since 2015. That obviously requires attention. The second point is, because of the various rates we see in the market, it is important that some level of convergence takes place at some point between the unofficial and the official markets. When that happens for the banks, some steep adjustments will be required. This is something that we, as an industry, have to be mindful of and prepared for. The third point is that there have new accounting regulations coming into play. International Financial Reporting Standard 9 is one of those and could potentially have an impact on a few banks. That said, the steps that are taken today by the Central Bank of Nigeria and other stakeholders are to ensure that there is no systemic impact in terms of challenges or issues on the country as a whole. For us, that is something we are looking at closely. Effectively, some banks are making huge profits, and we have to ask how these profits are made. Part of such profits are made from the volatility in the FX rates and high level of government borrowing. The sustainability of that needs to be questioned. When I take all of the one-offs out, I look at this from a normalized perspective, I believe some form of adjustments will definitely take place.</p><h4>CBN Governor Emefiele told TBY that banks have a significant role to play in the recovery of the economy in Nigeria. What is your view on the statement, and what is Ecobank's contribution to the economy?</h4><p>When an economy is in recession, it is important that all stakeholders play the right role in terms of supporting those who create wealth, produce, and make goods available to the population. We now need to ask ourselves how to achieve this. It has to be a concerted effort from policymakers, companies, banks and the Central Bank as well. We all have to come together. If any stakeholder does not have the right approach or solution, it distorts the market and causes asymmetry. Where there is asymmetry, there is always arbitrage opportunity. At Ecobank, we are doing a lot in terms of financial inclusion, which is the first step. Inflation is about the cost of living. Anything that can reduce that cost is an important element to consider. When we make access to financial services easier for the largest amount of the population at the lowest cost possible, it is a major contribution. Our role is to ensure that the price points of the services that we provide to our customers are as low as possible. This is where technology and digitization come into play.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>If you had asked me the same question in 2016, I would have been less conclusive as the situation was blurry and we did not know what to expect. However, today we are recovering, inflation is going down, and reserves are rising. The country recently closed a large bond issue. It seems that macro indicators are now moving towards creating an environment that will support growth. The 2019 election is going to come with its own drivers when it comes to financing the economy. If investments are made to support population growth, it can only have a positive impact on the GDP. It is a function of consumption and investment. The environment has to be conducive for private as well as foreign investment to come in massively to support the much needed improvement in infrastucture. In 2017, we spent half of the year in recession and half of the year out of it. On an average basis, that is not great, but if the trend that has started continues, 2018 will be much better from a macroeconomic perspective. We are all optimistic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[timur-turlov-ceo-freedom-finance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind your decision to launch Freedom Finance in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We saw an opportunity to match our expertise with the growing interest in Kazakhstan in domestic and foreign financial markets and the desire of many of our clients to manage their wealth in part through market investments. Since we began doing business in Kazakhstan five years ago we have been the foremost player in this business sector. Most other players have in fact reduced their participation in financial investments in the brokerage industry. This positioned us and prepared us to take advantage of opportunities in Kazakhstan. <br>Also we saw the economic risks of the current situation and falling prices, as well as the sanctions in Russia. The primary reason why the brokerage industry collapsed in early 2010 in Kazakhstan was due to the reforming of the institutional investors here. Most brokers in the sector were focused on servicing institutional investors, private customers, pension funds, and banks, which were involved in the reselling of all their assets. Kazakhstan has not yet developed retail brokerage, and when most of the players realized that institutional business was declining, the Russian brokers in particular left Kazakhstan, along with most of the international players. The local players cut their expenses as much as possible to minimize losses. They effectively lost the ability to earn anything on the market. At that time, the total turnover of the stock exchange was small; it was just a few million dollars per month. Freedom Finance is not just a successful company in Kazakhstan or Russia, we think on a nationwide scale of the Central Asia region, where Kazakhstan (and Russia as well) is a staging area for active expansion into key economies of the region, succeeding among other things owing to mineral resources. We see how many well-to-do people of such countries as Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and other regions are increasingly thinking about how to save and increase their savings, but are limited in the choice of investment instruments. The growth of income, as well as the increase in financial awareness, along with the globalization of markets and the media industry, creates the demand for such instruments, and Freedom Finance is ready to provide freedom of choice of investment instruments in all promising markets of Central Asia. We see here a huge potential for further expansion and development of our business. It will be provided with both entering into new regions and growing involvement of the well-to-do segments of the population in investment activity.</p><h4>How have you been able to attract your clients to investment opportunities in global markets?</h4><p>One of the most efficient and profitable parts of our business is providing access to international markets, such as the US markets and stock exchange. Interest in international investments has been high, as people are interested in diversifying their investments and allocating their risks between the US securities markets and local opportunities. In fact, 2017 was the first year that we started to see renewed interest in the Kazakhstan domestic market. Because of the devaluation risks, most people prefer to keep money in dollars, though the rates are extremely low. People seeking a higher yield in dollars can have access to the US stock market, which has a great growth outlook. We have organized the participation of our customers to give them access to some of the best offerings over the past five years, including Twitter, Facebook, and Hilton. All these offerings are high-growth industries and we have found eager buyers in Kazakhstan. Our research and trading efforts have been rewarded with strong interest and support among our rapidly growing client base in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are your plans with regards to listing Freedom Finance on an NYSE exchange or other market?</h4><p>Pursuing a listing on the NYSE or NASDAQ is a natural step for us to take at the appropriate time in the near future. Currently, we are completing the consolidation of our international group of operating companies under the umbrella of Freedom Holding, Inc., which is traded in the US on the OTC Pink Market. We believe it is a great time to approach a listing in the US market given our track record and our current prospects. We expect to meet all of the listing requirements. At the same time we have a large portfolio of domestic assets that we believe are undervalued because, during the last economic downturn, there was significant capital outflow from the country and the lingering distrust of local markets among investors. Among our securities holdings we have a number of companies in market niches that are growing fast. We have participated actively in IPOs and organized three equity offerings after the privatization program was paused. We are pleased that Freedom Finance in Kazakhstan is becoming a leader in underwriting the securities of local firms. When the government starts privatizing large firms, we anticipate it will do it through the local stock market, and we believe we are a leading candidate to play a prominent role in such public placements. We are proud of the fact that we have 50,000 customers, none of whom had participated in the stock market previous to becoming clients of Freedom finance. There are many boutique firms that can sell securities to large private equity funds, but we are one of only a few firms that can sell individual company stocks to our customers. Not only do we have the largest customer base, but we also have the most responsive one; when we offer stock, people buy because of our reputation. A broad customer base is also important for the companies we underwrite, as it promotes integrity in the distribution process and aftermarket trading market liquidity while contributing to reduce price volatility.</p><h4>What sectors will foreign investors target in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We believe we can sell investment ideas to US investors. We hold a strong position from a strategic point of view in Kazakhstan in terms of our fast-growing local investment bank that we plan to have participate in every privatization program and upcoming offerings. We are becoming the largest player in bonds and equities and are already the largest underwriter for equities. When buying stock, people are exposing themselves to the Kazakhstan stock exchange, which is one of the actively growing markets in the world. In previous years it was in the top five markets because our stock exchange grew 53% YoY. Privatization will come, and when it does the index of the stock exchange will also grow. In 2017 it has already grown more than 50%, and we may see it grow to over 60% again this year.</p><h4>What is special about Freedom Finance?</h4><p>Although Freedom Finance focuses on the classic brokerage, which is based on “live" relationship between customers and investment advisers, we are actively experimenting in the field of fintech, as we see an enormous potential for attracting into investment activity of ordinary people, with fewer possibilities, but fundamentally different scale - due to the number of such people in all regions. We have our own Tradernet platform, we have our own package of mobile applications. Presently we have tested the technology and business model of our internet marketplace for Freedom24 shares in Russia, where any person in a few clicks may become the owner of hundreds of companies in different markets - for example, from Apple to Amazon in the US markets. As a result, the project is ready for scaling and further expansion.</p><h4>What is your roadmap for 2018 and what steps are you taking to make sure it's a successful one?</h4><p>We anticipate completing a private placement of our own common stock in 2017 to key local and international business partners, as well as accredited investors outside of the US. This will provide us a capital infusion needed to fund our growth and expansion plans in our domestic and international brokerages offices, investment banking and consumer banking activities, as well as permit us to increase our proprietary trading activities and investigate acquisitions that complement our core business activities. We then plan to turn our attention to increasing our presence in the US through an exchange or market listing and to establish a number of strategic business affiliations with financial market professional in the US for purposes of direct investment into Freedom Holding as well as participation in our future underwriting of companies outside the US. It is an exciting time for Freedom Holding and we expect to inform our investors of many new developments in the coming months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Saudi Airlines Catering in line with the government's Vision 2030? And how is the company proceeding in light of these reforms?</h4><p>Our business is built on 10 strategic foundations that we have identified as providing a multi-faceted and sustainable platform for our development, growth, and contributions to society. These include our longstanding core business divisions of In-Flight, Hajj and Umrah, Catering &amp; Facilities, Lounges, Security, and Retail, which are important emerging areas of opportunity; and the vital principles and support functions that underpin our operations—Human Resources, Procurement, Saudization, and Technology. There are direct links between these pillars and the KSA Vision 2030 program. Our Hajj and Umrah services will help the country welcome more Hajj and Umrah visitors; human resources through our various divisions will provide new opportunities for women, youth and the disabled; adopting technology will contribute to the growth of e-commerce and e-services; and procurement and Saudization will support national companies and the development of local talent.</p><h4>How will Saudi Airlines Catering continue with its business diversification plans and what will be its focus for the years ahead?</h4><p>Saudi Airlines Catering has over the last 35 years blossomed into a broad and diversified enterprise, offering a wide suite of food and beverage, retail, hospitality and support services to local and international clients. Our response is a heightened focus on selective diversification, which will position the company in areas aligned with emerging demographic and economic trends, as well as the KSA Vision 2030 development platform. These areas will ensure we continue to deliver value to our employees, customers and shareholders. The country's youthful population, the government's commitment to spending and indicators such as consumer sentiment, all point to a positive long-term economic outlook. Our strategy is based on the conditions and opportunities emerging in each of our business sectors; in-flight catering and retail in addition to catering and facilities.<br>Many leading companies in Saudi Arabia has been focusing on appointing more Saudi females to lead important positions.</p><h4>What is Saudi Airlines Catering's plan when it comes to develop Saudi talent, particularly Saudi females? Any future plans that you can share with us?</h4><p>Along with talent acquisition, retention and development, Saudization is a core responsibility of the HR department. Pursuing a policy of Saudization ensures SACC plays a part in the development of the national economy, contributes to the well-being of Saudi women and youth, and maintains alignment with the KSA Vision 2030. In 2016 we maintained a Saudization rate of approximately 29.5%, significantly higher than the preceding year and our own targets, putting us in the upper bands of the Government's rating system. To further advance this cause, we have developed a special committee that will specifically address issues related to female employees. The committee is comprised of representatives from all key functions—such as training, recruiting and marketing—and female staff members from each department. We are also forging partnerships with local institutes and civic groups involved in women's causes to solicit their views and expertise. This Committee will ensure women have a voice within Saudi Airlines Catering and will also act to improve conditions for female workers, for instance by providing training for managers on creating a female-friendly environment and fostering new development opportunities. Our approach in developing opportunities for female colleagues exists across many seniority levels and business units to provide multiple options for work and career progression.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Exploring markets from Mauritania to Angola]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[oluseyi-makinde-group-md-makon-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of Makon Group's milestones and achievements over the past two years?</h4><p>Over the past two years, we have commissioned our flagship projects, including the Utorogu NAG2, a 150 million standard cubic feet (MMscfd) natural gas handling facility. It is fully commissioned and is supplying gas according to the West African Gas Pipeline specification into the Excravos Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS). In electricity terms, this quantity of gas will generate close to 600MW of electricity and equals between 10-15% of the national generation capacity for electricity, which hovers around 4,000-6,000MW. We started the project from scratch and carried out detailed engineering, designed the plant, procured the equipment, and installed it. It was a major undertaking for us. On flare-out projects, we are currently in the commissioning phase for Adibawa AG. Its capacity is 5MMscfd, though is an Associated Gas (AG) solution gas project. We take the gas that is produced with the oil, we compress it and sell it back for further processing through the gas pipeline network. We are working on a number of other gas-related projects, such as the Egbema AG and NAG gas processing facility for gas supply to Egbema power plant and the 3Us, which will remove flares from different flow stations around Utorogu and Ughelli east node. We have done all this with zero lost-time injuries (LTI). Those who work on our sites returns safely to their families; no one has even lost a limb. That is a key achievement for organization.</p><h4>What is Makon Group's edge over the many international companies that service IOCs?</h4><p>When I started the company, it was because I saw a niche in the market. I was working as a field engineer on an ExxonMobil site, will receive request for a certified expatriate engineer to fix certain problems and I would in turn send that requisition to my company's head office in Lagos, who in turn would send to it's associates office in the US. Bottomline, ExxonMobil would have to wait up to four weeks to have an engineer on-site in Nigeria and then pay an international rate through transit and on site here. I therefore approached my company's management  and asked to be sent on certification training that could be used to solve the above problem. It would have created a win win situation across the value chain as I would be based in-country and ExxonMobil or any client for that matter would not need to wait four weeks to have the needed support. Second, the company could afford to charge my services out at half the international rate. We still have the same edge today utilizing my model solution to the above; we use highly trained and certified local workforce combined with few expats. Furthermore, we can mobilize rapidly because our resources are in-country. We also deploy technology to support our operations. Whatever data or information or resources the international players have access to, we can leverage as well. Our price competitiveness is one definite advantage, as well as the local knowledge of the environment. Over time, expatriates companies get to know the environment as well, but not as in depth.</p><h4>What is your ultimate ambition for Makon Group?</h4><p>My ultimate ambition is to have an organization that can be benchmarked to international standards. I also want Makon to be the company of choice when people talk about project delivery in this corner of the world. In the past, when ExxonMobil was looking for a company to assist with automation and control scope, our name came up. I hope in the future this happens even more. In Cameroon or Chad, we went in there to work without any advantage and we competed well with international companies. That is why we must benchmark our operations such that if we compete regionally, we can hold our own. There are companies from South Africa that are seeking opportunities in this region as well so we have to be ready to compete as we  want to be in all Gulf of Guinea markets from Mauritania to Angola, if possible. However, it has to make sense and be profitable for us.</p><h4>Now that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) has been passed and is currently in the House of Representatives, what is your vision for how the industry will change?</h4><p>There have been honest efforts to make a dent in the progress to pass the bill; however, there is still a great deal of work to be done. It has been passed by Senate, though not yet by the House of Representatives. It has not been to the executive for approval, either. Thus, we still have quite a way to go. I still feel positive about the potential impact of the PIB on the industry. We have been doing things the same way for several years, and any practitioner in the industry would agree that things must change. There has been progress, though but very slow. Oil and gas activities is the heart of our being as a country. Once we see changes in the oil and gas industry, it will visibly affect all the other sectors of the economy. People are unsure; they do not know how it will affect them personally. However, we are on the right track; we just need to move faster and with greater determination.</p><h4>Have you witnessed increasing interest toward gas projects?</h4><p>It depends on how we look at gas. The most profitable entity in the country currently, I would say is the Nigeria LNG (NLNG). As a company, they are our best client today. We do not have to chase them for payments; sometimes, they even pay us in advance. When people say it takes time before companies earn decent return on their gas investment projects, I sincerely disagree. We do have issues when it comes to payment for gas that is directed to electricity because the chain from gas supply to electricity to homes still suffers from misalignment. Until that is resolved, people will continue thinking it takes time to get returns on investment from gas projects. There is a significant increase in gas projects because Nigeria is more of a gas region than oil. The earlier we monetize our gas resources, the better for us all.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We have seen positive movement, especially with the current price of oil at USD60 per barrel. I suspect it will be in the range of USD55-65 in 2018. That should allow certain projects to go on. Most of the indigenous operators that bought diversified assets from the IOC's are negotiating with banks on how to restructure their loans as they bought the assets when oil price was high. Once they finish that exercise, funding should be available to many of them. Some of the projects that were stalled will come back onstream. I see a positive outlook for 2018. I would be shocked if we return to USD35 per barrel. To that extent, I see positive things on the horizon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[usd15-billion-needed-to-connect-all-islands-by-2019]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From a policy perspective, what are your strategies to drive a positive and inclusive disruption through digital innovation?</h4><p>People, including the press, consider our ministry to be open. We cannot run from technology, which has great potential to solve wealth disparity and empower SMEs. However, it is not technology that is changing the world; people's mindsets are changing the world. People always find new ways and new business processes by maximizing the use of technology. ICT is an enabler of economic growth and social transformation and now we focus on maximizing technology to support economic growth. We aim to have a digital economy of USD150 billion by 2020, which will comprise 11% of Indonesia's GDP then. China, for example, has found its own way to deal with technology. It does not allow Google; instead, it introduced its own search engine platform. India similarly has its own ways. That is why Indonesia is currently in a transition period to position itself within the digital tsunami. Everyone in Indonesia is on Facebook and WhatsApp. We cannot stop those platforms or deny their access in Indonesia; however, we want also to develop our own platforms. The government needs to position itself to protect people from the negative impacts of this technology. We are working hard with foreign investors that want to conduct their business in Indonesia and we would like to be as competitive as possible in the international landscape, because Indonesia is a competitive country.</p><h4>What role can technology play in formalizing the economy?</h4><p>The key to technology is broadband. With that, we have an ecosystem that consists of excellent tools, devices, and applications; these all have to co-exist. We have the network. This country started to introduce 4G technology at the end of 2015. Currently, 297 regencies and cities regional cities out of 512 have 4G coverage, and we aim for all regions to be connected to broadband and 4G by 2019. From an ICT infrastructure perspective, we are number four in Asia currently after Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. The challenge is great compared to our neighbors because of our geography. It is easier for mainland countries to install fiber optics, whereas in our case, the cables have to cross large, open bodies of water. The investment to connect all islands by 2019 is USD1.5 billion. We built this with PPPs because we want the private sector participating in this space. By the second half of 2018 we will make a decision on our own satellite; this will be the leapfrog. In Indonesia we need a high-speed satellite because we have to connect around 220,000 schools at the primary and secondary levels and thousands at the tertiary level. We have to connect 75,000 village offices and 10,000 villages hospitals. We have already incorporated this plan into our National Strategic Project; the president has signed the decree. However, we want to position Indonesia to become number two in the region. We cannot compete with Singapore because it is a small island. However, by 2019 Jakarta will be more competitive. There will not be much difference between Singapore and Jakarta from an ICT point of view.</p><h4>How can you help create a climate that supports entrepreneurship in terms of start-ups?</h4><p>We aim to have 4G and smartphone devices cost around USD30 by 2019. We want access for everyone. Access to more affordable technologies relates as well to start-ups. We have to provide the room for people to innovate as much as possible. That is why in our ministry, start-ups do not need to get permits or licenses; the only need to register. We need to give start-ups a chance to develop and see what they can do before we regulate. We have to open the room so that people can come up with something completely out of the box. It is not necessary to create a difficult process that is complicated to deal with. This has been my policy since joining the ministry.</p><h4>The decree for the National Cyber and Encryption Agency (BSSN) was ratified in June 2017. How would you assess the establishment of this agency so far?</h4><p>We are working with the government to appoint the chairman of BSSN. This agency deals with cybersecurity and cryptographs. Indonesia is open for foreign investment. The executive director of Alibaba, Jack Ma, is an e-commerce advisor of the government. People are more likely to listen to his opinion of what Indonesia has done to support the growth of the digital industry. Secondly, we want Ma, as a guru, to develop Indonesia as the base of talent development for the region. We also want to help universities focus more on technology. With this combination, foreign investors will be able to see Indonesia as more than the market but also the base for conducting business in the region. Indonesia represents over 40% of Asia's economy and the population, which is why we deserve to become the base for investors and foreign business from outside the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Neconde Energy's main operations and the main projects it is currently involved in?</h4><p>Neconde Energy is in a joint venture with the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) to manage OML 42. OML 42 is a swamp asset that was acquired from Shell Petroleum Development Company in 2011. Neconde owns 45% while the other 55% belongs to NPDC on behalf of the Nigerian government. We have gone through a fairly checkered history from acquisition to date, dealing with such issues as who has operatorship rights and challenges with evacuation of crude due to the 18-month outage of the Trans Forcados Pipeline (TFP) which takes crude from our fields to the Forcados terminal. The outage of the pipeline was as a result of the insurgency in the Niger Delta. That long outage led us to experimenting with barging as an alternative method of crude evacuation.</p><h4>How does the new barging line of business change Neconde's operations?</h4><p>We lost access to the Trans Forcados Pipeline to transport our products from the well to the export terminal, where crude is processed to make it export quality. We had to recreate the pipe using boats, barges, and so on; we transported produced oil from the well into a vessel that would sail down a river or creek to a floating storage vessel that accumulates crude until it has enough volumes for export. This completely changed the nature of our company. We used to be just an oil and gas company but have now also become a marine company. To manage the marine spread we need barges, holding vessels, tug boats, and so on. A major part of the challenge of the experimentation was trying to keep all the elements working in sync to replicate the seamless flow through a pipeline. We do not want any break in this chain as that would lead to a stop in production.</p><h4>What is the advantage of barging over using the Trans Forcados Pipeline?</h4><p>Barging is not necessarily cheaper; however, it gives us the assurance that we can always produce. Since the Trans Forcados Pipeline became operative again there have been considerable improvements in its up time. However, the pipeline still goes down every four to five weeks because of leaks; it is over 40 years old and has been abused by all the attempts to steal crude from it, the bombings, and bunkerings; therefore, it is structurally weak. When it goes down, production has to be stopped. One feature of this production is we need to nurse our wells and take great care of them. With barging, we are no longer exposed to shut downs as a result of TFP outage. This also means we are better able maintain our wells at peak performance. These are some of the benefits of having usingbarging as a means of crude evacuation.</p><h4>What is your strategy and timeframe to achieve your goal of reaching a peak production of 100,000bpd from OML 42?</h4><p>The alternative pipeline solution is a key component in achieving and sustaining that level of production. It is one thing to attain a level of peak production; it is another thing to keep production going at the peak. More importantly, following the restoration of the Trans Forcados pipeline, we have a lifting of the restrictions that we had earlier and can at least produce and export products. Our target is 80,000bpd by the end of January. Later in the year, we have a number of major interventions that we have to carry out and a number of additional wells we need to drill; through these, we expect to achieve a production level of 110,000bpd by the end of 2018.</p><h4>What is your involvement with gas today?</h4><p>One of the features of OML 42 is that it is a gas-rich asset. We are currently commissioning the Odidi Central Processing Facility, which will add significant volumes of gas to the domestic gas supply grid for power. We have in the pipeline projects that we are considering developing for 2018, 2019, and beyond in collaboration with interested parties and investors. We will either have co-development or bring in parties that will either do BOT, build to toll, and so on. We see OML 42 as being a key player in the supply of gas to the national power grid. One of the subsidiaries the Obi Jackson Group is developing a Power Plant in the southeastern part of the country and its feed gas will  come directly or indirectly from OML 42.</p><h4>Some claim indigenous companies have been unlucky as they purchased assets from IOCs at a time of high oil prices. How are they dealing with recovering such investment in this new era of low oil prices?</h4><p>Firstly, a company needs to become creative, such as our barging alternative evacuation. It was developed out of a need to survive, because there were bankers waiting for interest and principal to be paid and companies cannot continue to say there is no production. The second aspect of the solution is a more meaningful dialog with lenders. As with many other companies in our position, we are amending the facilities that we entered into in 2012, 2015, and so on to bring about more realistic expectation of the asset returns to lenders. One interesting dynamic of this is although we are borrowers, we are now being selective about where we borrow money from. For example, offtakers have a better understanding of the oil and gas business and typically have cash and it makes sense to put cash in upstream companies so that they can guarantee offtake for a number of years. That is easier funding than we would receive from a high street bank. The final aspect that we are moving into and which will be seen more in the coming two or three years is companies such as Neconde going public to acquire funds.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be more of a consolidation year; we would like to have high targets hat we want to meet and surpass, though we are also looking at the macroeconomic environment and the fiscal enablers. We would like to see more of a settlement of the questions around the Petroleum Industry Bill. Removing that cloud from the business environment would also make additional investment easier because a bad bill is better than the uncertainty of the current moment. I am also hopeful that with more of the things that we are doing in Neconde, we will begin to see an end to the restiveness of the Niger Delta in 2018.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zain Saudi Arabia recently saw its first profitable half year to date, and its fundamentals are strong. What has driven these results?</h4><p>At the end of 3Q2017 Zain delivered strong results. YoY 11% revenue growth over the same quarter in 2016 while YTD we had 9% growth in revenue. We are delivering some of the best margins in the industry, including 68% gross margin and 34% earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). We have had three consecutive quarters of net profit, which has never happened in the company's 10-year history. We started 2017 with about SAR900 million (USD240 million) in liquid assets and ended the third quarter with about SAR1.8 billion (USD480 million), doubling our cash assets despite loan payments and funding our growing business. A transformation program underpins this performance. It begins with Zain offering customers more and smarter choice in products and services with better value. Zain in the past was a simple scratch card business for many years and this was due to a lack of sufficient investments in network CAPEX. We paid the world's highest license fee ever per capita globally at USD6.1 billion a decade ago to acquire the license. Several years ago the shareholders decided to invest and transform Zain into a data-centric company. Zain invested SAR4.5 billion (USD1.2 billion) into upgrading the network with LTE-A. The first part of the transformation was investing in the network and thus giving customers more choices for data packages. Today, about 55% of our revenues come from data whereas a few years ago almost 90% came from voice. Today Zain is perceived by customers as the data company of preference in Saudi. We have shifted away from prepaid and our growth is driven by postpaid, data, and enterprise customers. We are also gaining more Saudi national customers. Zain is now focused on reliability, quality and smart value offers for different customer segments. As our business today is over 95% B2C consumer business, we are also beginning to win over enterprise customers and exploring opportunities with government accounts. The other pillars of the transformation program included a significant investment in retail outlets and brand. We also implemented a cost optimization program and identified savings that could be diverted to sales and marketing activities. Finally, we focused on consistent and caring approach to handling customer enquiries and complaints with more responsive resolution of complaints. The combined impact of all these initiatives have contributed to better performance.</p><h4>What remains to be done in terms of the quality of your network and the positioning of your products?</h4><p>We have been issued with a new unified license (Dec 2016) that allows us to deliver and build fixed networks. However, we will not be replicating the incumbent's fixed network. In most areas of the world this is not economically feasible and the market in Saudi is no different. Our approach on the fixed side of the business is to be selective and target predominantly enterprise clients.  We have a joint marketing initiative with Saudi Electricity Company and in 2018 we will be delivering FTTH services to residential and business customers. We are also acquired spectrum to enhance the performance of our wireless network. We continue to roll out new infrastructure to improve coverage and capacity and expand our existing LTE-A data network. Our products portfolio will include best of class fast broadband services based on LTE-A and FTTH technologies. In addition to fast and reliable connectivity, we are also exploring solutions for smart home, smart cars and smart cities.</p><h4>What role does cost management play in your strategy?</h4><p>We talk about smart efficiencies, and not just cutting cost. If we can save money from something that does not impact the customer or the quality of service, we will do so. We are reviewing all our supply arrangements to ensure cost and terms and conditions reflect current economic environment. We are exploring sharing risks and rewards with some suppliers. Any savings are being redirected to sales, marketing and customer care. Smart cost optimization is an integral part of our business leadership at all times, irrespective of levels of growth. In 2017, at least half of our net profit resulted from a combination of cost efficiencies couple with reduced amortization due to the extension of our license from 25 to 40 years.</p><h4>How have you dealt with the impact of expatriates leaving the country and having fewer SIM cards?</h4><p>What keeps us awake at night is not what our competitors are doing, but the economic and regulatory environment. We believe in the Vision 2030; mid to long-term diversification of the economy requires investment and a great deal of digital enablement. However, in the short term some policy initiatives are shrinking the market. Expat levies and increased levies on expats are reducing the total number especially of prepaid customers. In addition VAT of 5% will result in lower disposable income for the great majority of expats. There will be significant impact in the spending patterns of expats in 2018 till readjustment takes place. In 2016/2017 due to a number of sound policy initiatives including biometric verification, approximately 6.5 million SIM cards disappeared from the industry. We expect customer numbers to remain steady in 2018 with reduced revenue per sim from the expat segment of our customer base.</p><h4>Zain announced a plan to cancel shares and do a rights issue. What is behind this bold move and how did you decide on it?</h4><p>Zain today has accumulated significant losses from previous years trading and also has a very high debt-to-equity ratio of 82%. As part of its financing arrangements due to such high levels of debt and losses, as the company turns profitable, shareholders have to wait for many years before any dividends can be paid. Diluting some of the shareholders and creating new shares can realize a pathway to dividends realized if the company continues its positive trading performance. Dilution is not an easy decision to discuss with the Board but it is a necessary long-term decision for the company; institutional investors understand such necessities. Subject to approval from shareholders and CMA, we expect to complete this initiative in 1Q2018.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>Our strategy is simple: focus on delivering smart value, consistent quality of service and responsive customer care. We also want to diversify and complement our core business, which is predominantly centered around wireless connectivity in the consumer segment, with fast broadband solutions based on fiber and wireless technologies, for home, business and enterprises. We are working towards accelerating the enablement of digital lifestyle in Saudi across not only youth and other lifestyle segments but also across communities through digital health, digital education and other applications. There is tremendous growth potential for digital services and superfast connectivity in the Saudi market in the years ahead driven by Vision 2030.  However, we believe the next 12-24 months will be very challenging for the industry and us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the TTB balance marketing Tanzania's most well-known attractions with encouraging people to visit lesser known parts of the country?</h4><p>Previously, we were very much focusing on the well-known attractions, especially those located in the northern part of the country. The main reason was that those areas are supported by tourism infrastructure: good roads, an international airport, and plenty of accommodation options. But recently we have found that Tanzania's northern tourism circuit has become saturated with tourists. In order to avoid mass tourism spoiling those areas, we decided there was a need to diversify Tanzania's tourism offering. Right now, we are placing considerable emphasis on promoting the southern tourism circuit. We recently signed up for a grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) precisely for the development of areas such as Rujewa, Kitulo, Udzungwa Mountains National Park, Selous Game Reserve, Mikumi National Park, and Ruaha National Park.</p><h4>Aside from geographical diversification, how else is the TTB looking to widen Tanzania's tourism offering?</h4><p>When we talk about diversification, we are not just talking about opening up other parts of the country, but also about promoting other products, such as cultural tourism. We want people who come to Tanzania to be able to stay with local people and learn about Tanzanian culture. Moreover, the government is also focusing on encouraging other types of tourism activities, such as beach tourism. We have one of the longest, cleanest, and most beautiful coastlines in Africa, with around 800km of white sand beach. This coastline has not been developed, and, therefore, presents a ripe opportunity for investments in beach tourism. We are also working to boost our MICE offerings, encouraging international business gatherings to take place in Tanzania as much as possible. We have state-of-the-art conference centers: the Julius Nyerere International Convention Center (JNICC), in Dar es Salaam, the Arusha International Conference Centre (AICC), in Arusha, and other establishments in major cities to encourage event planners to choose Tanzania as their next conference destination. Plans are being made to establish a national visitors and convention bureau in Tanzania. This will ensure that more international conferences take place in Tanzania. Efforts are also being made to promote sports tourism, to have more international football matches, marathons, and other sports events take place in Tanzania. Historical tourism is also another area we are looking into, especially now after the recent discovery of the skeleton of a 70 million-years-old sauropod in Tanzania.</p><h4>How is the TTB working to ensure that conservation remains a top priority?</h4><p>Statistically, the majority of our tourists come to Tanzania for the wildlife. It is clearly a major product for the country, and it looks like this trend will continue. In 2017, Tanzania was named the best safari destination in the world by Safaribookings.com. Because of this, it is even more crucial for us to conserve our wildlife in order to enable our industry to continue growing sustainably. To do this, the TTB works with both the public and private sector. Through our cultural tourism program and also through our support program to Wildlife Management Areas, we try to educate and involve local communities in the conservation management of their areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the priorities for FAO over the past year in Tanzania?</h4><p>FAO is a long-term development partner for Tanzania, having established offices in Tanzania in 1977, exactly 40 years ago. Since then, we have been providing assistance to the government in the planning and implementation of its agricultural policies, strategies, and programs. Our work mainly focuses on improving food and nutrition security, and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Through a Country Programming Framework (CPF), FAO and the government define priority areas in which to focus support over a period of two to four years. The current CPF focuses on strengthening evidence-based food and agriculture policy planning and coordination; providing technical assistance for increased investment in the sector; increasing agricultural production and productivity (crop, livestock, aquaculture, and forestry); improving access to markets of smallholder producers, particularly young people and women for improved incomes; and strengthening resilience to threats and crises, including those posed by extreme weather events. Under those priorities, FAO has provided Tanzania with specific and consistent support in preparing various investment projects in the field of agriculture, forestry, and natural resources management, including regional projects and other proposed bilateral investment programs by the World Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. We have been at the forefront in supporting the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries to develop climate smart agriculture guidelines and related interventions aimed at building farmers' resiliency to climate change. FAO support and advocacy has resulted in launching a national policy on youth employment in agriculture, which in turn has impacted the beneficiaries' livelihoods due to the high adoption rates of good agricultural practices. Finally, we have supported the Agriculture Statistics Strategic Plan, coordinated by the National Bureau of Statistics to improve availability of agricultural statistical data. We have carried out several technical studies to inform policy or development of sector strategies, including piloting activities on crop forecasting and small-area estimation.</p><h4>What advances have been made on the 2020 irrigation targets, and what will be the impact of these once realized? </h4><p>Dependence on rain-fed agriculture is a major bottleneck for agricultural development in many developing countries. Tanzania is increasingly modernizing its agriculture, and irrigation systems are a key factor in that path. Tanzania has 2.3 million ha classified as high potential for irrigation development out of 29.4 million ha suitable for irrigation. The government plans to increase the area under irrigation from the current 461,326ha to 1 million ha by 2020. There will be a huge level of investment in finance and human capacities to realize this target. Increasing irrigated land goes hand in hand with increasing irrigation efficiency and promoting the sustainable use of water. There needs to be more of an emphasis on innovation in the implementation and management of irrigation schemes, including multiple and integrated agricultural activities that will enhance food security and nutrition of local communities in the areas.</p><h4>Is there enough onus from the public sector on boosting mechanization and development in agriculture, and is there enough financing to support such a drive?</h4><p>The government policy thrust for medium-term development is expressed in the National Five-Year Development Plan and in the Agriculture Sector Development Program Phase II. Both of these emphasize the development of the agriculture sector through mechanization. There are good examples where policy is defining a move in this direction. For instance, the introduction of tax exemptions on agricultural machinery and implements, as well as the drive for industrialization and attracting of investment for value addition to agriculture produce, all boost mechanization and develop the agricultural sector. However, inadequate financing of the agricultural sector could be a stumbling block in achieving these goals. There is no doubt that the government needs to work in partnership with development partners, private sector, and civil society in pursuit of the agenda to modernize and mechanize the agriculture sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Aside from the drive to add 30,000 new houses to the market by 2025, what other priorities are highlighted in the NHC's Corporate Strategy Plan?</h4><p>The 2015-2016 strategy plan includes our commitment to build 30,000 houses over the next 10 years; however, this is not our sole focus. Aside from directly constructing these properties, we will ensure that many houses are being built for Tanzanians in various ways. One way is by entering into strategic partnerships; another is our portfolio dealing with land development—access to planned land with the infrastructure in place. We have another portfolio due to start next year, which will deal with the production of building materials as part of our alignment with the government's drive to boost industrialization, beginning with roofing materials, painting, and brick making. With that, our overall contribution to the sector will be extremely high, more than the numbers we have committed. Finally, we are midway through negotiations with partners on a deal for prefabricated industrial houses. Dodoma will be our key focus now as there is great demand for houses with the new administration moving there, and we must support the government in this.</p><h4>One of the challenges faced by the real estate market is the availability of affordable housing. How does the NHC leverage PPPs to work to resolve this issue?</h4><p>There is no lack of interest; we are in talks with companies from Turkey and the Middle East, and recently we had our first engagement with a group from Norway, though we have yet to progress further. We have been through the first round of meetings with 22 business people in real estate construction. The difficulty is that many people with plans to invest in real estate in Tanzania look at mid- and upper-level housing. We have not yet been fortunate enough to find people who are keen to support the low-income and affordable houses, where there is growing demand. However, it is important to stress that business in that sub-market can be huge. The amounts might not be large themselves; however, the volume is certainly there, and investors can double in profit on medium- or high-income developments. The NHC works hard to bring the right partners on board for this venture. We seek to improve the understanding of our philosophy behind affordable housing; we are not referring to socially subsidized houses, but a social business project that we fully intend to be financially viable. The other part is that we bring a level of flexibility to the transaction: we are willing to stretch investors' guarantees so that capital remains safe. That said, we have seen an appetite from impact financers, and we hope this will increase in the coming years so that we can make headway on these plans.</p><h4>How do you deal with problems that arise from large-scale urbanization across Tanzania?</h4><p>Urbanization is an issue not just in Tanzania, but the entire continent. In Tanzania, one of the side effects of urbanization has been a squatter crisis. Across the country there are valuable properties in badly planned areas. People have invested in houses in places that were not planned, simply because there were not enough plots being produced or enough developers putting up properties. When these houses are left unoccupied due to a lack of surrounding infrastructure, they invariably end up hosting large numbers of squatters. The NHC is tackling this problem with an extra emphasis on land planning: providing more surveyed roads and other resources to help meet the demand of people looking for areas in which to build. We also want to boost construction and development ourselves, to prevent people from needing to venture out by themselves. With that we have focused on Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Arusha, and Mbeya. We also see great opportunities in Musoma. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wheels-on-the-bus]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the thinking behind constructing the DART system, and how is it currently operational in the city?</h4><p>Local bus services faced safety and environmental problems: traffic congestion caused by too many low capacity buses, unsafe driving manners, non-adherence to traffic rules, and lack of proper maintenance of bus vehicles. In the early 2000s, the City Council, in search of a solution, toured other countries to learn how these problems were dealt with across the globe. Bus rapid transit (BRT) was selected as the most appropriate mode of mass transport to fit our city's needs due to its comparatively lower capital costs, as well as the possibility of involving affected stakeholders, such as the bus drivers. A consultant was engaged to complete a conceptual design mapping six main routes across the entire city. The routes are being phased in six parts with a total length of 141km of dedicated bus ways (called trunk routes) and there will be feeder routes.  The first phase, with 20.9km of dedicated bus ways and one feeder route, is currently in operation. This trunk route runs from the City Center at Kivukoni all the way up to Kimara, just outside the city center, some 15km. The same route also has branches to Morocco and Gerezani. The feeder route operates between Kimara and Umbesi, a distance of 7km. Phase one is also comprised of 27 stations, five terminals, three pedestrian bridges, and one depot. We started with an interim phase for a period of two to three years with 140 buses and an automated fare collection system. For the full phase, we expect to have 305 buses and 11 feeder routes. A procurement process is underway to get a second bus operator.</p><h4>Why is DART currently operating in an interim phase?</h4><p>We entered into an interim phase because we finished construction prior to securing a bus operator. The infrastructure was lying idle and was misused by petty traders and other modes of transport such as motorcycles, motor vehicles, and local buses. To put an end to this misuse, as well as to optimize use of the new facilities, the government decided to engage an interim operator, since the normal process of procuring an operator through a PPP would take a long time. The interim operator was a local bus company that, together with local bus operators, formed a company called UDART.  The DART Agency entered into a contract with UDART on April 25, 2015.  Currently, we are operating with 140 buses, of which 39 are 18m-long articulated buses while 101 are 12m-long buses earmarked for the feeder routes. The interim phase is planned for two to three years, while the full service will be for 12 years.</p><h4>How do you sum up the reception to DART, as well as its impact on the economy?</h4><p>Since we started operations, its impact has been extremely positive. When we started operations last year in May 2016, the average daily ridership was around 75,000 passengers. Now, just one year on, we are above 200,000 riders on a single day, with numbers on some days reaching up to 250,000. People are enjoying the shorter travel times from Kimara to the CBD, which previously took two hours but now takes 40-45 minutes. Not only is this more convenient for the public, it is also particularly economical, especially when taking into account savings on fuel and parking for those who have decided to leave their cars and ride the buses. The value of land and buildings near the project has increased. Apart from the economic benefits, there are also tangible environmental benefits because our engines are environmentally friendly. We are using EURO 3 engines that lower pollution in the city.  The project has made Dar es Salaam the first African city to win the prestigious global Sustainable Transport Award for 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[express-shipping-for-express-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is incorporated in the bundle of services DHL Tanzania provides for businesses, and have you noticed any change in demand for these over the past six months?</h4><p>DHL's strength, being the biggest and strongest international carrier within the logistics industry, lies in its international express services, since we have a robust network across the world. We also offer domestic deliveries, including import express service, where deliveries are collected from other countries and brought into the recipient's country of residence where they can pay in local currency. It is a unique service that not all providers can offer. As for changes in demand, we have seen a significant increase in customers seeking e-commerce solutions. With Tanzania every day becoming more technologically driven, it is no surprise that many Tanzanians are choosing to shop online. We have noticed a subsequent increase in international companies who are looking to ship goods safely, quickly, and reliably, and they are choosing us as their partner for this. We have received a number of requests from customers who want to integrate with us, and we are working to meet those demands.</p><h4>What are the comparative advantages of being in Tanzania, and how important is the country for DHL's global footprint?</h4><p>Within Africa, Tanzania is strategically positioned, in terms of geography, as well as in terms of demographics. All sectors in which we work, such as telecoms and energy, are at the early- to mid-development stage, which suggests considerable potential and growth opportunities. DHL, with its global expertise, network, and experience, is well placed to facilitate such development. We can coordinate the movement of all items and facilities, and provide reliable logistics services for new companies to enter the market. With the new government in place and with new fiscal policies, compliance drives, and revenue drives, there has been a reconfiguration in the ways of doing business, and we need to adjust to that. However, the expectation is that business will pick up as time goes on, and that means that logistics, global trade, and global movement of things from all parts of the world will increase, especially into Tanzania.</p><h4>How is Tanzania's profile as an attractive destination for FDI changing following these new regulations?</h4><p>The main thing is maintaining investor confidence. New reforms will position the country in a positive light for investors, showing that Tanzania is re-addressing much of its current business policy. New fiscal and compliance drives will certainly encourage investment in the logistics sector. At DHL, we are already discussing expansion steered toward accommodating the volumes we expect with this imminent growth. Increasingly companies are looking for express logistics centers, as they want to bring their items closer to the end users. Because of this, we are looking to expand our existing express logistics center.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the logistics sector as a whole?</h4><p>There is a possibility for growth, but this will depend on movements in the economy, trade between businesses and customers, and continued developments in the e-commerce field. We have been carefully analyzing our shipping trends, activities across the country, change within the government, and budgetary decisions, and have concluded that there will be growth. As the market leader, we will go on investing in our people, equipment, and facilities to ensure that we continue to exceed the demands of our customers. As the first and largest express logistics company in Africa, we are well positioned to service the growth of Tanzania, ensuring its viability and attractiveness on a global scale. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Overtaking Mombasa]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[overtaking-mombasa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What infrastructural developments have been underway at TICTS over the past year?</h4><p>We received two new large cranes, costing around USD10 million each, at the end of December and went into operation in January 2017. In addition, we have purchased substantial amounts of new equipment and made some structural changes. The government has increased custom checking: now there is 100% scanning and heightened customs verification, and we have had to make additional smaller investments to increase our verification area to be able to cope with the increased activity. We also needed to employ more staff to cope with increased customs inspections and size up our office space as a result. The new regulations mean sometimes there are more queues while boxes are waiting on trucks for scanning. The scanners are currently situated outside the terminal, and though we hope to relocate them in the future, we have employed additional staffing for the time being.</p><h4>Have traffic flows in the region increased since 2016?</h4><p>While local traffic has in fact declined by around 5% in 1Q2017, the transit cargo of the neighboring landlocked countries has been increasing. I attribute this to improvements in the economic conditions of our neighbors. In the DRC, the elections are now over, so things are back to business as usual. In Zambia, we have seen more mines opening in the Copperbelt, and with the uptick in copper prices, these businesses are now going strong. It has been difficult to forecast what will happen in Tanzania, and much will depend on governmental policies and the approach with the private sector and foreign investment. That said, if the economies nearby continue to improve, this will certainly have a knock-on effect on us, and we will see this in turn impacting the economy in Tanzania.</p><h4>In light of the increase in regional traffic, how do you evaluate progress made to inland corridor projects in the Eastern and Southern African regions?</h4><p>There has been a marked improvement in terms of infrastructure and connectivity in many of these corridors. While not all of these routes have reached optimum efficiency and we do face bottlenecks, we have seen a significant government effort to remove some of the obstacles impeding easy movement of cargo. Ultimately, the initiatives to boost connectivity through rail investment are extremely positive, and in addition to this, there are plans in the pipeline to upgrade road infrastructure as well. These demonstrated commitments are opening up Tanzania even more to regional trade.</p><h4>Given that Tanzania is an obvious entry point for trade in the region, what needs to be done to ensure that it fulfills its potential?</h4><p>Top priorities should be enhancing efficiency and reliability. On paper, Tanzania looks as though it is the most competitive entry point for the region based on proximity and direct corridors from Dar es Salaam to Rwanda and the DRC. However, in many ways ports like Mombasa in fact attract more business because they are renowned for their consistency in customs procedure. At Dar es Salaam, we are still somewhat lagging behind in this respect, although measures are being taken to correct this, such as the new 24-hour port-operating schedule. Costs are also a factor, and we will have to wait and see how the value-added tax (VAT) will impact transit cargo. VAT could weigh in heavily with shippers or freight forwarders when making decisions. If customs procedures can be further streamlined and overall efficiency increases, then we expect to see growth in traffic flows as a result. Currently, we seek to comply with higher levels of inspection, and this will definitely impact our revenues and our profitability. Technology, though it has still not yet taken center stage, will play a larger role in this with improvements to the scanning and checking process. I predict noticeable growth to begin in late 2018 or 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Does the distribution of the government's transportation budget accurately reflect the investment needs of the transport sector?</h4><p>We have started to see the proper allocation of funds since 2016. For example, the government prioritizes certain areas that need extra attention, such as inland waterways. There are plans underway to revamp these by acquiring vessels for Lake Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyasa. At Lake Nyasa, vessels are due for commissioning in mid-2017. We expect another vessel to be ready to be commissioned by YE2017, and there will be three new vessels on Lake Nyasa in total. At the same time, we have sought investors to fund the building of new cargo vessels for Lake Tanganyika to link the eastern part of the DRC to western Tanzania. This would connect to the road and rail networks. The allocation of these funds was planned some 20 years ago, and we now see the budget being distributed to the right places. With new cargo vessels, we will be able to transport raw materials to factories and finished goods to the market in line with the government's drive to boost industrialization.</p><h4>How do you assess the levels of dialog between the governing bodies of different modes of transport in Tanzania?</h4><p>SUMATRA has forged a great coordinating relationship with other agencies, whether it is shipping, road, or rail transport. Government institutions have to coordinate on issues relating to all these sectors. In addition, we have a role to play in regulating competition within the various industries in which we work. Most of our operators come from the private sector, and we act as the umbrella for them to come together. One example of this process is port tariffs: SUMATRA is tasked with approving all port tariffs and port operators have to apply direct to SUMATRA or through their landlord, Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA), if they want to increase a particular tariff. As their landlord, the TPA has to consider these requests and it advises the operators on whether a proposed tariff is too high or low and what factors the regulator will look at. The regulator then must consult with all the stakeholders in maritime, road, and rail transport to determine the effects on costs, efficiency, and competition. Through consultation, analysis, and decisions like these, we maintain a healthy and cooperative dialog across the industry.</p><h4>What role do PPPs play in Tanzania's burgeoning transport sector, and are there discussions to forge more PPPs in the transport sector within Dar es Salaam?</h4><p>PPPs are useful tools for joining hands with the government to come up with infrastructure investment, including in transport. Dar es Salaam's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project phase I, under an interim service provider arrangement, is a typical PPP. The operator for this is the private sector and the owner of the infrastructure is the government. We have held discussions with the World Bank about starting construction on phases two, three, and four of the city's BRT system. Before YE2017, construction on Phases III and IV, which include the roads from the city center to Gongo la Mboto and from the city center to Bunju toward Bagamoyo, will commence. Again, there will be more private companies operating the infrastructure built by the government. There are also opportunities to invest in rail transport. We have iron ore deposits in Tanzania's southern highlands (Liganga) waiting to be extracted, and these will need to be transported to Mtwara port for export, hence the need for a standard-gauge railway. At the same time, there are some productive agricultural centers—in the entire western part of Tanzania from north to south—that are not particularly accessible. This means there is a need for investment in roads under PPP arrangements, and then there will be scope to invest in the trucking industry to transport agro-produce from the farms to markets and centers with rail links. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Knauf begin its operations in Tanzania? </h4><p>Knauf is a leading company in both gypsum products for interiors and gypsum as a raw material. The company is active worldwide, with over 250 production facilities globally. Approximately five years ago, Knauf's management decided to investigate the opportunities for establishing our business in East Africa. We established a local company in Tanzania dealing in gypsum boards and gypsum-related building products, such as plaster. All the raw material we need is readily available in Tanzania, and we are able to mine all the gypsum we use in the production of our boards. The first step we took was to acquire the assets of an existing local Tanzanian-Chinese company. Our operations started officially in December 2015. We envision Tanzania as a base from which to expand our activities in East Africa and surrounding countries.</p><h4>How do you assess the demand for gypsum here compared to other markets?<br></h4><p>All of the markets in East Africa are experiencing rapid development and growth. Raw gypsum is needed in other industries, such as the cement industry, which has been booming in Tanzania over the last couple of years. This has pushed up demand for raw gypsum to over 300,000 tons per year. There is also growth in the use of gypsum in plasters and gypsum boards in line with demand for housing. Additionally, rapid urbanization in Tanzania translates into the potential for future growth. Parallel to this, there will be more and more high-end projects coming up, both in terms of public and private buildings, built in the modern way, meaning light and fast; therefore, we predict more potential growth in this field as well.</p><h4>What other actions are you taking to increase awareness about the use of your products?</h4><p>This is something Knauf is doing worldwide. We are not reinventing the wheel in Tanzania, because globally the company has a wealth of know-how that we can select from and implement here. At the practical level, the first thing we are doing is sending our group of professionals to visit job sites, informing clients about Knauf's products and systems. We are not selling products; we sell systems and solutions. We are trying to instill in the minds of local people that they can come to Knauf Tanzania at any time for solutions, regarding, for example, specialist fire protection, sound absorption, structural wall, or ceiling shape solutions for building projects. We also teach the industry how to best install or build using our solutions in order to benefit in terms of safety, time, and money. We trained over 150 people at Knauf Tanzania in 2016. It is a long proces, but in the long term a worthwhile investment.</p><h4>How is Knauf Tanzania contributing to the government's target to increase local manufacturing and what is your outlook here?</h4><p>The government wants to industrialize Tanzania, which is the right strategy for the future of the country. Knauf Tanzania is fully in line with what the government believes has to be done, and we are already doing it. We are locally producing something that used to be imported, and we are doing this using predominantly local raw materials. We produce gypsum from local sources and send the finished material to the local market as well as for export. The government needs to attract more companies like us into the country in order to reach its industrialization target. To achieve this, first and foremost, we need to place the emphasis on improving infrastructure. Moreover, there needs to be better promotion of the opportunities on offer in Tanzania. Then, the government should also ease the processes and procedures for companies when they do decide to come and invest here. Most investors come here with money, they have their money and do not ask for funding or favors; they just ask for an environment in which they are able to implement their plans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[every-sector-along-for-the-ride]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The government is entering its second year of its second Five-Year Development Plan (FYDPII). What is driving this?</h4><p>The main goal of the plan is to enable Tanzania to become a medium-sized economy by 2025, underscored by industrial production. The government's decision was inspired by a desire to create integrated and sustainable development through all available resources and offer a wide range of sustainable opportunities and employment. It is also true that industrial economies need to be more effective in overseeing and implementing investors' interests, rehabilitating and protecting domestic industries, and combating the power of unfair competition in the market. </p><h4>How important is the role of the private sector for attaining these industrialization goals?</h4><p>In the construction of industrial economies, the private sector is crucial, and the government needs to ensure it encourages existing opportunities and investments in trade and marketing. It must provide space for public-private dialog. Furthermore, the private sector is instrumental in spurring improvements in production techniques, developing and harnessing modern technologies, and boosting human resource capacity with professionals across every sector. This stimulates progress for all. Thus, the government depends on the private sector to support policies, programs, strategies, laws, and regulations that protect the interests of the nation. We are also cooperating with the private sector to develop and strengthen research institutions such as the National Development Corporation (NDC) and the Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA). </p><h4>Have you seen an increase in industrial activity in the past 12 months?</h4><p>Between 2016 and March 2017, the government successfully registered 242 different sector projects worth USD926,000. These are expected to provide up to 17,385 new jobs. Of these projects, 170 are industrial, 54 in construction, and 18 more in various fields across the board. In 2016, industrial production rose by 7.8%, compared to 6.5% in 2015. This growth was mainly due to an increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco products. The industrial sector's contribution to GDP was 5.1%, remaining fairly constant from 5.2% in 2015, though the industrial sector as a whole has generated 146,892 jobs, compared to 139,895 jobs in 2015. This was brought about by investments in the expansion and establishment of new industries.</p><h4>How does Tanzania compare to its East African neighbors in terms of attractiveness for investors?</h4><p>Our investment sector has continued to grow and is faring better than many other East African countries. The 2016 UNCTAD report shows that Tanzania attracted USD1.5 million in 2015. Similarly, the Quantum Global Investment report on 54 African countries ranked Tanzania ahead of Kenya and Uganda. Tanzania was number eight in terms of economic growth, financial flows, currency exchange, business environment, mass population, and technological and creative use in Africa. What's more, World Bank statistics show that total GDP growth has gone from 14.8% in 1997 to 31.3% in 2015, compared to the African average of 21-22% and the developing country average of 23-25%.</p><h4>What is the status of the special investment projects outlined by the ministry?</h4><p>We have seen an acceleration of internal investment from the Tanzanian Social Security Association (TSSA) as well as six social securities funds, which have been earmarked for 25 special investment projects in diverse sectors: textiles; commodities like tea, wine, and sugar; and metal molding. The PPF pension fund and the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) have joined forces to develop a sugarcane plant; the PPF has entered into a partnership with Karanga Prison for shoe fabrication; the LAPF pensions fund is investigating possibilities of investing in a tea fertilizer factory; and the GEPF pension fund has signed an investment agreement with the Dodoma wine factory, and invested in the construction of a metal molding machine at Kilimanjaro Machine Tools Corporation (KMTC) in Moshi. These projects are well on their way to being realized and, once complete, will contribute considerably to the manufacturing and value-adding arm of the state's industrialization strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[shelling-out-for-more]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the defining features of Tanzania's natural gas discoveries and Shell's operations in the country?</h4><p>Our main activity is our work on Tanzania's integrated LNG development based on three deep-water offshore blocks where dry gas has been found. Two of the blocks are operated by Shell and one by Statoil, and we will have a joint LNG onshore processing plant in Lindi in southern Tanzania. From here, LNG will be exported, and processed gas will be supplied to the domestic market. Unlike the oil discoveries of Tanzania's neighbors, such as Uganda and Kenya, which are relatively easy and fast to develop and bring to market, Tanzania's natural gas find is much more complex and will lead to a much longer-term project.  This will require different and careful handling, together with our partner, the government of Tanzania. </p><h4>Have those complexities impacted the development of these projects?</h4><p>This project is technically challenging, but for companies such as Shell and Statoil it is our bread and butter. We often talk in our business about “below-the-ground" risks and “above-the-ground" risks. We are excellent at managing below the ground risks: we know how to develop these reservoirs, we know how to run pipelines across the sea bottom, and we know how to build a world class LNG plant. For us, the major challenges so far have been or are related to the above ground risks, notably the legal, fiscal, and regulatory framework. </p><h4>What are the key priorities you would like to see addressed in this project's plan?</h4><p>In order to develop these large offshore volumes, we need economies of scale, and the only thing that provides that is an LNG export project. While the domestic gas market in Tanzania has been growing, with more gas being used for electricity generation and some industrial customers being connected over the years, gas demand is still comparatively small, especially when taking into account the economies of scale needed for developing these expensive offshore deep-water reserves. The contracts of the government call for a share of the gas to be available for the domestic market, which we will comply with, but what we can make available is much more than the current market demand. Moreover, gas-based petrochemical products such as fertilizer, ammonia, and methanol only work economically if they use very low-cost feed gas, and for various reasons, Tanzania's gas does not fit this bill. This all leads to the necessity of developing the LNG export project. </p><h4>What efforts are being made in Tanzania to build human resource capacity, and what is Shell's contribution on this front?</h4><p>Capacity building is a major focus area for us. Shell supports education in Tanzania at several levels, from supporting secondary schools and vocational training programs, particularly in the south, all the way to supporting academic education through the provision of scholarships and our partnership with the University of Dar es Salaam. We are particularly proud of our long-term support for the Young Scientists Awards Program in partnership with the Irish government. </p><h4>What is the importance of Tanzania's role for Shell in the region?</h4><p>We are good at developing large and highly complex projects such as Tanzania's integrated LNG project; and are well aware that this is a long game. We know that once this project gets off the ground, further developments will be unlocked, particularly in domestic gas and further exploration. Shell is a much-diversified company and also has a “new energies" arm, which is interested in Tanzania in terms of renewables, since we see considerable potential too on that front. In summary, we want to be here for the long-term and succeed, which means there is work to do in the meantime.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[go-north-young-man]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your most recent upstream projects?</h4><p>TPDC is currently in the appraisal stage for discoveries made in 2010. The government formed a negotiating team to work on our LNG projects in 2016. Since then, we have hosted a series of meetings with international oil companies (IOCs) to agree on the corporate governance and administrative elements of these endeavors. On the technical side, after some investigation by the IOCs, we have earmarked an area of focus, Likong'o in Lindi, and preparations are now underway. There is much to consider: feasibility studies, investigations into environmental impacts, compensation assessments, and land ownership nuances, among others. Currently 50-60% of the national grid is supplied by gas; therefore, TPDC and its partners are a cornerstone of the nation's economy. </p><h4>What opportunities are there for investing in the planned expansion of the Mtwara-Dar es Salaam natural gas pipeline?</h4><p>Tanzania's recent power problems are common knowledge. In 2011, the ongoing power shortage led the government to construct a pipeline to join gas from different fields, facilitating supply and balancing distribution. The first phase was the Mtwara-Dar es Salaam length of pipeline, a 551-km stretch, supplying over 300MW of power that was completed in September 2015. It has been so successful that there are plans to branch out across the country. With planned expansions, delivery capacity could increase to 1,000MW. </p><h4>Which areas will be the first priorities for this planned distribution expansion?</h4><p>Firstly, we have plans to connect between 30-40km in the north. Following that, we will look toward entering the cities of Mkuranga, Tanga, and Morogoro, important industrial hubs in the region. We also plan to ferry gas up-country by using CNG cars. </p><h4>What strategies does TPDC have in place to fully exploit the commercial potential of downstream operations?</h4><p>We have divided Tanzania into four areas. Firstly, there is the southern region of Mtwara and Lindi, in which we are about to complete a study on the best way to leverage commercial potential. The second area is Dar es Salaam. Here, we are currently connected to about 45 industries, but we want to boost this number to over 100, since between 50 and 70% of the government's revenues from industry come from Dar es Salaam. By YE2017, we will have divided Dar es Salaam itself into four sub-regions and will have put in place measures to link up interested parties with TPDC to fast-track development. The third is the coastal region, the fastest growing in the country in terms of industry. We are already making inroads, and by YE2017, we are aiming to give access to gas to 12 more industries. </p><h4>How will TPDC marry the need to fast-track projects through PPPs while remaining protective of local content? </h4><p>A new statute was introduced in 2015, which includes local content regulations and has been a great help for TPDC. Our first test will be the Dar es Salaam project, for which we are currently working on our PPP model. We have started in some areas, for example, that are connected to industries engaged in pre-financing for projects. One of the main challenges we face is the capital-intensive nature of gas projects. It is always a question of obtaining the right balance between seeking partners to reach our goals, while ensuring we keep Tanzania's best interests at heart. </p><h4>What are the key targets and objectives for TPDC over the next 10 years?</h4><p>The first thing we did was to embed a clause for capacity building and training into all of our contracts. This has been effective for the past 20 years or so, helping people benefit in the long run from the success of Tanzania's energy sector. Educational institutions are on board with this, offering scholarships, opening courses, and options for those wishing to widen their knowledge in the sector. We have a collaboration program with a Norwegian university that has proven a resounding success.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Britam's performance over the past year?</h4><p>In 2016, we focused on finalizing the rebranding of Britam. This included the re-launch of our Arusha branch, which we completed at the end of 2016. Since the start of 2017, we have placed increasing emphasis on driving innovation. We had indicated to the industry that we will lead in terms of product innovation and have lived up to this claim, namely coming up with new products that are better suited for the market. In 2017, we have launched two products: Britam Travel and Prestige Motor Insurance, a product targeted at high-end motor vehicles. We launched Britam Health on May 30, 2017. This is an inpatient-only corporate product targeted at SMEs and corporations with more than 10 employees. </p><h4>What is Britam doing to harness increasing opportunities among the growing middle class, SMEs, and the manufacturing segment?</h4><p>In terms of SMEs, we still expect business to grow in spite of a couple of challenges from this year, the last due to liquidity issues in the market. Banks have not been lending as they used to in the past, and that has had a direct impact on the SME sector, which depends on small loans from the banking industry. Banks' reluctance to lend, coupled with the liquidity squeeze in the market, has taken its toll on many small businesses. </p><h4>How do you use innovation to reach out to Tanzania's large uninsured population? </h4><p>At the moment, we are working with an external provider to develop a platform that will enable us to sell some of our products online from a smartphone. We have already worked on an application that we will launch shortly. We want to use the app to sell products such as motor insurance, home insurance, and possibly travel insurance. Agriculture is still a key area of focus for us. The lead time required to roll out a product in agriculture is longer than in other sectors, because the right partners are needed in the development of such an offering specifically designed to take care of the concerns of farmers. </p><h4>How does technology change your product portfolio at Britam?</h4><p>We basically run our business internally on technology platforms; this is how we manage most of our processes and products. The Britam Group is currently working on a project to upgrade its core systems. This will enable us to improve our interface with partners, be they brokers, agents, or even clients. This has been in the pipeline for the last two years or so, and we have already rolled out the ERP module. We expect to be able to roll out some aspects of this upgrade in the coming months. This will allow clients to access some of our functions, like claims. </p><h4>What are your targets for 2017, and how do you see these being met?</h4><p>In terms of the outlook, the year has started fairly well. We have ambitious targets for 2017, particularly because of the expectation that the new regime would have settled in and there would be some infrastructure spending by the government. The private sector also needs to adapt to the style of the new government; however, we believe that is happening now and things are beginning to pick up speed again. This is why our expectations are high for 2017. So far, we have seen the first signs of success. That being said, we are still awaiting more movement on the ground. The government has not yet released funds into the economy in terms of spending and infrastructure. It is taking some time, though we expect this credit squeeze to ease going into the later part of the year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can TIRA harness and expand Tanzania's already growing microinsurance industry?</h4><p>There are two things to flag here: the first relies on TIRA encouraging as many enterprises, business communities, and insurance companies as possible to expand their products to microinsurance. The second factor is public education and awareness about the usefulness and importance of insurance coverage. If we can achieve both objectives, then we can resolve both problems of supply and demand for microinsurance. In addition, we should tweak our regulatory involvement to provide more incentives for institutions that sell microinsurance serving the lower-income end of the population.</p><h4>What are the challenges the insurance sector faces in terms of putting in place solid healthcare insurance solutions?</h4><p>It is a government initiative to have universal health insurance cover in Tanzania, and TIRA supports these efforts wholeheartedly. We seek to coordinate those areas of health coverage that the public sector cannot serve. This supplemental role is important because we know different people have different health coverage needs, and private institutions can find a way to serve the community at large. One of the challenges that has come to my attention is that there is a problem with the pricing of healthcare facilities and services. Most health insurance companies complain about the sustainability of health insurance funds, as there is currently no price control mechanism, particularly when it comes to certain diagnoses and the prices of drugs. </p><h4>What impact could a successful universal healthcare coverage scheme have on the industry?</h4><p>Using insurance as the financing model for healthcare services will significantly boost awareness of what insurance entails, something we need in the private sector. If the public understands health insurance, it is much easier to understand other types of insurance; thus, the industry will grow. Secondly, there are certain categories of clients that will go beyond universal health coverage. While primary healthcare services are completely financed by the universal healthcare scheme, the next layer of coverage will go to the private sector, where people will purchase private health insurance. Therefore, successful healthcare will improve peoples' wellbeing and increase productivity and the need for different categories with private insurers.</p><h4>What are the key pillars of the TIRA's strategy to increase insurance awareness, leading, eventually, to greater market penetration?</h4><p>We do public awareness work through our National Insurance Education Strategy, which we have shared with every stakeholder and for which we have received support from various institutions. The National Insurance Education Strategy comprises three major areas of intervention. The first is to provide awareness education to journalists in Tanzania so that they can pass on their understanding to the public at large. The second is through the education system—primary, secondary, and tertiary—for which we work alongside the Minister of Education. The third part of our strategy targets the general public through the usual public awareness programs. We also highly encourage insurers to design public education programs and increase corporate social responsibility. </p><h4>What will TIRA do in the coming year to ensure that the insurance industry grows alongside other sectors?</h4><p>The approval and implementation of National Insurance Policy will spearhead the growth of the insurance industry here. One of the salient features of this policy is the expansion of insurance products, at least in part at the urging of coordinated efforts from both public and private institutions. Part of our mandate is to see business entities working without fear and interference from unregulated entities. If clients' expectations are not being met, we will face problems. As a regulator, we will thus be strict in terms of market and professional conduct. We will register all insurance experts in Tanzania and monitor their behavior in terms of how they treat customers. We can then de-register an expert or company from the insurance business if they engage in malpractice. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Low-Hanging Fruits of Finance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-low-hanging-fruits-of-finance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main factors leading to the recent success of the DSE?</h4><p>In 1Q2017, we made great advances, the result of efficiencies in investing our financial resources in relatively high-return financial instruments. Indeed, the balance sheet improved significantly from July 2016 following our IPO, the funds from which were invested in short-term financial assets. We have also earned significant income from listing activities, especially on fixed-income instruments. On the transaction income front, things have slowed somewhat, with a decline in trading activity in the market, for both fundamental as well as sentimental reasons. Total market capital-to-GDP ratio is still less than 20% of GDP. We recorded 7.2% growth in GDP in 2016; however, that was not reflected in the market cap—actually there was a drop in the listed companies' market cap despite the growth in GDP. </p><h4>What diversified financial instruments does the DSE plan to roll out to create a more robust financial portfolio for the country?</h4><p>The government's five-year development plan, and its emphasis on industrialization and human development will require considerable financial resources that can be mobilized in both the public and private sectors, either domestically or with foreign capital. It is estimated that in five years the economy has to mobilize close to TZS107 trillion for spending on capital investment on development plans, programs, and projects. Part of those funds will come from FDI; however, a significant part will also come from the local market. These funds will partly emanate from actions taken both from the fiscal side and from the monetary side. This is where the DSE comes in. Our role is to create an environment in which the government as well as private enterprises will see the benefit of using the capital market for mobilization of savings, and invest them productively in our economic development.</p><h4>What is the timeframe for offloading these instruments onto the market?</h4><p>There are almost 15 of these instruments we have in mind, and we thus need a staggered approach. The low-hanging fruit—which will focus on consolidating what we have already—includes enhancing issuance, liquidity, and performance of the existing cash-based products such as equities and bonds. The next stage is to enable lower-income individuals to participate in specific sectors, such as real estate development through the issuance of REITs or other specific sector via issuance of crowd funding products, and collective investment schemes that are subsequently listed in the stock market. For this, we need to work on the regulatory framework and fiscal incentives in order for these kinds of products to gain the necessary traction and appetite. </p><h4>What has been the impact of the obligatory listings for mining companies and telecoms on the DSE?</h4><p>The Electronic and Postal Communication Act (EPOCA) of 2010 was amended by the Finance Act of 2016, while the Mining Act of 2010, whose regulations in relations to conducting IPOs and listings were issued in October 2016, was then amended in February 2017. These require companies in these strategic sectors such as telecommunications and mining to offload 25% and 30% of their shares, respectively, to the public. These pieces of legislation have four key objectives. The first is economic empowerment and financial inclusion. There is no point of having GDP growth of 7% and above while the majority of citizens are excluded from it. The second objective is to facilitate the growth of the local capital market industry. Currently, the latter is not deep or liquid enough to be attractive for private enterprises or industrialists to consider raising capital or using it as an exit mechanism. The third objective is to encourage more transparency in Tanzania's corporate world. The fourth is increasing competition in the market in the long term, boosting tax revenue for the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Stone To Corner]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-stone-to-corner]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of your Tanzanian operations for your overall African footprint?</h4><p>BancABC operates in six sub-Saharan African countries. In Tanzania itself, we are a relatively small in terms of the banking playing field; however, we have the strategic intent to grow our business quite significantly in the foreseeable future. At present, we have five branches, though our focus is not necessarily to develop a brick-and-mortar setup. It has become almost prohibitively expensive for a commercial bank to roll out greenfield brick-and-mortar operations; therefore, we are turning to alternative channels, rolling out agency banking concepts and mobile banking applications, and strengthening a loan distribution network of about 100 loan centers out in the country, with nine zonal offices. Owing to this platform, and other innovations, we have been able to successfully compete in the market, banking around 45,000 retail consumer customers based on our distribution network, which we intend to roll out and grow.</p><h4>How are these strategies tailored to the Tanzanian market in particular?</h4><p>It is critical to be ahead of the game. In the MNO space, for example, records show that for the first time total turnover in the mobile banking space has exceeded that of the formal banking sector. This means partnerships with MNOs are critical. Some have already partnered with larger banks, meaning smaller players have to think differently. In that space, we have excelled through our alternative channels, where we have developed a prepaid card that links into a mobile banking application, and this allows customers to do wallet-to-bank and bank-to-wallet transactions. </p><h4>In line with this strategy, how are you working to strengthen the BancABC brand in Tanzania?</h4><p>As a relatively small player in the market, our approach to obtaining brand recognition has to be carefully thought out. We have to focus on specifics, which we have been successful doing over the last year. In the past year, we have been successful in the digital marketing space, where we have worked with Google, Facebook, and Instagram to garner between 9 and 12 million hits and views.</p><h4>What are the challenges of banking in emerging markets, in particular Tanzania?</h4><p>Many make the mistake of imposing a large corporation attitude on an emerging market. While it is important to consider the governance and compliance agenda, if this is pushed too strongly in emerging markets, it can derail any possibility of significant growth in these markets. There are a number of large international banks in Tanzania, Mozambique, and Zambia that have not seen any significant growth or have in fact regressed. Our way of approaching emerging markets is to remain nimble and react quickly, especially when it comes to decision making. The commodity crisis in the last few years has significantly impacted the Sub-Saharan African market. What is more, it had the opportunity to take advantage of the regional conditions to supply to the East African market. </p><h4>How successful has the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) been in regulating this environment?</h4><p>I have a great deal of respect for the central bank. The governor has always been a pragmatic ally of the financial services sector, and we enjoy close ties and strong collaboration. BOT has worked well with other banks in terms of bringing down interest rates. The one-year rate has come down from levels of 16-17% to 9%. There is also the drive to develop, along with the World Bank, the mortgage market in the country, an area that can be a cornerstone for financial stability, with the potential to unlock equity from real estate to develop the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania maintains the lowest inflation rate in the East African Region. What measures has the BOT successfully put in place to achieve this?</h4><p>Headline inflation in Tanzania averaged 5.6% in 2015 and 5.2% in 2016, which is within the medium-term target of 5% and the East African Community's (EAC) ceiling target of 8%. In June 2017, headline inflation was 5.4%, the lowest in the East African Region. Throughout the period, core inflation was anchored below 3%. This strong performance is largely attributed to excellent macroeconomic policies, a tight monetary policy stance pursued by the bank, and sustained stability of the nominal exchange rate against major currencies, complemented by other prudential measures to ensure the appropriate level of liquidity in the economy. The observed stability was further supported by improvement in food supply in the region, subdued global oil prices, and fiscal consolidation.</p><h4>What are your inflation targets for the coming year?</h4><p>Inflation is forecasted to remain a single digit and around the medium-term target of 5% in the coming year. This outlook is based on the projected favorable food supply situation, the stability of the shilling exchange rate against major currencies, and subdued global oil prices. Good weather has brought to an end the food supply shortage that had prevailed in the Southern Africa region, thus lowering the risk regional inflation pressure. The Bank of Tanzania will continue to implement prudent monetary policy to sustain the general macroeconomic stability.</p><h4>What initiatives has the BOT been undertaking to boost international commerce and attract FDI to Tanzania?</h4><p>The bank has been undertaking a number of initiatives aimed at boosting international trade. One such initiative is the establishment of export credit guarantee scheme. The scheme provides guarantees to commercial banks for credits extended to exporters. A number of projects have benefited from the scheme, including the Kagera Sugar Company, which secured a loan for extension of its production capacity to meet the demand for sugar in both domestic and export markets. With regard to FDI, the bank, in collaboration with National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC), monitors all FDI inflows in the country. The monitoring is done through periodic surveys, where all the information concerning the type, magnitude, direction, and composition of FDI are captured. The survey provides recommendations on investment promotion policies and strategies.</p><h4>How are you working alongside the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment to help shape policy frameworks on this front?</h4><p>The BOT does work with the Ministry of Industry and Trade in developing and supporting policies designed to boost international commerce. For instance, the bank organizes dissemination workshops for stakeholders including the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment to share the results and policy recommendations for appropriate policy formulation. Implementation of some of the recommendations falls within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role would you like to see the Central Bank playing in Tanzania to mitigate the drop in growth?</h4><p>By lowering the statutory minimum reserve requirement, the Central Bank has clearly loosened the monetary policy stance, responding to the growth of monetary aggregates that have been below the Central Bank's targets. One of the factors that used to drive the growth of monetary policy aggregates in Tanzania was the inflow of foreign assistance, borrowing on capital markets, and syndicated loans, all of which generated funds that were then intermediated into the economy. This inflow of foreign exchange has slowed down significantly in the last couple of years. It is interesting that this has not only happened in Tanzania; there is a similar pattern with many other countries in East Africa. In Tanzania, there was a need to to reverse the slowdown in the growth of monetary aggregates. Reducing the statutory minimum reserve requirements is one way to do this. The central bank has also reduced some of the interest rates under its control.</p><h4>What is the motivation behind the IMF's calls for the Bank of Tanzania to modernize its monetary policy framework?</h4><p>A modern monetary policy framework will allow for more efficient monetary policy implementation, and I should note this is the Tanzanian monetary authority's objective. We merely provide advice to allow a smooth transition, although we do consider this to be an appropriate objective for a country like Tanzania. A modern monetary policy framework entails the use of price-based indicators, namely the interest rate, to achieve an inflation target, the ultimate monetary policy objective, rather than by trying to control the quantity of monetary aggregates. The reason for this is that the relation between the growth of monetary aggregates and inflation is quite volatile and working directly with an inflation target and interest rates to achieve that is more efficient. Under this framework the central bank announces its medium-term target level of inflation and then uses changes in the policy rate and a public communications strategy to guide the public about the central bank's views on the stance of monetary policy. It then demonstrates clearly what it stands ready to do through the policy rate it sets and the open market operations it conducts to ensure that rate guides all other interest rates in the economy.</p><h4>What is your view of Tanzania's credit situation?</h4><p>Some of the project finance loans that have been finalized will start flowing into the country now. The government has been working on a syndicated loan for some time and there are strong indications that this money will come in towards the end of the 2016/2017 financial year. The IMF also advocates that the government get a Eurobond credit rating as this would broaden its opportunities to borrow. The IMF's 2016 assessment of Tanzania's debt situation is that it is at low risk of debt distress. It has opportunities to borrow, and use this money to build up infrastructure. On the other side, credit to the private sector has been declining significantly. Part of that may be due to liquidity in the economy; however, with the economy entering a soft patch, banks have fewer good opportunities to lend to businesses. There is perhaps a little more banks can do to actively source new lending opportunities given the many businesses that have huge needs for capital. As the economy emerges from the soft patch it will create greater opportunities for banks to lend as well. Meanwhile, the reduction in the statutory minimum reserve requirements has eased some of the pressures on liquidity. The government has been borrowing much less and that too should have freed up liquidity for the banks to lend. I do believe that banks' excess reserves indicate that they do have resources available to lend. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the principal mission of the council, and how does it work to achieve this?</h4><p>The TNBC was established by presidential decree in 2001 and was first formed in 2002 as a way of bringing together the government and private sector to discuss how best to support the private sector in the country. When we moved from a central economy to a market-led economy, it was decided that the private sector would be the engine of the economy and the government the facilitator. When his Excellency President John Pombe Magufuli came to power in 2015, as the Chairman of the Council he appointed the third council, which was inaugurated in April, that met for the 10th TNBC meeting. The council has 40 members: 18 from the private sector, representing sub sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and others; the labor union; government ministries; the governor of the Bank of Tanzania; and prominent members from academia. The purpose of the council first and foremost is to brainstorm how best to improve the business environment and competitiveness of this country, lowering the costs of doing business, enabling the growth of medium and small businesses, as well as larger companies, and ultimately attracting more foreign and domestic investment. A foreign investor will always ask a domestic investor about business in Tanzania; therefore, it is important to improve conditions for those companies that are already here.</p><h4>What was on the agenda at the 10th TNBC meeting?</h4><p>We had three main agenda points: Tanzania's business environment, private sector participation in industrialization, and strengthening the links between agriculture and industrialization. On the former, we tackled several different challenges that active businesses currently face, including a lack of access to land and underdeveloped human capital. On the latter two issues, we looked closely at how to fill in the gaps in our agricultural production, through irrigation projects, greater availability of fertilizer, improved small scale and commercial farmer linkages, and the best possible methods of value addition in agriculture. Elsewhere, we also discussed opportunities in tourism, currently contributing 17.5% to the GDP, with the potential to contribute much more. Currently, we welcome 2 million tourists on average each year; however, by reducing the costs for tourists entering the country—through more competitive rates for transportation and accommodation—we could double or even quadruple that number. On this front, we explored the various ways to fast track the improvements planned for Air Tanzania.</p><h4>What was the response from the public sector regarding progress made to these ends?</h4><p>Prime Minster Hon Kassim Majaliwa directed Tanzania Port Authority to have 24 hours operations to increase efficiency and reduce congestion at the port. The various ministers present at the council meeting reported on the respective progress made. At the moment, the Ministry of Land is working to expedite titling procedures, both for investment and housing. The Ministry of Agriculture revealed plans for the bulk procurement of fertilizer to minimize costs while the Ministry of Local Government explained how it will link small traders with the appropriate infrastructure, designating spaces for marketeering complete with all the necessary facilities.</p><h4>What about the private sector?</h4><p>It takes two to tango, and the private sector also has a role to play. When we talk about economic corruption, often there is a preconception that the fault lies mostly with the public sector. However, it behooves the private sector as well to tackle corruption in Tanzania. Private businesses have benefited from the fifth government's tackling of corruption, bureaucracy, and the cost of doing business. At the end of the meeting, the chairman requested that TNBC prepare the matrix relating to the various concerns raised by the private sector that came under discussion, as well as allocate chief responsibilities and confirm the timeframe for completion. The 10th TNBC meeting was a great success as it reaffirmed the commitment of the fifth government phase of private-sector development in Tanzania. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do changes to the membership mix at the BBG say about recent developments in Tanzania's business environment?</h4><p>The BBG has developed a strong presence in Tanzania over the past decade, with: a coastal chapter based in Dar es Salaam and a northern one in Arusha. In the latter our membership comprises companies dealing mainly in the tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, transport, and mining sectors, while more multinationals are based in Dar es Salaam, and these make up the majority of our coastal chapter membership. In total, we have around 250 members. In general, we see more turnaround in the coastal chapter, with expats coming in and leaving. There is less movement in the northern chapter and many of our members are familiar faces in the business community. Our members learn about changes to the business environment through our planned events such as breakfast meetings or special events. Every year in May we host a trade fair for our members to promote their businesses and do business with BBG members. We also host “hot topics“ from which our members can benefit. As a result of our successful and informative activities for our members, we have seen membership growing.</p><h4>What factors have recently impacted the business environment?</h4><p>One major challenge affecting members is the illiquidity of the market. This has impacted us all over the past one to two years: we see fewer new entrants while more established businesses witness diminishing growth or in some cases are forced to restructure to survive. In particular, we have seen customer-facing companies most impacted, including in the telecommunications, FMCG, services, and tourism sectors. This last sector has also been impacted following the introduction of additional taxes. Having said that, we have also seen positive responses to this situation from local industries, since imports have reduced and in-house manufacturers have seen a resulting uptake in sales.</p><h4>What approaches should be employed to facilitate business growth?</h4><p>From a private-sector point of view, it is important for businesses to push innovation. Consumers are not going anywhere; they are just changing their patterns, habits, and where they spend their money. They will continue to purchase things. Thinking innovatively in the market, trying to predict customers' actions, and staying ahead of the game; these are the secrets to success in the face of adversity. Many businesses in Tanzania are heading down this route, seeking to do things differently. Making products more accessible at lower costs helps us drive the top line. From the public sector, we need to see continued emphasis on private-public engagement. We need to create an environment that breeds openness and trust, which will provide a welcome predictability to the business world. If new regulations come into play, then these should be publicized at an early stage in order for companies to be prepared.</p><h4>How do you view the recent announcement that around 47% of the current budget will be dedicated to infrastructure projects?</h4><p>If the government succeeds in sourcing financing for all its infrastructure projects, it could create an enormous boost for the economy. Infrastructure is a pillar for growth in any economy. If we can access funds and deliver those projects, then such development will definitely take Tanzania to a different level. The confidence has to be in securing access to funds to be able to execute these projects.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the growth of Tanzania's economy?<br></h4><p>The BBG remains optimistic, because it is clear that the intent of the reforms to Tanzania's business environment is positive. Furthermore, the bottom line that Tanzania is ripe for investment still holds true. All the resources and the population—which is growing every year—are there. There is potentially a healthy middle class that can contribute more to the economy. All the ingredients for success are there; it is matter of having the right policies to enable the country to grow to its potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which strategic investment opportunities in Tanzania has the TIC been championing over the past year?</h4><p>Tanzania is going through a transitional period, and, as such, TIC has spotted areas where we can make reforms, increasing incentives and overall investment figures, and is taking the necessary measures to do so. The priority areas to attract investment, singled out in the government's Five-Year Development Plan 2016-2020/2021, are in manufacturing, particularly in agricultural processing, textiles, cotton, and leather products, as well as building materials, following the recent rise of the construction sector. We have the resources and raw materials, so it is just a question of the value addition. Finally, we have strong links with neighboring countries and TIC recognizes the importance of maintaining this and forging new ties to establish channels of commerce and enable us to come together as a region and create one robust market.</p><h4>How are you specifically tackling the issue of land legislation, which has proved difficult for foreign investors to navigate in the past?</h4><p>Just recently, TIC held an extensive and intensive discussion with the Commissioner for Lands. Our aim is to enhance the powers of the land officers stationed at TIC, which provides all the necessary land processing services under One Stop facilitation Centre within TIC. We are also establishing a joint land-auditing program to identify parcels of land not in use; therefore, we can make it available for investors. The idea is to have this available land formalized and ready for use, so that when an investor expresses an interest, we are able to accommodate within a matter of days. Moreover, we have plans to put in place a “landbank“ fund that will help raise finances for conducting land surveys and compensating locals who own land that has been earmarked for investment.</p><h4>What is being done at an institutional level to ensure policy and regulatory stability?</h4><p>The TIC works hard to connect various governmental ministry departments and agencies with investors in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page, and that transparency reigns supreme in all business transactions. TIC is interested in being an advisor in the investment policy in the country. We have been providing advice straight to the government to address all matters related to business environment. TIC also monitors and garners the necessary data from the business community, and we make this data readily available so that it can better inform policy decisions. We work with key stakeholders, such as the Tanzania National Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) and the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) to ensure that they too are on board with all procedural changes. Finally, we recently established the National Investment Facilitation Committee, a meeting place for CEOs and commissioners of all institutions to sit down and discuss how best to streamline business procedure in the country, registration, issuance of approvals and permits, and so on. TIC is also establishing a National Investment Promotion Committee for undertaking a coordinated promotional effort.</p><h4>What is your outlook and your major areas of focus for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have tried to reform internally and also associate the reforms with the institutions that are participating in the One Stop Facilitation Centre. We need to research, promote, and make investors confident to come and stay in the country. We are planning to launch our online investment window called Tanzania Investment Window (TIW) to radically reduce application forms in a friendlier manner. We have decided to increase our presence at the zonal level in upcountry regions so that we can collaborate with district councils and local authorities in addressing investor challenges and acquire land for investment. Therefore, we have decided to strengthen our regional offices around the country in all the main zones, as well as open three more branches to create an environment where an investor's sole focus can be on its core objective of productivity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the objectives of the ministry's strategic economic policy?</h4><p>The ministry has adopted economic diplomacy in recent years to respond to the reality of the international economy. As well as reaching out to other governments for economic development, it has become vital to reach out to the business community for direct investment, dealing not just with other governments and government agencies, but also with economic institutions like the IMF and emerging economic actors and individuals. It is an approach geared to deal with these new realities, committing resources to enhance our economic standing and increase our access to opportunities in the international arena. In particular, such diplomacy has to be directed toward two areas. The first is to ensure that we reshape our economic performance domestically along these lines, promoting a competitive economy and embracing the private sector. The second is to publicize the fact that Tanzania is ready to engage with its own private sector as partners to enable the private sector from overseas to come and work on collaborative projects. This includes making room for PPPs.</p><h4>What must be done to ensure that economic integration in the EAC acts in favor of the interests of each and every Tanzanian citizen?</h4><p>Bilateral, national-oriented development cannot be complete without regional integration. East Africa has gone through painful experiences: political differences, fractures in our community, conflict, and ideological clashes. The common services—railways, harbors, the postal system, telecoms, and even the monetary system—that we inherited after liberalization broke down, and we wound up establishing national services. All these are behind us now, fortunately. However, we still need to find a new way of harmonizing, which proves to be difficult. We need these national services to be synchronized in terms of regulatory provisions. That being said, the lynchpin of the new common market is economic trade and investment. We started with the customs union and are now advanced in the common market, heading toward a monetary union. There may be hurdles along the way—as we see with the EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), for instance—but we hope the benefits of economic integration will incrementally become more evident. We may have to readdress the way in which our communities interact to counter any possible imbalances, and it may not take the form of the federation we know. At the recent EAC summit, we discussed fundamental issues such as non-tariff barriers and the aspects of infrastructure that should be coordinated. There are the northern, central, and southern corridors to consider in terms of issues related to energy and resource sharing. It is also too early to tell how the outside world will respond to this proposal for increased integration. Regarding the EPA, we have yet to iron out the difficulties, and it is still clear that some of the agreements are favorable to Kenya as a much more advanced economy and do not necessarily benefit other nations to the same extent. However, we remain open to discussions, and while the timing is not right yet, this will be a vital moment for the EAC to define a new approach to cooperation with Europe</p><h4>What policies is the ministry implementing to ensure that safety and security are a key priority in Tanzania and the region?</h4><p>Tanzania takes its humanitarian responsibilities seriously. We have received refugees from nearby states like Rwanda since 1959, before independence, throughout the liberation movement, and during the Great Lakes crisis. We still receive and host refugees as part of our international obligation. We have an important role that we must continue to play in conflict resolution and promoting peace and stability in the region. The role we have particularly in maintaining and facilitating the resolution of conflict is an extension of our own independence and stability. That is why we swore a dedicated commitment to the UN to operate peacekeeping operations in Sudan, the DRC, and Jordan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the mutual benefits of Tanzania's membership in the EAC?</h4><p>The United Republic of Tanzania is one of the founding partner states of the EAC. Tanzania is also the home to a number of pioneer African nationalists and Pan-Africanists, foremost among whom is the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere. Pan-Africanism is important in this context, because the EAC and other regional economic communities in Africa are all part of the African Union's overarching plan to form an African economic community by the year 2063. Tanzania, the second-largest economy in the region, has also played a crucial role in promoting political liberation and stability not just in East Africa but Africa as a whole. The EAC is, therefore, richer with Tanzania as a partner state.</p><h4>What has been the impact, in real terms, thus far of the EAC's economic integration process, gaining momentum now for well over a decade?</h4><p>In April 2016, the community attained international recognition as the fastest-growing regional economic community in Africa. This acclaim is a result of the major achievements in terms of the integration that the EAC has attained in the recent past. For example, the EAC is now implementing a single customs territory, which means goods are cleared only once at the entry point. This has resulted in the drastic reduction of the period taken to clear goods from over 20 days to three to four days on the central corridor; from 21 days to four days between Mombasa and Kampala; and from 18 days to six days to Kigali on the northern corridor. Also, of the 15 borders earmarked to operate as one-stop border posts, 11 have now been completed. Similarly, we are now in a common market, with free movement of people, goods, and capital. Laws have already been enacted in our partner states to ensure that citizens enjoy these freedoms, moving and trading freely.</p><h4>What obstacles do you foresee along the way to achieving a monetary union between EAC member states?</h4><p>A high degree of economic convergence is important for individual countries planning to form a monetary union. This aspect is also important for the stability of the monetary union once formed. The loss of national monetary and exchange rate policies by individual partner states after the formation of a monetary union, and the likely constraints on national fiscal policy in the single currency area underline the importance of starting from a position in which such a loss of national discretion in macroeconomic policy can easily be borne and will not outweigh the benefit of introducing a single currency. The major challenge on the road to a monetary union is the fact that the economies of the EAC partner states are too divergent to guarantee a stable monetary union. The macroeconomic numbers for countries like South Sudan and Burundi, for example, are extremely different compared to that of Kenya. In order to promote economic convergence, EAC partner states have agreed on a set of four primary convergence criteria that must be attained and maintained for at least three years before joining the monetary union: a ceiling on headline inflation of 8%, reserve cover of 4.5 months of import, ceiling on the overall deficit of 3% of GDP, including grants, and a ceiling on gross public debt of 50% of GDP in net present value terms. Another challenge is the slow progress that is being made in establishing the key institutions to support the monetary union. For example, according to the East African Monetary Union (EAMU) roadmap, the East African Monetary Institute was supposed to be established by December 2015. However, this was not possible, partly due to the lengthy process of decision making of the community as stipulated in the EAC Treaty and also because some sectoral councils do not meet as frequently as required. The secretariat is doing its best to ensure adherence to the calendar of meetings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the mutual benefits of Tanzania's involvement in the Commonwealth of Nations?</h4><p>There are many ways the 52 member nations of the Commonwealth benefit across trade, law, the environment, and society in general. The historical ties and shared legal structures of Commonwealth members make it, on average, 19% cheaper for member countries to trade with each other. We pledged to work in closer partnership with the African Development Bank Group on areas such as climate change, natural disasters, equality and gender, rule of law, good governance, and youth unemployment. We agreed to develop and implement an outcomes-focused MoU on joint programs that will lead to real and tangible differences to the lives of Commonwealth citizens. In 2015, we deployed a Commonwealth Observer Group, headed by Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, former president of Nigeria, to observe the Tanzanian electoral process, and make recommendations for continuing to implement improvements in the delivery of free and fair elections. In addition, the Commonwealth Secretariat provides technical support to member countries with the aim of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and fair and equitable development for all. This includes assistance on trade, climate change, rule of law, and governance, among others.</p><h4>How do you strike a balance between encouraging English for ease of doing business and championing national languages for nationwide civic inclusivity?</h4><p>We celebrate diversity across the Commonwealth, and, as a key part of this, a rich variety of languages and dialects should be embraced. However, we should not forget that English is the most widely spoken language across the Commonwealth, and this is reflected in the many model laws, publications, and reports that the Secretariat publishes. A common language can only help the Commonwealth become more inclusive for the common good and enable countries to share best practices. The common language spoken across the Commonwealth also contributes to the "Commonwealth advantage," which is the benefit that results from similarities in language, law, and institutions when trade occurs between member countries.</p><h4>Given that the Commonwealth of Nations is actively involved in advising its members on stable and fair trade deals, what is your assessment of the ongoing discussions regarding the EAC-EU EPA?</h4><p>The Commonwealth is built on the twin pillars of democracy and development. Trade is an important area, in which we constantly work with our members to advance their development. We do this through supporting them to have the appropriate policy and legal frameworks, such as national trade policies and export strategies; supporting them on trade facilitation; and concluding trade agreements with partners. What is most important is that Tanzania and its partners in East Africa are able to come to a consensus on what is best for them as countries and as a region. The EAC is an important regional integration entity that makes advances in several areas. The region has always shown itself able to rise to challenges, and, because of this, will be able to forge consensus and come to a position that takes into account the concerns of all its members.</p><h4>Compared to other member states, how do you evaluate the progress made so far by the Tanzanian government to reduce bureaucracy and crack down on corruption?</h4><p>The Secretariat's public sector governance work assists in the strengthening of anti-corruption agencies of developing member countries in the Commonwealth in order to tackle the problem more effectively and help achieve SDG 16. The annual Heads of Anti-Corruption Agencies' meeting acts as a focal point for peer review of country anti-corruption reports, and shared transferable experiences and lessons. In this, Tanzania is a founding member; it also has a comprehensive body of laws, regulations, and oversight agencies designed to prevent, investigate, and sanction corrupt practices. The legislation deals with corrupt activities at all levels. Since assuming office in November, President Magufuli has been rebuilding trust with Western organizations by cracking down on corruption. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given that an average 80% of all Burundian trade transits through the port of Dar es Salaam, what plans have been laid down to ensure a healthy and balanced trade between your country and Tanzania? </h4><p>It is true that most Burundian trade effectively transits through the port of Dar es Salaam. This is not only due to the geographical location of Burundi—a landlocked country—but also reflects the close relations and cooperation existing between the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi. Both countries understand the importance of this relationship, and constantly endeavor to widen and deepen it. In the framework of the implementation of the East African Community (EAC) Single Customs Territory, Burundi has tasked its revenue authority officers with ensuring that cargo heading to Burundi that transits through Dar es Salaam is swiftly shipped either by road up to Bujumbura through the Kobero-Kabanga One-Stop Border, or by train up to the port of Kigoma and thereafter to Burundian ports (Nyanza Lac, Rumonge, Bujumbura) via Lake Tanganyika. There are further plans to make the Isaka-Musongati-Bujumbura railway line operational in the near future. Burundi has conducted conclusive studies pertaining to safety on Lake Tanganyika, which gives ample room for both Tanzania and Burundi to take the lead in developing the Lake Tanganyika basin to enable the free movement of goods, people, services, and capital in the area to flourish, and through this uplift the standards of living in our region. To this end, Burundi has developed plans to diversify its export capabilities, and Burundian companies such as BRARUDI have started exporting their products to Tanzania. </p><h4>What makes Burundi in particular an attractive market for businesses in Tanzania and vice versa?</h4><p>The United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi have long-standing historical and cultural ties on which to premise multifaceted trading arrangements. Burundians and Tanzanians are close neighbors, both geographically and spiritually, and over the years both our peoples have developed a common understanding, as well as sharing the same vision and destiny. This shared cultural and social knowledge is critical for successful businesses.</p><h4>What will be the focus of Burundian-Tanzanian relations going forward? </h4><p>The focus of these is to strengthen and further diversify our areas of cooperation. Everything calls upon the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi to effectively implemement the EAC integration agenda, which we strongly support as a complement of what we are doing internally to raise the standards of living of East African citizens in general and the people of Tanzania and Burundi in particular. We would like to see the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Burundi take the lead in promoting Kiswahili and French through university-level cultural exchanges between teachers and students, as well as other professionals.</p><h4>What can be achieved, in real terms, for member states, through streamlined cooperation in the EAC? </h4><p>The EAC partner states have agreed on the scope of their cooperation in the framework of the EAC integration agenda in terms of political, diplomatic and judicial affairs, infrastructure, economic, social, and productive sectors. In these sectors, there is a wide range of projects and programs, which, as partner states, we need to see implemented. In concrete terms, the EAC is now operating under a single customs territory, enabling the passage of goods with reduced transport costs and travel times. What is more, since partner states now operate in the EAC single market, there is now access to 160 million consumers. Moreover, the partner states have agreed to fast-track the implementation of projects and programs so as to achieve 17 sustainable development goals. Poised both as a single customs territory and a common market that aspires to higher stages of integration—the monetary union in 2024 and ultimately the federation of East Africa—the EAC is also set to pool its higher education resources, creating better mobility for university staff and students within the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you ensure Tanzania's economic growth benefits all citizens?</h4><p>Tanzania's economy remains one of the fastest growing on the continent, with 7.2% growth recorded in 2016. An increase in monthly revenue collection, from TZS850 billion to TZS1.3 trillion, has meant that our government has been able to build non-core spending and increase development budgets from 26 to 40%. In 2016, our country adopted the Second National Five-Year Development Plan (2016/17-2020/21). The main role of this program is to transform Tanzania into a middle-income economy by 2025 through increased development and industrialization. In the midst of all of this activity, we maintain the view that civilians are the development engines worldwide. No development project has ever been successful without the integrated involvement of workers, from agricultural activities—fishing, livestock—to tourism; construction of economic infrastructure, peacekeeping and security; the provision of social services; and the evolution of science and technology. For this reason, on behalf of the government, I wish to commend all Tanzanian employees. The government recognizes the great contribution to national development that its citizens provide. We promise to continue to address the challenges faced by our people to improve the working and living environments, and ensure all citizens benefit from the fruits of their labor. In this vein, we will continue with procedures to establish solid and robust social security frameworks, such as our newly developed system of employment insurance.</p><h4>How do you describe the recent development of diplomatic relations, both domestically and internationally?</h4><p>In 2017, we celebrate 53 years of union with Zanzibar. The union has enabled us to achieve great success in the economic, political, and social sectors. Together, we have improved infrastructure in several fields, including in aviation, maritime, railway, and electrical projects. What is more, our country is internationally respected and participates meaningfully on regional, continental, and global levels. We enjoyed visits from several international leaders, including the presidents of South Africa and of several East African Community (EAC) member states. The Vice President, the Prime Minister, and myself have also taken part in several visits abroad, increasing the Republic of Tanzania's international presence. We signed several cooperative agreements in various areas and have made progress in opening several embassies abroad in countries that had previously gone unrepresented. In line with strengthening our relationship with foreign nations, we have continued to contribute positively to the various international institutions of which we are members. In 2016, we received the honor of being elected as Chairman of both the EAC and the South African Development Community (SADC) Organ for Politics, Defense and Security. Through these institutions, we have played instrumental roles in peacekeeping missions in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lesotho, and South Sudan. In addition, we will continue to implement various initiatives that have been passed at the regional and international level.</p><h4>What steps have been taken in the past few months to strengthen transport infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>During the 2015 election campaign, one of the key promises of my government was to boost transport links through improved infrastructure. The fifth phase government is determined to reduce, if not completely eliminate, traffic in Dar es Salaam. To this end, we are driving forth an agenda of alternative automotive infrastructure in the city, spearheaded by the Dar Rapid Transit System, which has been working well now for several months. In addition, we plan to implement other transport infrastructure projects, including the construction of a 7-km bridge from Aga Khan to Coco Beach, and several highways in Mwenge, Morocco, Magomeni, and Tabata. Elsewhere, we are preparing for the construction of the Dar es Salaam Outer Ring Road, due to stretch 35km around the city. For this, we have earmarked TSZ38 billion from the new budget. In line with the construction of road infrastructure, we also have ambitious plans to improve rail transport services in Dar es Salaam, vital to alleviating the congestion problems we face. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of GIG to the country?</h4><p>In our 50-year history, our tradition of ingenuity and promoting entrepreneurial values has driven continuous improvement and our growth reflects the energy and innovation that GIG has applied to identify and utilize new opportunities. GIG is a privately owned family business. The public recognizes us via our sustainable development, market leadership, trusted brands, and a commitment to our ethical and social responsibilities. In 1989, GIG had 34 employees and sold around USD1 million. Today, we have more than 16,000 people working at GIG, and our sales are around USD2 billion, which illustrates the incredible growth over the past decades. Annually, our workforce has grown by more than 25%. We are a market leader in certain categories of personal care, home care, and cosmetics. Moreover, we have been able to achieve market leadership in certain categories of the business segments that GIG has recently entered. GIG manages more than 40 brands and, as a holding company, owns and manages over 70 companies. Altogether, our 14 strategic business units sell over 1 billion product units per year in 80 product categories. We manage the largest distribution channel in Iran with six distribution companies, and manage, own, and sell our products in over 1,300 cities in Iran and around the world.</p><h4>In which sectors are your activities concentrated?</h4><p>GIG has a diversified portfolio of business segments. We are involved in personal care, fabric and home care, and the cosmetics and beauty segment. We also have activities in food and nutrition, including edible oils, chewing gum, and canned food. In the pharmaceuticals industry, we founded an investment company, Golrang Pharmaceutical Investment Co., which serves as a holding company for six subsidiaries that take care of our pharmaceuticals business, from R&amp;D to production and distribution. Another important business segment is retail sales and distribution. We have a chain of nearly 700 retail stores called Ofogh Koroosh Chain Stores (OK). In 2018, we will have 1,000 OK stores. GIG is also involved in construction. We have built a commercial complex called Kourosh Mall that includes over 500 retail stores, a cinema complex with 14 halls and more than 3,000 seats, a family entertainment center, a food court, and kids clubs. Kourosh Mall is 1.3 million sqft in size and has around 1 million visitors per month on average. Energy and mining is another important sector for GIG and Iran in general. In 2008, we founded a holding company, Middle East Investment Mahd Group, which manages 25 companies in various segments of oil, gas, and mining. It has different types of projects ranging from small to large. We also own various mines, including copper, zinc, and lead mines. We are at the stage where we have done the studies and are looking to start exploitation, subject to our cost-benefit analysis. We want to see our efficiency at the highest level.</p><h4>Your vision is to be among the 500-largest corporations worldwide by 2025. What is your strategy for achieving this goal?</h4><p>GIG's vision is to be among the 500-largest corporations in the world by 2025. Currently the group's consolidated revenue is just over USD2 billion. To reach our goal, our revenue needs to be around USD30 billion. We will achieve this by continuing our growth figures of the past 10 years. GIG's income growth has been attractive thanks to our on-time investments during the last decade, with an average annual growth rate of 35%. In the last five years, our average annual income growth rate was 38%. Our compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years has been over 30%. To remain on track we have to grow even higher within the upcoming years. It is not easy achieving this level of growth; however, we are confident that with the tireless efforts of our colleagues and the right leadership we will get there within the next eight years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact will the recently signed Trade Facilitation Agreement have on Oman and the GCC region?</h4><p>The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) is the first multilateral trade agreement concluded since the WTO was established 22 years ago. This is the biggest trade reform in a generation. Earlier in 2017, Oman deposited its instrument of ratification alongside Rwanda, Chad and Jordan, allowing us to reach the number of ratifications required for the TFA to enter into force. This deal seeks to expedite the movement, release and clearance of goods across borders, cutting trade costs and red tape. According to a WTO study, once implemented the TFA could reduce the time needed to import goods by over a day and a half and to export goods by almost two days. This agreement also broke new ground in the way it was designed. It provides for the necessary practical support to help members with their implementation. We are working with a range of donor members and partners to mobilise that support. I have no doubts that the implementation of the TFA can help complement the reforms carried out by Oman within the framework of the Vision 2020 strategy. Full implementation of the TFA could reduce trade costs in Oman by up to 15.8 per cent — which can help many more Omani companies do business abroad, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises. It can also help to streamline the trade flows and cut transaction costs in the region and beyond.</p><h4>Given that Oman wants to become a logistics hub by 2040, what efforts can the WTO provide to ease this process?</h4><p>The WTO offers a unique platform for Oman to put their trade issues and priorities on the table and work to push them forward. Indeed, I think that the organization can play an important role to help the country reduce its trade costs; boost its competitiveness, diversification and participation in global trade in many ways. The WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement is very significant. Oman is also part of the Information Technology Agreement, which eliminates tariffs on a range of IT products. In addition, Oman is working to join the Government Procurement Agreement. Besides its economic significance, Oman's participation in these deals shows the country's commitment to the multilateral trading system, as well as a robust vision for the country's future. Indeed, at Oman's Trade Policy Review in 2014, WTO Members lauded the continued commitment of the country to the multilateral trading system and commended Oman for the reforms undertaken by His Majesty's Government to diversify the Omani economy. I hope that Oman will continue to take full advantage of the forum that the WTO provides.</p><h4>Given the necessity to diversify its economy, what measures should Oman take in order to secure more trade agreements?</h4><p>Trade negotiations are never easy. They require parties to be open-minded, flexible and creative—as well as ambitious and pragmatic—to find common ground and create win-win results. I think that Oman has displayed many of these qualities during the negotiations of their WTO membership. The country joined the WTO in 2000, after a process that lasted for around 4.5 years. In fact, the country's decision to enter the WTO sent a strong signal to the global community that Oman is committed to this framework of global trade rules that provide stability, predictability, and transparency, which are vital ingredients for doing business across borders. The country should seek to build on these qualities—and on its position at the WTO—to continue negotiating new deals and benefit its citizens.</p><h4>Is the WTO expecting to have any major tariff changes for 2018, and how would they impact Oman and the GCC region?</h4><p>I don't anticipate any major tariff changes in 2018. However, this does not mean that work on those fronts is not ongoing. For example, there are some regional trade agreements being implemented, helping to reduce tariffs in some parts of the world. Also, for some sectors, like information technology, tariffs are going down due to the expansion of the WTO Information Technology Agreement, which was agreed in 2015. Nonetheless, we must remain vigilant to potential risks - including the possibility that protectionist rhetoric translates into trade restrictive actions. While tariffs remain a key issue in trade policy, there is a lot of focus on other areas as well.  At the WTO, for example, members are talking about various issues, including how to help SMEs enter global trade flows, how to facilitate investment, or how to ensure that the benefits of e-commerce are shared more broadly. Like reducing tariffs, these issues have a great potential to foster trade and development.</p><h4>Regarding Oman and the GCC region, what are the WTO's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>There are many uncertainties in the global economy. In 2016 world trade grew at 1.3%. This was the slowest pace since the financial crisis. For 2017, WTO economists have issued a strong upward revision to their forecast, which is now projected at 3.6%. This is welcome news. However, substantial risks remain in place and could easily undermine any trade recovery. Against this challenging background, I think that the need to continue strengthening the multilateral trading system. A strong, rules-based trading system is essential for global economic stability. An important part of these efforts is to deliver new reforms and resisting the creation of new barriers to trade. We have shown that meaningful outcomes can be achieved at the WTO — and that is what we must continue doing. Our next Ministerial Conference is in Buenos Aires at the end of 2017 — and that could be an opportunity for progress. I look forward to working with Oman to strengthen the WTO and deliver further results to benefit the country and the region, and ensure that trade can contribute to Oman's economic and development goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>National Rums of Jamaica owns iconic distilleries in Jamaica; how do you plan to leverage these assets?</h4><p>National Rums of Jamaica comprises the Long Pond Distillery, which has been in operation for over 250 years, the Clarendon Distillery, which has been in operation for over 100 years, and Innswood Distillers Limited an aging and barreling facility. Among those three facilities, we make some of the finest rums, for which we have won several awards. Many people from across the globe come to tour the distilleries to document our rum-making process, which is published in various magazines. The rum fermentation process is unique and cannot be replicated due to the local environment and many other indigenous properties such as yeast, water, wood, materials, and so we are unique in each facility. We produce some of the finest and most exotic rums in this hemisphere and recently started a more precise marketing drive in Europe and Canada, and are working to establish ourselves in the USA. We are also in conversations with potential customers in the Caribbean, Latin America and China. The bulk rum also makes us unique and bulk rum represents around 90% of our business. We produce rum and ship the product in containers to other major distilleries, where it is re-blended and bottled. We are in the process of moving our business more in that direction to capture a piece of that higher-value market.</p><h4>What changes in strategy are you implementing as the head of National Rums of Jamaica?</h4><p>I joined the business in 2017 and part of my mandate is to take us along the branded route in a more substantial way, widening our footprint in Jamaica and internationally. We want to prove to our customers that we also have an excellent finished product they can enjoy. We have five expressions; top-of-the-line Special Reserve, around 10-12 year old rums; Classic Gold rum, which is lower priced; Special Gold rum, which is a bit further down the market; White Over proof White rum, which is 63% and very strong; and Whispering Breeze, a flavored rum, which is coconut based and has gotten great reviews from a taste perspective. We also have aged stock up to 15 years old, as markets are changing and people place great value in aged premium rum. The idea is to expand even further and create more blends. I keep referencing to the quality of the rum that we produce and we recently had additional proof of this. We decided to take part in the annual Miami rum festival, which takes place during summer. We took the Special Reserve and the Classic Gold Rum to the festival among around 110 competitors and we won gold awards to our two products. I was attending the festival with one of my colleagues and because it was our first time, we did not even have a booth to display our products. This event attracted a lot of attention to our products and we are thinking about including the gold medals on the label of our products. One of our major achievements this year was to re-open the Long Pond distillery after a four-year closure; in the Clarendon distillery, we can process 12 million liters per annum whilst in Long Pond we can produce 1.0 million liters of alcohol per annum. We have worked hard with the regulators and stakeholders to ensure that the Long Pond distillery could be re-opened in July and it has allowed us to re-engage customers in Germany and other parts of the world. We are already well known in Canada and are working to get into the US and UK markets. Jamaica is world renowned because of its rum and from the days of the pirates of the Caribbean, we have been a rum nation.</p><h4>What are the challenges and opportunities of producing rum in Jamaica?</h4><p>One major challenge, one could argue, is the issue of authenticity; companies place a little rum in a final product and claim it is from Jamaica. We are a part of the Spirits Pool Association and the West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers Organization, and they assist in classifying what is called rum, from all perspectives, including a geographic value indicator. A beverage cannot be called rum if it does not have certain components. Rum has evolved into a real industry and certain rules and regulations have to be placed around the industry to protect it. We get around 60% of our molasses supply locally while the other 40% is imported. We do not want to import but there is not enough sugar being produced locally. While it is not directly a rum challenge, it affects us. A local company, Caribbean Molasses Company, centrally buys the molasses from sugar factories and imports if necessary, and different rum companies pull their allotment from the pool. It ensures that each of us does not have to make individual negotiations. It has its benefits; however, there are more opportunities than there are challenges and that is a good place to be. Jamaican rums are essentially sought after in international markets, and there is an opportunity as a country to establish ourselves in a more macroeconomic way, enlisting government support in terms of simplifying tariffs, duty structure, and how rum is dealt with in general. The rum industry does create foreign reserves given that a large part of our business is exported, and we are constantly bringing foreign exchange reserves into our economy. We do not sell so much of our products locally because we are only 3 million people and there are several billion consumers across the globe and that is the market we should be looking at, rather than focusing on the local market. I am positive and upbeat about the future and I would like for all of this to be underscored by responsible drinking.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for the coming year?</h4><p>If I can achieve an increase in our branded rum business from 10 to 20%, then half of my job is done, because it is a higher value chain. That is one of our main goals for the coming year. Currently, we outsource our bottling, and the plan is for us to do that in-housein a few years' time when we reach the right critical mass. That would mean an expansion and hiring more staff. We as a team need our excellence to permeate every aspect of our business and we encourage that sentiment in the company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[rafael-echevarne-ceo-sangster-international-airport]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Sangster International Airport play in the Jamaican economy?</h4><p>Sangster International Airport is the main airport in Jamaica and the main gateway for tourists arriving into the country. Tourism is one of the key pillars of Jamaica's economy. We handle approximately 4 million passengers per year and the growth pattern in 2017 has been positive. We have grown beyond our expectations. We are working hard with tourism sector stakeholders to ensure that we tap into the right potential growth markets. The markets of interest include Latin America, where we are making inroads. We are mainly interested in Colombia, Peru, and Chile. There are currently no direct flights from Jamaica to Latin America, other than to Panama. We are in fact quite advanced on this and hope to have direct flights starting in 1Q2018. We have been mainly talking about the airport in relation to tourism; however, we are also working to support the development of exports, mainly agricultural exports. We also see more business people flying into Sangster International Airport because of all the things going on in Montego Bay. For this reason, we are working with businesses to look at developing the real estate opportunities we have at the airport.</p><h4>What flights do you have to connect Jamaica with Europe and other main markets?</h4><p>The second-largest group of passengers for us is the diaspora and these are Jamaicans living mainly in the US, Canada, and the UK. Around 70% of our passenger traffic comes from the US, followed by Canada at about 20%, and then Europe. In Europe, the main markets are the UK and Germany, though we do have flights to other parts of Europe, including Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Poland in the summer season. We also had flights to Spain and Portugal in 2017 for the first time in many years. The great thing is that all carriers are happy with this destination and plan to continue flying here and increase the number of flights. For the UK and Germany, we have scheduled flights year-round. For the US, we have flights with all the main carriers, such as American Airlines, Delta, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, and United.</p><h4>How do you maintain such high service standards year after year?</h4><p>We have won Best Airport in the Caribbean at the World Travel Awards for nine years in a row. Sangster International Airport is an airport that is greatly focused on tourism so we do our best to ensure that tourists' experiences at the airport are as great as they can be. Of course, we can always improve and we do. This is one of the keys; we are aware of the areas that need attention and we want to improve. We want to ensure that there are not only flights, but also that passengers have a great experience with us. This includes for example, reducing the queues at security and having mostly contact gates with jet bridges so passengers do not have to walk far. We have a large number of shops and restaurants with some of the best airport shopping in the Caribbean. We also have a great arrivals experience, including excellent lounges for passengers waiting for their hotel bus transfers. We try to cater to all our passengers needs.</p><h4>What expansion works do you have ongoing at the airport?</h4><p>Sangster International Airport has initiated a new phase of development in 2017, with a focus on investing in and improving our infrastructure. We expect that over the next 15 years, Sangster International Airport will see investments of over USD100 million. We will enlarge the terminal building, increase the facilities, and put in more gates to reduce congestion. We will renovate car parking facilities and improve the check-in area, as well as the commercial area to make it much more attractive and interesting. We are working with the immigration authorities to ensure that the passenger experience is pleasant when people enter the country, with the installation of new kiosks. We are investing in air conditioning and many other things to modernize the airport. And on top of this, we will also lengthen the runway at an additional cost of over USD60 million.</p><h4>Is the infrastructure in Montego Bay adequate to give people the best tourism experience?</h4><p>We try to do our best at the airport and it is great that hotels here are also investing and growing. There are more hotel rooms becoming available, both in terms of the expansion of existing hotels and the construction of new hotels. Tourists who come here seem to enjoy the experience. There is potential for more. I see many upsides to Jamaica. Our approach at Sangster International Airport is that we know there will be more hotel rooms coming and we have the passenger demand here; therefore, we have to grow our facilities. However, we want to work together with other entities to ensure that the entire experience is as great as it can be. We are working with hotels and playing our part to ensure that passengers who fly into Sangster International Airport can easily get on their hotel buses.  We are also opening a bus station at the airport  which will facilitate multimodal transport inter-connectivity. MBJ is also a home port for many cruise liners; therefore, people fly into Sangster International Airport and start their cruises from here. We have a number of flights from Europe bringing passengers in for this.</p><h4>What other projects do you have planned for Sangster International Airport over the coming years?</h4><p>We will bring in new technologies to facilitate the entire airport experience. One of the things we have planned is working together with hotels so that passengers can do their flight check-ins and label their luggage at their hotel rather than queuing at the airport to do this. We also want to make the airport part of the experience of being in Jamaica and not just an infrastructure that one goes through. We want the airport to provide entertainment and not just shopping, but also activities, culture, social media, and other experiences. To kickstart this, we are launching an initiative in November 2017 where we invite artisans from Jamaica to take part in a competition, both to publicize their work and to elevate the quality of the souvenirs being produced in Jamaica. My vision is for some of these artisans to actually work inside the airport making and selling their products. We are also playing Jamaican music in the arrival areas and bringing Jamaican artists in so that when passengers step off their aircraft they really feel like they are in Jamaica.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role can medical devices play as a driver for the Mexican economy?</h4><p>The role of medical devices is an important one not only in the treatment of patients, but also in production and exportation. Medical devices represent a technological transformation in health care. Mexico is the largest exporter of medical devices in Latin America and the ninth largest in the world, larger than Germany and Italy. We still have potential to become number two or number three. The capabilities we have built as a country in terms of manufacturing in the past few years in the automotive and the aerospace industries are now spilling over the medical device industry. Why not embark on a much larger journey to remake the medical devices industry into one relevant to the country, not only in terms of patients, but also as a driver for the economy?</p><h4>How can inefficiencies in the healthcare system be mitigated by innovations in medical devices?</h4><p>Our focus is on turning technological improvements into something that makes sense for the patient as well as for the healthcare system as a whole. As an example, now we have a way to monitor patients with pacemakers without having the patient coming into the clinic. Still, today many patients who have a pace maker will need to go to a specialized hospital that you can only find in the major cities in Mexico. Having this service provided remotely will have a huge impact on the economy and the people affected by these ailments. We have a device that can monitor the patient in their house and you can tell which patients are the ones that truly need to visit the hospital. We want to look at total costs of intervention healthcare and work together to streamline that cost to make sure you will be able to service more patients with the best help.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges that you are facing now in terms of adding value to and expanding the manufacturing of medical devices in Mexico?</h4><p>pharmaceuticals when referring to the healthcare industry, but the level of complexity and development is totally different. Developing a molecule is tough but once you have the molecule developed it is just about commercializing the product. This is not the same as medical devices, where you develop the device and then you need to train the physicians and nurses on how to use it. You even need to train the patient because at the end you need to have a follow up after the surgery. Pharma has a specific role in the treatment cycle, but when you have surgery you need a medical device. Developing the purchasing, regulatory, and quality processes for medical devices is different, and that is where we are struggling. We need to ensure that the regulatory agencies understands this. We need to show and demonstrate that using medical devices can help optimize therapies. The entire healthcare chain improves with the correct introduction of medical devices.</p><h4>What is the Mexican market's role in Medtronic's growth in Latin America?</h4><p>We have been growing at strong double-digit rates in Mexico for the last two years and the potential is even higher. We need to invest to further develop the market, as we feel like we haven't really scratched the surface yet. Growing strong double digit is an achievement and I am happy with my team has accomplished; however, the base is small. We need to grow faster than Latin America in the next 3-5 years. We need to also build and invest in the country and conditions to make sure that the growth is not only maintained but it is accelerated to a level where it should be. Mexico has not been among the top recipients of pharmaceutical and medical device investment in the last 10 years. You will see investment going to Brazil, Costa Rica, Panama or Colombia. This is because we haven't really positioned Mexico as the strategic market that it should be.</p><h4>What should be the priorities to increase the investment attractiveness?</h4><p>The first one is education. In general, physicians get acquainted with technology a little late in their careers. The new ways that we are treating medicine are not taught in Mexican universities. One way to solve that is to design an education plan that allows physicians to be exposed to technology at the resident stage. The second one is infrastructure. Patients who need an intervention do not have access to the right infrastructure. We need to work with the government and private companies to invest in infrastructure. We are talking about building small facilities with the newest technology in every city so people can access them.</p><h4>How do you envision the impact of NAFTA renegotiations on the medical devices sector?</h4><p>Medtronic is actively working in the renegotiation group and through AMID, the Mexican Association of Innovation in Medical Devices. My perspective is that the relationship between the US and Mexico has worked well. There are opportunities for upgrading the deal, but I don't think there should be major changes. At this point in time, we don't see a risk. If there is an increase in taxation for of products going out of Mexico to the US and Canada, they would be breaking the supply chain they have had built for years. At the end, if we need to pay more and raise prices, patients will not be happy. This is why local manufacturing is a key strategy for us. We cannot put the patient at risk whenever we have these headwinds coming. We need to have a strategy that is not volatile.</p><h4>What is your outlook and expectations for the next year?</h4><p>I believe that 2018 will be a challenging year. It is an election year and there would be money out there in public investment. Nevertheless, this may be jeopardized because of the reconstruction effort that we need to embark in as a country after the earthquakes, which of course is priority number one. This can affect the inflow of money in the health system. There are many aspects of the economy and the social environment that will make 2018 a tough year, but when you compare the size of the opportunities we have particularly in health care, all the things that we can see in terms of innovation and investment, and taking a leadership role to be at the forefront of making health care a central piece of the strategy as a country, we are planning to continue making significant progress in 2018. In general, I think we will continue having strong double-digit growth. We embarked on a five year plan in Mexico and this is moving forward regardless of NAFTA, the exchange rate, or elections, because that's the essence of our strategic plan; therefore, we are going to have a good year in 2018.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the main monetary policies implemented by the CBN in the last few years?</h4><p>In the last three years, the Nigerian economy encountered enormous external shocks that exposed our vulnerabilities. Due to inherent structural imbalances, Nigeria relies on oil revenue for FX supply and has a taste for imported goods. The sharp collapse of oil prices that began in 2014 adversely impacted fiscal revenue, FX reserves, and exchange rate stability. As the fiscal space constricted, the maneuverability of macroeconomic and social policies diminished. All these, in addition to shrinking FX reserves and depreciating exchange rate, placed immense strain on the Nigerian economy. By 2016, the economy had fallen into a recession even as inflation surged to intolerable heights. Given the importance of price stability in macroeconomic stabilization and the role of the exchange rate in the dynamics of relative-prices, the CBN focused its efforts on battling inflation and maintaining exchange rate stability. Our analyses indicate that a runaway inflation could only worsen the already unsavory situation. Hence, monetary policy stance remained cautiously tight to categorically rein in inflation and extricate lingering money illusions in the macroeconomy. We also took several decisions to fine tune the operations at the FX markets, with a view to purge the system of unscrupulous excess demand and ensure exchange rate stability.</p><h4>How would you assess the health of Nigerian banks today, and what message would you send to banks to further grow the sector's performance?</h4><p>Our assessment indicates the financial system remains fundamentally robust despite the enormous external shocks that debilitated the economy. This is highlighted by increased profits recorded across the industry and the improved credit ratings by foremost agencies. To ensure sustained financial stability, the CBN will continue to closely regulate banks using the risk-based supervision model and will maintain the elevated threshold of prudential indicators. As against the CAR of 8% prescribed internationally, the CBN had set a threshold of 16% for systemically important banks, 15% for banks with international presence, and 10% benchmark for all other banks. Given that the banking system is the lubricant of the economy, banks have an enormous role to play in supporting the economic recovery. I would encourage them to channel more credits to agriculture and MSMEs through our development finance initiatives. Contrary to the amplified risk perception of MSME credits, the sector of nonperforming loans (NPL) is far below the industry average. This indicates that credits to MSMEs generally perform better than those of supposedly low-risk sectors, many of which end up with the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). I would also advise banks to conduct methodical risk assessment and to adopt stringent prudential standards internally.</p><h4>You have stated the importance of agro-allied industries for Nigeria to achieve self-sufficiency in food production. What role can the CBN play in funding agriculture?</h4><p>Four commodities—rice, fish, sugar, and wheat—make up nearly NGN1.3 trillion (USD3.6 billion) annually in import bills. These and other commodities on the 41 items list are a drain on our FX reserves. Our proclivity for imports has enriched other countries and impoverished ours. We cannot depend on other countries for food; that exposes us to unquantifiable social and economic vulnerabilities. If we increase domestic food production, we will create jobs, reduce poverty, and shield our economy from foreign impulses. Thus, the CBN is channeling a great deal of development finance and interventions towards agriculture to ensure sufficiency in the production of food and raw materials through our various development finance mechanisms and schemes. Our intention is to ensure that Nigeria does not depend on other countries for most of the things we consume. We must ensure that our non-oil current account balances stand hugely positive. On this note, the Anchor Borrowers' Program (ABP) has recorded spectacular success, especially with regard to rice production. As we speak, rice production has increased several-fold. Kebbi State alone is expected to produce over 2 million metric tons of rice annually, while employees at Labana Rice Mills seek to keep pace with demand, processing 320 tons of rice a day, a 250% increase from the previous year. Therefore, we have seen sharp drop in rice imports that translates to a significant reduction in rice import bills, saving us over USD600 million in 2016 alone.</p><h4>What message of confidence would you send to the international community about doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria is open to business. For the first time, through a veritable partnership with the London Stock Exchange, various Nigerian stakeholders have accomplished previously unimaginable feats, including a federal government-issued diaspora bond. It was the first time any sovereign African nation had registered with both US and UK authorities and targeted sales at retail investors. The bond was oversubscribed by 130% and raised USD300 million, demonstrating increased confidence in the Nigerian economy. This was attested to by the recently released World Bank's ease of doing business indicator for 2018, which indicated that Nigeria, with a score of 52.03, improved 24 places to rank 145 out of 190, above the average score of 50.43 recorded for sub-Saharan Africa. The CBN's efforts to establish, nurture, and administer the Credit Bureau and the National Collateral Registry contributed in no small measure to improving access to credit and enhancing the ease of doing business. In addition, the introduction of the transparent I&amp;E FX Window buoyed investors' confidence and eased market sentiments. With all the evident improvements and increased transparency, Nigeria is a destination of assured returns to investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018, and what will be the CBN role in improving the economy?</h4><p>Barring any further unforeseen exogenous shocks, we expect the economy to fully recover from the recession by 2018. We also expect disinflation to continue throughout 2018 and, if the current momentum sustains, inflation may revert to low double-digit or even single-digit levels. FX reserves are expected to continue to grow. At the current pace, we can attain a reserve position of about USD40 billion by early 2018. The exchange rate stability that began in 2017 is expected to continue as the FX market transparency sustains and improved market confidence remains. With rent-seekers locked out of the market, there is a genuine prospect that the exchange rate could begin to appreciate against major currencies. Overall, I expect the economic recovery that began in 2017 to consolidate in 2018 and beyond. As the sentiments improve in the macroeconomy supported by proactive monetary, trade, industrial, and fiscal policies, I expect a continued uptick in GDP growth, with positive spillovers on unemployment. Policy-driven growth in the agricultural and industrial sectors will further bolster our economy.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kuwait and Turkey recently signed agreements to develop relations in a variety of fields: taxation, youth cooperation, IT; and the heads of states met. What do you hope will come out of these agreements?</h4><p>Turkey and Kuwait enjoy excellent political relations. We signed 12 agreements in various fields in 2017. This shows that both sides have a strong political will and determination to take bilateral relations even further and extend cooperation to other fields as well. We will closely follow up the implementation of these agreements in order to realize our targets.  </p><h4>In addition, military cooperation was discussed. How do you see this cooperation moving forward?</h4><p>In the last 15 years, Turkey has made significant progress to become self-sufficient in the field of national defense, and started to produce many modern weaponry systems of its own. We do not see Kuwait simply as a market. On the contrary, Turkey is ready to share its vast experience, know-how as well as technology, and to meet Kuwait's specific needs in this field. We believe that there is large room for cooperation between the two states.</p><h4>Turkish companies are very involved in Kuwait, particularly in the construction sector; how can the economic cooperation be strengthened further?</h4><p>Turkish construction sector companies are very active in Kuwait and the Gulf countries, and are undertaking many important projects. The Turkish construction sector has recently won a total of USD6.5 billion worth of projects in Kuwait. When you consider that it was only USD500 million in 2013, you can see the tremendous positive difference in this sector. Amongst these projects is the new International Airport of Kuwait being built by a world renowned Turkish construction company Limak. As the jewel in the crown for the 2035 goals of Kuwait, this airport which will cost USD4.4 billion will be an important source of income and pride for the Kuwaiti economy. Economic cooperation can be further strengthened by increasing bilateral trade, which amounted to only USD1.3 billion in 2016, by attracting Kuwaiti investments in Turkey and also by developing tourism. Kuwaiti businesses have invested a total amount of USD1.7 billion in Turkey and there is an increasing trend. We are easing bureaucratic impediments in front of investments from the Gulf countries. Turkey has become an important destination for Kuwaiti tourists with 180.000 Kuwaitis visiting Turkey in 2016, and the number of Turkish tourists visiting Kuwait is also steadily increasing. Another area which is developing fast is the acquisition of property in Turkey by Kuwaiti citizens. Over 6000 property so far and the number is increasing. We also welcome this development.<br></p><h4>Kuwait has been working to help Syrian refugees in Turkey; how can your two countries cooperate further regarding the issue of refugees?</h4><p>The number of Syrians in Turkey exceeded 3.3 million. For wide-ranging services provided for Syrians such as education, language courses, vocational training, access to labor market as well as support to social and health requirements, we have spent USD30 billion. However, the international community in general so far failed the test of burden sharing. Only a limited number of countries including Kuwait creates an exception in providing financial assistance. We are more than happy to see our friends like Kuwait extend their helping hand to share our burden. We continue to reiterate our call that equitable and meaningful burden and responsibility sharing is necessary. We appreciate the efforts of Kuwait especially through “Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED)". KFAED signed grant agreements in January 2016 with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education worth a total of USD20 million. KFAED also signed three grant agreements in March 2017 with the Municipalities of Gaziantep, Kilis and Åžanlıurfa, each worth of USD5 million. In the forthcoming period, we are ready to deepen our relations on migration and refugee issues, and exchange views in the preparations of the Global Compact processes.</p><h4>What field do you think would benefit from further cooperation between your countries?</h4><p>We believe that good political relations pave the way for better cooperation in other fields as well. The Joint Committee for Cooperation is an important tool in that respect through which we can explore new avenues of cooperation. We hope to hold the next session in Turkey in the months to come. For example, we signed Tourism and Culture Cooperation Agreement last March which I believe will help develop our relations in these fields. We are also closely following Kuwait's undertakings in becoming a regional financial and trade center. Coupled with the 5 Year Development Plan, we believe that Turkish companies and experts will be ready to contribute to these goals. There are certain areas where our cooperation can be further developed such as defense industry, energy and especially renewable energy, and organic farming. Food and energy security of Kuwait along with the strengthening of its defense capability are areas where Turkey can definitely contribute. Besides, our region is going through a critical period and the current circumstances in the region call for better cooperation and coordination among friendly countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Nigeria's agricultural sector performed recently?</h4><p>When the government came to power there was a severe shortage of staples, so we looked at grains such as rice, wheat, and millet. After two years I am pleased to say we are achieving self-sufficiency in rice paddy production, though milling is still a challenge. By March-April 2018 we will have overcome this issue and there will be absolutely no need for Nigeria to import rice. We will have more than we need, and this will be the same for tubers. In terms of the domestic food supply, we are heading toward self-sufficiency by mid-2018. However, we still do not have enough milk, wheat, egg powder, and certain fruits, which, however, can be grown here. We are looking at exports, too, because the oil sector will not last forever. Every country needs foreign exchange, so Nigeria has to find something else to export other than hydrocarbons. Agriculture has to lead the way before other sectors can develop and join in. We are talking about enhancing cashew nuts and cocoa, not only for local consumption, but also for exports. Also in the works are sesame seeds, coconut oil, shea butter, and castor oil for products such as cosmetics. We look at policies to export to India where there is demand and exciting opportunities for such products. Certain countries in the Middle East seek high-quality meat products and the market is quite big, at 120,000 carcasses per week. Nigeria is the world's largest producer of yams and we will enter into the production of cassava chips, as well as industrial starch and ethanol from cassava. We also plan to work on improving our processing and packaging. Some of our current processing methods do not meet international health standards. For example, we do not use stainless steel in some processing and are using polypropylene bags, which are not good for preserving food. We are moving from polypropylene bags to jute bags.</p><h4>The ministry is committed to engaging the youth in agriculture. What has been the public's response to your measures to increase participation in agriculture?</h4><p>The beauty is that Nigerians are responsive; the number of people returning to agriculture has never been this large. This includes young people, women, civil servants, and the military. In particular, the average age of our farmers now is about 65 years old, so they do not have long to go. If we can mechanize and invite the younger generations into agriculture, that energy hidden in Nigerians that has not been exploited before will come alive. We are excited to tap into this. Nearly every sector of society is heading for the farms now and it is exciting. Our duty at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is to help clear the land and give them irrigation and approved seeds. Another example is cotton; Nigeria was a leading producer and the textiles industry was the second-largest employer in Nigeria after the government up until 1975. Later, the industry declined. Nigerians consume a large amount of fabric because our traditional garment is made from 12m of material. Now we rely entirely on Chinese and Indian textiles. If our population grows at the current rate, soon we will not have the money to import all this fabric. We need to grow some of our own cotton. If we do research on seed types and farmers' yields go up to about 1.5 tons per hectare then we can satisfy local demand, manufacture our own textiles, and create more jobs.</p><h4>What is the potential of Nigeria's agricultural sector and what should be done to further support it?</h4><p>The potential is extremely high that in many ways I am happy we are broke and that oil and gas is giving way to reality. There is nothing wrong with oil and gas; however, we misused, wasted, and misapplied the resources. We need a man of our president's age, experience, and discipline to stabilize the country, despite what the critics say. We need a man of his character to stop this, and this may not be comfortable for those who are used to the old ways; however, he is the best choice. We are now back to reality and agriculture with more discipline. We will not lead the life of a lottery winner—as we did with oil—but of a producer. Nigeria has about 50 million ha of uncultivated land and massive bodies of water and rivers. We will utilize our dams and lakes to make sure we grow food all-year round. This is one of 2018's investments. Once that happens, we invite the world to come. There is demand from Russia and Europe. We already feed West and Central Africa. In another year or two the world will hear great things from Nigeria about food. We also want to educate Nigerians about the need for a healthier diet, because even though we produce certain categories of food, we are not consuming enough fruit, vegetables, minerals, and vitamins. This affects our lifespan, resistance to disease, and immune system. We are slowly educating people that it is not enough to eat yams and cassava, and they are responding. Our children do not have enough milk; they should be having a pint a day for their minds and bodies. Currently, there are too many children with deficiencies in their diet and therefore they can never truly reach their full potential. This is one reason why we are entering into cattle breeding to improve the milk yield per cow.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We should achieve around 3.5-4% GDP growth by YE2018. It could be more if we solve one problem, which is the cost of credit. If Nigerians have access to reasonable credit, we can double that growth rate. I would then expect a more cheerful population; things are tough for people currently. They are not pleased with the high cost of food, school fees, and medical bills. The government is concerned about this; however, we cannot make improvements overnight. However, at least in terms of food the worst is over. We are improving on transportation and building railways and once the cost of transportation drops and good gets cheaper, the population will be happier. There will be more jobs and a lower crime rate because the young people who are frustrated go into crime. Once we achieve this, society will begin to benefit and become a much happier and less violent society than it is today. We are heading for better times.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the key infrastructural challenges in the country?</h4><p>The major challenge of the country is that there is massive economic growth paired with unprepared infrastructure. It is not just roads and railways, but also ports and airports, electricity infrastructure, power, energy, water supply, and waste water treatment. You can build a port but without a hinterland connection or transport means to the rest of the country, you cannot go anywhere. The major challenge will be to really develop the infrastructure holistically in the whole country, which then can be a catalyst for growth.</p><h4>You are involved in the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development project (NCICD), or the Giant Sea Wall, a project to address the challenges that Jakarta faces in its water management. How the project has advanced, and what is your involvement?</h4><p>We are part of this MoU,  and are supporting the Indonesian government through Dutch funding, to map out this masterplan for the national coastal defense. The city is sinking at a pace of about 10 centimeters per year so large parts of the city are already well below sea level. We are already working on the 'no-regret' measures to ensure the safety for the coming 10-15 years, which includes a close-to-shore defense wall that is currently under construction. For the next 100-150 years, there needs to be a more sustainable solution to prevent flooding in Jakarta. It is not just the whole system of armoring the city against a rising sea level but also making sure that there is sufficient retention capacity in the city during the rain season. The city is now very densely built with hardly any space left for drainage canals and storage basins. At the same time, measures should be taken to implement proper sanitation and wastewater treatment, not only in Jakarta itself but also in the areas upstream of the rivers. Drainage canals and some of the rivers will discharge into Jakarta Bay and it should be ensured that this water is not polluted. We see that the current administration understands this holistic approach and is supporting various initiatives.</p><h4>What are the major causes of the sinking of the city, and how could it be addressed at the source?</h4><p>The ground water extraction has been a major cause of land subsidence causing this 10cm plus sinking of the city. Another reason is the rapid urbanization and construction activities that have increased the pressure on the soil. The possibilities are limited for further ground water extraction, so fresh water needs to be taken from more upstream rivers. At the same time, creating this giant sea wall will also create a street water retention basin close to the city. That means that clean water from rivers or rain can be collected in this basin to be used as a source for drinking water. Currently, rainwater pours down in large amounts and is then flushed to sea, because there is no storage capacity, which is a major waste. Storing rainwater and using it for purification is an appropriate solution, and is already done on a large scale in Singapore, where the ambition is to save every drop of rain and catch in retention basins.</p><h4>You are also involved in the Kuala Tanjung port expansion. What is your expertise in this type of project? </h4><p>We are the global market leader in maritime port and infrastructure development. Our fully integrated, multidisciplinary approach means we can deliver all the expertise a project requires, from creating new port facilities, relocating terminals, refurbishing facilities or optimizing the operations of existing terminals. We are involved in several stages; we consult the port authorities on how to economically operate a port and also how to improve operations. Sometimes it is possible to increase efficiency and the capacity of a port without physically extending it, rather by looking at the way it is operated. On the other side, we do work on the development plans to physically expand the port. We provide this combination of high-end consultancy on the client's side looking at the assets and how to optimize them and, while also bringing our engineering practice on how to construct a port, which we have done for decades around the world. We also advise the government on the strategy behind their maritime vision and port expansion plans. When you build a port, it is important to know why and what investors you will attract. One should not take away port capacity from a port 100km away, because that does not create any additional value for the country as a whole. The focus should be on making Indonesia more attractive compared to other countries in the region to attract more cargo and industrial producers to the country as well as creating economic zones and hinterland connections.</p><h4>How do you find the talent pool in the engineering field here?</h4><p>Our aim is to further build up our local capacity. Our expatriates provide expert support on projects and train local staff to become equally proficient and to prepare them for assignments abroad as well. In that sense, we are really a global company and want to be able to employ our staff anywhere in the world. Driving innovations and providing digital solutions become increasingly important in all of our business. Advanced 3D design and modeling is something we are already working on and we aim to move to solely 3D design in 2018. We also started using drones for our site supervision. We are working with young engineers, so letting them work with the most advanced systems and tools—creating an interesting modern environment—is also a way to attract and retain staff.</p><h4>What (digital) innovations are you developing to cater to specific local demand? </h4><p>For example, we have developed a flood-forecasting app, which we have now pitched to the local government in Jakarta. This tool will be beneficial for everyone in the streets and it gives close-to-real time information on upcoming flooding. We are also exploring the use of this application for companies like GO-JEK to monitor increased delivery demands in flood prone areas. Another project is studying how we can enhance the livability of Jakarta as a city. We have a very advanced wastewater treatment technology called Nereda®, a natural sewage treatment process that purifies water without chemicals by using a patented aerobic granular sludge technology, which only uses 25 or 30% of the land that you need normally for a wastewater treatment plant. It uses up to 50% less energy, and the quality of the effluent is by far the best of any treatment system, making it a very attractive solution for the densely populated city of Jakarta. This project was developed together with TU Delft in the Netherlands and has been rolled out in South Africa, South America, the Netherlands, and other European countries. We are now bringing this technology to the Asia Pacific region, and Jakarta will be one of the cities we are earmarking for implementation within the coming years. It is this continuous innovation that drives our company. There is so much development going on in Indonesia and it goes at such a fast face that you have to apply your best and most innovative solutions to help the country cope with its challenges. Another advanced solution is a project to manage the water supply in Indonesia. There is still a lot of non-revenue water, as the systems are not managed efficiently, leakages occur and systems are often too highly pressurized. We developed a software tool called Aquasuite®, which supports operators in water treatment plants to manage the pressure regime in the distribution systems. Reducing the pressure also means reducing the number of leakages in the system. By installing this control software, they can optimize the yield of the treatment plants without any major physical investments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-mehdi-fazli-ceo-golrang-industrial-group-gig]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of GIG to the country?</h4><p>In our 50-year history, our tradition of ingenuity and promoting entrepreneurial values has driven continuous improvement and our growth reflects the energy and innovation that GIG has applied to identify and utilize new opportunities. GIG is a privately owned family business. The public recognizes us via our sustainable development, market leadership, trusted brands, and a commitment to our ethical and social responsibilities. In 1989, GIG had 34 employees and sold around USD1 million. Today, we have more than 16,000 people working at GIG, and our sales are around USD2 billion, which illustrates the incredible growth over the past decades. Annually, our workforce has grown by more than 25%. We are a market leader in certain categories of personal care, home care, and cosmetics. Moreover, we have been able to achieve market leadership in certain categories of the business segments that GIG has recently entered. GIG manages more than 40 brands and, as a holding company, owns and manages over 70 companies. Altogether, our 14 strategic business units sell over 1 billion product units per year in 80 product categories. We manage the largest distribution channel in Iran with six distribution companies, and manage, own, and sell our products in over 1,300 cities in Iran and around the world.</p><h4>In which sectors are your activities concentrated?</h4><p>GIG has a diversified portfolio of business segments. We are involved in personal care, fabric and home care, and the cosmetics and beauty segment. We also have activities in food and nutrition, including edible oils, chewing gum, and canned food. In the pharmaceuticals industry, we founded an investment company, Golrang Pharmaceutical Investment Co., which serves as a holding company for six subsidiaries that take care of our pharmaceuticals business, from R&amp;D to production and distribution. Another important business segment is retail sales and distribution. We have a chain of nearly 700 retail stores called Ofogh Koroosh Chain Stores (OK). In 2018, we will have 1,000 OK stores. GIG is also involved in construction. We have built a commercial complex called Kourosh Mall that includes over 500 retail stores, a cinema complex with 14 halls and more than 3,000 seats, a family entertainment center, a food court, and kids clubs. Kourosh Mall is 1.3 million sqft in size and has around 1 million visitors per month on average. Energy and mining is another important sector for GIG and Iran in general. In 2008, we founded a holding company, Middle East Investment Mahd Group, which manages 25 companies in various segments of oil, gas, and mining. It has different types of projects ranging from small to large. We also own various mines, including copper, zinc, and lead mines. We are at the stage where we have done the studies and are looking to start exploitation, subject to our cost-benefit analysis. We want to see our efficiency at the highest level.</p><h4>Your vision is to be among the 500-largest corporations worldwide by 2025. What is your strategy for achieving this goal?</h4><p>GIG's vision is to be among the 500-largest corporations in the world by 2025. Currently the group's consolidated revenue is just over USD2 billion. To reach our goal, our revenue needs to be around USD30 billion. We will achieve this by continuing our growth figures of the past 10 years. GIG's income growth has been attractive thanks to our on-time investments during the last decade, with an average annual growth rate of 35%. In the last five years, our average annual income growth rate was 38%. Our compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years has been over 30%. To remain on track we have to grow even higher within the upcoming years. It is not easy achieving this level of growth; however, we are confident that with the tireless efforts of our colleagues and the right leadership we will get there within the next eight years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[federico-tagliani-ceo-an-global]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Mexican market in AN Global's strategy?</h4><p>Mexico is our essence; we have been in the market for 17 years. We started our operations in Mexico and we are proud of our Mexican heritage. Nowadays, Mexico accounts for almost two-thirds of our business, yet the dynamics are changing quickly. We are projecting that in the next 12 to 18 months, more than half of our business will come from the US market. We are tied to Mexico for different reasons, mainly because we are convinced of the quality of the Latin American talent. We have a worldwide hub here that easily connects with our neighbor in the north and traditionally has strong bridges with Europe and Asia in terms of economic agreements and treaties, and those devices make it easier to interchange goods and talents across the world.</p><h4>What are the reasons behind the IPO you are planning and what impact do you foresee this having for the company?</h4><p>In our experience, Latin American financial markets are too far from our industry, unlike the situation in the US and Europe. We must have strong ties with the financial market to pay for our expansion plans. We have partnered with one of the most successful private equity firms, Nexus, and we will be announcing around mid-November the incorporation of another visible financial institution as a new shareholder. These private processes take too much time and effort to complete so our idea is to open up our capital in a sophisticated market. Our first option is NASDAQ and eventually it could be the London stock market, to diminish the friction to have access to funds to finance our expansion. We compete on a daily basis with companies that are 100 times bigger than us. We are competing in the region well and we have some successes in companies like Mabe or Lala against the Accentures, the Delloites or the IBMs. With our ambition to be a platform for the Americas for the next three or four years we need more muscles in our body. We are improving our processes; the result is a more sustainable, visible and viable business for our stock holders with more reliability for our clients where they have a business partner who is tested permanently not just by them but by the market.</p><h4>How advanced is the digital transformation in Mexico compared to other Latin American countries?</h4><p>It depends strongly on the vertical segment. For example, Mexico is advanced in some areas of manufacturing; however, you have other extraordinary areas of opportunity related to the financial industry for instance. When you compare the percentage of banking penetration against Brazil, for example, it is low here and that represents a huge opportunity. A low bancarization means informality and potential corruption, which is negative for the economy, so there is an extraordinary opportunity in Mexico to catch up with our neighbors and improve in areas which are underdeveloped.</p><h4>How do you approach the digitalization of Mexican financial institutions?</h4><p>Financial services in general were made for robustness, security, and scalability. They were not made to be proactive or agile. The main financial institutions use huge mainframe hardware boxes which process tons of transactions but the reality now is that we as customers are used to running part of our lives with our personal devices. Financial institutions have to react to face these challenges as we are in the middle of an explosion of the so-called fintechs, which are nimble startup companies that do not have this legacy. What we are doing with financial institutions is helping them upgrade the whole cycle through design thinking, agile development and the so called dev-ops. It is a new way of incorporating strong agile processes with a different approach to build software, publish software and develop compared to the traditional waterfall strategies. How fast I publish new features is measured now in terms of days against months with the traditional approaches.</p><h4>What is the digital service that Mexican companies are requesting the most from AN Global?</h4><p>In fact, all of them. From digital guidance about how to define priorities and organize execution to specific solutions implementation. Advanced analytics, one of our top-three services, are not just about seeing what happened in the past but also foreseeing what will happen and inducing what will happen. Digital Marketing, in terms of brand positioning and sales uplift is other blockbuster. Companies need to be relevant to clients that are not just digitally savvy but digitally native. And that happens in BtB businesses as well as BtC. Digital commerce, from e-commerce oriented to distribution channels and final clients to e-procurement to enable digital supply chains, is a hot topic. To disrupt or be disrupted, or we could say to be 'Amazonized,' is a compelling reason to change business models and to embrace the power of digital commerce. Our Cloud offerings bring speed, agility, and safety. Gone are the days that the cloud was considered risky; now the cloud environments are more secure, scalable, and stable than the main in-house operations and systems. Sometimes with the legacy systems companies have billions of dollars invested in their IT assets so our approach is not to destroy them and create a new world but to build bridges with this past and leverage the traditional IT investments. We took the SAP, Oracle, and legacies corporate platforms and enabled them to be digitally responsive which has been part of our success.</p><h4>How does AN Global help Mexican manufacturing companies keep their competitive advantage in times of growing automation and digitalization?</h4><p>Some studies predict that by 2020 or 2022 the creation of jobs provided by the digital transformation will be more than the jobs which have been destroyed. China grew as a manufacturing giant initially due to their cheap labor but now China is the country in the best position to embrace digitalization. This is because they have modern manufacturing facilities. This is the situation in Mexico now as we had a lot of investment in the last decade and we have extraordinary manufacturing facilities in place. We are convinced that we can maintain the competitive advantage built over these past years with the evolution of digital transformation. In Mexico, now you have more car brands than in the US and that is not just due to cheap labor nowadays. Industry 4.0 with the application of Advanced Analytics above cyber physical systems to forecasting and replenishment worldwide supply chains could maintain Mexico as a place of choice to any manufacturing company.</p><h4>Does AN Global also help SME's escalate their business with digital transformation tools?</h4><p>We have a couple of business lines related to small and medium businesses. We do this business with the intention of helping clients from all kinds of backgrounds, industries and sizes to be more competitive and in this way help to make the economy more fluid and finally help our major clients to do more and better business. We focus on companies with the ambition to be relevant in the market and understand that transformation is the name of the game and technology can level the field against larger and established companies.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>We project to doubling our size by the end of 2018. Our projection for 2017 is that we will grow around 70% compared to our numbers in 2016. We feel that by the end of next year we will be at technical size to open up our stock in NASDAQ.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of GIG to the country?</h4><p>In our 50-year history, our tradition of ingenuity and promoting entrepreneurial values has driven continuous improvement and our growth reflects the energy and innovation that GIG has applied to identify and utilize new opportunities. GIG is a privately owned family business. The public recognizes us via our sustainable development, market leadership, trusted brands, and a commitment to our ethical and social responsibilities. In 1989, GIG had 34 employees and sold around USD1 million. Today, we have more than 16,000 people working at GIG, and our sales are around USD2 billion, which illustrates the incredible growth over the past decades. Annually, our workforce has grown by more than 25%. We are a market leader in certain categories of personal care, home care, and cosmetics. Moreover, we have been able to achieve market leadership in certain categories of the business segments that GIG has recently entered. GIG manages more than 40 brands and, as a holding company, owns and manages over 70 companies. Altogether, our 14 strategic business units sell over 1 billion product units per year in 80 product categories. We manage the largest distribution channel in Iran with six distribution companies, and manage, own, and sell our products in over 1,300 cities in Iran and around the world.</p><h4>In which sectors are your activities concentrated?</h4><p>GIG has a diversified portfolio of business segments. We are involved in personal care, fabric and home care, and the cosmetics and beauty segment. We also have activities in food and nutrition, including edible oils, chewing gum, and canned food. In the pharmaceuticals industry, we founded an investment company, Golrang Pharmaceutical Investment Co., which serves as a holding company for six subsidiaries that take care of our pharmaceuticals business, from R&amp;D to production and distribution. Another important business segment is retail sales and distribution. We have a chain of nearly 700 retail stores called Ofogh Koroosh Chain Stores (OK). In 2018, we will have 1,000 OK stores. GIG is also involved in construction. We have built a commercial complex called Kourosh Mall that includes over 500 retail stores, a cinema complex with 14 halls and more than 3,000 seats, a family entertainment center, a food court, and kids clubs. Kourosh Mall is 1.3 million sqft in size and has around 1 million visitors per month on average. Energy and mining is another important sector for GIG and Iran in general. In 2008, we founded a holding company, Middle East Investment Mahd Group, which manages 25 companies in various segments of oil, gas, and mining. It has different types of projects ranging from small to large. We also own various mines, including copper, zinc, and lead mines. We are at the stage where we have done the studies and are looking to start exploitation, subject to our cost-benefit analysis. We want to see our efficiency at the highest level.</p><h4>Your vision is to be among the 500-largest corporations worldwide by 2025. What is your strategy for achieving this goal?</h4><p>GIG's vision is to be among the 500-largest corporations in the world by 2025. Currently the group's consolidated revenue is just over USD2 billion. To reach our goal, our revenue needs to be around USD30 billion. We will achieve this by continuing our growth figures of the past 10 years. GIG's income growth has been attractive thanks to our on-time investments during the last decade, with an average annual growth rate of 35%. In the last five years, our average annual income growth rate was 38%. Our compound annual growth rate over the last 10 years has been over 30%. To remain on track we have to grow even higher within the upcoming years. It is not easy achieving this level of growth; however, we are confident that with the tireless efforts of our colleagues and the right leadership we will get there within the next eight years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Aiming to increase funding from international investors]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[clemente-del-valle-president-financiera-desarrollo-nacional-fdn]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 2011, FDN has been the main development bank of the country for infrastructure. What milestones has FDN achieved over the past year?</h4><p>We are preparing the future pipeline of funds that will be needed over the next five to 10 years. In terms of the 4G program, we have started to achieve important milestones. In 2017, we handled a toll roads program comprising 31 projects and USD19.5 billion between debt and equity. Thus far, 30 projects have been awarded to sponsors and 23 of those have received financial certification, which demonstrates the strong interest from financial institutions in providing a significant part of the financing of the program. As well, eight of the projects have had financial closing; grades were assigned and bonds were issued. We are currently working on another package of six projects that we hope to close by the end of 2017. The most important part of the results of the first eight projects with financial closing was the mix of funding. We wanted to attract a variety of funding from local banks, international banks, and foreign investors. We are pleased that the sources for first eight projects are relatively diversified, allowing us to reduce our dependency on local banks. Originally, many expected local banks to solely finance the program. We were able to bring the amount sourced from local banks down to 49%, and of that 49% we were even able to expand to certain universal banks in the local markets. Typically, these are funded by two main groups: Grupo Bancolombia and Grupo AVAL, which represent more or less four banks. Here, we were able to expand it to seven banks, bringing on new partners such as Davivienda and other banks that were not active in infrastructure in the past. Davivienda in particular, which is the third-largest financial group and has historically been more focused on housing, came into infrastructures strongly. We participated as an investor also to become a market maker for infrastructure bonds and equity. That also helps the tightening of interest rates. Of the 21% that constitutes institutional investment, three-fourth came from bonds while one-fourth came from debt funds. The debt fund was an innovation promoted by FDN that uses the private equity regulation that allows institutional investors to invest as much as 5% of the portfolio. The funding from international sources was as a significant achievement; we were able to raise 22% from international sources comprising eight institutions, six national banks from Asia and Europe, and two multilaterals. Later, FDN came in with 8.6%, which was the beginning. In total, USD4.2 billion was raised for the first eight projects. Now, we have the next six projects. Here, we hope to go beyond the 49% sourced from local banks and bring that figure down even lower to 42% or 44%. There is significant appetite from international banks; however, the problem is that there is inadequate funding in dollars. Out of 31 projects, 20 are government sponsored and have government support on the revenue side. They are large infrastructure projects and are expensive because of geography; the government had to subsidize, averaging 50% of revenues for the roads, with the other half provided in dollars. That was important because it allowed us to bring in an international source. We were able to reach 22% from international banks.</p><h4>The FDN recently signed MoUs with the Korean Development Bank and the China Development Bank. How relevant will that be going forward with 4G?</h4><p>We signed MoUs with them because they are important development banks in Asia. We seek to bring more Asian investors to 4G and hope the Chinese Development Bank will participate in the upcoming round in 2018. We want to strengthen that relationship and are in the process of that currently. This is all part of the same strategy to bring more players into the picture to ensure we have enough resources. We have been not only able to diversify, but also introduce innovations.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the next years and what projects are in your pipeline?</h4><p>The remaining challenge for us is the equity side; we require more equity in the system. This project is being done as an availability payment, and our sponsors have to inject a great deal of equity upfront or have letters of credit to support their equity participation. It is all project finance, unlike traditional financing. In that sense, it requires more equity more than corporate finance. We are working on a strategy to create a large private equity fund for infrastructure that will hopefully be launched at the beginning of 2018 with both local and international partners, mobilizing close to USD1 billion for infrastructure in Colombia. There is a great deal more in terms of our role in putting together large, complex projects, such as Metro de Bogotá. We are doing a light rail metro for Medellí­n as well, in addition to the expansion of the current system. We are working on the first PPPs for schools and hospitals as well, which be launched at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, respectively. We are also working on one of the most complex transactions for Electricaribe, one of the largest distribution companies for the whole coast. It is running into major problems resulting in the government intervening. The company was unsustainable and could not finance its operations and is now under our advisory arm. There is a great deal going on for projects in cities such as initiatives for roads and public transportations. After 4G, the next two to three years will see a wave of urban projects related to infrastructure. We support the construction of those projects and will go on to support them financially when they go to market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important reforms and policies implemented by the Nigerian Federal Government in 2017?</h4><p>
	The year 2017 was one of great reforms for Nigeria. We promised the electorate before the 2015 elections that we would secure the country, fight corruption, and revive the economy. We are keeping faith with these promises. The war against insurgency and general insecurity proceeds robustly, and we are recording good progress. There is no basis for comparing what we met in the area of security in 2015, with what subsists today. God has helped us tremendously. The war against graft is also yielding good returns, with moneys recovered in billions of naira, and hundreds of millions of dollars. The intention is not to shame anybody, but to get back what has been looted from the public treasury. We have also implemented reforms that encourage probity and transparency in public accounts. The Treasury Single Account (TSA) is one. We have in the process saved trillions of naira that may have been misappropriated. The economy is key for us, in terms of reviving and diversifying it. For many decades, we had depended on oil as the mainstay of the economy. We became a mono-product economy. But the downside was that whenever there was crash in the prices of oil in the international market, we simply crashed with it. That is not good for any country. So, we have focused on agriculture, mines and steel development, manufacturing and many others, as alternative sources of income. And the returns are quite promising. At the end of this dispensation, Nigeria would no longer be called a “mono economy."
</p><h4>On the theme of alternative revenue streams, tax collection has also improved across a range of sources during your tenure. What has been the strategy behind these efficiency improvements, and do you have specific targets for the year ahead?</h4><p>
	Yes, we have made scrupulous efforts to ensure that more people are brought into the tax net. Apart from the civil servants who are in the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system, we found out that the number of Nigerians paying tax was negligible. A lot of high net-worth people were simply not paying. So, we came with VAIDS, which is Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme. The intention is to allow those who are outside the tax net to voluntarily give information about themselves, and then pay their taxes. It's a time-limited opportunity for people to regulate their tax status, and they will not face any penalty, or prosecution. But they must do it within the prescribed time. This will help the country to improve revenue through tax collection.
</p><h4>The APC's election was a historical one, being the first time an incumbent lost to an opposition candidate, and the drive for transparency was a pledge that resonated strongly with the electorate. What would you say has been the APC's biggest achievement in its fight against corruption? </h4><p>
	I will not mention a particular case; the fact that there is an awareness in the country that corruption is evil, and would be punished, is in itself a big achievement. Days of impunity are gone. Days of paying lip service to fight against corruption are gone. And the fact that we have this awareness in the country is a big achievement. That is why a lot of Nigerians are involved in the whistleblowing policy. They identify with the crusade to stamp out corruption, knowing that if Nigeria does not kill corruption, corruption will kill Nigeria. It is heart-warming that it is not a war for the President alone, but the people have bought into it. That, for me, is a big achievement.
</p><h4>Reducing the economy's reliance on imports and strengthening the 'Made in Nigeria' brand has been one of your ambitions as President. Which sectors have embraced this the most, and in which ones would you welcome more FDIs to support local manufacturers?</h4><p>
	The bid to look inwards, and patronize what we produce in Nigeria, cuts across many sectors. That was why we had about 41 items placed under import restriction by the Central Bank. We need to develop our own local capacities, and one of the sectors where this has been most pronounced is in Agriculture. We used to spend about five million dollars daily importing rice, but now, we have the Anchor Borrowers' Program of the Central Bank, which has encouraged a lot of people into farming. Many farmers have become wealthy, and Nigerians are consuming rice grown locally. Same with other food products. It's very encouraging, and a veritable way to diversify our economy away from sole dependence on petroleum. We will continue to focus on improving local capacities, and will also welcome foreign investments in diverse areas like agriculture, mines and steel development, manufacturing, and many others. It is a good time to invest in Nigeria, with very good returns.
</p><h4>How important is it for Nigeria to prioritise investing in its large young population and what are the ways the FG plans to do so?</h4><p>
	We are a country with vibrant and robust youth population. But the sad thing is that due to many decades of poor leadership and ineffective utilization of resources, many of the youths have not been catered for. Many millions of them are either unemployed or under-employed. It is sad, and it formed a major plank of the campaign by my party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). We are trying to harness the boundless energy of our youths for national development. They are, therefore, at the heart of all our policies, be they on agriculture, solid minerals development, manufacturing, and so on and so forth. Whatever we do is meant to create job opportunities for youths, so that they may find self-realization, and fulfil their potential as future leaders.
</p><h4>
	Our TBY Analytics last year found that while Lagos and Abuja continue to drive economic growth, other centres such as Kano, Bayelsa, Kaduna, and Ibadan are also seeing increasing economic activity. What initiatives does the FG have to support decentralisation of the economy and see growth throughout the country?
</h4><p>
	Now, almost all parts of the country are involved in one thing or the other. Farming activities go on round the country, and God has blessed us with good rainfall in the past three farming seasons. Mineral resources are being discovered in different areas. Almost every part of the country has something to bring to the table, in the bid to reshape our economy.
</p><h4>
	What is your vision on the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) implementation, and how exactly does the FG plan to achieve the ERGP's goal of 7% GDP growth by 2020?
</h4><p>
	The ERGP is meant to build a sustainable foundation for the Nigerian economy. We envisage a 7% GDP growth by 2020, and that would set the country on the path of solid growth. We have enunciated policies that will enable us achieve the vision, and while oil would remain vital and important to us, it would not be our sole revenue earner. That is the intention of ERGP, and we will get there.
</p><h4>
	What measures are being adopted to weather the challenge of insufficient power supply and infrastructure, and how is Nigeria going to power its envisioned economic growth?
</h4><p>
	Power supply is something we are working on very hard, and we are gradually seeing results. In September 2017, we attained 7001 megawatts generation capacity, something unprecedented in the history of the country. Our target is to achieve a minimum of 10,000 megawatts by 2019. That would be a good foundation for national growth and development. It would also boost investors' confidence. We have all hands on deck, and we plan to deliver on our promises.
</p><h4>
	What message would you send to the international investor community about doing business in the country and to promote a positive image of Nigeria abroad?
</h4><p>
	Nigeria is a robust investment destination, and I am glad at the level of interest and enquiry we get whenever we go outside. At the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2017, the forum for business people was fully subscribed to. The interest in Nigeria by foreigners was quite salutary. And many of such are being followed up. On our part, we have also introduced measures to improve the Ease of Doing Business, with obstacles removed from the path of potential investors. Nigeria yields good returns for those who bring their investments here.
</p><h4>
	What is the current administration's foreign policy mainly focusing on, and what is your ambition for Nigeria's position on the global diplomacy scene?
</h4><p>
	Our foreign policy focus is also tied to our areas of priority. We relate with those who will advance our quests to secure our country, help us fight corruption and repatriate stolen funds, and those who will make positive impact on our economy.
</p><h4>
	What is your outlook for 2018?
</h4><p>
	Our outlook for 2018 is a continuation of what we have started, and which have begun to yield results. We will consolidate on those things, for the benefit of our people.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the strategic importance of the Mexican market for Uber?</h4><p>We are proud of what we have accomplished in Mexico to the point where today we are the third-largest country for Uber worldwide out of more than 80 countries. We have numerous success stories in the 45 cities where we operate, with Mexico City being the second-largest one out of more than 600 cities worldwide, Guadalajara the 10th and Monterrey the 16th. We continuously see more and more people wanting to use Uber not only as a form of self-employment but also a safe, reliable, and affordable option to travel. The role that Mexico plays is essential for the global portfolio of Uber and we are excited about the future, part of which is an integrated commitment that we have made for 2018. Publicly, we committed to tripling our investment in Mexico in 2017 and 2018. We will invest a total of USD390 million. With that, we expect to reach around 500,000 self-employment opportunities by December 2018, which means doubling the current number of active drivers. What is particularly exciting about that is the 500,000 represents around one economic opportunity for every 100 people in the country's economically active population.</p><h4>What challenges do you face that are unique to this market?</h4><p>One of the things I am particularly proud of is the transformation that Uber is undergoing, where we used to be a US-focused company, but now we start by listening, understanding, and receiving the feedback from local users in Mexico, and then developing solutions that work specifically for them. To serve these specific needs, the challenge always starts with safety: that is the first and foremost priority and we are absolutely obsessed with safety. We have continuously implemented various initiatives to provide safety and comfort to both drivers and riders. After that comes the quality of the experience and making sure we provide what drivers and riders need from us. The third priority is accessibility, which means making sure that our technology is available for everyone, regardless of what their background is or where they live. For example, today, 40% of our drivers used to be unemployed and 70% of them were incorporated into the formal economy for the first time thanks to Uber. We have a significant percentage of drivers who only drive for a few weeks or months because they have a particular target in mind or drive for Uber only a few hours per week in their free time. Therefore we have to help them exploring this opportunity and also make our technology as friendly as possible.</p><h4>How do you see Uber impacting congestion, particularly in Mexico City?</h4><p>One of the most fascinating things that we go after in Mexico is transporting more people in fewer cars. After we launched uberPOOL, we compared how traffic looks like with uberPOOL trips and how it would look like if those were individual trips. In just six months we have saved globally the equivalent of 55,000 metric tons of CO2, which equates to around 10,000 vehicles per year as these vehicles are only used 5% of the time. By looking at the data in Mexico City, one out of three trips is only one way, which means they are being complemented by other transportation options, many times public transportation, since Uber serves to complement the last mile necessary to get to our destination. There are immense benefits not only by taking uberPOOL trips, which is what we try to aim for, but also in those individual trips that can also be facilitated by sharing a trip when we know that two people are going in the same direction and have the split fare functionality to share a trip with someone they know.</p><h4>What other sectors in the Mexican economy have the need or opportunity for tech disruption?</h4><p>We also have UberEATS, where today we are in more than 5,000 restaurants in Mexico. We have seen double-digit growth in their sales through the facilitation of technology and have even gone further by adapting the business model by having less customer-facing operations and more back-end kitchens that offer the same value proposition but are only focused on delivering meals. We also have the potential in Latin America to use the Uber model that we are testing in the US to disrupt some of the other sectors. One could be the freight and truck brokerage industry that, in Mexico, works through phone calls and we can use technology to match supply and demand in real time here. Another example are the autonomous vehicles that we are investing in, which prove to be more efficient, safe, and hopefully accessible to the masses in the long term. There are various examples all over the place and this is what Uber is passionate about: using technology to disrupt sectors of industry that could work better for the benefit of the entire population and the cities where we operate.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Uber and ridesharing for the coming years?</h4><p>Related to the statistic that more people not only use Uber but use it more often, an interesting finding is that around 10% of our users have either sold their cars or abandoned their plans to buy one because they know that they can push a button and get a ride in any corner of the city at any time of the day. An entire urban design can be literally transformed when we think about how cities dedicate around 30% of their space to parking spots. In the US there are eight parking spots per vehicle and if we were to put them together that would make up an area 12 times the size of New York City. It is amazing the possibilities we have to transform our cities to have less parking spots, more parks, and less congestion and contamination for the benefit of citizens.</p><h4>What impact do you expect with your recently signed partnerships with AXA Seguros and Seguros SURA?</h4><p>We launched a partnership with AXA and Seguros SURA in order to provide coverage to every trip in Uber. We have the best coverage in terms of liability for third parties, passengers, drivers, and contingent coverage for property damage, vehicle theft, and coverage for personal accidents. What we are really excited about is that this will not represent additional costs for either riders or drivers and this speaks of the kind of disruptions not only in our focus in the industry but in the entire ecosystem and value chain. What we are doing is innovating and we have the potential to transform the insurance industry because with the entire data and visibility that we will have of all the incidents, we can become more intelligent and data driven to manage risk efficiently and provide the best value proposition for both drivers and riders. That is what is truly impactful about this alliance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the identity of Espinas Hotels?</h4><p>We have always believed we should see our customers not just as tourists but as businesspeople as well. We established the Espinas Persian Gulf Hotel located downtown in the heart of the city near museums and other attractions. This hotel is mainly for the tourists who come from all over the world and all over the country. We established the Espinas Palace for business people. This hotel is far from the city center, but has many conference rooms, halls, and business centers. In addition, it has excellent access to the international fairs and the summit center; therefore, it is targeted directly at the needs of business people. Our next plan is to establish another hotel in Tehran for the diplomatic corps and for summits at the presidential level. Right now, it is under construction, so we are using Espinas Palace for this purpose as well. In our one year of operations, we have hosted many presidents and prime ministers from all over the world. Espinas Palace features a conference hall with a capacity for 2,500 people; no hotel in Iran has such a facility. We can provide both businessmen and the diplomatic corps with any kind of facilities for meetings and seminars, and in addition we can provide them with a cultural experience. Our guests can stay here and attend business sessions and concerts, without the inconvenience of traveling from one point to another point or being stuck in traffic.</p><h4>Iran wants to increase the number of inbound tourists to 20 million by 2025. Do you think this goal is achievable?</h4><p>Iran has great potential in this regard. The rich cultural heritage of Iran appeals to people throughout the world and can attract many tourists. We have many monuments and ancient sites and an impressive history. We also have advanced hospitals with professional and well-educated staff, so many people from neighboring countries come here for medical tourism. Iran also has the potential to attract more people for religious tourism purposes. These three factors, combined with the Iranian hospitality and gastronomy, make Iran a top tourism destination. On top of this, tourists can enjoy different landscapes and weather conditions, from skiing areas in the mountains to hot deserts. We can attract more tourists, but the government should formulate a strategy. The number of tourists and businessmen has increased after sanctions were lifted; however, it seems that the JCPOA signatories are just lifting the sanctions gradually. As such, the number of tourists and businessman has increased gradually. I am waiting to see a further increase once the sanctions are fully lifted. There is great interest to be active in the tourism sector, and the government is trying to support it. The tourism industry is labor intensive and has the capacity to create many jobs, unlike industries where labor is replaced by machines.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the need of investments in Iran's hospitality infrastructure?</h4><p>We welcome international investors, though not only in the hotel establishments because local businesses can come up with that. We need international investors for airlines and for entertainment and recreational activities, such as cruises. In this way, guests will extend their stay in Iran. The average occupancy of hotels in Tehran is around 40%; however, Espinas Palace has a rate of 70% because of its multifunctional character and the amount of facilities we provide to our guests. There is no need for more accommodation in Tehran, but we do need other infrastructure. After lifting the sanctions, Iran was able to purchase new airplanes, so the number of seats grew. At the same time, we need our airports to have more terminals and better facilities to receive guests, both for local and international flights. Renovating and developing the airports should be the first priority. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tourism Bank offers a wide range of banking services to all Iranians. How do you differentiate yourself as a specialized bank in the tourism sector?</h4><p>As the first specialized private commercial bank in Iran, Tourism Bank has targeted the tourism industry as one of its essential strategies with customer-focused services and a commitment to deliver value. Tourism Bank differentiates itself as specialized bank in tourism industry by understanding and fulfilling sector's financial needs. We set up the Tourism Club, which is designed to provide special travel and hotel services to its members. Being a member of the Tourism Club will enable individuals to receive special services such as discounts from travel agencies, hotels, recreational centers, restaurants, and shopping centers that have contracts with the club. As an agent to the Iranian Development Fund, Tourism Bank provides exclusive financing plans for hotel and other touristic facility projects. We have already financed many new hotels across the country. Iran has a lot of attraction in tourism. We have a vast capacity and potential to grow and invest. Our present aim and purpose is to provide sufficient infrastructure for tourism in Iran. So far, we have invested in establishing many hotels and tourism facilities in the country. We hope to continue this way in our future transactions. </p><h4>Your bank aims to gain market share by introducing new credit and financial services and products. Could you elaborate on these innovative efforts?</h4><p>Tourism Bank is a young dynamic brand with an old sense of banking. Combining flexibility and excellency is what we believe in at Tourism Bank, and offering tailor-made services to our clients is what we know as innovation. So far, we have created new banking products that may be used specifically for traveling purposes. Some of our key products are the Gardesh Card, which is a unique debit card that is provided to all members of the Tourism Club and enables the holder to enjoy spending , receive discounts from selected outlets, and collect reward points. The card enables foreign visitors to exchange their funds to Iranian rial, while using any ATM machine in the country, or to pay through POS machines in Iranian rial within the country. On the other hand, the Tour Card is meant for Iranian tourists traveling abroad. Tourism Bank has obtained all required licenses to render international services to its clients. Today, we have more than 30 corresponding bank in Europe and Asia, and this number is growing rapidly.</p><h4>How will Tourism Bank capitalize on new business opportunities that go together with the investments in Iran's tourism industry to increase the number of inbound tourists?</h4><p>Tourism Bank concentrates on trust, proficiency, and the highest standards of integrity. Each goal needs its own efforts and creativity to be achieved. To benefit from future inbound tourists, we intend to increase our registered capital up to USD1 billion in the next five years. This will enable the bank to improve its operational capacities. On other hand, as a member of private banking clubs we are entitled to finance large projects through syndicated loans. It is anticipated that, within five years, the number of incoming tourists will grow to more than 20 million. In order to welcome these tourists, we have to prepare a lot of infrastructure and facilities. This is why we think that more than one tourism bank is required to expand this field of activity in our country. To this end, we will be trying to get the help and assistance of other banks. We are going for a kind of syndicated loan or syndicated financing for the tourism sector in our country. As far as I have discussed with the managing directors of other Iranian commercial banks, they are willing, and they have accepted our role as a leader in this field. We will prepare to handle this influx of tourists to Iran. So far, we have discussed our plans with several foreign banks and they have been eager to invest in our tourism sector as well. In addition to Iranian partners, we are also looking for foreign partners. Tourism bank presented its banking model in one of UNWTO's sessions to an international audience. They seemed to be impressed with the model. Naturally, we are prepared to collaborate with all international organizations who are interested to pursue our business model.</p><h4>How do you assess the efforts taken by the Central Bank of Iran to implement Basel II and III standards in the banking system?</h4><p>The Central Bank of Iran has taken serious steps to lead the Iranian banking system to adjust itself to the latest international banking rules and regulations. Anti-money-laundering statements and procedures have been approved, and risk management systems are practiced now in almost every Iranian bank. Internal audit departments are now an inseparable part of a bank's organizational chart. In order to reflect on our own capital adequacy ratio, we have started a corporate governance department. Corporate governance is taken seriously at Tourism Bank, and all departments have been set up and equipped with well-trained, young team members and latest global technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>HEGTA was established to increase cooperation among its subsidiaries. How do you pursue this goal?</h4><p>HEGTA is the biggest tourism holding in Iran and consists of seven companies that are all leaders in their field. RAJA Rail Transportation Company, the Homa Hotel Group, the Abadgaran Iran Tourism &amp; Welfare Complex, Anzali Dehkadeh Saheli Residential Complex, the Social Security Refah Gostar Company, Iran Touring and Tourism Investment Company, and Tamin International Travel Tourist Services Company have been working together, and because of the synergy between these companies, they have been working more efficiently. For example, we host the people who travel with RAJA Rail Transportation Company in our hotels all over the country. The revenue of these companies has increased since the establishment of HEGTA, and it has helped us to attract more customers and guests. HEGTA as a brand is developing both in Iran and abroad. Other companies have more trust in our subsidiaries because they are attached to the HEGTA brand. The activities of our seven affiliated companies are clearer and more integrated so that they can play a more important role in the tourism sector and the Iranian economy.</p><h4>How well is Iran on track in achieving the goal of 20 million inbound tourists by 2025?</h4><p>The government is working hard to prepare the infrastructure to achieve this goal. After many studies, the 100 Hotels, 100 Businesses plan was created to increase the quality and quantity of Iran's hospitality infrastructure. The plan involves the construction of 100 hotels in the 31 provinces across the country and entails comprehensive decision-making. Approximately 250 projects have been introduced so that potential investors can choose which may be of interest to them. For some projects, among others in Isfahan and Hamadan, investors have already started to gain the necessary licenses and permissions. The 100 Hotels, 100 Businesses scheme has made the whole world aware that we want to develop the tourism sector in Iran. We aim for the construction of four- and five-star hotels and some three-star hotels in smaller cities. We used to develop plans based on investor demand, but we changed to developing plans to advertise them and attract investors' attention. </p><h4>How has the 100 Hotels, 100 Businesses initiative been received by investors?</h4><p>We have received many good offers from well-known foreign investors, especially following the International Tourism Conference. At the moment we are investigating these offers and working on them. With the 100 Hotels, 100 Businesses scheme, HEGTA wants to establish mutual investment projects with either foreign or local investors. These people know that HEGTA is a trustworthy and secure partner for investment projects. Foreign investors can also obtain interesting fiscal incentives, such as tax exemptions from five to 13 years. We see many local investors who are ready to work in a joint venture with international investors. We aim to ensure that tourism is seen as the number-one investment opportunity in Iran. HEGTA is positive about partnerships with local investors too as they appreciate the opportunity that the tourism industry offers. We decided to develop and modernize the tourism sector in Iran and are preparing ourselves from an administrative, banking, and regulatory point of view to facilitate this. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p>We hope that the strategies that we have implemented in railways, transportation, and hotels will reap their benefits in 2017. One new development that we have not announced anywhere yet is that we will move into medical and health tourism in 2017. One of HEGTA's companies will work together with the private sector to accomplish this. The Social Security Organization already manages 400 clinics and 70 hospitals. The hospitals and skilled doctors in the private sector have shown a lot of interest in cooperation in this sector and we are excited to start this new partnership. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ICHHTO has articulated the target of 20 million inbound tourists by 2025. How well on track is Iran in this regard, and what needs to be done to realize this goal?</h4><p>ICHHTO follows the government's 2014 strategic roadmap. Every agency in the country must follow this plan in order to reach the country's goals. Increasing the number of inbound tourists to 20 million is just a quantitative goal that we will use as a tool to help develop the country's economy, and, if we follow the right approach, we can reach this goal in the next eight years. Tourism is always affected by political issues, and the number of inbound tourists depends on Iran's global political status. The inbound tourism rate is not always dependent on internal policies. Implementing the JCPOA has allowed us to demonstrate our stability to tourists and increase their confidence in the country. We have a long task ahead to reach this goal of 20 million inbound tourists and will require an annual increase of around 8% to achieve it. We focus on various ways to reach this target. For example, we are marketing Iran as a tourism destination and highlighting the interesting opportunities the country offers to visitors. Our approach is to highlight to the world the attractions of all our provinces and demonstrate that Iran is a safe destination for tourists and is full of opportunities. We want tourists to know that it is easy to come to Iran and that they and their families will be safe when they come here. We seek to diversify the tourism offering in the country to cater to a wide variety of tourist demands and tastes. For example, we have the village tourism industry as well as the health and cultural tourism segments. We are creating opportunities for the long term and are diversifying the range of tourism packages and destinations we offer. ICHHTO participates in various tourism conferences and forums in Iran. By using all the tools at our disposal we are working to find the right approach to reach the 8% yearly increase in inbound tourists we require and achieve our goal of 20 million by 2025.</p><h4>In which segments do you see potential to attract more tourists over the coming years?</h4><p>There is great potential in all segments of the tourism industry here. We are working through the opportunities in each segment under our plan. These include great opportunities in both village and medical tourism and a wide range of natural and cultural attractions, such as marine, desert, and UNESCO sites. We have a different plan in place to promote each segment. For each province in Iran, we can focus on one of these segments and plan our tourism promotions around that.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the need for new hotels in Iran?</h4><p>We only experience this problem in the high season, when there is a shortage of accommodations in certain provinces, such as Fars and Isfahan. Other provinces do not have this issue as we are already developing new accommodation in some areas. We will resolve the accommodation issues with the help of the private sector and foreign investors who will build new hotels. We now have around 530 eco hotels in Iran, which appeal to tourists. In provinces like Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Bushehr, Hamadan, and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari we do not have any infrastructural problems because we have excellent four- and five-star hotels there. If we want to attract international tourists, we have to adopt the international standards they expect.</p><h4>What is ICHHTO's strategy to attract the foreign investment that may be necessary to give impetus to Iran's tourism industry?</h4><p>We are currently designing an investment plan for foreign investors that includes incentives such as loans that investors can obtain from Iranian banks to carry out tourism developments here. Prior to the JCPOA, there were some financial limitations on foreign investors here; however, Iran is now able to conduct transactions with international markets and trade with other countries again. As a result, there are now a number of investors that are willing to come and build or repair hotels around the country. Their main concern at this moment is the market instability in Iran and also the limitations and lack of services in the country. On the other hand, with the help of other ministries, we provide foreign investors the various facilities they need. We introduce them to banks to facilitate loans and other financial arrangements they might require to conduct business here. We also show them the processes required to obtain licenses in the country. The government and the private sector will assist those companies that are prepared to come here and repair or build new hotels in the country. We welcome brand hotels to come and establish chains here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pharmas-good-karma]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Barkat Pharmaceutical Group is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Iran. What is your strategy in further growing the company?</h4><p>Our main priority is to establish new companies based on PPPs. We implemented this strategy last year and so far it has led to the establishment of three companies. We also want to establish new joint ventures with foreign investors and foreign pharmaceutical companies. We have already established one with a Spanish company that manufactures fertility, menopausal disorder, and contraceptive products with a capacity of 20 million tablets annually. We are also engaged in talks with the top pharmaceutical companies in Europe. Hopefully we can start new projects based on partnerships with these companies. Another goal in further developing Barkat is to grow our sales market by increasing our exports. We have a large production capacity in Iran and have already established branches in Iraq and several CIS countries. Also, we aim to invest in small, knowledge-based companies that develop new molecules, which will be used to develop finished products. These companies are young, flexible, and high tech, and we want to support them by partnering with them. Our activities can be divided into three categories, namely chemicals, biotech, and advanced therapy. Our chemical division produces 450-500 items for the Iranian market. Biotech is a big focus for us, as the sector is growing rapidly throughout the world. We have invested more than USD100 million in biotech in the last 20 years. In our advanced therapy division, we work on replacing and regenerating cells and organ tissue. We have received the release permission from the Ministry of Health and hope to be able to start working with gene therapy soon. This gene therapy could be used in the treatment of non-solid cancers such as blood cancer.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the lifting of sanctions on your operations?</h4><p>The health sector was never subject to sanctions, but we still faced difficulties with financial transactions. Buying API or equipment would cost us more because we needed to buy from second or third parties. At times, we signed contracts that, in the end, could not be honored because of transaction issues. Now that sanctions have been lifted, the payment procedure will be easier. Before and during the sanctions, not many companies came to Iran to explore the market. This is different today. We have a partnership with top US and European companies regarding cancer therapy and related products. One of these companies also offered us a financial package that was not possible before the lifting of sanctions. It is important to implement international standards in Iran. When we want to export to new markets, we need to show the quality of our medicines. Under sanctions, we faced difficulties with this documentation process. We are working on the implementation of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines and hope to receive the GMP certification for our manufacturing facilities soon.</p><h4>How do you assess the attractiveness of the Iranian pharmaceutical industry for foreign investors?</h4><p>Barkat Pharmaceutical Group is constructing a pharmaceutical industrial and scientific park that is a good base for investment in pharmaceutical manufacturing and related services. Already, 16 companies have bought property here, among them reputable companies such as Novo Nordisk from Denmark and Vitabiotics from the UK. With its manpower and high level of education, Iran has the relevant assets to develop into a knowledge-based economy. Pharmaceutical companies can contribute to such development. Iran has 80 million people and 110 pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Our labor force and knowledge base make us the strongest in the Middle East. With the good cultural and political relationship with other countries in the region, such as Iraq, Syria, and some CIS countries, Iran can become a regional medicine hub. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role have agricultural cooperatives and pertaining trading sectors played in the development of the agriculture sector in Iran?</h4><p>The agriculture sector is an important sector of Iran's economy, which is underscored by the fact that the country has more than 4 million farmers. Including the families that they sustain, 20 million people or a quarter of the population depend on jobs in the agricultural sector. The agricultural cooperatives network is a network of local, regional, and national cooperatives that dates back 50 years. These cooperatives are shareholders in Iran Agriculture Investment Co. We have 11 national cooperatives that focus on different agricultural segments, such as livestock, bees, and oil seeds. Iran Agriculture Investment Co. endeavors to help them and to increase the efficiency and productivity of the agriculture sector. We also arrange imports of agricultural goods that Iran does not produce enough to fulfill the needs of the local market. During sanctions we had to work through a dealer, because we were unable to have direct contact with sellers. Now we will serve our shareholders with a direct connection. We also support the farmers and cooperatives in marketing their products outside of Iran. We take part in international exhibitions, especially in European countries. We will be present in international fairs in Cologne and Paris, where we will showcase the products of the cooperatives of Iran.</p><h4>How do contracts with foreign counterparts assist in your activities?</h4><p>We produce certain important agriculture products and are the world's largest producer of horticulture products such as saffron, pistachio, apricots, and caviar. Moreover, we are the world's second-largest producer of well-known regional products such as dates and pomegranates. We have excellent products and seek opportunities to improve our connections with the market. We have a contract with IMEXAN GmbH, and it now represents us in markets and exhibitions, though it is not the only company that we work with. We have contracts with large foreign companies and farmer cooperatives in Europe, such as ICS, Avril, and FNPSMS. ICS helps us with irrigation systems. Avril is the market leader and largest producer of rapeseeds. FNPSMS is a French national federation of sorghum and maize and oversees eight large French companies that used to be in Iran. We have this connection because it is a federation like us, with companies that are familiar with Iran and supplied us with seeds that are compatible with our climate and soil. We are a net exporter of agricultural products and an importer of technology. Our contracts with these companies help us serve our network with new agricultural solutions.</p><h4>How can foreign investors and agricultural companies seeking to enter Iran participate in your investment projects?</h4><p>We seek investors; after the sanctions, we are in need of new agricultural technology. For example, Iran is by far the largest producer of saffron in the world. Yet, production is mainly done by hand without any machinery. The same goes for harvesting tomatoes. If we had the right equipment, we could make these processes more efficient and increase profitability. We could partner with companies that want to invest in the automation of agriculture in Iran. There are many opportunities for investment in Iran, such as machinery, food processing, and importing new technology for seeds or pesticides. During sanctions, we could not import good pesticides and the products used were not of high quality. Some imported low-quality pesticides destroyed many gardens in Iran. We are interested in quality pesticides, which investors could help us with. There are also opportunities for investors in trading activities. They could set up an office in Iran and purchase products to repackage and export. We can be the local partner for investors both in long-term strategies, such as factories, and short-term investment opportunities. <em></em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate HEPCO's evolution, including its acquisition by Hydro Atlas?</h4><p>My background lies in Hydro Atlas, and with this company I recently acquired HEPCO. About 45 years ago, Hydro Atlas was the exclusive agent for Atlas Copco from Sweden, and at the same time HEPCO was the Liebherr agent. Around 10 years ago, the government adopted policies to transfer companies to the private sector. Among these companies was HEPCO, which now is 61% privately held with the rest belonging to various investors on the stock market. At the moment, HEPCO is not in a good position. Some years ago the sanctions ended long-lasting partnerships with companies such as Liebherr, Komatsu, and Volvo. We decided that we could not stop our business and we would start to produce by ourselves. We started cooperating with some Chinese companies, but we found out their quality was not sufficient so we stopped and focused on our own capacities. Today we produce machinery such as excavators, motor graders, and rollers under our own name, and we have a plan for producing HEPCO-branded dozers. Now that sanctions have been lifted, we are also interested to resume some partnerships. We asked Liebherr and Komatsu if they wanted to come back and reestablish themselves in Iran through HEPCO. We have a short- and a long-term strategy. For this year, we have a plan to produce about 500 units of new machinery, and we are also going to take one deal to produce about 3,000 units for the next two years. We have around 2,000 employees working at HEPCO. Around 80% of HEPCO consists of producing machinery, mostly mining and construction machinery. Another 20% consists of some other project lines, such as complex high-tech steel structures that can be used by the oil and gas industry and others. We have contracts with European companies such as Siemens and Liebherr in these project lines. When we go to produce the heavy machinery, we make a product that will stay in production for several years, but we acknowledge the need to stay active and innovative at the same time. Therefore, we have allocated 20% of the company's resources and capacity to R&amp;D. In the future, I think Hydro Atlas will concentrate on the cranes business, and HEPCO will concentrate on the construction and port business.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook for economic development in Iran? </h4><p>We believe the perception of Iran has improved and will continue to do so. Recently, Iran signed a large contract with Total, and they came because they found out that it is safe in Iran and can trust us. It is going to get better day by day, but the entire world economy is in a bad situation, which started in the US and is coming through Europe to the Middle East. In the next 10 years, the price of oil will continue to fall, and in the future, gas will become more important. The largest holder of gas reserves is Russia, followed by Iran. This is something investors are thinking about.</p><h4>How is the agriculture business going?</h4><p>In the agriculture business, we are doing better than in construction. We now work with good companies such as New Holland, and we have a contract to produce 1,000 units next year. We are going to start a new line of machinery for port solutions, and we are in the process of signing a contract for this. We have some special machines and robots that are unique in the Middle East, and the quality of the products we produce is of a quality comparable to international standards</p><h4>Are you looking to grow your exports to increase your international footprint?</h4><p>One of the conditions that I asked from the big companies that want to get back to Iran and partner with HEPCO, is to get the permission to export to other countries. We have other brands in HEPCO, and these days, our grader is number one in the Middle East as it has the best quality and price. In our business, brands tend to have a limited portfolio of products. We want to produce the whole package in the future. As part of our strategy, our exports will develop phase by phase. We will start with the neighboring countries like Iraq and Pakistan. In the next four years, we will export to our neighbors, and in the following years, we will think about exporting to other countries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what do you attribute the successful transition of SEKAF from a small family business to the diversified holding it is today?</h4><p>Our success is based on our commitment to quality and on-time delivery to our clients. Customer satisfaction is a crucial focus for us. We also consider every employee a member of the family. We trust them and expect that this is mutual. Customer satisfaction, transparency, and the relationship between personnel and management are the main pillars of our continued success. After the end of the Iran-Iraq War, there was a high demand for the construction of new buildings. SEKAF's policy was to diversify, so that if one sector of the economy faced problems, the company could profit from other sectors, allowing the company to grow continuously.</p><h4>What are the main projects in which SEKAF is involved at the moment?</h4><p>SEKAF has three departments, namely energy, road and railways, and buildings. In the oil and gas industry, we have two EPC contracts in gas compressor stations. Next to this, we work on the refinery and polishing system in the Kangan area. To the southeast of Iran, we will build a 75-km, 36-in pipeline in the second part of 2017. We are constructing a 110-km railway project from Tehran to a nearby city called Varamin. This project is important to the country. We are also constructing the Shiraz Metro and a 25-km highway in a hilly area near the city of Kerman. In our building department, we are working on a business mall with 65,000sqm in the Pasdaran area. We are building the Tajrish Police Station and 1,456 flats in Karaj. This project consists of four phases. In each phase we construct seven buildings, and each building has 52 apartments. Our strategy is to get involved with projects that are of strategic importance to the country. </p><h4>What is your strategy for reaching foreign companies to partner with?</h4><p>It is in the mutual interest of foreign and domestic companies to close partnerships. Companies entering Iran need a local partner that knows the rules and regulations, and understands the business environment in Iran. At the same time, we are looking for new knowledge, innovation, and management systems, with which foreign companies can help us. Foreign companies choose to partner with SEKAF because we are trustworthy and transparent. We understand the nature of partnership. Our experience in different industries demonstrates our capabilities. We have, therefore, been collaborating for over a year with a company named Ferramedia. It is an organization that creates cross-functional enterprises of several kinds of businesses worldwide. It manages the full cycle of a project, from inception and funding all the way to the final execution with the support of a strong community of private and institutional partners. Ferramedia is helping SEKAF to develop the Iranian market and is bringing in Italian companies and expertise in the fields of railways, renewable energy, and food and beverages. Also, we are currently in touch with Japanese and South Korean companies that want us as their construction partner. We are also negotiating with an Italian company for gas-related services.</p><h4>Are you looking to further diversify your portfolio of activities? </h4><p>We are already present in many sectors. Within the oil and gas industry, our activities include pipelines, refineries, and gas compressor stations. On top of that, we construct roads, rails, metros, and buildings. Recently, we have been looking to enter the clean energy industry, in partnership with the Italian company SITA. We are particularly interested in solar and wind energy. Also, we would like to expand to water projects, as herein lies one of the biggest challenges for the future of Iran. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Upping the Industry]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[upping-the-industry]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have Iran's aviation industry and IAC developed over the years?</h4><p>Iran established its first airport in 1922, and the first Iranian pilot landed at Ghale-Morghi airfield in 1926. Iran is one of the first signatories of the Chicago Convention. The most important changes in the airport industry came after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. IAC became independent from the Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) in 1999, which was the first indication of the commercialization of the aviation industry. Today, IAC manages 54 airports and offers a full scope of navigation and airport services within the Iran airspace. IAC is a unique company in Iran and the exclusive provider of air navigation services. We have 7,000 employees all around Iran and have the best locally trained air traffic controllers in the region, which could be our differentiator to be successful in the future. In the engineering sector, despite the sanctions, we have been able to perform our duties because of our qualified and skillful engineers. We have been operating independently and have successfully developed our own system. The Iranian aviation industry is relying on internal technologies and resources, especially human resources. We have managed to develop despite unjust and illegal multilateral sanctions for more than three decades. We are open to use modern technologies and capable of being a great partner for international companies; our human resources are capable to work abroad with international communities as well.</p><h4>How do you assess the status of Iran's airports, and how do you reflect on the need for investments to upgrade infrastructure and equipment?</h4><p>Iran is located in a geopolitically important region, between Europe and Asia Pacific, and has the potential to be one of the most important aviation hubs in the world. Iran is a vast country and has economically optimum airways between Europe, Middle East, and Asia Pacific cross over its airspace. In addition, we want to establish Iran as a transit hub, where we can also provide maintenance, repair, and operations services. Iran has 54 airports and 80% of air traffic activities are concentrated in eight major airports. We recently experienced a two-digit increase rate in aircraft movement in these airports, and these airports are going to be overloaded. We want to upgrade our existing infrastructure. This includes terminals, runways, equipment, and even constructing new airports. We also seek to improve our air navigation system equipment. For instance, Mehrabad International Airport experienced 19% growth annually. We have planned to develop the infrastructure and establish new airports, for example in Bandar Abbas and Bushehr, where there is no possibility of expanding the current airports. We also have planned to construct a large airport in Chabahar, one of the important port cities of Iran, and the international tender announcement for this project is going to be conducted soon. IAC will expand into a holding company to oversee other business units in the form of joint ventures with international companies. The first such experience will be at Mashhad International Airport, where we have planned to construct a new terminal in partnership with an international company. We have formalized agreements with European companies and are working on a contract to develop the airports. IAC invites all international companies to capture and exploit the unique opportunities of investment in Iran's airports and air navigation market, which offers significant returns. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Virtual Success]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[virtual-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SamanTel is part of Saman Financial Group. Why did the group decide to enter the telecommunications sector?</h4><p>SamanTel is not the first company in the Saman Financial Group operating outside the financial sector; we have other companies involved in satellites to enable communications between different banks. However, SamanTel is the group's first company to enter the high-tech ICT and mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) fields. The reason the bank entered this market is to bring the next level of services to its customers, because the next generation of the financial sector is dependent on ICT. For Saman Financial Group, covering the entire ecosystem is a crucial factor.</p><h4>SamanTel's vision is to offer basic and value-added services to the IT and telecoms fields. How are you implementing this vision?</h4><p>The main focus of the company is to bring core and value-added services to customers; however, the value-added services will come in different phases for customers. The first one we have focused on is financial value-added services, whereby we are implementing well-developed wallets for our customers. In the future we might enter into blockchain implementation. The first phase is addressing certain value-added financial services, and we will then enter other sectors and domains. One of SamanTel's goals is to be a pioneer and innovator in value-added services.</p><h4>Many other foreign and domestic companies have already expressed an interest in becoming MVNO service providers in Iran. What are your competitive advantages here?</h4><p>One of the main competitive advantages we have is the ecosystem the Saman Financial Group has created from its insurance company through to its investment company, a satellite enabling company, and the bank itself; this ecosystem is unique and complete. No other existing party in Iran has such modules in one ecosystem with one director. Another competitive advantage of SamanTel is our team, with people who are well developed in the ICT markets. The telecommunications market is not very large in Iran, with just three or four mobile network operators (MNOs) to date. There are thus not that many people in the industry in Iran. The team at SamanTel has been gathered from those operators and knows very well how to conduct the business of a mobile operator. Around 50 companies have expressed an interest in becoming an MVNO operator in Iran; however, many of them have already been eliminated from the list. There are various stages involved in getting a license and it is hard to get one. Each step in the process requires many different things in terms of financials, the team, infrastructure, and the contract with the MNO.</p><h4>What is your strategy to obtain market share in this increasingly competitive market?</h4><p>At this stage no company can say with certainty it will be the greatest player in the market. However, we can rely on our unique ecosystem and IT infrastructure. Being a mobile operator in Iran requires the approval of the Communications Regulatory Authority (CRA), and there is a similar regulatory authority for banks, namely the Central Bank of Iran. There are two regulatory bodies here trying not to infringe on each other's markets too much. For example, mobile operators in Iran seek to enter into the field of virtual financial wallets, which the central bank seeks to prevent from happening. Therefore, such regulations in Iran force Saman Bank to have a mobile operator. This puts Saman Financial Group in a unique position because it has a banking license as well as an operator's license. Together we can bring different value-added services to the market. There are not many companies in Iran that have both licenses.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have a full MVNO license, which is an important platform for technical implementation in terms of having the infrastructure and the operations side in place. At this stage we are just in the starting phase of establishing everything. In the next two years we will still be in the initial stage of making sure everything works together smoothly. Later, after that start-up phase we will be able to say we are an established operator and can start forecasting other business prospects. Also with our Wi-Fi technology and know-how, we are eager to provide these services in the Middle East region. With this technology we are not limiting ourselves to MNO functions. We will be able to provide different services in certain areas and in different countries as part of SamanTel's network with cooperation inside other countries. We are talking about everything over Wi-Fi, including voice services and data. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[shaping-irans-image]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the development of Shiva Rasaneh and its current role in the media services industry?</h4><p>We have been fairly active in the media industry, providing technical and media assistance to foreign TV and radio crews, newspapers, and journalists from across the globe for more than a decade. Shiva Rasaneh Company, compared to its counterparts, has significantly fulfilled its clients' needs and holds an esteemed status among the global media. Our young, energetic, well-experienced, and highly educated staff has proven to be absolutely effective in providing foreign media with audio-visual facilities. Moreover, in terms of our professional background cooperating with a large number of documentary-based companies, Shiva Rasaneh has extensive background in making documentaries as well. We have demonstrated our keen interest in sharing our knowledge and experience with others, too.</p><h4>How can the media play a role in the internationalization of Iran?</h4><p>As an effective means of communication, the media can play a crucial role in the world and provide an opportunity to governments to clearly express their ideas and effectively communicate their message to people around the world. It is also worth mentioning that the economy and the media complement each other perfectly and are highly unlikely to survive separately.</p><h4>What services does Shiva Rasaneh offer to international media outlets?</h4><p>Our clients, hierarchically speaking, are prioritized and categorized in accordance with their needs. We professionally assist them in meeting their expectations in Iran. We help foreign media with different services and activities. We follow up on the process of issuing and receiving press visas. Moreover, we make media arrangements and fix interviews. We also help get the permissions to work as a journalist. Finally, we provide high-tech studios for live broadcasting. When it comes to offering a comprehensive package of technical and media services, there is no question that Shiva Rasaneh is the right partner. Shiva Rasaneh has had the pleasure of holding interviews with Iranian presidents, parliament spokesmen, and other high-ranking officials. Our company has also been highly privileged to collaborate with a countless number of universally recognized TV channels such as the BBC, CBS, ABC, RT, Al Jazeera, Vice TV, and many more. All these TV channels prefer to work with us, and this growing willingness is the key to our success.</p><h4>The media has been changing rapidly in the past years and has become more dynamic with the rise of social media. How do you adapt to this new landscape?</h4><p>The media has a leading role among all industries in conveying news, views, and other messages. News coverage is inseparably tied to the economy and politics. Naturally, politicians all make an effort to clearly get their message across through the help of the media. This is why superpowers have always struggled to gain control over this industry in order to impact public opinion. Similarly, the media can make a great contribution to many business traders to successfully advertise their products and draw people's attention to purchasing their products. Technological advancement has enabled us to fully satisfy our clients' expectations. If we had not succeeded in achieving such a goal, undoubtedly we could not have convinced them to stay with us.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>There are a number of far-sighted and forward-looking people in our company who make wise decisions and formulate our plans. They also evaluate the latest developments in the media industry taking place around the world. By participating in various international and national conferences and festivals, they not only identify accurately the basic needs and requirements most in demand by the media, but also take significant measures to practically apply all these changes and findings to our work. Shiva Rasaneh Company wholeheartedly has put its main concern in its slogan: Delivering impressive performance definitely yields spectacular results. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[meeting-needs]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the impact of the aluminum industry on Iran's economy?</h4><p>Because Iran is rich in energy, we can benefit from its availability at low prices. Iran produces 355,000 tons of aluminum per year and consumes 426,000 tons, and the country is a large importer, at 252,000 tons per year. Aluminum consumption has increased significantly since 2004, on average by 9% per year. Considering this trend, consumption will reach 655,000 tons in five years. The capacity in the downstream aluminum sector, such as sheets, strips, tubes, dishes, and gussets, is about 800,000 tons per year. At this moment around 5,000 people work directly for IRALCO while some 11,000 work in related factories and workshops. The aluminum-dependent industries employ 25,000 people in total.</p><h4>Iran seeks to significantly increase its aluminum output toward 2022. How will IRALCO contribute to increasing Iran's production capacity?</h4><p>We want to develop the aluminum industries, meet local requirements, and obtain foreign exchange incomes through exports. Also, we want to reduce operational costs and invest in local aluminum production units. The Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO) assigned IRALCO to formulate a long-term plan for the aluminum industries. IRALCO developed a framework for the production of 1 million tons of primary aluminum, 2 million tons of alumina, and 450,000 tons of petroleum coke. Iranian Alumina Development is set to produce 280,000 tons of alumina per year, while Almahdi Aluminium Complex will produce 110,000 tons. Hormozal has a target of 147,000 tons of alumina while IRALCO will have a total alumina production of 220,000 tons. The framework also includes downstream plans and plans to meet the need for bauxite.</p><h4>What is necessary to strengthen the competitiveness of Iran's aluminum industry?</h4><p>Despite the comparative advantages for aluminum production in Iran, aluminum prices are still higher than in other countries in the Gulf region. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce costs. It is important to do so if we want to meet the industrial development aims in the aluminum sector: providing domestic needs as well as earning foreign exchange incomes through exports. We want to conclude long-term contracts with major international suppliers for alumina, petroleum coke, and anode in order to obtain high-quality raw materials at low prices. We also want to reduce our electricity costs. Since most aluminum producing countries have granted electricity subsidies to the aluminum sector, it is important that the government grants us the same advantage. We constantly seek to improve our costs parameters, which are related to the costs of electricity, raw materials, and manpower to have a certain output. Modern technology can help us with this.</p><h4>You recently negotiated with NALCO from India for the supply of raw materials. What will be the benefits of this partnership?</h4><p>NALCO is one of the largest producers in India of high-quality alumina-powder, the most important raw material in the aluminum industry. IRALCO has been registered by this company for direct purchases and to participate in short- and long-term tenders without any intermediate agents. Doing away with such dealers gives us a better price. Thus far, IRALCO has succeeded in providing and purchasing more than 460,000 tons of high-quality alumina powder at the best price. IRALCO is the only producer in Iran that is permitted to purchase from NALCO. In addition to enjoying competitive prices for these purchases, we have been able to use governmental foreign exchange reserves—Indian rupees—which has allowed us to save at least USD18 million.</p><h4>What is your vision with regard to the international expansion of IRALCO and which markets are interesting to enter?</h4><p>Around 35% of IRALCO's production goes to exports and 65% of production is meant for the domestic market. Turkey is our largest foreign client. The world resembles a global village and economic and commercial interactions have become international necessities. IRALCO pays attention to the global market in line with the promotion of its downstream industry. We know that IRALCO-branded ingot is of high quality, and we are interested in entering the European markets with downstream products such as ingots.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We want to have stable, reliable, and cheap access to sources of alumina and carbon products. This aim can be reached through investments in the construction of alumina and carbon production plants. Another target for next year is to create a cooperative and clear market for aluminum-using industries. We want the Iranian Aluminum Syndicate to provide for its needs directly from IRALCO by making economic and cooperative units. In this way intermediate agents are omitted and the raw materials will reach the downstream industry directly. We also seek to implement certain renovation projects and invest in our manpower improvement plans, which will reduce production costs. I would also like to see electricity subsidies. Moreover, it would be helpful if the central bank set up credit lines with countries that produce raw materials for the aluminum industry. We would also like the central bank to provide us with facilities such as low-interest loans and letters of credit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[babatunde-raji-fashola-honorable-minister-federal-ministry-power-works-housing]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the ministry's most recent policies to help tackle the 80 million housing shortfall in the country?</h4><p>I see an opportunity to build a real housing economy. The policy is clear and undeniably global; to create affordable housing. That then morphs into various social housing concepts. All we are trying to do now is restart a national housing program that will unleash the housing economy here. Having a national program firstly entails knowing what the people want in terms of housing. Then we will know what our total construction plus infrastructure cost is, and this in turn will determine how much the houses are worth in the market. This defines the acceptability and affordability of housing here. The first leg of the housing economy is already underway; artisans are being employed and the solid minerals sector has grown positively for the first time after nine negative growth quarters. People are buying sand and other building materials, and there are quarrying activities happening. Around 13,000 people are directly engaged in construction and about 40,000 people are indirectly employed in the supply value chain. There are 653 indigenous Nigerian companies that are contractors and employing all these people. By the time we finish, the financial sub-sectors will also be involved, such as mortgages to support acquisitions, as well as the merchandising sub-sectors, for example furnishing the houses. I am focusing on the opportunity to do something that works and survives partisan politics.</p><h4>How will the government fund its housing projects given shrinking oil revenues?</h4><p>If we look at what government contributes to the GDP , it is barely 10%; the remainder comes from the private sector. Therefore, it is not proportionate to expect the government to bear the entire cost of funding houses. However, the government can initiate the policy and program, evolve the design, test the market, verify the principles, and support private capital to come in. This is what we are doing. We are running our pilot schemes in every state, and if they succeed, then we will multiply them 10-fold. The government, whether state or federal, will not have all the money for this. But the government can assist in certain ways because it has fiscal powers, policies, and the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN), so the government can become the financier of acquisition. Once the private sector sees that workers can get loans to purchase houses, then we will have created an incentive for the private sector to build. We are strengthening the FMBN to grant mortgage acquisition loans to workers and this is an incentive for the private sector to replicate our house building model many times more than we can. The money for this comes from the monthly contribution workers make to the National Housing Fund. In addition, we will soon announce a government guarantee for acquisitions through the FMBN. More importantly, we are thinking differently from before. We have to improve access for people in the informal economy to use vehicles, such as through cooperatives. For example, individual farmers cannot afford to buy a tractor, but each has a sum of money to form a cooperative and buy one tractor for them all to use. This model has worked in transport, farming, and refuse collection, now I want to test it in housing.</p><h4>How would you assess the power supply situation in Nigeria currently and what are your plans to increase power generation and distribution in the country?</h4><p>If we compare how much African countries have spent on power over the last two decades compared to western countries, Asia, and the Middle East, we can see the investment and therefore the results gap. It is perhaps in the latter half of the last decade that African countries have begun to pay more attention to their energy needs. Our energy issues have not defied solution; they have simply not received the kind of attention and investment that is needed. We have had decades of inaction. During these periods our population continued to grow. Now we are ramping up our response and the speed at which we are procuring more power now is consistent with our roadmap to get incrementally more energy, steady growth, and later to upgrade our power. In terms of incremental energy, we have increased production of power from 2,690MW when this government was inaugurated to 6,900-7,000MW today. In November 2017 we secured another 115MW from Gbarain and in December 2017 another 240MW on-stream. In March 2018 240MW will come in and by July 2018 another 40MW should be added. There are close to an additional 2,000MW coming in over the next three to 15 months in terms of production. At the same time Nigeria's national grid is expanding. We currently have around 33 transmission projects, many of which we will conclude between 4Q2017 and YE2018. Distribution projects are also being completed. This is a dynamic and evolving process, and Nigeria's transmission capacity is now close to our generation capacity. The real area of challenge now is the distribution side, because Nigeria's power generation capacity has outstripped its distribution capacity. We need to intervene and ramp up our distribution capacity. We are collecting data about where peak power needs to go from each of the distribution companies, where collection losses are lowest, and where there are more customers willing to pay. Then we will plan the roll-out of distribution equipment and how to fund it. Of course, this is the responsibility of the distribution companies, though we will give them as much help and as many incentives as we can. We are working with them, we have a clear plan, and, importantly, we have momentum. We can see that our program is bearing fruit and we want to keep going.</p><h4>Some private players in the power sector believe the electricity tariffs do not match the cost of investment, which discourages them. What is your response to these claims?</h4><p>That is one argument; another is that consumers are paying more than the tariff through their own self-generation, sometimes two or three times more. The question is what they can do to get consumers to trust them with that money, and the answer is that provide the service. Electricity providers have to meter because consumers are ready to self-generate power. If they provide the service, then clearly they will get more money and consumers want to see what they are paying for so they have to meter them. Another argument is the assumption that the tariff and unit costs will not guarantee recovery. Again, this argument is flawed because we only collect from disclosed consumers. Every distribution company must improve its means of auditing and censoring all the people consuming energy within its business area. They need to develop a consumer database. They are operating based on the consumer numbers given to them at the time of privatization, which is about 7 million consumers for the whole of Nigeria, which cannot be right. If they keep the same tariffs but improve the collection base, their income doubles. There is an assumption that the tariff is low when in fact the solution lies in collecting more from more consumers who are not currently paying for their electricity. In any event, ultimately the Federal Ministry of Power, Works, and Housing does not decide or approve the tariffs; that is not our job. There is a regulator with a statutory duty and the ministry does not stand in its way. Our responsibility is not just to help businesses, but maintain the balance for consumers as well. Indeed, businesses ultimately exist because of consumers. We all exist here for the consumers. It is difficult to store power and it is not as easy to control as other commodities where if the price is increased the commodity is still there. However, there is a trust breach somewhere that we need to bridge by improving service. Once people receive a better service their resistance to paying drops.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the power and housing sectors, and for Nigeria in general for 2018?</h4><p>2018 is clearly the year where we can expect to see some large advances. We should see more results in terms of the effect of our programs in the power and construction sectors, as well as how these drive other sectors like petroleum, bitumen, and diesel fuel for construction, along with all the industries that support construction and provide the inputs, like the steel industry and mining. This should be consistent with the real impact this government seeks to make in terms of investing in infrastructure to drive growth and development. 2018 will be a better year compared to 2017 in the same way 2017 was an improvement on 2016. This goes to show the trajectory of policies, the government gaining momentum, and change truly being imminent. In 2018 we will be measuring the results.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does IMIDRO support the development and international competitiveness of companies in the mining industries?</h4><p>IMIDRO is owned by the government but manages mining and the mining industries like a private-sector company. Our job at IMIDRO is to invest, either by ourselves or in partnerships or joint ventures with the private sector in Iran or foreign investors. IMIDRO is required to have at least a 49% share in every investment we do with private sector investors. We can get loans, provide finance, and enter joint ventures with other Iranian and foreign companies to invest inside or outside Iran. The government is keen to invest in the mining sector, and IMIDRO has a key role to play in this.</p><h4>What are IMIDRO's main activities in supporting mining companies and increasing their production output and international competitiveness?</h4><p>One of the major functions we have is to advance exploration. Iran is 1.6 million sqkm and, unfortunately, is behind in exploration. Iran is a mining country with deposits of 68 different minerals. Therefore, we invest and insist on investment in exploration. The mining industries are in an early stage of development. We have started with 250,000sqkm of exploration, and hopefully by YE2017, we will have good news for the Iranian people about new mines. Right now, Iran has more than 57 billion tons of potential mining reserves, and 3 billion of that is iron ore. We have to ensure we have sufficient investment in the mining sector. We believe we need USD50 billion in investment in the mining sector over the next five years. Some USD13 billion of that is going to be invested in steel and the rest will be spent in other fields, such as aluminum, copper, gold, zinc, and nickel. We are working to activate new projects in the mining sector as we did with zinc in Mahdi-Abad. We still have seven steel projects in Mobarakeh. At the National Iranian Copper Industries Company, we are working hard on the production of copper cathodes at Sar Cheshmeh and elsewhere. In gold, we have the Zareh Shuran and other mines.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the effects of the JCPOA on the feasibility of international partnerships?</h4><p>Hopefully, following the lifting of sanctions negotiated by the government, the path will be cleared for us to work with foreign companies. In 2017, we have had good meetings, many MoUs, and even some projects awarded. For example, in the fields of consultancy and the transfer of technology we have had good results. Right now, we have an overseas consultancy firm working in Iran as a contractor in the titanium segment. Iran has high tech know-how in steel, and we are self-sufficient. In copper, we have had some good meetings with companies like Glencore. We are also in touch with international companies in the gold segment, and we see a good chance of forming MoUs with and partnerships.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the share of Iran's mining industries in the domestic economy and its share in the global mining sector?</h4><p>It is best to adopt a strategy of not selling our raw materials. Iran has the gas and the experts to produce finished, value-added products. We do our best to produce our final products at a low cost, using high-tech processes. As a mining country, sometimes our demand and supply balance is not equal. Sometimes our supply is greater than demand, for example, in iron ore and steel. Our target for 2025 is to produce 55 million tons of steel in Iran, and more than 14 million tons of that will be for export. Therefore, we believe we need to have better relationships with other mineral-producing countries and companies. For example, in 2016 we exported more than 5 million tons of steel and part of that was to Europe. Healthy companies have to depend on exports, technology, lowering costs, and having sound HSE and environmental practices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your diversification strategy for the coming years? </h4><p>We are diversifying into different sectors under the name of our own investment company. This company will oversee four holding companies, which in turn will manage activities in energy, hospitality, finance, communications, and mining. In the energy holding, we will focus on oil, gas, and electricity. The hospitality arm will consist of hotels, travel agencies, and an airline business. Our financial holding will include brokerage companies and financial investments, and the mining holding will oversee our activities in the mining industry. It is important for foreign investors to understand that we are not only active in the power and electricity sector, but are highly diversified. We are even active in FMCG and home appliances and are negotiating with companies active in the fashion and apparel industry. We are open for negotiations and cooperation with international companies in every field we are active in.</p><h4>In which business units do you see room to grow in the near term?</h4><p>We are focusing on oil and gas, railways, power plants, and electricity. Our priorities will be the places and industries that are going to give us projects. Oil and gas will be one of them because there is a great need for investment there and a lot of room for a company like ours to grow. We see the railways as an important means of transportation, and the government wants to expand the metro and railway projects; hence, this is a huge market for us. The market for power plants is shifting toward a new generation of electricity with smart grid systems and solar and wind energy. We obtained licenses to construct new solar plants. Within the power plants division, we are moving toward renewable energy. We are trying to create smart solutions and build automation systems, and we believe the government should invest more in order to train people how to use and save energy. </p><h4>How are you making KTC a global brand and one of the best in the region? </h4><p>Some 10-15 years ago we started doing projects abroad: we had projects in Turkey and Tajikistan, and exported to other countries around the region and world. We are not only thinking of KTC as a local brand. One of the restrictions we had was related to the sanctions. After the signing of the JCPOA, we saw new opportunities coming in. We, as the private sector, have to capitalize on these. Local partners are key in facilitating your business when you move to other countries and help to facilitate in the establishment of the company. And, just like foreign companies need to connect with local partners in Iran, we need to connect with them to pursue our international aspirations. KTC is able to compete with international companies in terms of the state of our technology. On top of this, we have competitive advantages that result in lower prices for our products. We also have more affordable products than international firms. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are targeting the expansion of KTC and looking for opportunities in Iran and others markets, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. We are already starting some negotiations over partnerships with foreign companies. We need to expand our manufacturing facilities, because one of our limitations is insufficient capacity. We are also expanding in the smart grid and renewable energy sector. Energy is key to our country's sustainable development. We are also focusing on water, another major challenge. By bringing new products to the market we want to help the government in monitoring the usage of water. Moreover, we are looking to bring KTC to the stock exchange and are planning an IPO for the end of the year. This company is for all the Iranian people, and we would like to share it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the operational difference between Henkel Pakvash and Henkel Iran?</h4><p>Henkel business comprises three separate divisions. Adhesives and industrial technologies is the largest, with nearly half of the company's global turnover. The second largest division is laundry and home care, and the third is beauty care. Henkel Iran is currently a generic name referring to the business we have in Iran; however, it is not a legal entity as such, and it does not have any operational structure. Still, it helps us internally to build one corporate culture, and to harmonize and optimize our human resources policies and other shared services provided by different supporting functions.</p><h4>Henkel is a global brand, present in over half the countries in the world. How would you assess the significance of the Iranian operations for Henkel?</h4><p>Henkel has a clear strategy, and growth is the number-one priority. We cannot imagine intensive growth without having a strong footprint in the emerging markets. Iran is the last big emerging market that has not been approached yet by most global FMCG players. After the JCPOA, it came to mind first for most international companies looking for opportunities to expand. Henkel has a long-standing history in Iran that goes back more than 45 years, to the opening of the Henkel Industries factory. Its laundry and home care divisions started operations in Iran in 2002, with the acquisition of Pakvash business, while its beauty care division initiated marketing and distribution activities in 2016. The Iranian market has everything it takes to become one of the top 10 countries worldwide for Henkel.</p><h4>How did each of the business units perform over the last year?</h4><p>In 2016, the growth star was the adhesives and technologies division. This excellent performance was linked to the reenergizing of local industry following the gradual lifting of sanctions after JCPOA. The adhesives and technologies team did a fantastic job in recapturing the market opportunities, and launching new products for our end consumers. 2016 brought also an excellent start for the beauty care business, beyond expectations. Laundry and home care had another solid year, growing its market share and concluding a strategic acquisition. In general, our Iranian business delivered solid growth year after year, despite the macroeconomic challenges and fluctuating demand. </p><h4>Have you been able to successfully integrate these brands in your business and obtain synergies?</h4><p>Henkel is targeting both organic growth, consistently developing its base business, and growth through acquisitions. In Iran, we are now focusing on integrating the assets we acquired in 2016 from Behdad Chemicals. The first stage is to get the operations up and running fluently. Synergies will come at a later phase of integration, in line with our long-term plan. The objective is to turn this local brand with a fantastic heritage into a shining star in the Iranian and the regional markets.  We are quite happy with the progress and look forward to offering Iranian consumers more exciting innovations under their favorite brands.</p><h4>What prompted the decision to acquire local brands instead of introducing Henkel's international brands to the market?</h4><p>The board took this decision after recognizing the strong platform of this local brand, and the strategic fit to our portfolio. Besides, we want to keep on supporting the local authorities with their plan to develop local production and sourcing. This acquisition was a model for bringing foreign investment in a fully compliant way to develop the local economy. The local authorities are extremely open to serious investors and act very professionally when it comes to such investment projects. We received immediate, transparent, and full support from the Organization for Foreign Investment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Health, the Governor's Office, and every local authority. It made a big difference in terms of speed of decision and implementation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do assess the contribution of ICIIC to the development of the chemical and petrochemical industry in Iran?</h4><p>Established by the Bank of Industry and Mines, our company produces linear alkyl benzene, the main raw material for powder and liquid detergent. To produce this, we use a technology that we originally received from an American company called Universal Oil Products (UOP). We signed a contract 25 years ago with the London branch of UOP because of the limitations of dealing with the US. Our original capacity was around 50,000 tons per year, and we started production around 22 years ago. Domestic demand at that time was around 38,000 tons per year. The remainder of our capacity was exported to countries like India and Persian Gulf countries such as Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman. Around 12-15 years ago, we did our first expansion project and increased our capacity from 50,000 to 75,000 tons per year.  At that time, we increased the capacity to produce normal paraffin from 43,000 tons per year to 140,000 tons in our first expansion project. </p><h4>What is your strategy to stay ahead of the competition here?</h4><p>During the last few years, we sold around 75,000 tons of linear alkyl benzene to the domestic market, with which we fulfill 90% of domestic demand. Consumption of detergent in the country has increased from 2kg per capita annually 22 years ago to over 15kg now. In some European countries consumption is even at 35kg per capita. Before ICIIC was founded, all the linear alkyl benzene that was needed in Iran was imported, mainly from Spain, Italy, and Germany. After we started production, we delivered nearly the full domestic demand, and the average consumption of detergent increased. During the last two to three years, we negotiated with UOP London to receive its latest technology. Because of the sanctions, every time UOP said it was ready, something happened and we had to wait. After signing the nuclear deal, UOP agreed to start negotiations about providing us with this new technology. This resulted in a contract that was signed in late 2016. We are now conducting our second expansion project, which involves the removal of the dangerous HF acid from our production process while increasing the capacity by around 100,000 tons per year. Once completed, we will be able to produce around 200,000 tons of linear alkyl benzene per year.</p><h4>What is the export strategy of your subsidiary Commercial Port Services? </h4><p>We send our product by truck from Esfahan to Bushehr. From there, it goes to its final destination by vessel. We export to countries like India, China, Indonesia, and sometimes Turkey and Pakistan. We have some exports to Turkey by road as well.</p><h4>Are you targeting new export markets?</h4><p>We are looking at some African countries. When you go through the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea, places like Kenya and Sudan become interesting. We want to focus on the eastern part of Africa because it is important to be careful with transportation costs. Our competitor is a Spanish company that also produces linear alkyl benzene. From Spain, it uses the Mediterranean to transport its products; therefore, we need to be able to compete on transport costs when exporting to new markets. We have agreements with some experienced consultants to assist us in opening new markets. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>I am positive. Especially for petrochemical companies, the future will provide good market circumstances. Our product sales and exports increase every year, and our second expansion project and the application of the new catalyst technology will allow us to increase revenues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SAIPA is a dominant brand facing tough domestic competition. How can you increase domestic market?</h4><p>After a period of recession in the Iranian market, particularly in the automotive sector, we are seeing the vehicle market expand again. Average income has increased, which boosts the demand for cars, which results in fierce competition with numerous competitors from around the world entering the Iranian market. SAIPA also has some domestic competitors whose activities have increased considerably. Before I joined SAIPA, its domestic market share was 34%; now, despite this increased competition, it is 41% and growing. In 2016, we increased production by 15%, which the market can absorb.</p><h4>Are you looking for partnerships with international industrial conglomerates?</h4><p>We want to increase our exports to neighboring countries and are considering partnerships with overseas conglomerates to facilitate this. For example, SAIPA and Citroí«n have a joint venture in one of SAIPA's largest production factories in Kashan. This is a 50-50 joint venture with a solid business plan. Within two years, we will have three products from Citroí«n produced at this plant. SAIPA produced 600,000 cars in 2016, a figure that will be 1 million by 2020. To do so, we will have joint ventures with several companies, such as Citroí«n and Kia. Under these, 30% of the products will be dedicated to exports. By 2020, 50% will be produced domestically and 50% in joint partnerships.</p><h4>To which countries is SAIPA exporting and which are part of your international growth strategy?</h4><p>Over the last decade, we have been the largest Iranian exporter of cars, at 70% of all automotive exports. We have plants producing cars in several countries, including Iraq, Syria, Venezuela, and Azerbaijan. The most recent addition is Algeria, where we opened a plant in 2016. We fully own some of these plants, while others are part of a joint venture. We are also focusing on the production and export of vehicle parts both independently and with companies like Citroí«n.</p><h4>How are you working to become an international automaker?</h4><p>Our international marketing shows that SAIPA has the ability to compete in the regional market, which was proven when we managed to export the most cars during sanctions. Our cars are affordable and suit the purchasing power in this region better than most other players. Therefore our strategy is to focus on designing and manufacturing cars that our neighboring consumers can afford. We have contracts with Chinese carmakers because they can produce affordable cars at low prices. Therefore, in addition to our cooperation with Citroí«n and Kia, which produce higher-priced cars, we have been working with Chang'an, Brilliance, and Zotye from China to create affordable products for the regional market. Citroí«n has purchased 50% of the shares in SAIPA Kashan, and the members of the board of this joint venture have already started their activities in Iran. Within a few months, we will launch the first products under this joint venture. In terms of engines, we have worked with Citroí«n, which has so far invested USD100 million. It will increase this figure to USD300 million within the next few years. Meanwhile, Brilliance is investing USD100 million now, a figure expected to reach USD500 million in five years.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the upcoming years?</h4><p>After years of delay, we now see great opportunities for innovation in the sector. This is a great opportunity for international high-tech companies to come and invest in Iran. Consumer demand for cars in Iran has increased significantly to about 2 million cars per year. In addition to the potential for an extra million in the region, that makes 3 million altogether. Average incomes are increasing rapidly, and the population is young, so demand will grow as quickly as investment. Our turnover was USD3 billion three years ago, USD5 billion in 2016, and projected to be USD8 billion by 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the role that IDRO has played in the development of the industrial sector here in Iran?</h4><p>We have been involved in around 250 projects in Iran in the last 50 years. Our task is to invest in megaprojects and then privatize them after three years. We also work on projects that the private sector is not capable of or interested in. Our main responsibility is to invest in the railway, high-tech, and energy sectors. We also focus on educating young managers on the future of the country. We have around 37 projects in progress, amounting to about USD5 billion in financing. After the JCPOA, we have been in talks with large companies and have signed around 19 MoUs thus far. Around eight of them resulted in an agreement and are in the execution phase. We have six years of cooperation with South Korea in the automobile industry. Investing in the automobile industry is one of our main policies at IDRO, and we are a major shareholder in the two largest car manufacturers in Iran. We have around 80 million people in Iran, the majority of whom are young and want a good, affordable vehicle. We have to work on bringing that to them. We signed several agreements in the automobile industry including Peugeot, Citroí«n, Renault, Hyundai, and Mercedes Benz. In cooperation with Peugeot, we have started a production line that has already reached the market. </p><h4>How does IDRO fulfill its role as a pioneer in propelling Iran to become the regional industry and innovation hub?</h4><p>We invest in science and obtain technologies and configure them for our own use. We are proactive when it comes to technology. There are more than 3,000 knowledge-based companies in Iran, with young, educated, and talented experts. It is a fundamental part of IDRO's business to help these companies and show them the way. The second phase is financing and fundraising. We have many SMEs in the private sector that have problems with financing. We help and guide them to attract the necessary funds.  We want to use our credibility to solve the private sector's problems and provide guarantees to the banking system. Our policy is not to dominate the industrial sector, but empower the private sector. </p><h4>How can IDRO facilitate international industrial conglomerates in doing business in Iran?</h4><p>For example, Alstom, a well-known French company, wants to come to Iran and work with the private sector, and IDRO acts as a mediator to connect it to companies in the private sector. In Iranian petroleum contracts, one of the terms is that foreigners and global companies must have one local partner. Almost all of them want to work with IDRO as their local partner. IDRO is thus a bridge for global companies and investors entering Iran.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the next year, and what do you expect for IDRO and the industry?</h4><p>I am optimistic about the future. We are planning a new way and are currently in the middle of this effort. After the JCPOA, we started a dialog between Iran and other countries and are seeing different high-level delegations coming to Iran. As we move forward, we will see more results from the JCPOA. We have around USD4 billion in foreign investment in the industry and mining sectors. Projects worth USD1.5 billion have been executed in the last 18 months. More will come. Inflation has fallen from 45% to around 10%, though we still have problems with our industry due to a lack of liquidity. Our banks are not able to inject the required money into the development of SMEs or industry, and thus we need to have changes in this regard. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance has a responsibility to support the banking system. If all these improve, we will certainly move in the right direction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Half of expatriates living in Dubai for over 10 years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mustafa-vazayil-managing-director-gargash]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Gargash fare over the last year?</h4><p>2016 and 2017 were great years for Gargash, particularly in relation to new business and client acquisitions. The market was also beneficial as a result of the introduction of compulsory employee benefits medical insurance by the government. When we look at the underlying strength of our portfolio at in 2016, it was robust. We are dynamic and base our growth on various changing scenarios, while preparing our general capabilities to respond to and be proactive to emerging situations.</p><h4>A recent study found that Indian expatriates often do not have full insurance coverage because of the temporary nature of their stay in Dubai. How does Gargash cater to Indian expatriates?</h4><p>The reason why the insurance penetration levels are lower for Asian expatriates compared to the other expatriate communities is that insurance awareness is low in developing countries like India. On the other hand the European community is extremely insurance and risk aware while Asian communities have a more skeptical approach. However, there is growing awareness because of the mandatory health insurance and exposure to other risks, which results in new sectors of the population getting informed and involved with the insurance business. For many Indians in Dubai this is the first time they realize the advantages of the broad offerings of insurance companies. The life and protection insurance segment so far has especially low penetration levels because of the alleged transient nature of the expatriate population. However, over half of the expatriates here have been in Dubai for over 10 years. Most prefer to buy into pension schemes or similar products from their home country. The social security element in India is also rudimentary, unlike in Europe, where the government provides state pensions and public healthcare. In our experience the Indian attitude is still traditional; their children will look after them in their old age. However, with the globally increasing cost of healthcare and rising life expectancy, there is increasing awareness of the need for medical insurance in the Indian community, as well as need for pensions and savings.</p><h4>How do you reach out to the corporate community in Dubai?</h4><p>Since we cater to every business sector from construction to healthcare, hospitality, trading and manufacturing, it is clear that Gargash has to be able to adapt to the dynamics of the evolving economy in Dubai. Gargash's corporate business is increasing at a faster rate than our individual client base. Today, our corporate clients make up about 65% of our business. When we started, it was the other way around. Our exposure has increased significantly in recent years, giving us an edge in acquiring new corporate customers.</p><h4>How is competition between international and local insurance intermediaries in the Dubai market is likely to develop?</h4><p>There is always a place for both international and local competitors in a market like Dubai. The presence of international insurance intermediaries is required here because they handle global accounts and insurance programs. Companies like Gargash with our global networks are in a strong position to compete with them. In the end, the customer will decide who best caters to their needs on the basis of the quality of service we provide. We need to have the best expertise on the ground as a local company, while international players can fall back on their global expertise, though that comes with a delay factor. Our edge from a client point of view when we compete with these international companies is our expertise, network, and service. We are present in Dubai with a large organization and a well-established brand. Gargash is the only broker in Dubai accredited by the Chartered Insurance Institute in London as Chartered Insurance Brokers. This means we have in place a whole raft of systems, along with international compliance standards and annual audits for the benefit of our clients. We have maintained these standards for the last 11 years. This is the gold brand we carry and it makes a difference. Our bench strength of qualified people on the ground is much bigger than that of our international competitors. They have far greater resources globally, but on the ground, ours are stronger.</p><h4>Does Gargash have any regional expansion plans?</h4><p>We would like to be a regional player, though regional expansion is not something a company does on its own; rather, it needs great partners. It needs to know the markets it is entering. We are exploring the possibilities for this through joint ventures or other collaborations. Our potential partners need to be business community leaders on the ground in those markets that are interested in diversifying using our expertise and capabilities.</p><h4>What trends and challenges do you see coming in the insurance industry in general?</h4><p>From an industry point of view, I see consolidation. There are more than enough actors in the market and they find it difficult to achieve scale, whether on the individual or company side. It is inevitable for basic business reasons that the industry consolidates. I do not see many mergers and acquisitions happening; however, market forces may persuade some actors to do this. From a UAE point of view, there are huge opportunities because there are only two Emirates without mandatory health insurance now. Perhaps 2018 will see those remaining Emirates bringing in mandatory health cover. That is another growth opportunity for the market. Looking at Dubai 2020 and beyond, with the continuing growth in tourism, I am positive about the outlook for the medium to long term. In terms of the challenges that the insurance industry will face, one will be increasing profitability margins. Developing a technology platform will become inevitable for achieving profitability in the future. Plus, marketing through different channels will be important, such as through social media or online. B2B insurance services may still require face-to-face interaction, though personal lines of insurance will go through aggregators, online portals, or social media in the future. Currently only 10% of personal insurance business is transacted through these platforms, this figure will easily increase to 30% in the next three to four years. Digitalization will have a major impact on the insurance business. This is where the bigger players will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace and market forces will create some consolidation. Gargash's plan is to grow. If a company does not grow, it becomes static and complacent, and that is a downward slope. We will grow our business without compromising on our profit margins. We will have healthy growth with the right margins.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Behran Oil enjoys a large market share in both engine oils and lubricants for industrial applications, partly because of the strengths of your brands. How do you assess your current market share in the different divisions, and how are you planning to develop it?</h4><p>We are the market leader in the lubricants industry, with a 50% market share for passenger cars, motor oil, and especially heavy-duty oils. In the industrial sector we occupy 33% of the total market. We are in a situation where we can define the price and manage the market. We have a strong portfolio that covers nearly all the needs of the market. Car manufacturers approve all our oils, which provides a good reference for people looking to see who the strongest players are. Lately we have reached some limitations in the market, and for that reason we have placed our focus on some of the top-tier products. This is because of the high margin in the area and the better brand position that Behran Oil want to have. In addition, in the near future this will be the trend of the market so we want to keep up. We pursue a high position and want to compete in terms of quality rather than price. We also want to capture the premium parts of the market regarding the brand position that we have. On top of this, we aim to launch brand campaigns for our top-tier products and reorganize our distribution channels based on that strategy. We want to shape the market, giving more services to the end users and maintaining close contacts with them. In the industrial oils division, we have offices in eight provinces in Iran and offer technical and consulting services through our sales engineers. We want to increase their knowledge of lubricants and additive monitoring, and thus become even more powerful in the market.</p><h4>After establishing the first refinery nearly 50 years ago with a capacity of 30,000 tons per year, your current base oils output is around 250,000 tons per year. Do you plan to further increase your capacity in the next years?</h4><p>Actually we want to focus on finished products rather than base oils. Base oils are an intermediary product for us, and we prefer to focus on the marketed products.. Therefore we want to steer away from increasing production capacity for these oils and move to production of base oils in the 1+ Group. We want to be pioneers in the technology realm, which is why we want to find a qualified partner that has a license and advanced technology. Also, we would be interested in a partner that can finance our projects and grant us market access. If we find that partner, we are ready to start a new company producing base oils for Group 2 and 3.</p><h4>What is the outline of your growth strategy?</h4><p>We see some internal and external drivers for growth. Internally, we have brilliant human capital. Behran's credit also allows us to invest, which is another strength. Externally, industrial growth in Iran allows us to enhance the market. The share of the industrial sector here may not be so great in comparison with other sectors, but we expect to see a boom in the economy when sanction being lifted, and this will positively affect the industry sector. Industrial growth will provide a good base for our lubricants. The car producers in Iran are also sparking growth and innovation. The sector is moving from the low to the high end, which is another good trend for us. There is also an increase in public work; the infrastructure and mega projects that the Iranian government is carrying out are another good driving force for our business. The government also intends to invest in the automotive and industrial sectors and address the problem of unemployment. These investments have a good effect on our lubricant businesses, as we produce hydraulic and turbine oils for industrial use as well.</p><h4>Behran Oil already exports to over 40 countries. Are you looking to enter new markets?</h4><p>Our grand strategy is to have a direct presence in our target markets. In the past, we would just export commodity to overseas markets. Now, we are aiming brand oriented products to be exported. We want to have a direct presence in the target markets. Setting up blending and packaging  facilities in our target markets and building a distribution system through a local partner is part of our strategy. The local partners with which we would like to sign long-term partnerships are those who already operate in those markets. Our target markets are all East of Africa, West Asian countries, our neighboring countries, and the CIS countries to the north. We want to have a marketing and sales campaign in thesemarkets as well to introduce the Behran Oil brand. We may also establish a joint brand  for any particular market, but primarily we would like to use the existing Behran branded products in the markets.</p><h4>What is your strategy for reaching out to new partners?</h4><p>For potential internal partners, we focus on cooperation with technology and know-how. If any partner or investor has the ability, they are welcome to work with us, and we are ready to receive them. The mass market already belongs to Behran Oil; however, we are looking for a specialized company to help us expand into niche markets. This could be under the Behran Oil brand but also through a joint brand if any company comes and sees the opportunity. Iran enjoys great social and political stability, as well as a prime geographic position. Thus, establishing relations with a company such as Behran Oil means having sustainable business for years to come. We invite foreigners to come to Iran and start a lucrative business here.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>For half a century, Behran Oil has worked in the lubricant business. We believe our human capital is our main capital for staying in the market. Our people and processes are important for running the business. Our main competitor has made more investments in machinery than we have, but we have made better use of our resources. Our human capital, know-how, and software form the soft part of our business. This part may be hidden, but it is our secret to success. It helps us stay in the market as a leader and further expand our position. For the lubricant business we need good relationships with additive suppliers and OEMs all over the world. With the lifting of sanctions, we were now able to strengthen our partnerships with additive producers and sign agreements with them. Also, regarding the OEMs, we renewed the approvals, which is important for the industrial sector. They wanted to know if Behran Oil had the certificate of approval or not. After the sanctions were lifted, it was much easier to renew these approvals. Also, with regard to transportation we have not faced any problems after sanctions. We do, however, still face issues with transferring money, which we hope will be solved in the near future. The trend shows that the economy is growing and that Iran will be booming over the next five years. Our business in Behran Oil is related to this growth. If the economy takes off in the near future, our business will radically change. As the rate advances are being made—with new marketing tools, agents, and networks—we will do our best to stay apace with the new intelligence of target markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[80% urbanization rate in Latin America]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[emilio-uquillas-country-representative-development-bank-of-latin-america-caf]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges does Mexico face in terms of development? What are the priorities of CAF in Mexico?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most developed countries in Latin America. However, there are some challenges to be addressed. According to UN reports, Chiapas, for example, has a Human Development Index 20% lower than Mexico City. Development banks like CAF are here to help reduce this gap. We need to provide the best tools and knowledge our countries have in order to overcome this poverty and inequality phenomena. Mexico has improved significantly in this area though there still is plenty of work to be done.</p><h4>Mexico has the second-highest Gini Coefficient among OECD countries—0.46. What policies does CAF support to reduce income inequality in the country?</h4><p>First of all, it's important to mention that Mexico, as a part of public policy, has created an adequate frame to increase private investment, which has been a powerful tool to fight poverty considering the sustainable income-generation activities developed, which reduce the dependence on public expenditures. It is something like a public-private alliance against poverty. Although rural issues are no less important, with a large urbanization rate (80% by 2015) Latin America has become the region with the highest urban growth in the world where exclusion, low productivity and climate change coexists and are deepening referred inequalities. In this light, one of our priorities is to contribute with the countries to build the best answers to solve the urban deficiencies. We work with the “Cities with Future“ initiative, where CAF accentuates the need to focus on vulnerable populations' quality of life regarding access to services and infrastructure improvement with focus on resilience. I think that this approach could have a great impact on Mexico.</p><h4>How does CAF support the country's productive sector amidst the uncertainty linked to the NAFTA renegotiation?</h4><p>Our focus has been on transitioning from macroeconomic issues to microeconomic aspects because the macro stability is not sufficient condition to reach sustainable growth. Currently, one of the important challenges for Latin America is something we have called productive transformation. A good example is what happened in some Asian countries where development could take a radical turn by improving the productivity. Considering that a key factor was the transformation of educational levels and human talent, as CAF we promoted the improvement in skills for work as a source of long-term change. We promote working skills reinforcement in young people to assure them better conditions and opportunities to access the labor market and improve the economy's competitiveness. On the other hand, our mission at CAF is to promote regional integration and sustainable development. That being said, we could encourage a deeper integration between Mexico and South America while stimulating productive transformation. Given our experience in the region, we believe there are clear opportunities for Mexico in the economies of the south.</p><h4>How does CAF frame poverty in the region?</h4><p>Poverty as an inter-temporal phenomenon of comprehensive welfare, which not only affects one person or family, but also future generations. Therefore, we have to consider factors other than family income, such as housing quality, access to public facilities, and education levels that can be passed on. This is a more realistic and comprehensive way to approach poverty.</p><h4>How do Mexican cities fare in terms of climate change adaptation compared to the rest of the region?</h4><p>In the Paris Agreement, countries adopted several measures to fight climate change. Mexico has significantly advanced regarding its policy commitments to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Mexico's approach is transversal and comprehensive, including all stakeholders and factors. Environmental policies are not only about climate behavior and conservation; they are embedded in all economic, productive, and social areas. It is a transversal issue that must be taken into account when designing educational, health, industrial, and transportation policies. The environment is no longer an important issue; it is a vital one. The Latin American region needs to generate a regional, organic, and comprehensive approach to manage environmental decisions.</p><h4>How does CAF support the Mexican government to upgrade its water infrastructure and improve its water governance?</h4><p>In general terms, water is one of the most critical and important issues amongst CAF programs. We are part of the Global Water Council and we recognize there are many challenges regarding water. Water governance must be included in all development agendas. Mexico does have a shortage of water resources; however, we are on time to generate a national water governance program that we are keen to be a part of. We can share other countries' experiences like Spain's which has been extremely successful in this matter, and we could contribute with Mexican authorities in policy design in this respect. . Both, public and private sectors must cooperate in order to reach a sustainable water usage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[adiatu-adeyemi-managing-director-tulcan-energy-resources-limited]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main drivers behind the establishment of Tulcan in the downstream energy sector?</h4><p>Prior to Tulcan, I worked with Negris Limited. It is an oil and gas service company. My experience in Negris endeared me to the oil and gas industry. I have my first degree in BTech Chemistry where I focused on industrial chemistry. This qualifies me for both downstream and upstream sector of the oil and gas industry. I ventured into the construction industry in 2004 and remain active in that sector till date. In 2010, after my MBA program, I decided to return to the oil and gas sector. Having better but limited knowledge of the industry, I approached a friend for partnership and support to set up a company. After much deliberation and consultations, we agreed to work together. We also agreed to start with trading in the downstream sector which was less regulated. Tulcan Energy Resources Limited was registered in 2011 and operations began after this. It is worthy of note that the downstream operations require extensive experience, funding and asset ownership to support/enhance reasonable trading.</p><h4>What is your position in the market now?</h4><p>Looking back, I will say we have done well. Most of our decisions and actions have paid off. We have taking advantage of opportunities in the country that we never knew we could. It was not easy; however, we made up our minds not to quit. We had to deal with regulators in the government and from clients. Funding was another tough point; at some point, our funds got depleted, due to devaluation and volatile prices of product. We also depend on bank support. In order to get that support, we will have to get approval from the government and the stakeholders. We transited from bulk buying and depot allocation trading (which we started in 2011) to becoming an importer with focus on the local market. We started working with licensed depot owners to get direct allocations from Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC) which has allocations for almost 6 million liters monthly. We paid upfront and then sold directly without having to go through importers. We started importing directly since 2013. At the moment, we actively import approximately 20,000—40,000MT of products per month (mainly ATK and AGO). Although it was not easy to obtain licenses, permits, funding, and bank lines to execute the import but we managed to get it done all the same. So, I will say we are active in the industry and we are still striving to do even better.</p><h4>Nigeria relies heavily on foreign countries when it comes to finished, refined products. What is your vision for the sector to become self-sufficient?</h4><p>A solution is on the way, though it may not be enough. Nigeria has great potential; however, its refineries are not working efficiently enough to meet the needs of such a heavily populated country. A recent solution in the pipeline is the Dangote Refinery, which might come on-stream in 2018/2019 or 2020. We are working to see where we can collaborate with refineries and help them get the products out. It is quite competitive; however, we are working out a structure where we can play a role in supporting refineries by buying some of the refined products and blending them further. It is doable, but will take a great deal of persuasion and strategies. In that way, we can play the role of an important distributor. One day, perhaps we may not need to import anything if we are able to put all of the products we are already producing to good use thereby becoming exporters as a nation. The simple model we seek to work on is either being able to use enough raw material directly or synergizing between companies to make sure we get what we need. If we achieve that as a company and other companies do as well, Nigeria will export more than it imports. If we can locally refine enough products for the local market, it goes without saying that the scale of operations will be large enough to then export as well. That is where we would like to operate, as a company and as a nation.</p><h4>What is it like to do business in the downstream sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>It is definitely challenging and very tough, though it is interesting as well. The challenge is to gain a place in the market and there are many steps to take before companies can have access to imports. There is a great deal of regulations and government bureaucracy to pass before you can be approved. Furthermore, bank support is also very necessary. If companies have the integrity and transparency to convince a bank, they must also demonstrate that they operate with best practices and certain standards. Getting all of that in place is challenging. However, if the company is set up well to do business, it will not see much problems. In fact, there is plenty of room to capitalize on opportunities in Nigeria and expand to other points of Africa from here. We have a great deal of credibility by operating in Nigeria, and that is exportable to the East African Community (EAC) which we are exploring at the moment.</p><h4>What do you expect for 2018?</h4><p>2018 will be a pivotal year in Nigeria. We have an election coming up and we typically see great transitions between parties. It was a peaceful and fair election the last time. However, we do not know what lies in wait for 2018 and beyond. As a promoter of business, we are prepared for any shock. In terms of government and election procedures, we do anticipate some ups and downs and are getting ready to weather the storm. The major challenge in our business is foreign exchange; most of our trades are priced in dollars. In 2016, the Nigerian currency was affected greatly. The great thing is that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been able to come up with methods that minimize our exposure. We are not buying dollars on the stock market directly; however, with the support of our banks, we can trade at rates that are flexible and competitive for a year. However, the CBN takes care of 50-60% of our risk as a company. We are not all the way there yet, but are on the way. The government is more than committed to improving the country. As an entity, we can also play our part to make things better; we cannot just leave it to the government. Leadership is a collective role. We strive to continue our own path as a company as part of the country. That is the same way I operate my business; I reach out to my team for advice and guidance so that we can work together toward a common goal. We like to be compliant and focused; we will never ever be involved in any form of corrupt activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you introduce the hospital and provide a background to your operations?</h4><p>St. Nicholas Hospital was registered in 1952 as a private hospital. It consisted of a small bungalow for outpatient cases with day-to-day ailments and minor illnesses. Activities and prospects were good, so in 1968 the existing structure was demolished and a purpose-built hospital was established. Initially, it was just pediatrics and gynecology, but over the years, however, we have grown and developed, adding different medical specialties such as Oncology and Nephrology as well as surgeries, including spinal surgery and renal transplants. We have 320 members of staff, and in the last five years we have opened up new units and now have hospital clinics in Victoria Island, Lekki Free Trade Zone, and a hospital in Maryland (on the mainland). Our aim is to develop a hub-and-spoke model to feed our hospitals.</p><h4>In early 2017, the hospital was listed by the LSE as one of the fastest-growing companies in Africa. What was the main driver behind this success?</h4><p>The hospital has grown rapidly in the past five years; since 1999 we have opened new clinics, increased our staffing, and put in place new processes and protocols. We seek to build a healthcare system and have an institution that can run by itself, because it has a corporate governance structure. Our competitive edge is in our ability to remain focused on providing quality healthcare. I look at other hospitals not as competitors, but as being in the same business of trying to provide quality and effective healthcare for the large population. Healthcare should not be expensive and some hospitals here are too expensive. The whole point is to provide quality healthcare at a reasonable cost and we focus on that without cutting corners. There is a large gap in providing affordable healthcare. There are more entrants coming into the medical space and many from abroad, including India and Turkey, proving that the healthcare business in Nigeria is vibrant and there are untapped opportunities.</p><h4>What should be done to reverse the trend of people seeking treatment aboard?</h4><p>A great deal has to do with confidence in our system, part of this is educating people and giving them examples of what has and can be done. We have to rely on healthcare institutions to showcase their achievements; this would help in no small way. We can safely perform various treatments here; however, people still go abroad for operations, mainly to the UK. It is a matter of building confidence through publications, demonstrations, and citing examples. There are other problems and some hospitals and practitioners are not up to scratch so more work has to be done by the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) to sanction and enforce regulations of what can and cannot be done in a hospital. My role in building up trust in Nigerian doctors is by running a company that patients can trust. If a patient needs to have a non-emergency surgery it can be done via laparoscopy or via open surgery. If we do not have the competence to do it via laparoscopy and the surgery might leave a small scar, then we let the patient know. We explain what we are able to do and what could be done if they choose to go abroad. A large number of the medical practitioners we seek for abroad are Nigerian.</p><h4>What can the government do to boost the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The government and Ministry of Health can do more and equip the doctors with what they need to do their jobs. In the teaching hospitals, they need to do audits just to raise standards. Hospitals must seek staff that are intelligent and can be trained. All doctors are trained well enough; however, there is a great deal of improvement that can be done there. Trying to do something with the government is extremely difficult; however, the sector needs stricter regulations and controls that must be enforced. The government needs to provide an enabling environment that encourages 'reverse' brain drain. Another important aspect of our trade is tools and medication. The costs of equipment are astronomical due to exchange rate, duty payment, tax — we do not manufacture these equipment, but they are necessary for meaningful healthcare. Everyday routine medical 'consumables' from the disposable couch covers or paper hand towels to disposable gloves are more expensive that they ought to be. Drugs for some chronic ailments, immunosuppressant types or for chemotherapy, are beyond the reach of most of the people that require them and this leads to avoidable deaths, 'poor' treatment, and various societal anomalies. Unless a there is a determined effort by the government to review the Healthcare space in Nigeria holistically we will continue to lag behind our peer nations.</p><h4>What is your opinion of compulsory healthcare insurance?</h4><p>There is the National Health Insurance Scheme is also designing a scheme of its own that will resemble the compulsory pension scheme. It should bring in more money to do our work as our payments will be guaranteed. This is one of our biggest problems: receiving payment for healthcare, which is a global problem as excellent healthcare is expensive. A health insurance scheme that runs effectively is a solution. If it became mandatory for every company to pay health insurance for its staff, if there are more than five employees there would be a large pool of money. Assuming this money is used as it should be, and then its impact would be significant.</p><h4>What are the specific healthcare trends in Nigeria?</h4><p>Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are becoming more prevalent, as chronic kidney disease, cancers of the breast, cervix, and prostrate are also on the increase. The number of strokes and cardiovascular diseases also continues to rise. On top of this, we still see common Nigerian diseases such as malaria.</p><h4>What are your expectations from 2018?</h4><p>The hospital will expand in 2018. It will be our 50th Anniversary next year and with four healthcare facilities, I want to ensure they are all running as efficiently as possible. I would like to increase our bed numbers; we currently have 65 beds in two hospitals and I would like to increase that to the hundreds. Also, I would like to perhaps open another hospital. In terms of the general operating environment, a great deal depends on things that are not under anyone's control. I do not think anything drastic will happen. In 2018, the country will prepare for the next election and that will have an impact on the economy as a whole. We do not expect any adverse effects to our business and hope to continue what we do as best as we can.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[jeddah-creates-about-7000-tons-of-waste-per-day]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you and your company Dr Fadil Fuad Basyyoni Group (DFBG) get involved in environmental issues in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Some 15 years ago there was very little awareness about environmental issues from business in the MENA region. There was only activity in certain aspects of the sector, such as city cleaning and waste management, collection, and disposal. The total picture in terms of wider environmental issues, such as air pollution, green energy, and glass recycling had a low level of awareness here. Typically when you live in a luxury environment you create waste but you do not deal with it. Europe started looking at the way it treats waste because they started having a problem with it. There was no space for the waste being created and they had to decide what to do with it in terms of landfills and taking care of it using other solutions. Saudi Arabia also started looking at these solutions. Dr Fadil Fuad Basyyoni Group (DFBG) talked to the government authorities about taking aggressive actions to do this. We started with the decision makers and then made various presentations to help educate the legislators and public about the importance of environmental management; hence a waste management and classification regulation was passed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia does not have a problem with space, but it does have an issue of how to deal with its waste. There were problems with open areas containing dumpsters because the country did not have any landfills. The groundwater was becoming polluted and people living in certain areas were suffering a range of problems. In response the government built proper landfills, but these were costly to engineer and run it therefore became feasible to do recycling and some companies started working in this field. Initially they were not experts, they just collected items and sold them to places countries such as China. As understanding grew more advanced recycling solutions came into play here. This is the point where DFBG came in. I am proud to say we were one of the first companies to start working in this sector. We brought in solutions, created contracts, particularly with government authorities, and also worked to find new solutions to environmental problems so that the government knew what to do.</p><h4>Were you working as a consultancy at this time?</h4><p>We worked first as a consultancy firm solving waste management problems. Then we had the idea of turning this waste into revenue for the government. For example, Jeddah creates about 7,000 tons of waste per day and this goes up to 10,000 tons per day during periods like Hajj and Ramadan when so many extra people visit the city. This is a huge amount of waste, although it is about average or just above average by worldwide per capita standards.</p><h4>How have you been taking this waste and turning it into a business?</h4><p>For example, we went to Jeddah municipality and set out the kinds of waste they have and what it costs them. We told them we could turn it into revenue for the municipality. We offered to build a factory to turn waste into energy using the build, operate, transfer (BOT) model. We came up with a solution using plasma technology to transform 3,000 tons of waste per day into almost 100MW of power. The difficulty we face is that electricity tariffs are very low in Saudi Arabia as they are subsidized by the government. As we are now looking to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 this type of project to create green energy should work.</p><h4>Do you think Vision 2030 has created a new era for renewables and green solutions?</h4><p>I think the Vision 2030 itself is a very good tool, but it does not contain that much of an explanation about environmental proposals. We wanted the details to be in the Vision. Now I think the government is adopting a new approach to push the environmental agenda more. We want to see practical projects and investment happening in real life for green energy, recycling, and revenue from waste, and not just studies being done. Waste can provide a very good return as a new income source. We can either turn it into green energy or sell recycled materials to factories with a competitive price. Vision 2030 is a good tool, but we need very good KPIs to manage the Vision and give it life in a practical sense.</p><h4>What are the main subsidiaries and lines of business DFBG will be focusing on?</h4><p>We are establishing a company for implementing new ideas with a private not-for-profit organization in Saudi Arabia. We are doing a project together at the moment to establish recycling programs in every city. Part of the recycling scheme will be not -for-profit, and some will be to create profits for the partners. This project will be focused on electronic, plastic, and cardboard recycling with a different approach. We will be approaching homes and owners of waste to offer them solutions, including collecting waste, and recycling. We are also trying to revive our waste to energy project, because with the change in governmental approach and Vision 2030, I think this project will be feasible now.</p><h4>Is DFBG intending to get involved in managing petrochemical waste in places like Jubail and Yanbu industrial cities?</h4><p>We go to them as a consultant. They always ask us for help. We are one of the closest consultants for Saudi Aramco and Jubail and Yanbu. We do EIA studies, modeling, and find solutions to environmental problems and waste management. This is more in a consultancy role. There are projects there already to take care of the waste. However, I am particularly against using incineration for waste management as it shifts the environmental problem from solid to air. In fact many countries ban incineration of waste now because it is harmful to the environment. So we have to find better options. There are companies in places like Japan and the US that are doing very good work now on alternative solutions, such as plasma technology. It is a little bit more costly.</p><h4>What are your expectations at DFBG for 2017?</h4><p>It is very hard to answer this question. Everybody is saying we will have a bad year in 2017. I am saying no, what we will have is a consolidating year. This means we need to work hard to improve our own technologies and procedures. Sometimes in business you have to slow down a little bit. This is a marathon and not a sprint, and we are running at a slow pace at the moment, but at least we are still running. We are still moving forward and I think we will be winning again very soon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[through-heck-and-high-prices]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your plans for the newly established Persian Gulf Star Refinery?</h4><p>Iran possesses the second-largest gas reserves in the world and, together with Qatar, owns the world's largest gas field, the South Pars gas field. At the moment, 24 of its phases are in operation, which gives us 25 million cbm of gas per day, plus 40,000bpd of gas condensate for each phase. In the process of producing gas, we are confronted with large amounts of condensate, for which we need to find a proper use. With the largest population in the Middle East and the largest industry sector of all regional energy-producing countries, there is a high demand for gas in Iran. At the moment, around 80% of Iranians use natural gas as their main source of energy. Also, most of our power stations run on combined cycle and the gas turbines are fueled by natural gas. At the same time, we have the opportunity to export the natural gas through pipelines to Turkey and Europe. In the future, we may even supply to Pakistan and India. This policy was implemented during the sanctions, as Iran used to be a net importer of gasoline. The demand for gasoline in Iran is high and gradually increasing. The Persian Gulf Star Refinery will produce Euro-4 standard gasoline, and will hopefully allow Iran to become a net exporter of gasoline. The Ministry of Petroleum also wants to transfer all the gasoline stations to the private sector. We want to take over some of these gasoline stations and create a new brand of stations to sell our brand of fuel.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the contribution of TAPPICO to the development of the petrochemical industry in Iran?</h4><p>Petrochemicals are one of the best industries to invest in because of the price of the feedstock. We oversee around 20 subsidiary companies fully under our management. We also have many affiliated companies in which we have board seats. Our total market share exceeds 50% and we are present in all petrochemical industries of Iran. We are also active in the production of bitumen and lubricants. We control over half of the Iranian tire market. We are also active in the paper and wood industries and are about to start on two megaprojects converting methanol to propylene.</p><h4>What potential do you see in other countries and what markets do you target for further growth?</h4><p>China and India are our greatest opportunities for the future, though there is also a great deal of potential in countries like Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. </p><h4>What is your strategy for reaching investors and partners for joint ventures inside and outside of Iran?</h4><p>Iranians are a peaceful people who, like everybody else, merely want a good life. Next to this we have great access to gas and oil and an abundance of petrochemicals. Our gas fields are particularly rich, as the gas is of high quality with great methane proportions. This creates huge potential for investors. Until the end of 2018, the next phases of construction and operation of the Persian Gulf Star Refinery will be one of the main priorities. We will improve the infrastructure and quality of our human resources through training to ensure we have the right person in the right place. </p><h4>What is your outlook for TAPPICO in the year to come?</h4><p>We are present in almost all Iranian petrochemical companies and have a big basket of different products. Our share in the stock market is strong. When the price of crude oil fluctuates, this has an immediate impact on petrochemical products that are based on liquid feed stock. Because our feedstock is gas and not liquid, we are affected by the fall in prices to a much lesser extent. On top of that, the price of gas is not an internationally standardized price, such as with crude oil, but a regional price, which is different in Europe, the US, and the Middle East. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ever-the-well-lubricated-oyster]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess your current market share in different divisions, and how do you plan to develop it?</h4><p>We are the market leader in the lubricants industry, with a 50% market share for passenger cars, motor oil, and especially heavy-duty oils. In the industrial sector we occupy 33% of the total market. We are in a situation where we can define the price and manage the market. We have a strong portfolio that covers nearly all the needs of the market. Car manufacturers have also approved all our oils. Lately, we have reached certain limitations in the market, and for that reason we have placed our focus on several top-tier products, a future trend with which we need to keep up. We want to compete in terms of quality rather than price and capture the premium parts of the market. On top of this, we aim to launch brand campaigns for our top-tier products and reorganize our distribution channels based on that strategy. In the industrial oils division, we have offices in eight provinces in Iran and offer technical and consulting services through our sales engineers. We want to increase their knowledge of lubricants and additive monitoring, and, thus, become even more powerful in the market. </p><h4>Your current base oils output is around 250,000 tons per year. Do you plan to further increase your capacity?</h4><p>We want to focus on finished products rather than base oils. Base oils are an intermediary product for us, and we prefer to focus on marketed products. We want to be pioneers in the technology realm, which is why we want to find a qualified partner that has a license and advanced technology. Also, we are interested in a partner that can finance our projects and grant us market access. </p><h4>What is the outline of your growth strategy?</h4><p>We see some internal and external drivers for growth. Internally, we have brilliant human capital. Behran's credit also allows us to invest, which is another strength. Externally, industrial growth in Iran allows us to enhance the market. The share of the industrial sector here may not be that great in comparison to other sectors, but we expect to see a boom in the economy as sanctions are lifted, and this will positively affect the sector. Industrial growth, in turn, will provide a good base for our lubricants. The car producers in Iran are also sparking growth and innovation. The sector is moving from the low to the high end, another positive trend for us. There is also an increase in public work; the infrastructure and megaprojects that the Iranian government is carrying out are another good driving force for our business. </p><h4>Behran Oil already exports to over 40 countries. Are you looking to enter new markets?</h4><p>Our grand strategy is to have a direct presence in our target markets. In the past, we would just export commodity to overseas markets. Now, we aim to export our brand-oriented products and have a direct presence in target markets. Setting up blending and packaging facilities in our target markets and building a distribution system through a local partner is part of this strategy. Our target markets are East Africa, West Asia, neighboring countries, and CIS countries to the north. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our human capital, know-how, and software form the soft part of our business. This part may be hidden, but it is our secret to success. It helps us stay in the market as a leader and further expand our position. For the lubricant business we need good relationships with additive suppliers and OEMs all over the world. With the lifting of sanctions, we are now able to strengthen our partnerships with additive producers and sign agreements with them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess SAFA Rolling &amp; Pipe Mills Company's contribution over the past 25 years?</h4><p>In terms of macroeconomic data, we have contributed to Iran's economic growth in three different ways. One of them is employment—we have created around 1,500 jobs. We have also immersed ourselves in high magnitude investments in the downstream oil and gas industry. The same goes for the steel industry, for which we produce the highest quality using state-of-the-art technology. The third is the economic value of SAFA Rolling &amp; Pipe Mills. The 2015 GDP figure of Iran was USD425 billion, of which around 40% was comprised by the industrial sector. With our production capacity of around 1 million tons, our contribution to Iran's GDP is roughly USD1 billion, which means our contribution to the industrial share of GDP is more than 0.5%. </p><h4>What competitive advantages do you have? </h4><p>We are among the few companies that have been evaluated by international companies and have been approved as their vendors because of our technical know-how and quality. This is our biggest current advantage. We also have excellent research and marketing abilities and positive credit ratings in the financial sector. Financially, we are healthier than our competitors in Iran. Also, we are experienced in outsourcing raw materials with steel mills in Europe, China, South Korea, and Japan. We have managed to establish and maintain supply channels with our dedicated supply sourcing policies. </p><h4>How do you improve your technology and increase the variety of steel products you produce?<br></h4><p>SAFA Rolling is the result of a diversification strategy within SAFA Industrial Group. We sought more diverse applications than only the oil, gas, and energy segments. Hence, we expanded and diversified our products into different applications, particularly for upstream segments. We have added value by producing, for example, OCTG casing and tubing pipes, a unique and high value-added product for drilling applications. Next to this, we are targeting refineries and petrochemical plants, surface facilities, field developments, offshore projects, LPG/LNG/NGL plants, pump stations, water treatment desalination projects, and trunk and flow lines. </p><h4>In which infrastructural projects are you currently involved?</h4><p>In order for the country to expand its pipeline infrastructure and networks, there need to be 40,000km of new pipelines in both upstream and downstream. These include offshore subsea sour gas transmission, onshore networks, refineries, NGL, LPG and LNG plants, field developments and surface facilities, and crude oil trunk and flow lines.</p><h4>What is your post-sanctions strategy?</h4><p>The world's demand for energy is increasing by roughly 2% annually. It is essential to have a reliable energy supplier that can provide sustainable and affordable energy. Therefore, as the holder of the world's largest gas reserves and ranked fourth in oil production, Iran is boosting exploration and development of both. The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) has developed a new scheme called Iranians Petroleum Contracts (IPC), a modified form of the 'buy back scheme' that offers additional incentives to investors. Combined with political stability, this will create a safe environment for international companies to invest in Iran's hydrocarbon fields. About 90% of our products still go to the oil and gas industry. We also have capacity dedicated to other segments, such as the automotive and construction segments; however, this is still relatively small. The government has articulated a plan to attract around USD25 billion of investment in the oil and gas sector annually, and by 2025 the aggregate investments shall be USD200 billion. </p><h4>Which markets do you currently supply, and what is your strategy to grow your global footprint?</h4><p>Based on our positive outlook for Iran, we are focusing on the domestic market for now. We seek market niches that cannot be reached by our competitors. This will help us to outmaneuver the competition and become the number one player in the energy sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed in recent years?</h4><p>POGDC is a young company; we were founded less than 10 years ago. Yet, today it is one of the largest players in Iran in the oil, gas, and petrochemical sector. We are now the largest petrochemical refinery company in the country. In the IMI 100, a ranking of all Iranian companies composed by IDRO, we have been among the top 10 for five years running. With our three urea plants, we are the number-one fertilizer company in the Middle East and have the largest methanol factory in the world. Our growth is encouraging, and we seek to be in the top 20 petrochemicals worldwide.</p><h4>How do you assess the scope of your activities? Will you implement new diversification or integration strategies in the coming years?</h4><p>From the beginning, we have been taking raw materials from the oil and gas industry to produce petrochemical products and sell them on the free market. Today, we are changing this through three strategies. First, we are diversifying our products with cutting-edge technology, such as with the Kian project. Second, we are looking at the integration of refinery and petrochemical production, for instance in Tabriz, where we have already signed an agreement to integrate the two. Third, we signed agreements with the number-one licensor in the world to build new downstream production facilities here rather than sell raw materials to other countries. We should limit the export of our raw materials and focus instead on exporting finished products.</p><h4>Have you been able to engage in international partnerships since the lifting of sanctions?</h4><p>After the JCPOA we signed many agreements with well-known companies. We signed two deals with ENI to purchase licensing and produce products like lubricants under its brand. We also signed a front-end engineering design deal for the Kian Petrochemical project with the Linde Group from Germany. It took one year to complete these basic engineering activities, and we just signed a USD1.5-billion deal with a European company for the final stage of this cornerstone project. This was signed with our corporate guarantee—not a government guarantee. We work only with the top companies in the world and have great relations with the largest European and Japanese players in oil, gas, and petrochemicals. </p><h4>How will POGDC capitalize on new business opportunities in the post-sanctions era?</h4><p>Iran is the safest country in the Middle East. All the neighboring countries face security problems. When a country is safe, it can think about investment. We are steadily growing because we have the best resources in the world. We have young and skilled people, which further drives our growth. POGDC is growing every day, and with the joint ventures with foreign companies we closed, we have the best technology in the petrochemical industry.</p><h4>What is your vision with regard to the development of PODGC's international footprint?</h4><p>We are considering diverting our production downstream and selling worldwide. At the moment, we sell our products to over 50 countries without any problems. We produce more than 6 million tons of fertilizer and are the largest urea producer in the world. Our production exceeds Iran's consumption; thus, it is only logical to sell internationally.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coming year?</h4><p>At the moment, we are pleased with our situation. We aim to steadily continue on our growth path, but are somewhat confined by the skepticism of foreign companies that work with Iran. At the moment, we are the only company whose corporate guarantee is accepted by foreign financers. We have a great reputation in many countries and are not afraid of competition, only sanctions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will your new vision determine your strategy for the upcoming years?</h4><p>We recently decided to adopt a new vision, which is to be a leading sustainable energy and petrochemical player offering diversified and high-quality products and services in Iran and the region, and be recognized as the strategic partner of choice in the energy field in Iran. This vision is based on three pillars. One is to create value, which means finding the right investment opportunities. The second is to be a diversified business with a diversified portfolio of activities. The third is to build strategic partnerships with global players, building new competitive advantages and value propositions for future project execution and future business activities. We just started to implement this new strategy and plan to reach the goals that have been specified in this regard.</p><h4>How do you create value for your shareholders through your activities and subsidiaries?</h4><p>We have broken down the energy business into four strategic business units covering the entire value chain, namely upstream, midstream, downstream, and power and utilities. Iran, like other countries, will gradually benefit more from added value in the energy sector. Our strategy has been to be present throughout the energy value chain, with help from the capabilities and expertise of our directors. We are well established in different parts of the value chain, such as drilling and well engineering services. Moreover, we are a qualified Iranian E&amp;P company that is an excellent partner for major oil companies that want to develop oil and gas fields in Iran. International oil companies must have a local partner to engage in E&amp;P activities in Iran. We want to be the partner of choice for major oil companies. It is important for partners to know which companies are fully private. Most of the companies are prequalified by the Ministry of Petroleum, or are semi state-owned companies. There are only a few companies that are fully private, and PEDC is one of them. Another advantage is that we have the backing of Pasargad Financial Group. </p><h4>How can PEDC, as a trader in energy products, benefit from Iran's strategic location?</h4><p>PEDC transports oil products between neighboring countries. We import some oil products from the UAE and Iraq, and export them to Armenia and Afghanistan. Also, we import products from Turkmenistan and export them to Iraq. We started this business to benefit from our geopolitical situation. PEDC possesses three power plants, located near the borders with Turkey, Iraq, and Afghanistan. We are seeking permission to export power from our power plants and directly export it to neighboring countries. In a few years, there will be opportunities to get involved in the trade of electricity, and we can benefit from our geopolitical situation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>After the reelection of President Rouhani, Iran will continue to develop positive relationships with the world. This will create a more supportive business environment in which we can conduct business. We are going to complete our build-operate-transfer (BOT) project for laying a gas pipeline to export gas to Iraq. We have a project worth more than USD2 billion with the National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC) to build a 600,000km pipeline with five compressor stations for exporting gas to two Iraqi cities: Basra and Baghdad. We are going to complete this project by the end of next year, which will create more value and credibility for us. We aim to sign partnership contracts in the next year with major international oil companies to develop Iranian oil fields. In addition, we would like to enter into partnerships in our petrochemical and refining projects, especially in Siraf, where we have eight plants that each produce 60,000bpd of condensate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the first public joint stock reinsurance company in Iran completely financed by the private sector, how has Iranian Reinsurance Company impacted the insurance landscape of the country?</h4><p>Before our establishment, no private reinsurance company was active in Iran. We were the first company that brought private capital to the local reinsurance market. When we started our operations, we had two objectives. We wanted to introduce reinsurance for the local market and work with regional companies to access the international market. Soon after our establishment, however, sanctions were imposed on Iran by Western countries. Hence, we reasoned it was better not to accept reinsurance proposals from overseas, because in reinsurance a company is much more dependent on the international banking system for foreign exchange and currency transactions. We decided to slow down our international ambitions and focus on the local market. In Iran, we are now the third-largest player in reinsurance. Our market share in the reinsurance market is about 9%, which is satisfactory. We have a share in most Iranian reinsurance businesses. This is not a business where one can enter and leave when it suits them; the key to gaining market share is to commit to the customer, because some of the reinsurance commitments may last up to 10 years. This business is about the long run, and we realized it was better to refrain from engaging in international business until we had a clear view of the future and could obtain ratings from recognized international rating institutions. As a result, we have been able to build a strong network within Iran.</p><h4>What is your strategy for securing a greater share of the reinsurance market, both in Iran and the region?</h4><p>In addition to the problems that were related to sanctions, the market has experienced other challenges in the last three years. First, tariffs were lifted and rates were falling. There are certain lines of business that need more reinsurance, such as oil, energy, and aviation. These lines of business are extremely important for reinsurance companies such as ours. In these reinsurance-oriented lines of business, rates have fallen steadily as competition has increased. We are not greedy for market share; instead, we focus on getting the right shares of the market and giving professional advice for quality underwriting. Currently, we are satisfied being the third largest in the market.</p><h4>How do you reflect on investor sentiment based on the interactions you have had so far?</h4><p>We have an excellent structure of local shareholders and investors. In the future, we also need to have foreign investors and partners. We believe partnership with internationally well-known partners will be mutually beneficial as we know the market and they bring capital and know-how. Unfortunately, various unrest in the Middle East has elevated investment risks. The investment climate for reinsurance would benefit from stabilization. Prior to investments, we would like to see more business exchange. We are preparing ourselves to receive more foreign investors. We already have the plans and the potential. According to Iranian regulations, all properties in Iran have to be insured by Iranian companies. If foreign investors came, we can reinsure this part and have a partner overseas that provides them with services abroad. We can reinsure all the assets of foreign investors in Iran if we also have a foreign partner that can back the client in the international market. This will help us gain new customers and would assure investors that the end of their reinsurance is in the hands of a large global player. This is a great opportunity for us because we would be able to establish a joint venture with a leading company and facilitate investment in Iran. We are in close contact with these international firms; however, the greatest challenges we face are with banking and rating. Once these problems are overcome, better relations can be fostered. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the motivation behind the establishment of MA Insurance in 2011?</h4><p>MA Insurance was established with the purpose of creating trust, peace, and confidence for all parts of society and the economy. Cross selling and financial supermarkets are growing in industrial risk insurance (IRI). Value creation for customers has a special position in Iran's economic system. Iran pays special attention to the banking, insurance, bourse and exchange, leasing, and investment securities sectors. The purpose of its establishment was to create reliability for different sectors of the economy such as industry, agriculture, and service producers. MA Insurance has a market share of almost 1.5% with more than 700,000 insured. In life insurance, MA Insurance even has a market share of 9%. With the participation of Bank Mellat we give a range of different services to our customers such as mortgages, fire insurance, property coverage insurance, oil and gas insurance, and commercial insurance. Our company provides services to all types of businesses such as entities, agents and brokers, corporations, and individuals.</p><h4>How do you bring innovation to the market?</h4><p>One of our innovative services has been designing social liability insurance for the Iranian leopard. The Iranian Leopard Insurance covers liability insurance for farmers and villagers and also the leopard itself. Unfortunately, it is an endangered species whose ecosystem is being destroyed, so it wanders into villages to find food and villagers used to kill them to protect their land. To solve this problem, and to stop the falling numbers of leopards, we compensate villagers' damages caused by leopards so they will stop killing them. Another innovative plan that we have designed in cooperation with Mellat Bank is the Parnian Scheme, which provides life and health insurance for women who create an account in Mellat Bank with at least a USD3,000 deposit. In the MENA conference, which was held in the UAE, we managed to stand among the seven most innovative international companies in the insurance sector. We recently participated in the Iran-German Waste Management Initiative, where we presented new schemes to German experts and announced our willingness to give services to Iranian and German companies. MA Insurance was the only Iranian insurance company invited to the conference, based on recognition for its local and international potential and capabilities. We have also received several awards for our approach.</p><h4>How do you secure market share and compete with the traditional names in insurance?</h4><p>Our company has a good share of the market in life and investment insurance. The reason is that we offer different options that are in high demand and have a strong IT department. Our strategy is to further develop life insurance and expand our sales networks. We have great capacities in oil, gas, and the energy sector. We have qualified staff and experts who can provide good services and increase our activities in the reinsurance section. We are there to serve our customers, so customer relationship management is a key focus, both now and in the future. Also, we are interested to learn new marketing approaches. We are seeking new ways for branding and eventually will be on the frontiers in the near future.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We expect economic growth over the next year. Our president created a friendly atmosphere seeking interactions with almost the whole world. There is a good political situation with increased international trade relations so we are looking forward to a great future for Iran. We are going to see economic growth in the year ahead, and our business is developing. Oil sales have increased and Iran managed to increase its output in OPEC. The oil price and Iran's access to modern technologies provide a good basis for growth. This will positively affect the insurance sector as well because this industry is one of the rings of development. We predict a rise in the insurance companies' income and profitability aligned with economic growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does CSDI play in managing the systemic risks in Iran's exchange markets?</h4><p>CSDI is the sole company responsible for providing the infrastructure for pre- and post-trade activities in Iran. We have four exchanges in Iran: the main Tehran Stock Exchange; Iran Fara Bourse, which is the over-the-counter (OTC) exchange; an energy exchange; and a commodity exchange. It is our responsibility to make all post-trade activities, including PS, SSS, and then CCP, and do the clearing after this. CSDI is the only company for post-transaction settlement and clearing activities in the four exchanges. It is important to have consistency between these and CSDI. We should have a central payment system to reduce all risks such as credit, liquidity, and legal. In terms of liquidity and settlement risk, we have a collateral management system that provides sufficient liquidity for executing previously failed obligations. We founded a special fund, the Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF). We are able to clear all activities and transactions through brokerage firms and do not need a direct connection with individual investors. Since late 2015, CSDI has launched the Blue Model for reducing default risks in transactions. In this model, a correspondent bank will play the role of the custodian bank, and foreign investors will no longer have any concern about the default risk. It is worth mentioning that brokers will continue their responsibilities just as before and receive their fees. The point for the new situation is that there will no longer exist any default risk of broker's settlement commitments because a new account will be opened in the bank under the name of the investor for the settlement process. </p><h4>Which steps need to be taken to make the Iranian capital markets better developed and more internationalized?</h4><p>The internationalization of the Iranian capital markets is an entire program in which the exchanges, the regulatory body, and CSDI each have their own tasks. We are responsible for providing the main infrastructure in the market but are not in charge of making transactions or approving regulations. We are going to make the Iranian markets more similar to other prominent markets in the world in terms of the regulatory environment, IT software, standards, and risk-management mechanisms for which we are planning to revise all pre- and post-trade-related procedures and structures to fully comply with international standards.</p><h4>What would be your message to international investors who are thinking of entering Iran's capital markets?</h4><p>Iran is one of the most stable countries in the Middle East and is known as a land of opportunity. After 10 years of sanctions, it is a largely untapped market, with many uncompleted projects in different fields and investment opportunities in infrastructure, oil and gas, and mining. Iran offers a diversified market, with over 40 different fields of industry active in the Iranian capital markets. Iran has one of the highest interest rates in the world, at around 20%, and has succeeded in curbing inflation to under 10%. We have succeeded in providing a range of financial instruments to both local and foreign investors. We have had few credit risk events and have never defaulted in our history. In addition, SEO has assigned all Iranian listed companies to apply IFRS regulations to their financial statements and other audited financial reports in order to enhance not only the transparency but also the fairness and efficiency of the capital market. Moreover, we are going to improve and enhance our situation and create more similarity between the Iranian and foreign markets by applying internationally accepted standards such as IFRS and IOSCO regulations to internationalize the Iranian capital markets and improve relationships with our foreign counterparties. Our final message to all international investors willing to enter Iran's capital market would be that CSDI is fully prepared to provide custody services for any foreign natural or legal entity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[financial-giant]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Refah K. Bank distinguish itself in the highly competitive Iranian banking sector?</h4><p>Refah K. Bank is fully owned by the Social Security Organization (SSO). This organization is a large and active fund in which 44 million people have a stake. This is more than half of Iran's total population, so the SSO is clearly a giant company with huge and important holdings. The SSO is involved in diverse economic segments such as petrochemicals, steel production, medicine, food, and transportation. Next to this, it is active in finance. Refah K. Bank is the sole financial arm of the SSO. The term bank refers to what we call a financial institution, because in Iran we do not have investment banks. Financial institutions serve as the alternative indeed. It must be noted that two things distinguish Refah K. Bank from other banks; one is its connection to the SSO, and the other is its diversification, with subsidiaries of the bank operating in different sectors. In comparison to other Iranian banks, Refah K. Bank plays an important role in the economy in terms of social security. Other banks do not really serve this function. We are a strong and special financial institution with huge capital and assets.</p><h4>Do you use these assets to support particular industries in Iran?</h4><p>We definitely do. Refah K. Bank has a fixed-interest fund with nearly USD700 million in assets and liquidity. We also have a program to support different activities of the SSO. We finance and render services to companies that invest in different sectors. We offer government-backed Sukuk bonds that are in accordance with Islamic law. Refah K. Bank is experienced in this field as well. Last year, we provided the Ministry of Cooperatives, Labor, and Social Welfare with such Islamic investment documents which were equal to almost USD1.1 billion and related to investments in supporting health insurance plans.</p><h4>How is Refah K. Bank innovating with the services it provides?</h4><p>We have a program for expansion in e-banking services and are updating our hardware and software in order to achieve further accomplishments in e-banking. We own large stakes in three IT companies. One of them, Data Processing Iran, is well known and was probably the first IT company in Iran. This company used to be the representative of IBM in Iran. Refah K. Bank owns nearly 50% of this company's shares. Another company, called Saman Pardakht, is influential in the banking system, and we own 30% of this company as well. Saman Bank is the chief shareholder of Saman Pardakht. The third IT company associated with Refah K. Bank is Tosee'h Tejarat. This company is completely owned by Refah K. Bank and is involved in IT banking services. We are boosting our income not only by deriving additional income from non-banking activities, but also as a result of our interest and expansion in mobile banking and e-banking. We always look to apply new technologies.</p><h4>How has Refah K. Bank proceeded in the field of international banking since the lifting of sanctions?</h4><p>We are trying to develop our bank both in the local and international arena. We are quite successful in doing so. In 2016, we were able to increase our international banking activities, with active relationships with around 120 international banks. Of course, this is an ongoing activity. We have important customers and partners in various sectors in Iran. For example, the Social Security Investment Company (Shasta) is one of our important partners. Shasta has around USD20 billion in assets. It is the largest investment company in Iran and supports many of the activities of the SSO. Being the primary subsidiary of the SSO, Shasta is in fact bigger than Refah K. Bank. It is also our principal customer. Nearly all the subsidiaries and investment companies of Shasta are also our customers. We also have a program for establishing a new branch, probably a new bank in Europe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pillar-of-support]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you promote exports and enable investors and exporters through your services and activities?</h4><p>EDBI is the export-import (EXIM) bank of Iran. EXIM banks around the world are typically state owned and this is the case with our bank as well. EDBI was established as a body of the Iranian government to promote exports and enhance economic relations between Iran and other countries. If Iranian companies want to participate in projects outside of Iran, we provide the financing to make this happen. The strengthening of activities of Iranian companies in the region is important to the Iranian government. We also provide working capital to Iranian exporters of commodities or goods, and to projects that are export oriented. We provide them the facilities they need in order to shape the required infrastructure for exporting from Iran. There is important infrastructure in Iran that we must support, such as Chabahar Port in the southeast, which is important for the commodities trade. We can also facilitate other countries such as Afghanistan and India trading through Chabahar Port or use it to connect to CIS countries. EDBI financed the expansion of Chabahar Port together with the EXIM bank in India. In addition to providing loans and credit facilities to companies and projects, we provide services to exporters and importers. These include letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and assistance with money transfers and opening accounts with foreign banks in order to receive the proceeds of exports in other countries. All these services are provided to both exporters and importers.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the JCPOA on your operations?</h4><p>After JCPOA, we were able to improve our relations with other banks. Currently we have around 120 corresponding banking relations. Before JCPOA, all our foreign accounts were blocked. We have since reconnected to SWIFT and can now exchange messages with our counterparts in different countries. We opened new accounts with different banks or reopened suspended accounts. We are now able to transfer money across the border, which is important as we can now take the proceeds of exports in different accounts. We can open and advise on letters of credit and can issue letters of guarantee and different facilities and services to other banks. One of the problems after the JCPOA is that we expected to reestablish correspondent banking relations with large banks like Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse. However, they are still not ready to have corresponding banking relations with us. These are the limitations and obstacles we still face. There are some issues related to the readiness of the Iranian banking system in implementing international rules and regulations. The biggest obstacle, however, is the fear that institutions have of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of Treasury. We have developed solid relations with many banks after the JCPOA and are waiting to reopen relations with large banks in order to provide better services to Iranian importers and exporters.</p><h4>Why should Iranian exporters or foreign buyers look to EDBI as their banking partner?</h4><p>Our services are focused on supporting exports, so exporters concentrate their banking activities in our bank. When we issue a letter of guarantee we take just 2% as cash and 98% through other forms of collateral, like a promissory note. This is a service that only we offer. We provide exporters with attractive loans as our goal is to support businesses. They come to us because of the preferable fees or rates that we provide them. EDBI is a development bank, and the nature of development banks is to take more risks. Since we are a state-owned bank, the government takes on this risk in order to support the exports of Iranian companies. This is completely different to the activities of commercial banks that are more conservative on this issue and less prone to taking risks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which banking segments do you see the potential to grow your market share?</h4><p>We seek to change our operating model to become a fee-based bank by providing advisory and consultancy services to our clients, both corporate and individual. We particularly want to concentrate on asset and fund management, because now that Iranian entities can operate outside the country, there are many clients who want to hold their assets in a mix of currencies. We are working on business models for fee-based services for our clients. In addition, we concentrate on digital banking and IT. Pasargad Bank has been a pioneer in developing virtual banking in Iran and we continue to build on that. We are developing new applications, for example related to the Internet of Things (IoT). We are a technology-driven bank and seek to use the best technology available in order to provide good-quality services to our clients.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of the re-entry of Iranian banks to the global financial arena?</h4><p>Since the signing of the JCPOA and its implementation, Iranian banks have had positive experiences in establishing new correspondent banking relationships. However, large banks are not returning to Iran. The reason for this is that some of those banks have been fined by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and are scared of incurring new kinds of penalties, even though all banking operations with Iran right now are fully legitimate and no longer under sanctions. One of the other major issues for overseas banks is the cost of compliance, which has created some hesitancy. Pasargad Bank has been able to establish around 60 new correspondent bank relationships since the signing of the JCPOA. We deal with trade finance transactions and open letters of credit for our clients all around the world with the exception of North America. Pasargad Bank also has a strict compliance policy and sanctions screening process that has been in place for seven years. We have a compliance sheet for every foreign transaction to ensure it is completely legitimate. We also open letters of credit under the ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600), and all the information and documentation is provided to the advising and negotiating banks. We have seen many developments since the signing of JCPOA and expect to see more, including larger banks with a higher capacity, coming to the Iranian market. The issues that remain, which are outside the control of commercial banks, are likely those that need to be decided upon by entities such as the Central Bank of Iran. Iran is on the Financial Action Task Force's Gray List, and we would like to see the country come off that and get onto the White List. This would help us improve our relationships with our correspondent banks worldwide.</p><h4>How do you reflect on Pasargad's Bank capital adequacy ratio and balance sheet?</h4><p>Our capital adequacy ratio at Iranian YE (March 2017) is higher than the minimum recommended by Basel III. Furthermore, Pasargad Bank was one of the first to issue its accounts based on IFRS, and we did this within the required time frame under Iranian law. The Iranian regulations state that every company should hold their general assembly within four months of the end of the fiscal year. Only Pasargad Bank and one other bank were able to hold their general assembly and report under IFRS within this prescribed timeframe. The reason for this is that since its establishment Pasargad Bank has sought to be the first Iranian bank listed in the Fortune 500. We established our standards and internal processes in such a way that, when the sanctions were removed, we were already ahead in terms of our compliance and practices and in line with international standards. Even though we have been reporting according to Iranian financial standards, we have been preparing our accounts based on IFRS as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bank Saderat has been one of the cornerstones of Iran's banking sector, with close to 3,000 local branches. How do you assess the contribution of your bank to the Iranian economy?</h4><p>The first Iranian bank was created 130 years ago as a branch of a foreign bank. Subsequently, certain Iranian banks started operations, and Bank Saderat was one of the most aggressive banks at the time, established 66 years ago and the first purely owned by the private sector. At the dawn of the Islamic revolution, all Iranian banks were nationalized. Then, around seven years ago, the bank was privatized again. From the first days of Bank Saderat's existence, we have had branches outside the country. The first overseas branch was in Hamburg, which is still operational. Hamburg was chosen because it was a hub for Iranian carpet sellers. We used to have many branches in the UAE, and a reasonable number of them are still active. Bank Saderat Iran has always been the most important bank outside the country. In terms of the numbers of customers and depositors, Bank Saderat owns 50% of all Iranian banks set up outside the country. The sanctions affected our international footprint, which we now seek to rebuild. Bankers are cautious regarding these matters. However, Iran has economic ties with the world, which is demonstrated by the large amount of oil sold to other countries every year. The money involved with this should be transferred by banks, and if a bank is not willing to do business with Iranian banks, there will be other ones.</p><h4>What are your plans to further expand the international network of Bank Saderat?</h4><p>The first step is to reestablish our establishments outside the country. We intend to reshuffle our staff abroad and employ people with more expertise who are more efficient in absorbing customers. Next, we want to reinforce the relations between Bank Saderat and its international branches and partners abroad. We seek to strengthen our position in Europe and believe Vienna is particularly important. After Brexit, new financial centers in Europe will emerge, and we believe Vienna may become the next financial hub of Europe. Therefore, we are studying these possibilities in order to have a more efficient international strategy.</p><h4>Do you seek partnerships with international banks and investors that can help you achieve your domestic and international goals?</h4><p>Bank Saderat has a great international history and is respected by Iranians. We have loyal customers who have stood by the bank through all the difficulties. We will benefit from this when the situation improves. We have had some excellent and promising discussions with other banks. We have also reopened certain international branches and subsidiaries, including the ones in Paris and Athens, though they are not as active as they were before. During the sanctions, we suffered a great deal. Our foreign establishments no longer make the profits they did before, and there are no new businesses yet that we can profit from. Therefore, we are gathering our former customers and trying to revive the business.</p><h4>What is Bank Saderat doing to catch up with international banking standards?</h4><p>We have asked renowned auditing, accounting, and law firms to scrutinize our operations because we do not want to hide anything. This will help us present an excellent picture of the real situation of the bank and the extent to which Bank Saderat complies with international financial standards. In this way, we can improve our weak points and have a more efficient business. The Iranian banking system faces difficulties, and there are different reasons for that. In order to manage the private banking sector, the regulatory framework needs to improve. In addition, the government needs to realize that private banks are completely different from state-owned banks. Having a dual banking system, with private and public banks, requires special attention and the authorities need to learn how to deal with the mixture of banking systems. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the need for security arise and how did you manage to grow your business in this segment?</h4><p>We are talking about needs, and in general there are needs and there are luxuries in business. Security is not a luxury anymore; it is a need. There market is in danger, and the pain that is being experienced is clear from how many attacks happened this year in the Saudi market. It is a market that could be attacked by any enemies either from the outside or the inside. As a matter of fact, most attacks comes from the outside, especially that there is a war now in Yemen that Saudi is involved in. There is a war in Syria and Iraq too, and since all of these wars are affecting the area, we believe that Saudi now is now engaged in an e-war. The most important things now is information, and whoever controls that information can win. This is why we are at war, because enemies are attacking our information. Thus, Bin Zomah Tech took the initiative to fulfill the market need. We decided to secure all the Saudi sectors with the best technology available. We are grateful that we are now expert in protecting Saudi's private and public sectors.</p><h4>How important is it to educate citizens and companies about security and how much of your focus has been on this?</h4><p>We started with vendors that believe in the same objective as us. They transfer their beliefs to our company. It was a lot of hard work bringing that to the market but there is another factor to consider which is that security does not end at a particular level. It always expands. Every day you have a new attack, a new way of attacking, new threats, and new antidotes for those threats. Before, there was only a firewall and Antivirus, but now there is a next generation of firewalls that offer protection from all known and unknown threats, email gateway security, and next-generation end-point protection, in-built security, NAC solutions to control and manage all end-points, end-user IT analytics, and security solutions, and many other considerations that collect all the information and files that might affect users later. There is a lot of competition but we try to work with the best, because there is one thing in security that is well known. You cannot say I am secured from any external attack or internal attack because that means you are not secure; there is no such thing as 100% secure.</p><h4>What other products do you provide for the market and who are some of the clients that you cater to?</h4><p>For Bin Zomah we only have three divisions, first we have ICT, which is related to infrastructure storage and server and information security, is a part of that division. Information security is a part of ICT as you have to be part of an IT company to provide security at the highest level for IT providers who work with routing, switching, wireless coverage, point-to-point communication, infrastructure for the data center servers, storage, backup, and security which is the highest level of IT provision. We are one of the security companies that provides security for the government and public sector. Also now the public sector understands they have to work on security now. The second division is the AV division, which is an Audio Visual Systems Integration division specializing in the design, installation, and support of multimedia presentation technology, video and audio conferencing systems, and customized communication products. Bin Zomah Tech believes that to be the leader in a field it should invest in its engineers. Now the well-trained and certified expert engineers in Bin Zomah Tech that are up-to-date with the newest technologies are the reason behind the success of the division. The third division is the e-learning division which provides e-learning services, education, and consultation. The e-learning division has the ability to build a complete e-learning system from scratch, which no firm here but Bin Zomah Tech is capable of offering consultation for.</p><h4>How did the business come about and were you in this profession before?</h4><p>Life is a story, and my story started with me working as a technical then passing through sales to end up with management, which will never be successful without the technical and the sales skills. I am grateful to Allah for blessing me with this career journey. Yes I was an IT guy for sure. I started working in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and was technical. The most important thing for establishing a company is to know the market and understand what you are working on. I think I have both because of my experience, and it is hard to find people that can convert to sales in a technical market. Technical people work with machines which can lead them to have poor communication skills. This helped me a lot as I have a technical background and a good background in sales. I was in the top of the companies that were here working in the Saudi market and I learned the market very well. I then started Bin Zomah Tech Company.</p><h4>How has the market changed and how has it evolved through Vision 2030?</h4><p>The vision now is to make everything electronic; e-business, e-government, and e-banking, and this is the vision for 2030. If you do not work on this, then you will be out of the market. Many big companies closed this year and last year because they did not understand how to change their systems. Many big companies have been affected by what has happened recently in the area because the business goes down but we are booming. Even in this critical situation we are doing well. As for the companies still standing, if they do not develop and adapt with the Vision 2030, they will close too.</p><h4>Is this why you are an IT provider? </h4><p>Bin Zomah Tech is a system integrator. Many companies rely on sales area and they have good sales people who can bring the projects and close the deal. After that they face a problem with the implementation, so there needs to be a balance. We do not consider ourselves to be a sales company. We count on deliverables and implementation. Bin Zomah Tech has a very professional engineering team and this is where I invest. So my deliverables are not actually like others and this is what makes the business grow.</p><h4>How do you acquire your projects?</h4><p>Bin Zomah Tech concentrates on doing its best to win the first project from a customer. We go as low as possible in terms of cost so that Bin Zomah Tech can win the project. Once Bin Zomah Tech wins it then sales activity is done through that project using professional planning, design, high quality and efficient implementation, follow up, and documentation, ensuring client satisfaction. Once everything is handled well and we win the clients' satisfaction and trust, then they will come back to us for the second and third projects. We have many loyal customers and if they have a project then they ask us to do it.</p><h4>Do you feel that the Saudi market has enough capacity?</h4><p>I think there are still needs but not for the old fashioned companies. The market needs professional companies and those who count on relationships no longer exist as everything is different now. In the past if you are well connected you could start a company and take projects to get started, but this is no longer the case. Relations are very important but not like before, as it is not easy to give a project to a company that is unqualified. You will be questioned, especially in the public sector but also even for the private sector. Being someone's friend is no longer sufficient. They are looking for a real company who is capable of delivery and the market needs such companies to do this. Most of the big companies in the Saudi market are blacklisted somewhere so this gives you an indication that there is something wrong, especially when you work with Aramco, Sabic, and all the enterprise companies that really see the performance of that company.</p><h4>What are your project plans for 2017 and your expectations for the year?</h4><p>We believe that we are working in a different way to the market. We have a special team that is selected carefully and I really mean that everyone in the company believes that he owns the company. We are really like a family and everyone does their work happily and is satisfied. We have a family environment. We are 40 people across three branches with Saudi, Jordanian, Lebanese, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sudanese, Indonesian, Yemeni, and Egyptian staff. We have a heterogeneous environment that just counts on professionalism. I expect 2017 to be a strong year for clients, projects, and product expansion. The market is not like before financially but when you work in a professional way that does not mean anything. This is because at the end of the day the government or a private business owner understands they will lose a lot and will do their best to allocate the money correctly. So finance is important for luxury projects but not for demand projects. We are doing theaters, meeting rooms, smart classrooms, digital signage, and video walls and there is growth in this in both the public and private sectors. We count on the technical people who show the difference between ourselves and other companies from the design stage. If we do a meeting room we have two designers; AutoCAD and the other is 3D. AutoCAD takes everything from the room to explain how each wire will go through the room and the other shows exactly how the room will be once completed. Once you see this you will be really interested in the product because not so many companies invest in this area. This is why we are winning theaters, meeting rooms, and digital signage. We have huge video wall projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[m-hisham-atalla-managing-director-saudi-total-petroleum-products-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Total Lubricants get started in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Total Lubricants was established in Saudi in 2007; it is a joint venture between Total and local partner Zahid Group. After several years it agreed to structure a new blending factory in King Abdullah Economic City. This factory was inaugurated in 2013 and deals with the production of different types of lubricants with the technology of the Total group. The investment for the blending plant was around USD15 million, and the capacity is around 45,000 tons per year. Since then, there has been a growth tendency for Total lubricants here. After this, we developed three branches and three warehouses in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam, and these exist to be able to provide a better service for our customers. We have 269 products in different types of containers, and right now we are at an 8% market share. What we are expecting to do in the coming years is very ambitious. We recently signed a contract with Michelin to have mutual services and lubricants. Currently, we have blended service centers, and it has multi-branded products, but with the Michelin service centers our lubricants will be served the most, alongside Michelin tires. Therefore, the plans for the coming years are to try to increase our market share through a lot of visibility in the market. Also, on the industrial part we are pushing hard to be able to reach certain market share, higher than the one we have now. We are also approaching  cement and steel factories and recently got approval to be  within the short list of supplier for Aramco.</p><h4>What are the market dynamics today?</h4><p>It is a matter of how flexible we are for changes in the market. Two or three years ago the major channel of sales was construction, and now there is a slowdown in that channel, so we have to be flexible to change. This is why we made an agreement with Michelin and others, to be able to reach the end consumer rather than sending bulk to construction companies. That will start up again but it will take some time, but what is still working reasonably for us is the consumer market. Since we do not own a network for fuel stations, we have to go after the service centers. Last year we made some changes, some diversification, and we have tripled our targets in the industrial and automotive market.</p><h4>To what extent do you import?</h4><p>We use Luberef, but sometimes we import some special lubricants. Now an expansion is being made in which it is going to make group two, but even with group two we cannot make synthetics—it has to be group three, and for this group we have to import either from Europe or Singapore. So, if we want to sell synthetics, we have to import.</p><h4>Is it possible that you will expand in the future and export more from Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>It's always a target to expand locally and work in opening markets for export. Export has criteria that govern its success, including the cost of product, freight, Forex and a long list of issues that have to be considered. We are studying it carefully to start export very soon.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Here, two major things that are constantly used are lubricants and tires. These two things will remain because of the long distances that people travel here, so we will keep a focus on these areas. In the construction market, I believe there will be a movement in the near future; this will give a push, but it will not be immediately shown in the market. We will also give a push on the retailing side, in terms of sales, and approaching and reaching end consumers, which is not of big interest to many companies. Another area where we will push this year is special fluids.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Al Hilal Bank select Kazakhstan as the hub to branch out into?</h4><p>Al Hilal Bank's decision was very much a product of the growing ties between the UAE and Kazakhstan. There was an interest on the part of the Kazakhstan President and government to foster Islamic finance in the country and in 2009 an intergovernmental agreement was signed regarding establishing an Islamic bank in Kazakhstan. As a result, it was a natural first step for Al Hilal Bank to look at Kazakhstan as its first foreign market outside of the UAE. We were established, licensed, and registered here fairly quickly after that, and started our operations in early 2010. Cooperation and support on the legal and regulatory framework from the Kazakhstan government has continued ever since. Most recently, the President's support has been evident with the AIFC's focus on Islamic finance as one of its key pillars. Not surprisingly, the first few years for Al Hilal were investment years, where we set up the business, hired people, developed processes, and built our client base. However, for the last five years we have been profitable with our corporate business here. We have an established client base that has appreciated our commitment to customer service, and we have continued to build the business, though on a careful basis and risk conservative  approach. For example, in terms of our credit reviews, we ensure we lend to solid businesses that are able to service their financing arrangements with us. We have been quite successful with this business and do not have any non-performing financings on our books.</p><h4>In 2017, Al Hilal took the step to establish its retail business in Kazakhstan. Why now?</h4><p>Retail banking has been part of the strategy for the bank for a while. Our ambitions were clear, though it was a matter of finding the right opportunity and window, which emerged in recent times. We ran a pilot program in 2016 to attract retail deposits from individual customers. We had conservative targets and far exceeded those within weeks; we realized there was a demand for this. People see that we are 100% government-owned in Abu Dhabi, which speaks to our credit-worthiness. The market here also understands the UAE because there are many business and government connections and many people holiday there. We decided to launch our flagship retail branch in Almaty and the timing was fortuitous. With other developments in the local banking market, we have been able to present Al Hilal Bank as a strong partner for people seeking a safe and secure place to deposit their money.</p><h4>How would you describe Al Hilal Bank's typical client base, particularly in the retail segments? Are you going for market share or quality of customer?</h4><p>We have focused on the quality of our customers in the corporate sector, and we will do the same in the retail space. We are not seeking to grab a large market share; we will acquire new retail customers by applying a careful and considered approach and paying due attention to their credit-worthiness. Our retail strategy includes offering financing products for individuals, which we are in the process of implementing. We started with accounts and deposit products, partly to build the funding base we need to provide retail-financing products. We are launching our pilot financing products in 4Q2017 with the aim to launch these products publicly in 2Q2018.</p><h4>How educated and aware is the market today in Kazakhstan about Islamic financing products?</h4><p>Awareness and education about Islamic finance and some of the differences between it and conventional banking products are issues we have to deal with here in Kazakhstan. This has been part of our corporate mission since the Bank started here. We have done this with various seminars we have organized and special training sessions for corporate customers that have not been exposed to Islamic finance before. For example, there are some differences in the way Islamic banking products are treated from an accounting and tax perspective. And we do such training on an ongoing basis. We are mindful that there is a lack of awareness in the local market, and education is a big part of improving this. Nonetheless, this vision is also being supported and fostered from the very top. President Nazarbayev announced in September 2017 at the Global Islamic Finance Awards that Kazakhstan would issue a USD300 million sukuk in 2018. We see this as a potential investment opportunity both here and in the UAE. Judging by other sovereign bond issues in the past few years, there has been considerable interest in the Kazakhstan credit, and presumably it will be the same among sukuk holders. In the current global environment, this offering could potentially provide a good yield.</p><h4>What are your key objectives and expectations for 2018?</h4><p>Our recently opened branch in Esentai Tower in Almaty is our flagship branch in Kazakhstan as it is primarily focused on the retail market. We are not seeking to roll out a large number of physical branches across the country. But we will look to expand our offering beyond the three cities where we have branches now, Shymkent, Almaty, and Astana, and potentially open another branch in one of the other regions at some point. However, our expansion will be very much focused on the digital and online offering. We have an internet banking platform that we will roll out shortly. We have been doing this in steps on the retail side. We will seek to roll out a digital mobile app in the near future to offer remote banking service to our customers wherever they are in the country. Both 2017 and 2018 are again investment years, similar to the early years we spent establishing our corporate business here. However, in 2018, as we launch our financing products, we will start to build the revenues from the retail business and will see more significant growth beyond 2018. In 2017 we have remained positive and healthy from a profit perspective and we expect this to continue into 2018.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of SATBA in Iran's shift toward renewable energy?</h4><p>SATBA is a national hub and a center for research and technical activities for developing renewable energy and working on energy efficiency. Moreover, it is responsible for creating a proper ground for the implementation of power plant projects with the cooperation of the private sector and providing access to different sources of clean and renewable energy by using the great available potential of the country. We laid the groundwork with our analysis, feasibility studies, and resource assessment in the field of renewable energy and developed different renewable energy projects in the country with the help of pioneering companies from Europe and Asia. We also started pilot projects for each field of solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen, and geothermal power generation. We have an average of 300 sunny days in Iran per year, which demonstrates our potential in the field of solar energy. Moreover, based on our analysis, we have the economic potential to install a 30,000MW wind power plant in Iran. The technical potential is 140,000MW and, based on our studies, there are 15 potent geothermal regions in Iran that have great potential for geothermal power production. Every city in Iran with a population of over 200,000 people has the potential for the installation of a biomass power plant. These studies provide a roadmap for our organization to develop the renewable energy sector in Iran and implement our involvement in this field.</p><h4>What is SATBA's role in increasing Iran's renewable energy capacity?</h4><p>The current total installed power capacity in Iran is 75,000MW, of which 10,000MW comes from large hydropower plants. In order to increase the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix, parliament tasked the Ministry of Energy and SATBA, through the Sixth Development Plan, to increase the share of renewable energy to 5,000MW in the next five years. The share of wind and solar are larger than other sources. SATBA will play a key role in this development. Two years ago we started a new policy to increase the capacity of renewable energy. Rules and regulations provide that the entire 5,000MW should be put in place by the private sector, either Iranian or foreign. SATBA's role is to formulate policies, coordinate the processes, and support the private sector, making the application process easier and less time consuming. We provide contracts to the private sector that will guarantee their return on investment. These guaranteed Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) contracts are between SATBA and private-sector companies and have a duration of 20 years. Throughout this period, investors can be assured that they can sell the generated electricity at a fair price, as the tariff is among the most attractive in the world. Many investors, especially from foreign countries, have expressed their interest in entering the Iranian renewable energy sector, alone or through a partnership with an Iranian company.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future?</h4><p>The renewable energy market in Iran is emerging and attractive because the government and people of Iran are interested in environmentally friendly technologies. Based on our analysis there are many areas in the country that have great potential, especially for solar and wind projects. In the next five years, the Ministry of Energy wants to increase the total power capacity to 100,000MW. Most policymakers in Iran want to increase the share of renewable energy due to the great potential, environmental issues, and the ability of renewable energy to create jobs and deliver electricity to non-developed areas of the country. We are a developing country, and the demand for electricity is increasing. We try to find solutions for the challenges that foreign investors might still see. In addition, the private sector is allowed to export electricity to neighboring countries. We see a bright future for renewable energy in Iran and seek to overcome the remaining challenges and facilitate the process. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy regarding the diversification of Fakher Holding, and which sectors are of particular interest?</h4><p>In addition to the activities in which some of our subsidiaries are currently involved, such as office furniture, decoration, and branded clothing, we intend to adopt and develop a forward-looking strategy toward diversifying our products and services in as many relevant business sectors as practically possible. To meet current and future market demands, this strategy should certainly contain elemental factors to expand, in particular, the operations of Tipax and TPX. For this purpose, we have to move toward the creation of a perfect business ecosystem with a capacity for new investments. Since Tipax is the first private post operator in Iran, we will apply the most advanced technology in each business sector in order to achieve a high market share in courier and postal services and enhance our competitiveness with pioneering international firms such as DHL. It is important to keep pace with the latest market trends, needs, and customer expectations, and we will do so by recruiting and training human resources equipped with knowledge, skills, and expertise.</p><h4>With the signing of JCPOA, the opportunity has arisen to expand your operations abroad. What steps have you taken to increase Fakher Holding's footprint abroad?</h4><p>We hope and sensibly expect that this deal will provide excellent opportunities for trade to flourish at local and global levels by changing the present economic climate. As such, we contemplate the concept of our dynamic presence in regional and global markets with emphasis on high service quality, competitive prices, after-sale services, and more active participation in international forums and exhibitions. To this end, we plan the development of our communications networks inside and outside the country. More notably, the first bold step has been taken by creating a trading company in London and Dubai. Today, Tipax is doing global business, and the aim is to expand it rapidly to become a top-performing, world-class postal service and logistics provider in the region.</p><h4>How will Fakher Holding capitalize on the growth of e-commerce in the future?</h4><p>E-commerce in Iran is still in its infancy. Fakher Holding has predicted some new business models in its survey that are hinged on the market potential and our proven track records. The current Iranian market is right and suitable for deeper involvement in e-commerce, which needs secure and express transport services to satisfy customers' demands. Tipax is one of our major subsidiaries and has substantial capabilities in this particular sector. Thus, Fakher Holding has contemplated e-commerce as one of its strategic goals by focusing on the upgrade of the logistics sector as the main facilitator. E-commerce has had tremendous positive impacts on the expansion, development, and growth of our courier services and has yielded productive results in customers' growing demand and increase in the volume of shipments as well as the growth rate in the B2C sector.</p><h4>How do you view the potential of Tipax to compete with global industry leaders?<br></h4><p>Tipax has started to broaden and diversify its range of services and has accordingly nurtured the 3PL approach at the level of executive directors. It is worth mentioning that Tipax initially included provision of logistics services as a response to market needs and customization. Currently, plans are underway for more investments toward full attainment, and we may use the successful models initiated and experienced by the credible international companies as a benchmark for future expansion of our logistics sector. Today, it is an undeniable fact that provision of logistics services and the creation of a proper supply chain are requirements of any activity in international trade and are regarded as the main tools for achieving an organization's goals. Tipax is backed by more than half a century of experience in private logistics and courier services. It has great potential to become a pioneering company in the Middle East and even far beyond, and to compete with the world's leading logistics companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>
