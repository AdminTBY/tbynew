		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the scope of your company in Abu Dhabi and the UAE?</h4><p><strong>Dietmar Siersdorfer</strong> We are headquartered here in Abu Dhabi for our Middle East operations, with local setups in the GCC countries, and we have focused on intensifying our relations with governments and local companies throughout the region. For example, in Abu Dhabi we have signed a significant contract for a compressor station in Taweelah that will pump gas from Abu Dhabi to Dubai. We are also working on our collaboration for Expo 2020 in Dubai, following the signing of our premium partnership to be technology partner for intelligent infrastructure and operations.</p><p><strong>Bernard Roux</strong> Thales has been present in the country for more than 40 years and has supported the country in development, bringing innovation here for the service and benefit of customers. Although present in more than 50 countries and with 65,000 employees worldwide, the UAE holds a special place for Thales due to the in-house know-how base we have developed here. We have solutions in defense, security, ground transportation, aerospace, and our entire portfolio is present in the country.</p><h4>What infrastructure projects are you working on? </h4><p><strong>DS</strong> We are working with the government in Abu Dhabi and in the Northern Emirates with Federal Electricity and Water Authority (FEWA), where we signed an exclusive partnership to develop the FEWA power plant project. We have also signed a corporate agreement with ADNOC, through which we intend to focus on using digitalization to improve energy efficiency and operations across all ADNOC subsidiaries. At the Global Manufacturing and Industrialization Summit in Abu Dhabi this year we also featured our work in additive manufacturing and 3D printing. With our local partners we produced a 3D-printed frame for an airplane television screen, which is the first certified 3D printed part for aircraft interiors to be produced in the Middle East. The frame will be used in older airplanes, for which parts can take up to 120 days to deliver, and the idea is to drastically shorten that lead time. The weight and structural integrity of the 3D printed part is also much better than the original part, which equates to lower fuel costs. We teamed up with Etihad and Strata on this co-creation partnership, and we are now working on new ideas to develop the product further.</p><h4>What are some of the knowledge transfer and training programs Thales can bring to Abu Dhabi in light of the development of local aerospace manufacturing? </h4><p><strong>BR</strong> Thales is aligned with the expectation and the strategy of the UAE authorities. This includes the development of the local industry, of our partnerships, and our technology transfer schemes. It is a normal behavior as a long partner of the UAE. Our capabilities are close to their needs and we aim at increasing the customer feedback to enhance the efficiency of the service we deliver to them. Together with the satisfaction of the customer and end-user, one of the key points of our strategy is to enhance the local footprint. </p><h4>What is your vision for digitalization, and how does that tie into Abu Dhabi's development as a global smart city? </h4><p><strong>DS</strong> We believe digitalization will play a significant role in the development of Abu Dhabi's economic development. A research report we launched with Strategy&amp; revealed that while 85% of companies in the GCC believe that digitalization could play a significant role in their company, just 3% consider they are advanced with their digital strategy. So most companies are at the beginning stages of their implementation, although we also found that across the Middle East, governments are generally further advanced with digitalization than the private sector. </p><h4>How are you building a platform in the UAE to grow in the region? What are some of the projects that you have in these other nations?</h4><p><strong>BR</strong> We currently have over 300 people in the UAE, in all domains including operations and engineering. We intend to grow, for the benefit of the UAE but also the region. We want to foster a hub for innovation and competences across the GCC with its base in the UAE. Regarding expansion, we can always do better. We can always find one solution that has not yet been delivered to one country or another. Instead of focusing on what we want to sell, we like to focus on the customer expectation and satisfaction. It is by that that we will enhance our footprint. The plan for the future is to have a positive impact in the country's development, in the projects we deliver, and to translate that into growth for the region. In that respect, Thales' objective is to be an active participant of the national agendas to support national strategic plans such as UAE Vision 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the association's key milestones?</h4><p><span></span>Sheikh Saqr Bin Mohammed Al Qasimi Sharjah has always been a pioneer in breaking barriers for Arab women in the sports world. Ever since the formation of the first women's sports club in the UAE three decades ago in Sharjah, under the patronage of HH the wife of the Ruler of Sharjah, Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, achievements have been building up for female athletes and teams both in domestic tournaments and abroad. The Sports Council remains committed to supporting such clubs, and recently has merged under its umbrella the newly formed Sharjah Women Sports Foundation, headed by one of the council's board members, to further dedicate focus to this important field, recruit more talent, and support female athletes in their careers.</p><p>Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulla Al Thani The Sharjah Golf and Shooting Club started in 2005, and today we have a nine-hole golf course, basketball courts, swimming pools, tennis courts, a mixed gym, a lady's gym, and both male and female spas. We also have our shooting department, archery, three different restaurants, football fields, CrossFit gyms, and a state-of-the-art paintball course. The club is diverse in terms of sport and has spawned a passion for staying active, trying new activities in Sharjah, while providing people the highest level of service. Our golf course, which has been internationally recognized for its quality turf and nine holes, is one of just a few fully flood-lit courses in the UAE and provides players with the possibility of playing and staying active day or night.</p><h4>How do you work to nurture local talent and boost Sharjah's goal to become a sports hub in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>SSBMAQ Talent discovery camps are in place all year long. Scouting programs in partnership with children, youth, and girls centers are activated, followed by domestic training camps and occasionally international ones to allow this discovered talent to grow. Once the athlete joins one of the Emirate's clubs officially, attractive benefits and compensation are also awarded and a career is planned to allow him or her to unlock their highest potential. Last year, through a reformation of the Sharjah Sports Council, a diversified group of experts were appointed in the new board. The new formation came with a clear set of objectives and a new strategy to focus on discovering talent, investing in nurturing athletes, and—with the appointments of two female board members for the first time in the history of the council—dedicating a focused branch of the council's agenda and budget to the advancement of women in sports as well.</p><p><span></span>SMBAAT Firstly, being in Sharjah means we are family oriented, and we seek to provide this kind of atmosphere for our guests, thereby offering the club a unique selling point that is appreciated by families across the region. We also offer weekend or mid-week membership, though most of our members prefer the mid-week option. The mid-week option allows us to offer a more affordable price for members while leaving the weekends free to host competitions and championships, which in turn increases our visibility and profile throughout the region. As the club has grown and expanded into new sports and activities, membership has followed. There has been a large wave of people who wish to live more active lifestyles. We also have a popular juniors program for the children and teenagers, which is one of the strongest in the Emirates. We collaborate and work with many local schools to promote golf and other active sports. We can accommodate groups of 1,000-1,500 people on a variety of different activities making us one of the most flexible and accommodating venues. There is something going on almost every day.</p><h4>How would you characterize your importance in the economic development of the Emirate?</h4><p><span></span>SSBMAQ By hosting international tournaments, forums, and other events, the council is contributing in bringing traffic into the Emirate that will both achieve more exposure for Sharjah, and more business brought into its hospitality and tourism sectors.</p><p><span></span>SMBAAT Sharjah Golf and Shooting Club hosted the European Senior Tour in March 2017, one of the biggest events in the world and watched by 500 million people. It was a great honor to host it, and it was the first time in history that a European championship has been played on a nine-hole golf course. Apart from our advantageous location, we were able to show off our weather, accessibility, and hospitality offerings in the Emirate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Skyline University developed since its inception?</h4><p><strong>AMITABH UPADHYA </strong>Our most important milestone is completing 25 years. We are the only private university or business school in the UAE that has reached this anniversary and celebrated our Silver Jubilee. HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi was the chief guest at our graduation ceremony. Sharjah is fortunate because His Highness' vision of education and culture has made the Emirate a leader in both sectors. In addition to that, our BBA and MBA programs were reaccredited by the Ministry of Higher Education. We introduced exciting new majors at both levels. At the BBA level, we introduced public administration to train young people for governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations as well as non-profit organizations. At the master's level, we introduced e-governance to be offered alongside our most popular major, strategic management and leadership. Three years ago, we established a center of entrepreneurship and innovation, which has been enormously popular. This aligns with the vision of the UAE and the Ruler of Sharjah to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, especially at the university level. This center allows us to help students and young entrepreneurs cope with the difficulties inherent in starting a business.</p><p><span></span><strong>KAMAL PUR</strong>I Skyline envisions being a globally renowned university that nurtures the spirit of innovation and creativity toward building a knowledge based society. Skyline University was established almost three decades ago. The main goal at the time was to create an organization for business and management training and education, starting with travel and tourism, then marketing, international business, and IT, but by IT we produce businesspeople for the sector, rather than programmers or hardware engineers. We confine ourselves to business and management education because we feel we require more managers and leaders in any organization. Since then, we have graduated at least 12,000 students who are working with airlines, hotels, and tourism companies as well as manufacturing and service industries locally, nationally, regionally, and globally. Tourism is the world's largest industry when we consider the entire value chain. Globally, it accounts for 10.7% of world GDP, and we are the only institution that caters to this demand in the UAE, which combines academia and vocational training.</p><h4>What are your strategies to ensure Skyline graduates are in high demand and remain relevant in a rapidly changing environment? </h4><p><span></span><strong>AU</strong> 95% of Skyline University graduates find gainful employment immediately after graduation. Skyline maintains an active and involved corporate affairs department that regularly interacts with various sectors of industry. This led us to introduce a new concept that we call the CEO lecture series, where once a semester a prominent CEO comes and speaks to students. There is no set topic or duration; we only ask that they describe their journey, experiences, and how they reached their current position. We also have MoUs with 15 different government departments, including Shurooq and SEWA. We offer employees at these organizations scholarships through these MoUs to complete their graduate or postgraduate degrees, thus creating a revolving door. To receive the scholarship, they are given a mandate from their department to maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 in order for the degree to be applicable for any promotion. This, in turn, helps the university maintain higher quality. We have a network of over 3,000 alumni, some of whom attend the annual alumni meetings to hold panel discussions and networking functions. Getting our students and alumni gainful employment has never been an issue.</p><p><span></span><strong>KP</strong> Training and education is no longer in bricks. It is in bricks and clicks. Today, travel and tourism has changed. Hotels and airline tickets can be booked from mobile phones, and the public no longer requires hotel and travel agents. There is a growing demand for tour operators (outbound/ inbound) as well as destination planners and MICE professionals. Skyline provides trained and qualified manpower to provide training and education in the growing qualified manpower in the field of travel and tourism, IT, and business and management. Most companies make the mistake of cutting corners with training, which ultimately leads to poor operational execution and the loss of clients. One of the most important things we are doing is the gamification of education, whereby we turn studying into a game. Rather than pushing education in its raw form, we try to pull people in and make them want to study by offering a challenging and structured learning environment where progress is controlled by the student rather than instructed by a teacher. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you establishing yourselves as leaders in the sustainable engineering community?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ALTAF HUSSAIN</strong> I tried to diversify GECO M&amp;E's business lines. We have four major divisions, including mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP); power; facilities management; and fire protection. When I took over, the MEP division was the biggest one, generating almost 80% of GECO M&amp;E's revenue, with the remaining revenue coming from the other, significantly smaller, divisions. I felt there was a need to diversify all our business lines, as well as grow the business. Now MEP makes up almost 40% of our revenue, power 30%, fire protection has increased to 15%, and facilities management contributes almost 15%. We have also started a new extra low voltage (ELV) division because the requirements in the UAE are changing and we want to address this new segment of the market. Our ELV division covers home and building automation, security systems and cameras, gate barriers, parking management systems, internet protocol television, and the like. With this strategy, GECO M&amp;E's business has grown considerably, and our staff has grown from 1,700 to 2,500 over the last four years.</p><p><span></span><strong>GEORGE BERBARI </strong>DC Pro Engineering is a highly specialized electromechanical firm that focuses on district cooling, power generation, and green building. We are behind 90% of the implemented air conditioning and energy innovations in the Middle East. While the amount of resources and opportunities are huge, the efforts to optimize sustainability and limit waste are minimal. We have one of the largest carbon footprints per capita in the world when it comes to energy. Despite several success stories, we have yet to impact energy consumption trends. The effort in Sharjah must involve detailed structure and coherence. As Sharjah is growing more and more dependent on energy imports, we must focus on reducing consumption of energy as well as utilizing its existing energy, mostly natural gas, as effectively as possible. We have been very successful in the UAE and GCC simply because of the need for district cooling. Our unique expertise covers development, operation, design, maintenance, and all other aspects of the business and has enabled us to be industry leaders.</p><h4>How does the current trend for green buildings and sustainable construction affect your operations?</h4><p><span></span>AH All the tenders that we are receiving require us to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards. For some projects, they ask for LEED Silver and for others LEED Gold standard. We recently signed a contract with Majid Al Futtaim to build a substation in Zahia City Center Mall that will be LEED-Gold compliant. This is an international standard that ensures a building is designed to maximize energy efficiency and make the most of renewable, sustainable resources. The standard goes from silver to gold and then platinum.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>GB</strong> The UAE's signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was a big step in the right direction. Sharjah must follow the lead of Dubai and Abu Dhabi and seek investment in solar, wind, and green building. The Sharjah government has taken the initiative by establishing waste-to-energy projects and is attempting to recycle large swaths of construction waste. However, stricter regulation with more enforcement is still necessary. By using aerated blocks rather than the block and insulation currently used, we could cut construction waste from 5% to 1%. Energy policy is very complex and requires much research and dedication to begin to understand how to address it effectively and efficiently.</p><h4>What are some of your most significant projects at the moment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AH </strong>The Tilal City development is one of the big projects for our power division. Also, recently we have signed huge contracts of USD77 million for the construction of two substations and the other one for the USD100-million Lulu Hypermarket in Sharjah. We are the MEP and fire-fighting contractor for Dubai Municipality for their "Dubai Frame" project. We are installing almost 400km of fiber-optic cable in Sharjah that will be used for smart metering and monitoring. Our pipeline of work is full for 2017 as well as 2018.</p><h4>How do you engage with the community and encourage more sustainable practices? </h4><p><span></span><strong>GB</strong> While DC Pro Engineering is a business that operates for profit, we are also a business with a mission. For years, we have never given up on trying to create change, though this is happening slower than we would like. Through perseverance and education the sustainable engineering trend in the UAE and the region is gaining momentum. We attend several conferences a year, and publish books, papers, and articles, all with the goal of sharing knowledge, engaging the construction and MEP community, and accelerating change as fast as possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have you pursued to be successful?  </h4><p><span></span><strong>RICHARD LINEVELDT </strong>We took a decision when we started Gama Aviation in the Middle East in 2008 to focus our operation and efforts on expansion plans in the region in Sharjah. The reason for doing that was the unique opportunity we saw in an underserved market, together with an environment and a set of stakeholders at the airport, including both previously mentioned authorities as well as the other colleagues, operators, and concession holders on the airport. We also wanted to expand the business aviation sector at the airport, understanding that the volume and the business, which aviation would bring to Sharjah, adds to the unique capabilities. We have worked with the airport through the years to establish the perfect location for us. We have been operating our own aircraft from here since 2008. However, more importantly, we opened up this facility in 2012 to handle passengers and VIP movements out of Sharjah International Airport. That has given us a great sense of the business demands every year. We have managed to attract many UAE-based aircraft to Sharjah for passenger services, maintenance, cleaning, and overall operations of the aircraft. </p><p><span></span><strong>ADEL AL ALI </strong>For businesses to be successful in these times, they need to be adaptable to social and economic trends. This is where true innovation comes into play. When applied to all aspects of the business, innovation can truly steer operations back in the right direction.  For example, as a low-cost carrier, our aim is to make air travel affordable. What really sets us apart is our dedication to ensuring value-for-money and great service. We carried more than 8.4 million passengers in 2016, recording a 12% increase on 2015 figures.  We currently operate a total fleet of 47 Airbus A320 aircraft, serving over 130 routes in 35 countries from our five hubs in the UAE, Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan. </p><h4>What is the importance of location? </h4><p><span></span><strong>RL</strong> If you go back to 2008, there was no Dubai World Central Airport. At the time, we had to make the decision of going to Sharjah or Dubai International Airport, which had three FBOs. Sharjah is 15km away from Dubai International Airport. We believe that is a much more central location for serving the historical center of Dubai, together with the northern Emirates. That has proven to be fairly true. We use Dubai World Central Airport from time to time for our own aircraft. However, we were fortunate, though, getting in early with Sharjah Airport Authority to get it to have faith in us and allow us to have exclusivity. Exclusivity is the key to building a customer base when you are small and have to make loads of investments. We have a 25-year concession agreement here now, the first five years of which will be exclusive. It was what we required to be sure that the investment we are making is worth it for both parties. We are confident that after those five years we will be set. </p><p><span></span><strong>AAA T</strong>he Middle East is home to over 350 million potential travelers, and our multi-hub structure offers us the diversity and flexibility to tap into this market. All destinations on our network are strategically evaluated and operated. We learn a lot from our existing operations in all markets, and we continuously aim to serve the business and tourism needs of our customers. Trabzon and Baku expand our list of destinations and enhance the network we have established serving leisure demands of customers across the Middle East and North Africa. The integrated network across multiple regions has massively contributed to the success of our operations and Air Arabia is open to expanding in regions that continue to support this strategy. Since our inception, we have committed to building our network, and today we remain the largest low-cost carrier (LCC) in the Middle East and North Africa. Almost 15 years into operations, we have seen many low-budget carriers enter the market and take on different operational strategies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your impact on the marine industry in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Lars Seistrup</strong> Our newest facility is in Sharjah, where we have had our head office for the last three and a half years. This is where we have our main activity and where we focus on ship repair, conversions, oil and gas, and new buildings. We are officially a Dubai-based JV company owned by Albwardy Investment Dubai and Damen, NL, and despite the depressed economy, we have a full scale and fully functioning new building yard. In Dubai, we have been operating now for 39 years as the company originally started in 1978. In Fujairah, we have a workshop that mainly does afloat repairs, meaning repairs to the vessels that are on the anchorage in Fujairah. We also have a diving division that works primarily out of Fujairah, and occasionally in Africa and Oman.</p><p><strong>Basel Shuhaibe</strong>r MAP Marine Technologies is a division dedicated to the development and production of unmanned solutions and other navigation systems with numerous applications in various fields within the maritime industry. For example, our autopilot device, MAP, is well suited for the fishing industry, allowing the captain to tend to his fishing and other tasks while the autopilot system controls the boat's course. Oil and gas sectors also benefit from our unmanning kit, MAP Pro, where unlike MAP it can be remotely controlled from a distant point off the boat, enabling the operators to run their data collection and surveillance rounds, communicating back to the main ship without having to send their team out to sea. Our MAP Marine Auto-Pilot is both practical and fun to use, making it the perfect fit for the leisure boat segment. It is patented as the first such system where you can control the operation on your mobile or tablet through a downloadable app whereby users set their course and entire route, like a self-driving car. If they want to change course they can simply steer left and right using their phone. We launched this product in 2017 and have already sold about 200 units, with about 25% of these sales in the UAE alone.</p><h4>What are some aspects of your broader strategy? </h4><p><span></span><strong>LS </strong>We were founded almost 40 years ago in Dubai as Albwardy Marine Engineering. Damen came into the picture in 2008. When we came here we branded this place as Damen Shipyard Sharjah. That became confusing on the branding side, appearing as if we operate two entities when in reality it was only one. Albwardy Damen has excellent cooperation with the Sharjah government. There are two authorities here, the Hamriyah Free Zone Authority and the Sharjah Port Authority. The water part is covered by the Sharjah Port, and the land is managed by Hamriyah Authority. While the Hamriyah Free Zone Authority and Sharjah Port Authority are not one company, they are close. HE Sheikh Khaled Bin Abdullah Bin Sultan Al Qasimi is the chairman for both, lending their operations a sense of natural synergy. Sheikh Khaled also makes himself very accessible and proactive. The Hamriyah Free Zone is extremely business friendly and affords companies sufficient space and services to successfully run their businesses. We have seen numerous benefits from being located here. For us as a shipyard, it is a double bonus as we utilize the water and the land. The Sharjah Port is one of the most professionally run ports in the world, and its management really understands how business is done.</p><p><span></span><strong>BS </strong>The introduction of MAP Marine Technologies (MAP-Tech) has shifted the majority of our clients from individual and recreational operators to industrial and defense end-users. Whilst of course we maintain all our target profiles—leisure, commercial, industrial—and continue to cater to them with our various products, being the only private company globally to produce readily available autonomous technology at competitive rates has greatly impacted our sales direction and allowed us to compete at government tenders for defence projects. To date, we have been awarded projects in the US and are engaged in discussions with Canada as well as several other countries in the GCC, Africa, and the Southeast Pacific region. Building a defence vessel involves more severe scenarios, both physically and with respect to communication. We have to consider that the vessel will be exposed to harsher conditions and will need to be more ruggedized. Furthermore, in terms of operation, we must secure the communication between the point of operation and the unmanned vessel from potential hacking attempts. In the commercial industry, the system should not be susceptible to hacking either, but the type of encryption is quite different. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of your industrial park?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Abdelaziz Fikr</strong>i Sharjah Asset Management (SAM), the investment arm of the government of Sharjah, launched ASIO in accordance with its vision to create a strong and diversified economy and further boost the competitiveness and prosperity of the Emirate. Aspiring to be the one of the largest industrial parks of its kind in the region, ASIO will help contribute to the sustainable growth of the Emirate. The industrial park is a dedicated platform for the industrial sector in the UAE. Its strategic location, together with state-of-the-art infrastructure, grants the Emirate a competitive edge. Moreover, it will allow businesses based in ASIO to flourish and make use of land, sea, and air links. ASIO stretches over an area of 14 million sqft and comprises 353 multi-use plots, including 220 plots for light industries, 53 plots for medium industries, and 80 plots for mixed-use businesses, in addition to three plots for retail and one for staff accommodation. These are available to Arab nationals as freehold and as 100-year leases for non-Arabs.</p><p><span></span><strong>Mohammed N. Al Hazzaa</strong> State-owned zones have different objectives than the ECIC and therefore different customers. First, they typically aim to attract megaprojects with grand ambitions that can rarely be sustained or undertaken by a private company with stockholders. In contrast, we target SMEs. Secondly, we are more flexible than the larger free zones and industrial cities. That flexibility is a testament to our policies and central to adjusting our costs in line with business owners and payment schedules to meet an ever-changing business environment. Larger industrial zones are unable to match our personal touch and flexibility when it comes to supporting businesses. We do this in the hope that it helps struggling SMEs survive in a competitive- and low-priced marketplace. Small businesses are the backbone not only of local and developing economies, but also of communities structured around the family unit. We are very proud of the presence we have in local communities, the businesses that occupy the Emirates Industrial City, and the support we can offer them.</p><h4>What effect do the free zones in Sharjah have on your business?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AF </strong>ASIO represents a new concept in industrial oases and free zones. It offers free zones benefits, while investors in these plots are also exempt from service charges. Bank finance is also being offered on easy terms. ASIO is one-of-kind as it offers direct access to world-class logistical infrastructure for companies to import, export, or re-export goods and materials, both into and out of the UAE. The industrial plots offer companies one of the region's most business-friendly locations. In addition, ASIO is set apart as it offers post-implementation community management.</p><p><span></span><strong>MNAH</strong> The effect will be positive. We have very different functions and hopefully we are able to complement and support each other, business to business. For this to occur we must establish a strong and open line of communication between all the parties concerned as well as relevant government organizations. We have to work together to ensure that Sharjah remains a preferred business area, not only for industrial purposes, but also commercial, logistics, and other services. An easy way to do this is by referring to these economic zones or special economic centers. Additionally, as Sharjah has some of best universities in the Middle East, we should work to develop programs designed to attract graduates into the industry. We have signed an agreement with Sharjah University to work in partnership to create internships and on-the-job training to give academics opportunities to enter the private workforce. Rather than finishing university and finding themselves without job prospects or seeking out government jobs, we want graduates to get involved with the industrial sector to gain real work experience. In GCC countries, it is not uncommon for young people to rely on the public sector to find employment. Unfortunately, this mentality can be detrimental to growth in the private sector. We are trying to change this mentality and support a transition toward creating jobs and promoting efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

This has helped in attracting more exhibitors from across the world and quality visitors from across the target markets, resulting in improving Sharjah's standing as one of the most diversified economies as well as an investment destination in the region. Being an active member of prestigious international and regional entities like the Global Association of the Exhibition Industry (UFI), International Association of Exhibitions and Events (IAEE), and Arab Union for International Exhibitions and Conferences, as well as our association with many industry bodies, has helped us establish Sharjah's presence on the global exhibitions map.</p><p><span></span><strong>JIHAD SOLAIMAN T</strong>he USARTC is a business hub that bridges US and UAE companies and entrepreneurs. It was originally founded with a focus on goods trading and has since expanded to provide consultation and office space for the business operations of foreign companies. The center helps to enable entrepreneurs in expanding their market into MENA, the GCC, and the US by assisting with all business set-up needs in order to accommodate the thriving entrepreneurial and start-up environment.</p><h4>How do you create synergies with other businesses and entities in Sharjah?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SMAM</strong> We work closely with the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), and its support and guidance have helped us tremendously in promoting local industries and SMEs in a big way. SMEs are the lifeline of local industry, and we give them a great opportunity to market their products through our shows and events. Sharjah is also building a new 4 million-sqft exhibition and conference center in Al Tai district. Expo Centre, along with its sister organization in Khor Fakkan, and the new facility will work together to establish Sharjah as a nerve center of the events and exhibitions industry in the region and across the world. </p><p><span></span><strong>JS </strong>American companies usually look for free zones, so we maintain good relationships with the free zone authorities and can offer companies locations in free zones. This is one of the most attractive aspects of the center, as we provide assistance in operating in a free zone; we are able to open the door for companies to the market through our contacts. Operating in a free zone allows US citizens to retain 100% ownership of their company and pay no taxes. The safer, lower-risk environment is beneficial to investors, especially if it is the first time they are expanding internationally.</p><h4>How has your growth evolved over time, and how are you anticipating future growth?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SMAM</strong> We have been registering impressive growth year after year. More than 300,000 people visited 12 events during 1Q2017. There are several factors that have helped us. They include our strategic location, a strong track record of four decades, the support and guidance we receive from the SCCI, state-of-the-art facilities, and highly professional management, marketing, and promotion teams. A clear strategy of investing in niche events that are unique to our region has also helped us a lot. Emphasis on external events has paid us rich dividends. We aim to maintain the momentum for the rest of the year.</p><p><span></span><strong>JS</strong> Over time, the USARTC has attracted more companies in more varied industries. It has expanded to offer more customized office space and to accommodate larger US companies such as Global Eagle (formerly EMC). Global Eagle provides communication satellites and is based here for the region. It offers in-flight entertainment, which is used by companies like Emirates and British Airways. This is one of the most important companies we have and it employs many people. We have other companies offering different types of products, such as Shining Monkey, Goodman, and GMC. We have some customers who are interested in other countries in the region such as Oman or Qatar. We tried to get some high value luxury furniture companies into Saudi Arabia, but right now our main focus is on the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your approach to diversifying and entering the global market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BADR JAFAR</strong> At Crescent Enterprises, we understand the benefits of offering a universal solution that is nuanced for the local market, especially in industries such as ports, logistics, power, and general infrastructure, where we can have a significant impact. Through our ports subsidiary, Gulftainer, for example, we not only offer efficient logistics solutions in the ports we manage across five continents, but also add sustainable value to the economy by supporting local industries and creating local jobs.</p><p><span></span><strong>HE SHEIKH MOHAMMED BIN FAISAL AL QASSIM</strong>I At Manafa, we mainly focus on investments in real estate, capital markets, and private equity. Our current investment strategy is based on the global and regional market changes. We believe a strong brand speaks to and taps into the market far more effectively in today's competitive marketplace. There is no doubt that the competition is very strong here, with many international as well as local brands that want to prove themselves. We offer excellent and consistent service and quality, which is why customers come to us for repeat business.</p><h4>How would you assess the business climate and entrepreneurial ecosystem?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BJ</strong> Entrepreneurship is a top priority across the MENA region, with over half of these countries ranking in the top 50% of the Global Entrepreneurship Index. It is a source of pride to see the UAE lead in the space, with the likes of Souq.com and Careem emerging as recent champions of the region's entrepreneurial ambitions. Today, amidst the digital revolution, we also need to realign our business models toward this new paradigm of entrepreneurship. While profitability and financial returns continue to be primary drivers, we stand a better chance at long-term success by building strong global brands, generating jobs and developing essential skills, and moving from being just a solutions-utilizer to a solutions-provider. At Crescent Enterprises, we are channeling this approach through CE-Ventures, which is our internal incubation division that follows a social enterprise model of business, one that puts people, the planet, and profits into a symbiotic framework and generates a multiplier effect on impact. The goal here is to build responsible, sustainable, and change-evoking start-ups, which are grounded in innovation, and at the same time focus on maximizing stakeholder value-creation, and generating sustainable opportunities for our youth. </p><p><span></span><strong>SMBFAQ I</strong> look at the Emirates as a whole, and although we are based in Sharjah, our operations are spread across all the Emirates. The UAE, including Sharjah, has a very strong and appealing business environment for all, including the private sector. The stability of the country, its accessibility, and location as gateway between East and West capturing the right time zone, safety, infrastructure, choice of business platforms for investors, tax structure, and flexibility of capital movement give foreign investors the perfect foundation for success.</p><h4>Where do you see new opportunities for growth?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BJ</strong> Broadly speaking, besides our home markets in the Middle East and North Africa, the two regions that we are looking to expand into are Sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries in Asia. These regions are emerging as the fastest growing in the world, with overall GDP growth projections over 3%, and in some countries within these regions as high as 5-7%. We are also expanding in the US. Over the last few decades, the investment made toward upgrading US ports' infrastructure has been grossly inadequate. Expanding trade has put severe pressure on the existing system, increasing congestion and threatening US economic competitiveness. Hence our US expansion was driven by the glaring need for modernization and upgrade of US port infrastructure.</p><p><span></span><strong>SMBFAQ</strong> I still believe Dubai is the most attractive place for investors, but there are other Emirates that might generate a greater ROI than Dubai because of their lower cost base. There is no doubt that Dubai has a strong appetite for the international market because of its exposure. However, this also has an element of cost, which means that the return of investment will be less for investors in comparison to areas such as Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, or other emirates. There are more returns further north because of the cost base being lower. This is because land in Dubai is much more expensive than in Sharjah, which is more expensive than Fujairah. The reason is that the government of Dubai is pursuing initiatives, like the canal for example, and when you do dredging the cost of the land next to it goes up. This is natural evolution; there is a nicer lifestyle and better urban planning, but a smaller return, requiring compensation.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your medical city evolved over the years?</h4><p><strong>DR. ABDURAHMAN AL-MUAMMAR</strong> If we delve into a little history, King Khalid University Hospital was established in 1980 as a tertiary care teaching facility. Prior to it, King Abdul-Aziz had been independently operating as a teaching hospital. Both the hospitals were then linked to King Saud University's College of Medicine, providing tertiary care and specialized ophthalmology and otolaryngology care, respectively. With the continued expansion of services and increase in patient visits, a need arose to better reorganize the facility. Hence, in 2012, the foundation for an integrated healthcare system in the shape of King Saud University Medical City was laid. Within a year and half, we remapped our operating model, realigned our governance structure, and established a new strategic direction for the medical city.</p><p><strong>PROF. MAHMOUD SHAHEEN AL AHWAL</strong> I joined the medical faculty in 1977, two years after it was founded. We used to rely on traditional curricula as our method of education and we used to have a well-known, world-class teaching staff, most of which came from outside of Saudi Arabia. At that time, the university hospital had only 250 beds and a basic layout and structure. However, the level of training was outstanding and the services provided were excellent. Since I returned to the Kingdom in 1992, we have not stopped developing. We went from an academic staff of around 50 to more than 400, and we have assistant, associate, and full professorships in all specialties and subspecialties. We send 70% of our young academicians to Canada to complete their post-graduate training, 20% to the US, and 10% to Europe and local programs.</p><h4>How important is the accreditation process in facilitating connections abroad?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAM</strong> We, as a medical city, have to consider the care and education functions for our institution. In terms of medical tourism, clinically, there are two aspects to consider. From the humanitarian perspective, our doors are open to provide care to all, regardless of nationality. From the business perspective, increasing globalization and corporate consumerism have led to an influx of people, particularly from the GCC, which calls for the establishment of high-caliber centers. Accrediting our institution not only ensures infrastructural capacity but also skill adequacy. If we talk about education, medical tourism opens avenues for knowledge sharing, evidence-based learning, and establishing long-term relations. KSUMC is trying to attract foreign students, particularly from the GCC and the Middle East, to further include students from diverse backgrounds. </p><p><span></span><strong>MSAA</strong> One of the achievements that I am proud of, on the hospital side, is our Diamond level of accreditation from Canada International. We have also achieved JCI accreditation. We also have institutional accreditation from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada, and we are the first hospital in the Middle East to achieve this. We consider accreditation a tool, not an end in itself. It is a process that allows us to maintain the quality of care and service we are proud of. It also has substantial benefits for our students because it allows them to be trained according to the most rigorous standards and procedures. This prepares all of our staff to work with any North American hospital.</p><h4>How do you fit into the requirements of Vision 2030 and what are your expectations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAM </strong>Vision 2030 has enabled us to streamline our priorities and steer our movement in the right direction. Our strategy was already in line with our national agenda, but Vision 2030 added more focus to it. We know where we fit in the competitive scenario and how can we facilitate healthcare, education, and research at the national level. Furthermore, since the development of an autonomous governance structure, our goals can be aided by corporatization as an integrated healthcare system. We are now looking forward to partnering with the private sector and seek opportunities of operational collaboration, turning our support functions, like laboratory testing, medical imaging, rehabilitation, and sterilization, into services for a larger population. </p><h4>What role does technology and innovation play in your delivery of healthcare?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MSAA T</strong>echnology and education go hand in hand. Technology has allowed us to achieve our goals much more quickly. Many new techniques and practices in medicine rely on advanced technology and we are dedicated to staying at the forefront of the field. Our health information system is called Phoenix, and we built it locally with the help of Al Enayah. We continue to develop and modify this program to make it fit our needs. We are planning on developing a new program with the support of the university and Jeddah Valley Company, and this program will give us mobile capabilities. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Aviation Training]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[aviation-training]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Vision 2030 fit into your operations and services?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Fahad Sulaiman Al Harbi</strong> Training is increasingly needed to develop existing professionals or help newcomers to gain the needed skills. Of the jobs we offer, not only in aviation but in general, at least 50% of the jobs do not require a university degree. This is why technical and skills-based vocational training is key to the reforms in the education sector that Vision 2030 is implementing. In our field, the more airports we have, the higher the demand for skilled people in aviation, from ground handlers to services within the airport to the air traffic control tower. At SACA, we used to offer three-year diplomas, but we have shortened that to a one-year diploma because of the high demand. We will also offer a certification program with no diploma points; attendees can stay two or three months just to fill a gap. Some companies alone have around 10,000 jobs in ground handling in Saudi Arabia, so the demand for certification and training is huge, and we are adjusting to meet that need.</p><p><span></span><strong>MANSOUR ALSHARIF</strong> We have created a landside area, which in aviation terms is the airport area one can walk into without any checkpoints. In the landside areas of any airport there are restaurants, commercial spaces, and leisure activities. We are investing in a larger portion of landside operations at the airport to allow for all our activities to be done on the landside, not on the airside. This will include facilities for family picnics and small air shows over the weekends. This fits with the entertainment goals under Vision 2030 and supports other sectors of the economy, such as transportation. We believe aviation can contribute a lot to the entertainment sector including discovery and sightseeing flights. Aside from training, everything else we do in aviation is entertainment. Vision 2030 has also attracted investment. RWAA currently has two big investments underway; we are developing our new campus and replacing our fleet. </p><h4>What are your ambitions and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FSAH</strong> One of the plans that we have in 2017 is to make the academy a private company. That privatization will make us a more sales- and revenue-oriented organization. In the past, our main client was the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) in Saudi Arabia, but now we have more than 20 different clients Kingdom wide. Now we are serving every airline, airport, and company that deals with airports and their subcontractors. We will have an International Air Transport Association (IATA) training session in Jeddah, which will be the first time it is public. It is no longer free, which signifies a major step for us. Officially we are not a private company just yet, so we do not do sales, but in 3Q2017, we will privatize. For 2017, we wish to triple our customer base and expand our partnerships with universities and academies internationally. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has conferences that it does every year in different countries, last year it was in Seoul and this year it is in Kenya; we wish to host it here in Jeddah.</p><p><span></span><strong>MA </strong>We have three programs we want to introduce aside from the standard aviation training. We have the VIP private pilot license (PPL), which is a PPL program designed for professionals who want to have PPL training at home. By YE2017 we will also have a standard military conversion program. Under this program, we could convert a military pilot's license to a commercial pilot's license in 10 days with intensive training. We have already been successful with this program with several students in 2017 without even marketing the program yet. Finally, Skydive Saudi Arabia is going to start in January 2018. It is top in our priorities that this service will allow for female jumpers as well as males. This is going to be both for leisure and also for professional skydivers. It is a big program. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[saudia-airlines]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies are you pursuing to keep your leadership role in the industry? </h4><p><span></span><strong>GHASSAN AL SHIBLE</strong> We have to realize that the airline industry has a role that is much more than just transporting people from one place to another. Especially for a flag carrier, the role is to enhance the country's global presence and contribute to the economy. Not only in terms of economy and revenue, but in attracting people who will contribute to the economy of the country at large. Therefore, Saudia's role remains strategic rather than just business-oriented. However, major changes are coming. First, we are going to enhance the customer experience. We want to ensure clients have a pleasant experience so they will return. Saudia has also embarked on a major overhaul of its fleet, introducing new aircraft and retiring old ones, as well as upgrading the aircraft. We have a target of 200 aircraft by 2020, from a current fleet size of 138. Our fleet will be the youngest in the region, which translates into comfort and safety for our customers. The third aspect we are looking at is operational efficiency in terms of costs and productivity. That means establishing a new culture within Saudia Airlines to make sure it is driven by productivity and meritocracy rather than just seniority. We want to create an agile airline that can respond to the changing environment of today's aviation sector. </p><p><span></span><strong>SALEH AL-JASSER SAUDIA</strong> is the national carrier of Saudi Arabia and currently in its 72nd year of operations. As such, it holds a unique position. We launched a five-year strategy that will transform SAUDIA into a commercial, competitive entity relying on its own resources. We have already started to implement this, adapting elements of growth as well as improving productivity and efficiency, services, and overall customer experience. We are also adapting and redesigning products to cater for the needs and wants of the specific customer segments we have identified. To support this, we have launched a number of enabling initiatives. While we are the face of the country in each of our destinations and have strategic objectives to satisfy in this regard, we are fully committed to being a sustainable and thriving business entity; the initiatives we have launched in recent years cater to this precisely.</p><h4>What has been your blueprint for privatization? </h4><p><span></span><strong>GAS </strong>The issue of privatization is critical. For it to be successful, we have to create a triple-win equation for all our stakeholders. This is a win for the entity being privatized, a win for the new partners, and a win for the public at large. If we put all those together it will be a win for the whole economy in general. That is not an easy equation to create in a highly competitive business, as the airline industry and its associated units are directly relevant. Saudia is going down the road of privatization, and there are a few entities from Saudia that have been privatized in the process. The rest of the units are in the process of being privatized. That said, there are two important prerequisites to press the button on privatization. The first is to make sure the entity are operating totally on commercial principles and ready to be privatized. The last thing we want to do is to privatize an entity that is not operating efficiently and therefore fails to satisfy the market. The other thing is timing. Market conditions are beyond the control of Saudia Airlines. We have to pick the proper time when market conditions are favorable. </p><p><span></span><strong>SAJ P</strong>rivatization is a journey that starts with a vision and this vision starts with specific objectives that go back 20 years. Our approach so far has been focused on privatizing the group's subsidiaries, which has been successful. As we go, we learn from what has been achieved and build on our successes, adapting to new changes, and reacting to the lessons we learn along the way. We have already listed two companies, while others went with strategic partnerships. Privatization goes through a number of stages, starting with corporatization, governance, and then operational improvements. Ultimately, we reach an IPO if the company is in the right condition and the market conditions are favorable. Of those listed, one has already passed the stage of strategic partnership and is ready for listing. Another two have undergone corporatization, governance, and business improvement. The next step is to do the same for the Prince Sultan Aviation Academy (PSAA) and our real estate unit, Saudi Airlines Real Estate Development (SARED). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[private-ports]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expansion plans? </h4><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAH HAMEEDADIN </strong>When it comes to the container side, by the end of 2016 our infrastructural capacity was roughly 4 million TEUs, even though our volume is still 1.4. We are looking to the port to be the hub for the entire region so we need to expand to other businesses, which includes Ro-Ro and bulk shipments. We will open the first terminal this year where our Ro-Ro operations will have a capacity of up to 300,000 cars and bulk for up to 3 million tons. The advantage we have is that the whole masterplan was created from scratch; we had the ability to properly plan and implement things learned from around the world in the port. Needless to say, it is in a strategic location on the Red Sea connecting Southeast Asia and Europe. With the Suez Canal expanding to include a second lane, the opportunities are endless. With King Abdullah Port located between Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia has spent a large amount of money in the last few years to improve infrastructure in the region. Jeddah Airport is being expanded by building a new terminal, and the Medina-Mecca passenger railway system, which passes through King Abdullah City, will also be operational in 2018. We are working with the Ministry of Transportation to eventually link up with the land bridge freight railway that will connect eastern Saudi Arabia with the western region and completely change the shipping line movement. A vessel will be able to load its containers at KAP and be in the eastern province in less than 24 hours,  thereby avoiding the Strait of Hormuz, which has higher insurance premiums.</p><p><span></span><strong>MICHEAL WUBBENS</strong> We foresee an expansion of the port that will continue for the next couple of years. Today we have more than 3km of berths that are completed, and we plan to have about 15km in total by the end of the project. So, we have a few years yet ahead of us. The ultimate development period depends on finance, economy, demand, political issues, and more. However, we see a continuous increase in demand, because of the superiority of KAP's infrastructure, its superior efficiency, and its strategic positioning. The port is in the proximity of Yanbu, and considering that Vision 2030 includes the expansion of the petrochemical industry, it is an excellent place to be because these exports all go to KAP. Yanbu does not have adequate port facilities for the export of commercial cargo like containerized petrochemical products—it is an industrial port, not a commercial one. The commercial port of Yanbu was not designed as a container port and does not have international connectivity. So, it needs KAP.</p><h4>What are some of the major ongoing trends in the shipping business?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AH </strong>One key advantage that Saudi Arabia has is the crucial proximity of the Arabian Peninsula between Europe and Asia. With our strategic location on the Red Sea, we have emerged as a prime transshipment hub without losing our focus on import/export capabilities. That is how we attract global logistics leaders: by inviting them to come load their transshipments here where there is so much available land, not to mention an abundance of imports/exports apart from crude oil. Previously, these companies would offload their transshipment and leave with an empty load, but the development of Saudi Arabia's exports means this is no longer the case. We are next to the Yanbu industrial area and very close to Petro Rabigh, while also adjacent to the Industrial Valley at King Abdullah Economic City, which helps many of these shippers avoid that double call. That is one of the key advantages we have in being able to attract these large shipping lines to Saudi Arabia.</p><p><span></span><strong>MW</strong> In the global shipping industry, small shipping lines are going out of business, and there is a great deal of consolidation going on. The remaining lines have forged four "alliances,“ which are capacity-sharing agreements, similar to what airlines are doing. There are just four alliances remaining now, namely 2M, Ocean 3, G7, and CKYHE. The alliances are part of an effort to optimize the use of existing capacities.  The use of large ships triggers economies of scale. Big ports like ours that can accommodate this trend will be more important. In short, cargo is being driven onto larger and larger ships, and only ports like ours that can accommodate such vessels will remain competitive internationally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you positioned in terms of the market, and what is your growth strategy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FOUAD HALAW</strong>I  The potential for growth is always present. We generally assess market share by looking at several different sources and indexes. Growth is forecasted in the market, and new regulations have had both positive and negative effects on our business and the market in general; however, we have chosen to view the changes as opportunities and are positioning ourselves accordingly. A change in management and a new vision for the structure of the business, including being the first MVNO on the market and bringing new speed and agility to our operations, has had a large impact. Between December 2015 and June 2016, Virgin Mobile KSA added an additional 1.5 million customers, taking its user base to 2.5 million and pushing the established operators hard. It has been a staggering success and has changed the way operators, the industry, regulators, and investors look at the potential of the KSA telecom market. We invest a great deal of time into developing growth strategies and are witnessing the impact of that. We are committed to operating within the market with a great deal of agility; all of our internal processes allow us to react to changes rapidly and effectively, such are the advantages of an MVNO. This has been one of the major reasons why we were so successful in 2016. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>AHMED ABOU DOMA</strong> In May 2017, we were brought on to equip the first smart city in Saudi Arabia, in Yanbu. This is part of our contribution to Vision 2030 and is the first of five smart cities that the government wants to build over the next five years. We have started another smart city in King Abdullah Economic City. That is an example of the foundation we have built for the next phase of development in this country. Initiatives like data center developments and rollouts, smart city developments, and smart Hajj solutions are our focus. We have been part of a consortium that won a bid to deliver ICT services to the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance (CCHI). We are going to deliver the platform that will link medical service providers, pharmacies, insurance companies, and patients; they are all going to be connected digitally, which will provide convenience of use and avoid any fraud.</p><h4>What trends do you see in regards to regulation of market dynamics and requirements?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FH I</strong>t is in the best interest of firms to disrupt the market in a positive way, to try and get the best prices for customers. By focusing on niche markets that the larger, more established telecoms firms have neglected to service appropriately, we have the ability to expand our market share, and thus position ourselves as a very unique service provider with best-of-breed technology. However, regulations in Saudi Arabia are still evolving so we can see some regulatory improvement to allow MVNOs to have more flexibility and balanced competitive-edge operations. They are more agile, more nimble, and more willing to take risks. MVNOs are also accelerating the digital transformation in Saudi Arabia; we at Virgin Mobile Saudi are looking into digitizing our sales channels, member care, and billing as we see those as three main areas that will help in transforming the industry digitally in the short term. </p><p><span></span><strong>AA </strong>Everywhere in the world data services are rising, while voice services are declining. We have to cater to that and take into consideration that this is one of the most data-savvy markets in the world. Customer satisfaction here is typically shaped by the data usage experience, not by the voice experience. Financial services are going to come to this market, but this is the largest economy in the region, and if mobile financial services are allowed to come in, there is going to be a huge opportunity for all players. SMEs are another growing line of business, and  SMEs in the market in this country are underserved. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main activities in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Amjad Abdel Hafez</strong> NourNet is part of the Astra Group, the 23rd-largest privately owned business conglomerate in Saudi Arabia. We started as an ISP in 1998. At that time, over 40 licenses were issued and we were one of the very few who opted for a corporate market segment. We realized Saudi Arabia lacks services and after sales support, not infrastructure. It was with this in mind that we carved out a niche for ourselves by offering top-notch pre- and post-sales support and continuous service innovation. Having started with basic connectivity services, we have grown to become one of Saudi Arabia's leading converged services provider. It was not an easy feat to achieve because the convergence between information and communications technology is a bridge most telecom players in the region struggle to cross.</p><p><span></span><strong>Ali Abdullah Alayed </strong>TAQNIA is one of the few organizations that did not have to change when Saudi Vision 2030 and NTP 2020 came out because its strategy was already fully aligned. 2017 is an important year for TAQNIA as it will begin executing several of its industrial projects that will make a big impact on Saudi Arabia, such as Aero Connectivity Services that allow airplane passengers to connect to a high-speed Wi-Fi connection at an altitude of 11km. Another project is the implementation of the Saudi Internet Exchange Point, which will reduce cost and latency, and heightened security of the internet usage in Saudi Arabia. Towards the end of the year, TAQNIA will be launching an academy to develop local capabilities in focus sectors relevant to the Kingdom. In terms of venture capital, the Riyad TAQNIA Fund (RTF) continues to close a number of investments in local start-ups. RTF is amongst the largest VC funds in the region, with a fund size of USD120 million.</p><h4>How do you ensure data security in your cloud services and data centers?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAH</strong> Security is an extremely serious issue. When we studied security solutions, we saw different ways to enhance the service to satisfy customers. We have a strong partnership with vendors in Saudi Arabia and customized solutions for them on the security front. However, the weakest link in this chain is still the end user. Therefore, there is a great deal to do in terms of education. While we work on educating our customers on strengthening the weakest link, our security services focus around protecting the users as much as protecting the enterprise IT infrastructure.</p><h4>What are the details of your partnership with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST)?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAA </strong>The arrangement is a result of research conducted within KACST in the satellite industry. The research resulted in forming the partnership between TAQNIA Space and Digital Globe to manufacture six satellites. Three of them will be focused on the Middle East, while the remaining three will be marketed internationally. Marketing will be performed by both TAQNIA Space and Digital Globe. Eventually the manufacturing of the satellites will be fully or partly localized in Saudi Arabia as KACST operates world-class research institutes that are progressing well in the field. The technology will be further developed and localized in the future.</p><h4>How does the current localization drive across the country represent an opportunity?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAH </strong>We fully understand the importance of localization because it is about identities that a country does not need to lose. One of the key reasons behind NourNet's success is our strong local presence through local infrastructure and local services. There are in fact more interesting ideas that are being discussed. Saudi Arabia is well positioned in the region. Almost anything that is successful in Saudi Arabia can be easily extended to most countries in the region. Thus localizing in Saudi will eventually spread services across the whole region. We have to innovate as a country to be ahead of others. We have to be sharper and more agile to find out what works and what does not and continue our growth.</p><p><span></span><strong>AAA I</strong>n terms of completely manufacturing aircraft locally in Saudi Arabia, initially we will bring the parts and assemble them here. Complete manufacturing is not easy due to the requirements for building engines. The engines will eventually be imported but the body of the plane and most of the things that we are able to manufacture here will be done. As we progress, TAQNIA will strive to develop the local supply chain so we can gradually reach complete manufacturing localization. The plant is being built and we plan to produce the first plane between 2020 and 2021. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about your current strategy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Musaab al Mubarak </strong>We are focused on building the country as an e-trading hub not only for locals but also for international markets, international exporters, and importers. We have five major business lines within this frame; there are exports and imports, which is our major e-service currently and that we have implemented across 32 ports. This year we developed a new e-service and seek to automate as much as possible the entire process for exports and imports. This has been active since 2005 and we ended 2016 with over 19 million complete transactions. The other line is to automate the port committee system from first arriving at the Saudi border up until the cargo of the containers moves out from vessels. We are working with the Saudi Port Authority to automate this and our plans should be finalized in 2017. This is the major business line related to imports and exports and the plan is for this to be finalized as a Single Platform for SAUDI eTrade in 2017. We want to automate payments to become a single e-process allowing traders to receive all invoices electronically from all stakeholders, no matter private or government, and making payments electronically. We are working on this initiative and expect to launch this service in 4Q2017.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Abdulaziz Abdulrahman Alshoulby</strong> The Saudi eGovernment Program (Yesser) plays an important role in the execution of the National Transformation Program (NTP) objectives and Vision 2030 to develop the e-government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by enabling the transformation of government entities, in addition to constantly improving and maintaining the National Portal (<a href="http://www.saudi.gov.sa">www.saudi.gov.sa</a>). As for the reforms, Yesser is responsible for three strategic objectives from among NTP's objectives: improve the user experience, transparency, and quality of government services; improve the efficiency of government internal operations and employees; and maximize the ROI of government ICT investment by leveraging shared platforms and resources.</p><p>These three strategic objectives are measured through the following key performance indicators (KPIs) for each objective, including KSA's ranking on the eGov Index (UN), the Open Data Barometer, and user satisfaction Index; e-transformation index (Qiyas), e-government services maturity level (MARASD), the number of major government agencies adopting GRP standard processes for HR, finance, and procurement; and annual reduction in government expenditure on core ICT infrastructure.</p><h4>How do you regard yourselves in the market, and how do you make a profit?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAM</strong> We are owned by the government but are completely private; we do not receive any budget from the government. For e-procurement we collaborate with the Ministry of Finance to automate the procurement for the government and have developed two main stages. The first is to automate fast services regarding electronic tenders from the government side and the tender for direct purchasing. This was launched in 2014 and has been implemented in over 200 government organizations around Saudi Arabia, not only in Riyadh. Today we are in the Jizan province area to train municipalities on how to use the system as this will open the market and be a major wheel in government procurement for our economy. This will help to create a marketplace for trading and we can subsequently open it internationally. It will also allow SMEs to participate in government tenders. The target for this system is to completely automate the procurement cycle and we work with the leaders to achieve this goal. We have in fact built this system and target implementing it this year with the Ministry of Finance. We aim to create a marketplace for suppliers; already more than 20,000 suppliers have registered on our portal since 2014 as well as over 200 government organizations that have submitted their tenders through our system.</p><h4>To what extent has the NTP and Vision 2030 impacted your work? Are expectations higher?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAA </strong>Expectations are definitely higher. Due to the clarity of NTP and Vision 2030, the goals are clear and well defined and that has contributed immensely to the alignment process of government agencies with each other. This alignment has already started to have positive impact on government agencies' work and performance, including Yesser. The three strategic objectives for which Yesser is responsible cascades down to five initiatives: increase standardization, collaboration, and security across government entities through e-government governance, leadership, and oversight; develop an innovative whole-of-government concept, platforms, and enabling services to deliver seamless omni-channel experiences for users; enable an open government through e-participation and open data; enable paperless and efficient common government processes; and build and roll out shared ICT government platforms and expertise. Additionally, Yesser measures regularly the rate of e-transformation of government entities and the goal is to increase the current rate of 57% to 80% by 2020. As for the e-government services maturity level, the target is to be 85% by 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the growth of the Saudi market mean for your firm?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAJID OWAID AL OTAAIBI </strong>There are at least 350,000 new drivers entering the market every year. Demand is rapidly growing; hence, we will look more into used cars and help extend the life of cars. More drivers mean people will start to target the affordable segment, and smaller cars will be the next automotive trend. In our opinion the market will double in 10 years and reach 15 million cars. What Saudi Arabia needs is linkages between the government and the spare parts sector. Giving certificates that ascertain the quality of mechanics in every workshop center will help us excel and know what parts need to be changed. This is important so that cars are better maintained, remain in the country, and are safer for drivers. The future of the auto industry will be strong. The youth in Saudi Arabia is important for the market to grow and develop as well. We seek to enter a franchising style and to complete the circle by adding Toyota to our portfolio, which is the last brand we do not have. We use this to reorganize the company to focus more on the IT sector and reduce our employees to the minimum required. </p><p><span></span><strong>MOHAMMED SAUD AL ZAMIL</strong> We consider the plastic industry a converging one, which is still at a nascent stage in Saudi Arabia, although we have made great leaps and bounds. We are still at the beginning when it comes to converting plastics into engineering products. Our factory produces basic products, such as bumpers, coolant fans, mud flaps, and many other products at the prototype stage that we have not run in commercial lines. In 2007, the ecosystem was not ready to produce OEM parts or develop such a product; however, today the ecosystem has developed. We need someone to support us in our prototype as well as in R&amp;D by selecting the right materials for automotive applications. We need a factory that will procure the materials for us. SABIC has developed a center to which we will dedicate certain funds to develop our products through it. Currently, we focus more on fast-moving products for Asian brands, which in Saudi Arabia are mainly Korean and Japanese brands. We produce products for Toyota, Hyundai, and Nissan and have one product for Chevrolet.</p><h4>What role do foreign markets play in your business strategy? </h4><p><span></span><strong>MOAO </strong>We are now a member of the Nexus Group, a purchasing group in Europe that is working with assets worth EUR9 billion. It comprises many customers, buyers, manufacturers, and sellers. The idea is that we can make arrangements between buyers that will allow us to exchange stock and data. Every company that has joined Nexus is well established; therefore, it has helped us understand what we need to sell and where. For example, in Africa we need to look at selling car items not being sold there. Getting this from Saudi Arabia is difficult because we need licenses and invoice reports, and too many regulations can often damage the business. Looking to the future, we will continue to target these regions, as this is where the automotive sector will continue to boom. Part of the company supplies insurance companies with spare parts, and in return we get all their obsolete cars. From there, we sell them to scrap yards where they are cut for spare parts. </p><h4>What opportunities do you see for your sector with Vision 2030? </h4><p><span></span><strong>MSAZ</strong> Aside from R&amp;D, the biggest problem that every factory in Saudi Arabia has is identifying order-winning criteria, and not setting the price or quality without understanding the customer. By doing this, we will increase the competitiveness of our factories. If the order-winning criteria is the price, companies will not care about the quality in order to compete with low-quality Chinese markets. If the order-winning criteria is quality, companies will focus more on R&amp;D and collaborate with SABIC, and so on and so forth. The great thing about Vision 2030 is that everyone talks about the private sector and wants it to take the lead, which we believe can happen. There is also a focus on enforcing the laws, which is extremely helpful for local businesses as well as in terms of attracting foreign investors. This is a major initiative that will greatly assist us and provide certain competitiveness over other countries around the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><strong></strong>How would you describe the current era of industrial development in Saudi Arabia? </h4><p><span></span><strong>ABDULLAZIZ AL ZAMIL</strong> When SABIC was founded in 1976, we were given capital of SAR10 billion and did chemical projects through JVs with various international companies. When the bylaws of SABIC were established it was clearly stated that it would be a wholly owned government company; however, after a number of years turning a profit, shares were sold to the public. We got the project going, and started production and export, and once SABIC declared its first two years of profit, the government decided to sell 30% of the shares to the public. This was a popular offering and was widely received; it was in fact oversubscribed by several times. Shares were sold for SAR10, and the current market value is over SAR100, making it a successful example of privatization. It represented a required income and this was understandable, especially when oil prices came down. Now it is ready and everything is set up; the bylaw is there and the company is profitable. There was an increase in local utility costs, which put pressure on companies like SABIC, forcing them to find ways to reduce their costs. </p><p><span></span><strong>ABDULKARIM ALNAFIE</strong> Automation is an opportunity for our country as it raises the level of jobs that we can induce more Saudis to take. Salaries will increase, as will the workplace environment. Most of our plants are more or less automated; some have the highest levels of automation because it is not possible to find Saudis capable of doing the jobs or to provide salaries that will make employees happy. We discourage hiring more foreign labor for these jobs and encourage automation; we always want our plants and factories to adopt and employ the latest technologies. There is always a tradeoff between investment on returns and costs, so this has to be viewed in a more pragmatic way.</p><h4>What kind of investments are you currently interested in? </h4><p><span></span><strong>AAZ </strong>We are active in downstream activity, with at least 12 ventures in chemicals and plastics. We have some JVs with American companies, such as Huntsman, and with Austrian and Turkish companies for packaging. Many of these JVs are expanding organically from within. We are also adding new products and looking at new ventures and opportunities. Packaging could grow massively, as FMCG multinationals have their regional headquarters here. Because of product price reductions we have to find a way to reduce our costs. This combined with an increase in feedstock costs means there is more urgency to reduce costs. A major effort was made by Sipchem, Sahara, and others to try to reduce their costs to be more efficient, and it has been successful. In terms of expansion, this depends on the viability; one area to reduce costs is in capacity, since this kind of investment is heavy and has high fixed costs.</p><p><span></span><strong>AA</strong> The focus is not for us but for the entities that will develop these industries. The Ministry of Defense will determine its priorities and what can be localized or not. We are there to support, when requested, any of these industries. That is not to say we do not have certain capabilities today; we have industries in defense, though there is much room to grow. Aviation is one of them and some companies like Taqnia have announced different projects that they are looking into in aviation. It recently launched an airplane in cooperation with Ukraine and is looking at other ventures to support that project or others that are similar in nature. In 2016, renewable energy was a focus topic on our annual report in SIDF as it is an important industry that is imminent and we will need to support it. By the end of 2017, we should see execution of some of the mega projects that the ministry has talked about. We have financed certain projects in the sector but more will be on the way, at least for solar power. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do recent reforms influence your business and overall strategy?</h4><p><span></span>Soren Nikolajsen Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Plan bring exciting and significant changes to the Saudi economy. The push away from high dependency on the oil-related sectors will for banks result in an adjustment to our business activity and open up new opportunities in the private and non-oil sectors. The land tax, introduction of VAT, and capital market reforms are other initiatives that will affect the Saudi economy in different ways. On the capital markets side, we welcome the push from the regulators to encourage a more active corporate bond market. On equities, the potential inclusion of the Saudi stock market to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index would be very positive and help improve liquidity in the market.</p><h4>How have your retail banking operations been performing?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Abdulaziz Al-Onaizan</strong> Over the years, our strategy was to expand our branch network. Today, we have the fifth-largest branch network. We have more than 150 branches and more than 175 remittance centers across the Kingdom. We want to optimize the existing branch network in terms of service, customer care and experience, as well as to digitize our operations. This year, we opened five self-service centers that can operate with extended hours to basically cater for self-service needs, like applying for consumer loans or card products.</p><h4>To what extent do market developments affect your future strategy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SN</strong> Technology and digital services will play a particular important role for the industry in order to meet the needs and demands of our customers. Banking in general, and retail banking in particular, is changing rapidly. 97% of basic transactions like withdrawing money, paying bills, and making transfers are today done via electronic platforms such as online, mobile, or ATMs. That is a significant shift from the past, and demands a lot from us as a financial services provider in terms of what products we offer and how we deliver them. And growth is strong. Last year the usage of our market-leading mobile application grew by 65% and mobile payments by 171%.</p><h4>Do you expect a boom in the Islamic finance industry in Saudi Arabia now, as interest is heightening?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAO </strong>On the consumer side, it has grown substantially, and we have seen conversion of conventional banking to sharia-compliant banking. Society is conservative by nature, and if we offer both sharia-compliant and non sharia-compliant financial products, people will choose the former. Islamic banking is becoming popular in the international markets as well. After a financial crisis, people will always look for new ways of financing to basically share the risk. Conventional financing is all about transferring the risk. On the other hand, sharia financing is about risk sharing; therefore, we are close to the client throughout the lifecycle of the transaction.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for the next 12 months?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SN </strong>We will stay focused on our core business areas and serve our customers well. The overall business mix is roughly where we want it to be, so there are no big strategic deviations. A key focus area remains to be the development of our digital services as we continue to be a leading innovator of financial services products in the Kingdom.</p><p><span></span><strong>AAO</strong> For Saudi Arabia, the worst is behind us. We have had difficult times over the last two years with the drop in oil prices. The government has taken concerted actions to reduce spending and find alternative ways to finance the deficit. Given these efforts by the government to manage the fiscal position of the country, lowering the deficit will be better than expected. We are optimistic about Bank Albilad's future and confident all these initiatives we are taking to enhance the business will be successful. We are trying to manage the efficiency in the organization that will put us in a better and stronger position. We are focusing on digitizing our services in retail banking and cross-selling as well as SME business supported by the government, which we believe will be the main drivers of growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company get involved in environmental issues in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Fadil Fuad Basyyoni </strong>Some 15 years ago there was very little awareness about environmental issues from business in the MENA region. The total picture in terms of wider environmental issues, such as air pollution, green energy, and glass recycling had a low level of awareness here. DFBG spoke with the authorities about taking aggressive action to do this, and a waste management and classification regulation was subsequently passed in Saudi Arabia. As understanding grew, more advanced recycling solutions came into play. This is the point where DFBG came in. I am proud to say we were one of the first companies to start working in this sector. We brought in solutions, created contracts, particularly with government authorities, and worked to find new solutions to environmental problems so the government knew what to do.</p><p><span></span><strong>Mohammad Al-Elyani </strong>BeeA'h was established at the direction of the Royal Commission, the governing environmental regulator in Al Jubail Industrial City. The Royal Commission recognized that progressive industrialization would potentially create environmental issues and, along with certain leading industries, decided to involve the private sector to meet the environmental management needs of the city, which resulted in the establishment of BeeA'h. Business commenced in 1989, with a small landfill site of 75,000sqm, which then expanded a year later into the physical and chemical treatment of hazardous and industrial waste. For some time, the hazardous organic waste that was generated in the Industrial City was not managed and had to be stored until BeeA'h commissioned its hazardous waste incineration center in 1997, the first of its kind in the Gulf region and making BeeA'h the market leader with fully integrated waste management facilities.</p><h4>What projects will you focus on?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FFB </strong>We are establishing a company to implement new ideas with a private not-for-profit organization in Saudi Arabia. We are doing a project together at the moment to establish recycling programs in every city. Part of the recycling scheme will be not-for-profit, and some will be to create profits for the partners. This project will focus on electronic, plastic, and cardboard recycling with a different approach. We will approach homes and owners of waste to offer them solutions, including collecting waste, and recycling. We also seek to revive our waste to energy project, because with the change in governmental approach and Vision 2030, this project will now be feasible.</p><h4>How important is the waste management sector to the Saudi market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAE</strong> Saudi Arabia is one of the world's major oil and petrochemical producers, with Al Jubail in particular being one of the largest industrial petrochemical sites in the world. The country recognizes that industrialization brings with it the risk of environmental damage which, if not managed properly, will adversely impact and endanger the quality of life for future generations. Greater emphasis is now being focused on opportunities for recovering processed materials, recycling, and reusing the waste that has been generated and only using waste disposal as a last resort.</p><h4>How has Vision 2030 created a new era for renewables and green solutions?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FFB</strong> Vision 2030 itself is a great tool; however, it does not contain much of an explanation about environmental proposals. We wanted such details to be in the vision. Now the government is adopting a new approach to push the environmental agenda more. We want to see practical projects and investment happening in real life for green energy, recycling, and revenue from waste, and not just studies being done. Waste can provide a great return as a new income source. We can either turn it into green energy or sell recycled materials to factories at a competitive price. Vision 2030 is an excellent tool; however, we need great KPIs to manage the vision and give it life in a practical sense.</p><p><span></span><strong>MAE </strong>We are highly encouraged and motivated by Vision 2030 and are committed to doing our best to be a part of the success harvested from this vision. We are working to maximize the use and productivity of existing resources in order the meet the demands of industry for safe and compliant waste management at economic rates. BeeA'h is fully aware of industry needs and the current and new technologies that can be employed to satisfy regulatory requirements. Throughout almost 30 years of operation we have met increasingly more demanding regulatory compliance standards and modified our operations and invested in new facilities to ensure compliance. We continue to look at emerging recycling and recovery opportunities and to evaluate alternative treatment methods for specific waste streams that can offer greater economies to waste generators. There is no one solution or technique for all waste being generated. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of your biggest achievements over past years?</h4><p><strong>Essam Zahra </strong>The National Water Works Company is a private company working in water activities, specifically water pumping. Water requires a full solution and there are many processes to move the water from the source to the final users. Saudi Arabia is about 2.2 million sqkm, and there are around 25 cities and not one river. National Water Works Company is an international leader in water equipment for pumping and we bring that technology to Saudi Arabia and apply this technology. Our major achievements involve upgrades to technology; we can now tap water reserves from wells deeper than ever before, often exceeding 2,000m. We completed the range so we are the only company in Saudi Arabia that can provide any type of wells or pumps to serve local projects. Thanks to our reputation we were awarded the Riyadh Water Enhancement Program (RWEP), launched in 2011 by the ex-Governor of Riyadh to avoid water cuts in summer. National Water Works Company handled this project to realize the strategy. In short, the requirement was to drill 43 wells in Riyadh and to install 25 water treatment plants. But even though a project of this size needs two to three years to complete, the authorities asked for it to be done within six months, which required a miracle. This was really a unique project and many pumping providers in the world could not do it; the only company that met the needs and took on the challenge was National Water Works Company. In six months, we supplied 43 units and installed those pumps in the wells and we ran it. </p><p><span></span><strong>Mahmoud Fallatah</strong> Nesma Water &amp; Energy is focusing on water infrastructure. We did a couple of projects in greenfield infrastructure including two big projects for the development of about 7 million sqm of residential and industrial areas in King Abdullah Economic City. This covers the complete utilities infrastructure such as water piping, storm piping, and sewer piping, as well as electrical cables and roads. In addition to that, we constructed 13 desalination plants for the national water company with a total capacity of 65,000 cbm per day. Water meters with house connections and operations and maintenance services are also part of our targeted scope. We operate the smart cities and the small villages that belong to them for Dwadmi and Affif in the Riyadh region. Now, we are building four desalination plants with The Saudi Industrial Property Authority (Modon). These are industrial areas where we are supposed to provide the means of water distribution, ground wells production, desalination, reservoirs, tanks, and tanker filling stations.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the fact that the Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture says water is one of the most attractive future investments in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EZ </strong>Vision 2030 has forced all the active authorities in the Kingdom to plan and design their initiatives to meet the requirement of the reforms. This is not an option; it is a must and a duty—it is why all services and utilities in the Kingdom will be handled by the private sector. So from now until 15 years down the road everything should be settled in that line and water and energy is number one. That is why the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture hosted the Water Investment Forum recently in Riyadh, as this was the picking-ground for all the interested investors in the water industry to extract and explore what opportunities would be suitable for them. More than USD50 billion has been announced for PPPs or BOTs. </p><h4>How could privatization affect your business?</h4><p><span></span><strong>M</strong>F This is good news for us. In my personal opinion the water sector is undergoing a big transformation program and most of the projects could be privatized. The BOT, BOO, IPP, and IWPP will dominate in the sector. There will be water treatment and sewage treatment plants that will be tendered this year. Now, The national water company is managing Jeddah, Riyadh, Mecca, and Taif, and soon another 19 cities in the country will follow them. That is good news because the entire system for the water in these small cities that used to be under the government and Ministry of Water will be nested under the national water company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the potential of the Saudi market? </h4><p><strong>JAVIER DIAZ GOMEZ</strong> Market size is extremely important. The Saudi Arabian market has a larger population than any country in the region, and truly is the most important market in the region. Additionally, the geographical size of the country requires a much larger investment of time and capital; companies willing to make these investments will be able to capitalize on the country's rich wealth of opportunity. We were the first Spanish private company to be awarded a non-revenue water contract. This means we try to optimize the network to avoid leaks. We were awarded this contract because we are one of the top-10 firms in the world in the field of water management. Our core business is managing sewage and water networks for cities, and we have extensive experience and world-class expertise. In Spain, for example, we manage the sewage and water systems of more than 1,000 cities. In countries where there are major water scarcities, it is important to reduce water consumption and properly manage water resources. Really, our extensive experience and long history of success was why we were awarded contracts in Saudi Arabia.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>RAMI MOUSILLI </strong>The country's population growth, industrial expansion, and sprawling development mean there is an ever-increasing demand to increase efficiency and upgrade the capacity of Saudi Arabia's current water and power infrastructure. The national transformation program (NTP) 2020 was mandated to fulfill the requirement of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 to make the Kingdom a global investment powerhouse and epicenter of trade connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa. This called for a substantial increase in non-oil revenues and exports by diversifying the economy, increasing efficiencies, and meeting the demands for expansion. In line with these targets, the relevant governmental and semi-governmental bodies underwent complete restructuring to meet them across all aspects of operations. In the power sector, the mandate to diversify the energy mix has driven governmental bodies to initiate grid-integrated renewable energy projects on a wide scale, which will help alleviate air pollution, reduce fossil fuel consumption, and contribute to peak load demand. Vis-í -vis, on the water sector side, the targets to reduce water loss, increase efficiencies, raise the tariff to cover actual costs, increase service coverage, and meet future demands has opened up the field for vast and wide ranging privatization initiative. The restructuring of water and power sector and privatization initiative undertaken by the Kingdom to address the solution to these issues and to meet Vision 2030 target goals are materializing through several major BOT, ROT, and BOO in the brownfield and greenfield projects. Moreover, Saudi Arabia enjoys a high credit rating, stability, and the required regulatory platform to facilitate implementation of PPPs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JDG</strong> For us, 2017 will be a transitional year. Many governmental agents are announcing their intentions to begin new projects this year, but we know that these types of initiatives take time to develop and implement. These are huge changes that need massive adjustments on the legal and financial side. This will be a major issue both this and next year and will take time to address. We will see major changes by the middle of 2018, but not before. Aqualia has a number of projects with all of the water works institutions, so 2017 is fully loaded in terms of projects. While 2016 was a poor year for tenders, right now we are in a good position. We hope that in the coming weeks we will have even more projects confirmed, especially in water management.</p><p><span></span><strong>RM </strong>Our strategic goal for the year ahead and the future in general is to maintain our lead by continuing to expand our market share and formulate strategic partnerships with governmental and international stakeholders. We are anticipating several BOT, ROT, BOO, and concessions to be released this and the next year, which will be our main focus to transform Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies into a major regional developer. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Western Region has maintained strong economic performance in recent years despite economic headwinds. Why do you think this is?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Hassan Dahlan </strong>I do not see or feel any differences in the economies of the Saudi regions; indeed, they have all maintained strong economic performance despite the negative effect of declining oil prizes in the world market, comparing to years ago when the monthly oil prices in the world market were going up. Government spending has amounted to 39% of GDP over the past three years, and budget deficits have averaged 4.6%. In general, Saudi Arabia's regulatory efficiency and open-market policies have lagged behind those of other emerging economies. To a backdrop of low oil prices over the past two years, in April 2016 the country unveiled a notable policy shift in the form of a significant economic reform plan, Saudi Vision 2030. The plan is looking to increase foreign investment in all Saudi regions and enhance the overall competitiveness of the Saudi economy.</p><h4>In what ways has the Asharqia Chamber helped attract trade and investment to the Eastern Province? </h4><p><span></span><strong>AbdulRahman A. Al-Wabel</strong> The Eastern Province Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Asharqia Chamber) has been playing a key role in attracting trade and investment to the Eastern Province. Actually, our Chamber's main activities are concentrated on touting the region's enormous trade and investment opportunities to the local and foreign investors. For instance, over the past year, the Chamber hosted 11 foreign trade delegations and organized a number of catalogue exhibitions of different countries aimed at establishing trade and business contacts between the Saudi companies and their overseas counterparts. In addition, the Chamber has also been engaged in various social and voluntary activities.</p><h4>How has the Jeddah Chamber worked to improve foreign and domestic investment in Jeddah this year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HD</strong> Saudi Arabia's economic challenges may offer significant opportunities for foreign investors, as improving the country's investment climate remains an integral part of the government's new efforts to liberalize the country's trade and investment regime and diversify an economy overly dependent on oil exports. The government took many positive steps to encourage foreign investment, including opening the Saudi stock market to qualified foreign investors; developing plans to privatize the country's civil aviation, technology, and healthcare sectors; removing the barrier to full foreign ownership of retail and wholesale businesses within the country; and publishing a new companies law that lowers some barriers to starting a new business. It continues to encourage investment across nearly all economic sectors, prioritizing investments in industry, manufacturing, transportation, education, health, communications technology, life sciences, and energy; as well as in four economic cities that are at various stages of development.</p><h4>What role do you see this region playing under Vision 2030?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AAAW</strong> As the hub of the Kingdom's industrial activities, I believe the Eastern Province has taken the lead in supporting the most ambitious Vision 2030, which is mainly aimed at reducing the Saudi reliance on oil. In this economic transformation, the Eastern Province is the key player contributing significantly to the Kingdom's drive to diversify its income away from oil. With the robust growth of industries, the Eastern Province is now called "The Industrial Capital of the Gulf." Most of the Kingdom's manufacturing industries such as petrochemicals, chemicals, steel, cement, aluminum, and plastics are located in the region. These industries are largely based in the Dammam-I and II industrial estates and Jubail-I and II industrial cities. The Eastern Province is set to witness an industrial boom with a number of mega projects coming up. As you aware, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdulaziz recently inaugurated a host of basic infrastructure and development projects in Jubail and Ras Al-Khair industrial cities including the Sadara Chemical Company (Sadara) and the Saudi Aramco Total Refining and Petrochemical Co. (SATORP) in Jubail. The two projects are among the largest facilities in the refining and petrochemical industries that support the objectives of the Saudi Vision 2030. These two world-class projects are the successful partnerships between Saudi Aramco and two global companies — the Dow Chemical Company and Total—which are leaders in their respective areas of business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you develop the concept for your services?</h4><p><span></span>J<strong>UANA RAMÍREZ SOHIN</strong> was created as a project that seeks to transform the way we assist patients that have chronic degenerative diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, chronic renal failure, and others. We optimize resources and grant a better life quality to patients, providing the health system with a solution. Patients with a chronic degenerative disease have different needs. We cannot attend to these needs through standard medicine; we need to understand them through personalized and individualized medicine. First, we offer personalized medicine through the concierge model in which an assistant is assigned to each patient, and he/she becomes the specialized assistant for the patient to resolve all the needs throughout the disease, ranging from the administrative aspect to medical appointments, delivery of medicine, psychological assistance, and nutritional and emotional support. We also have an added-value team with psychologists, nutritionists, and thanatologists that are working with the patients and their families. Second, we also have a genetic diagnostic unit that we offer to doctors. It is the largest portfolio of genetic tests in Mexico. With full genetic information, doctors can make better decisions about treatment and design individualized treatments.</p><p><span></span><strong>ANDRÉS JURADO</strong> We learned that there was an emerging trend to commercialize medical services in Cancún to American and Canadian patients; hence, I approached a surgical center, which allowed me to learn about its operations and activity in depth. There are medical services that are provided by doctors, clinics, and hospitals; however, the customer service elements for medical tourists not within the normal range of hospital activities were lacking, namely personalized attention, follow up, and logistics. This is why we sought out this opportunity to launch this project of our own. It was launched in 2013, and from then on we have focused our services specifically on addressing these elements that were lacking.</p><h4>How do you bring together different stakeholders within, and beyond, the health sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JR</strong> Regarding our genetics testing offerings, we work with 95% of insurers in the country. With the concierge service we are working with the biggest ones. Approximately 70% of patients with chronic degenerative diseases such as cancer have access to the concierge service, but our target is the public sector. We want to democratize access to health. Additionally, because SOHIN has grown between 35 and 70% annually, this makes us an attractive company to investors. I was the only partner until 2016, when I did the first investment round, and we are concluding the first round this year. I hope in a couple of years to do the second round of investments. The health sector is attractive for investment funds, and since we are one of the few successful entrepreneur cases in the health sector, funds have come to us directly. My job is to choose partners that align with the vision of the company, that have a component of social impact.</p><p><span></span><strong>AJ </strong>Our biggest challenge was bringing together hospital and tourism operators. Hospital language and hospitality language are two different things, so there was a need to create an education process for hospitals and hotels to understand this new type of client. This is a completely new approach and not a lot of hotels have been able to overcome this challenge, so the ones that have are the ones that we gladly work with. At the same time, hospitals have a major opportunity to develop and commercialize their services; they are not used to it because they do not have the experience or the need. Therefore, those were the biggest challenges, to put together these two industries to create packages that would fulfill all of the needs of the patients that travel to our destination for a medical procedure.</p><h4>Where do you see growth coming from and what are your upcoming priorities?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JR </strong>We want to have 100,000 patients by 2020. Attending, understanding, and transforming the attention model for these patients is vital. We want to continue our advance in Latin America—we also have a presence in Colombia and Argentina—and in 10 years, we want to be on the stock market. We want SOHIN to be able to change patient care for these diseases.</p><p><span></span><strong>A</strong>J The biggest growth has been in establishing new medical services. We started out with only plastic surgery and dental services and now we have five programs. In terms of offerings, we have grown and have established these programs successfully. Also, in terms of volume of patients, we have been having good results in the past two or three years, and we aim to continue that way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you expanding business lines?</h4><p><span></span>MIGUEL QUINTANA Tourists want live experiences; they want to interact with culture, people, and nature and be part of the destination. Hotels are thus starting to create small amusement parks and offer tours to make their offerings more attractive. Hotels are now starting to change and create these activities for the same price they sell their rooms for. This is where Experiencias Xcaret realized we already have all the amusement hotels seek to include in their offering and that we can build the ideal hotel ourselves. Therefore, on December 1, 2017, we will open the doors of our 900-room hotel and be the first "fun-inclusive“ hotel. In addition to Xcaret Park and the new integrated hotel, we offer tours to other parts of Quintana Roo State and the Yucatán Peninsula. We have excursions to all archaeological sites, such as Tulum, Cobá, and Chichén Itzá. We offer a professional service that includes our parks and archaeological sites, and in the future we will also be able to take guests fishing or golfing. We intend to continue adding new services step by step. We want to ensure we provide professional, fun, clean, and safe activities for the families that come to the Cancún area.</p><p><span></span>MAURICIO MARTINEZ DE ALVA In April 2017, we made a deal with Top Golf for 10 new golf venues. Top Golf is a different business. Food and beverage are a huge part of the Top Golf experience, combining golf and a restaurant experience and attracting both golfers and non-golfers. We have a close relationship with Top Golf. Therefore, our three main lines of business are dolphins and tours, parks, and Top Golf. Today, dolphins are the biggest part of the business, though this probably will not be the case in the future. Nevertheless, we are expanding and have acquired the site next to us where we will do three nice concepts with additional dolphin swim space, a fantastic beach club, and an area for crewmembers. This will be open in November and is an excellent investment as land in Cozumel is expensive. Our collection of facilities is great, and we are in the area we want to be in.</p><h4>What are your plans going forward, particularly in Quintana Roo State, and how do you plan to be one step ahead?</h4><p><span></span>MQ We are still missing certain segments of the market here, for example, an option for visitors to come here for a few days and then go on a Caribbean cruise without needing an American visa. If we had a port here, this would be possible. Other opportunities are to bring in concerts, races, and events to make this a destination for international shows. We are building our next park over the next few years, and it will be called Xavage. It will be in the same area as Xplor, but with completely different adventures. The two parks will complement each other. We are opening our 900-room hotel in 2017, and then we intend to open another new 900-room hotel every two years until we reach a total of 4,500 rooms. We are creating innovations in the market. That is what we have done in the past, and now that we are entering the hotel industry we cannot just do the same as everyone else; we are doing it because we believe we can do it better.</p><h4>How do you incorporate animal welfare into your operations?</h4><p><span></span>MMDA The business of dolphins is what we were born into; it requires a huge commitment from the owners. Today, we are visible in everything to do with animal welfare. We have been way ahead of the accepted standards regarding animal welfare. Every year, we pass all our reviews and audits. If that were not the case, these tour operators would not deal with us. We have passed all the requirements for customers such as Disney, Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Tui, and Thomas Cook. Mexico is one of the few countries with regulations, whereas countries like the US do not have clear animal welfare regulation. These standards make us better, and we are an active participant in raising them. The animal populations are growing, which is a reflection of animal welfare. We have a concept called the Blue Conservation Project; other companies are green but we are in the dolphin business so we are blue. We invest money in free-range dolphins in conjunction with the university and work with fishermen to clean the ocean. We are conscious that sustainability and animal welfare are the only way to go in this business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you attract shows and/or events to your venue?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ALEJANDRO ARCE</strong> People now have more information and are eager to have more shows that are playing in other parts of the world. In the 1990s, people did not have access to social media or know bands other than the big ones that came to Mexico. Today, kids have access to social media and want to have shows from Korea, the US, and Latin America. You need to research and see what shows are successful in the world, what the top tours are, and how they are making business across the world. You have to analyze data from radio, TV, Spotify, and obviously social media to understand what people are talking about and following on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Mexico City is a top city; it may not have the same economy as London, New York, or LA, but there are similarities, so we have to check what shows are working in other major cities. In Monterrey, we compare it with cities like Miami, Chicago, Dallas, and Houston. Some acts will work in Mexico City and not Monterrey, and this is a part of our research. You have to check different variables and understand the venue capacity, act, audience, local economy, and price in order to ensure that everything matches the target.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>GONZALO ESCAMEZ SADA I</strong>n 1993, the founders made a decision to follow the European model. In this model, the convention center also makes its own exhibitions. We founded a company called APEX, which organizes trade shows. We started to develop our own trade shows and eventually other organizers started showing interest in organizing their own shows. We work internally to develop things that are strategic for the region. If our current organizers are not interested in pursuing an area we want to develop, we give that project internally to APEX and they develop the show. We work with our own company as well as both national and international trade show organizers. We have grown to about 900 events each year and are now the second largest convention center in the country behind the World Trade Center in Mexico City. About 70% of our business is corporate due to the manufacturing vocation of the city. We do about 130 exhibitions a year, of which about 40% is B2B and the rest are B2C. In B2C, we probably have about a 45% market share in the country.</p><h4>What makes you the best to work with for events compared to your competitors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AA </strong>We own the two best venues in the country and in Latin America. The Mexico City venue is the most modern and state-of-the-art venue in Latin America. It holds 22,000 people, and the main center screen is the biggest screen for a venue of this capacity. It has two helipads, free parking for 5,000 cars for all of our shows, three restaurants and bars to visit before and after the event. It is better than many venues in the US, and in terms of the artists and productions, we have state-of-the-art production, backstage, catering and communications. There are many places in Mexico, but there are not many that work with state-of-the-art technology. We own two of them, and in Monterrey we have the biggest indoor venue. Those are the main advantages of working with us but we also have more experience than our competitors, with more than 14 years working in the market and organizing shows in stadiums, theaters, and our own venues.</p><p><span></span><strong>GES A</strong>pproximately 25% of our clients are international. We are close to the US border. The rest of the country does not focus on developing business with the US as much as Nuevo León does. And there is a lot of American influence compared to places like the Bají­o or Querétaro, because of the proximity and the fact there are about 2,800 businesses here. Overall, the city is well positioned for our business ,given the scope of trade between Monterrey and the US. One of the things that we see, especially from the international community, is that when they come they do not have the contacts or know the suppliers or market, so they depend on local people. With APEX, we help them promote the event, generate sales, and help with their logistics. We contact different associations and chambers to source qualified buyers for certain industries or products. Therefore, we do not only bring good exhibitors that bring in new technology and equipment, but also qualified buyers for successful trade shows. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes your hotel or group?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FRANCISCO ZINSER CIESLIK</strong> We had an IPO in September 2014 and as a follow-up, an additional raising of capital on the market in June 2016. The company has done very well; we are a successful growth story as well as a profitable one. We have the highest EBITDA margin of the companies that are public in the industry. We have our own brand, Krystal, and close to 80% of our rooms are under this brand, which has been present in Mexico for over 35 years. This brand has an excellent penetration within the Mexican market, considering that 85% of travel in Mexico is made by locals; hence, it is important to have a strong local brand. With the other 20% of rooms we have, we also manage other brands such as Hilton and Starwood brands. We are preferred operators for the major hotel companies in the world. We focus on Mexico and we have no plans to do business elsewhere. Around 38% of our rooms are third-party management contracts, meaning have no investment in these properties. That speaks well of Grupo Hotelero Santa Fe because it means we have a great deal of confidence among hotel owners to manage their properties. The aforementioned performance of our group is a clear competitive advantage to attract these contracts.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>RENÉ AGUADO </strong>The Four Seasons Hotel Mexico City is the only hotel in the city solely dedicated to focusing on the luxury segment. Therefore, our guest rooms and suites, meeting rooms, outlets, public areas, amenities, and most of our services are focused and specialized for that type of traveler and experience. As an example, in order to cater to our well-traveled guests, we have added Fifty Mils, which is one of the top four bars and the only hotel bar with international award-winning mixologists in the city. We have also been recognized as the only Five Diamonds hotel in the City by AAA. The iconic architecture of our building, a low-rise, hacienda style with a one-of-a-kind central garden, gives a unique sense of place and creates a sanctuary-like feeling in one of the busiest cities of the world for and sets us apart of the rest of our competitors.</p><h4>What is it that attracts people to invest in the hotel and tourism sector in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span>FZC The tourism sector is a cyclical sector; however, we are now starting to experience longer cycles. The specific opportunity of our group is that we generate over 30% of our revenue in US dollars. So when there is foreign exchange volatility, we really have a great advantage of having a little more than a third of our revenues in hard US currency. This is a good thing for investors, as there are many sectors that do not have foreign currency revenue. Overall, Mexico is well known for its evident tourism vocation, with very high standards in terms of services and products. And I truly believe that makes investors comfortable. The country was ranked the 9th most visited country in terms of international travelers in 2016, up from 13th in 2012, this is a clear message that Mexico is very competitive in tourism.</p><h4>Mexico has now climbed to eighth place in the World Tourism Organization ranking of the most visited countries in the world. To what do you attribute Mexico's success in the sector?</h4><p><span></span>RA Several factors have contributed to this success. The most important has been our people. Mexicans are a welcoming and service-oriented culture by nature. That has kept us as a top destination to visit throughout many years. However, the last couple of years, the government and private sector have been more strategic in their marketing investments in order to increase the number of visitors to the entire country. Mexican beaches have always been magnets for all international guests. Lately, other areas, such as Mexico City, have been discovered as top travel destinations, not only for cultural or business reasons, as used to be the case. Now Mexico City is visited by culinary and leisure travelers. It is a safe and fun city for families and couples where you can find everything from Aztec temples to avant-garde and modern buildings, mariachis to raves and amusement parks, from ponchos to haute couture, from tacos to top-50 restaurants, and from traditional cantinas to trendsetting bars and speakeasies. It is eclectic, modern, vibrant, and inspirational. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved, and what are your goals for the coming years?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>Alán Aguirre </strong>Grupo Alta started 26 years ago as a family business. We began with 40ha of farmland and now have about 5,000ha. Around 70% of our land is in Sonora, and we produce mainly table grapes, which make up 40% of our business, while the other 60% comprises pecans, peaches, melons, watermelons, and cantaloupes. We also do vegetables like bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and others. We would like to concentrate on three or four products like table grapes, pecans, and certain other specialties and produce them all-year round, not just in Mexico but in Central America, South America, and other parts of the world, to form alliances with other growers in other countries. Grupo Alta is a family company; currently, we have part of the second generation of the family working on different areas of the company such as growing, production, marketing, and sales. Therefore, the vision is to be able to keep it as a family business for many generations to come.</p><p><span></span>Francisco Tapia Grupo Wellin started 12 years ago in the farming business. We became organic by chance because we did not have the financial resources to buy pesticides. We used chicken manure, which was cheaper, and a concentrate of chili and garlic as repellent and vinegar as herbicide. Subsequently, a broker from the US came and took some soil samples to do tests; he said we could be in the organic business in less than a year. We started with grapes, then with squash and melons. Currently, 80% of our revenue is from organic farming, but we believe urban mining will become the main business for Grupo Wellin. Our urban mining project is a 2,000sqm facility with no emissions and zero waste. Using an ultrasonic generator we extract metals and non-metals from the printed circuit boards of the electronic devices that are thrown away. We employ biotechnology to remove all the gold, silver, platinum, and other valuables and recycle them. Mexico generates 900,000 tons of waste per year and is number one in Latin America in terms of waste creation. Brazil is another country that creates tons of waste annually; therefore, we will head there next.</p><h4>How important is your company to the local economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AA</strong> We have many relationships with suppliers; we work directly and indirectly with many people in the sector and that helps the economy of Sonora and the whole country as well. When we supply our products to a grocery store or customer, we provide quality—quality flavor, security, health, and social responsibility. We are important for the economy of the state; however, we really want to be an example of how to take care of the people in a company. We pay our staff four or five times above the minimum salary; this is one of the ways in which we take care of our people. In addition, they have excellent housing and three meals a day. A large part of the success of the company is because of the workers here doing manual labor that allows us to produce high-quality products. Most of the staff that come back to us like the way we work with them, how they get paid, and the security they feel. </p><p><span></span><strong>FT </strong>We want to transform and implement an open management system where people can actually read numbers and financial statements so they know how the business is going. We need to completely change the way we work and share profits with the people. We want everyone to have a sense of ownership and success. We are introducing this program and providing them with an education. We empower people to become better. We want to fight illiteracy and contribute as a company to literacy. I am doing it only for 600 employees on my farm right now; imagine if we can transform them to help better the lives of their families. We always strive to innovate and want to be the leader in terms of improving welfare via our products or services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the benefits of working with your company over competitors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LUIS G. MÉNDEZ TRILLO</strong> We are growing, but we also want to stay as close as possible to a boutique firm with a personal and professional relationship with a small number of highly serviced clients. This is what differentiates us from our competitors and made us so successful in the last five years.</p><p><span></span><strong>SERGIO FELGUERES</strong> We are quite different from independent individuals that sell real estate. The majority of them do not have any experience, and yet clients still give them the most important part of their assets. Often, these independent people fail to protect their clients. I have seen many people who lost their assets because they chose a bad real estate agent. On the contrary, REMAX agents are very well prepared to protect their clients.</p><h4>What is the typical profile of someone who purchases a franchise or a foreign investor?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LMT</strong> We consult a lot of investors for whom we do tailor-made projects. We understand their risks, their expectations on returns, and the type of products they want to invest in. We are also a major player in the land search and securement process for land banks and investors. We are one of the few large brokerage firms with expertise in the technical, legal, and market conditions that define the strongest investments. We are working a lot on securing land for developers. We also work in appraisals and are one of only two appraisers for Fibra Uno, and the exclusive appraiser for Fibra Danhos. Both of these keep us busy. We also just opened our project management and construction management branch and are excited to have already gotten our first enquiries. A chief strength of ours is being committed to long-term relationships and being able to serve our clients in any part in the country.</p><p><span></span><strong>SF </strong>We have different kinds of clients. We have people who used to work in a big company and are looking for more independence. Some of our clients own small independent real estate companies and want to be part of our network. We also work with our own agents, who want to grow and open their own business while still being part of the brokerage system. We do not want people who buy a franchise to be self-employed; we want them to build a business.</p><h4>How has Mexico evolved as a destination for real estate investment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LMT </strong>Most new developments started about 20 years ago when NAFTA was signed. This is when we started to see the first modern and state-of-the-art buildings. In the last five years, we have seen a further increase in the quality and scale of mixed-use products. In a complicated city like Mexico City where we have security, traffic, and distance issues, it is important to develop mixed-use projects that allow users to have a higher quality of life and a place that they can work, exercise, eat and entertain themselves with cinemas, restaurants, bars, and gyms. Each year more and better products are entering the market; though this trend will continue, the challenge now is an oversupply of office space in the next three to four years. However, in terms of the quality of our products, the yields for international investors, and our increasingly educated market, Mexico still has huge growth opportunities. Many of our seven- to 10-year leases are now based on the US dollar; therefore, we also have the same guarantees you will find in the world's main markets. Our market is becoming more mature, secure, and sophisticated</p><p><span></span><strong>SF T</strong>he real estate business in Mexico is consistently becoming more professional as small real estate businesses move into our franchise models. This means we can grow from 110 to 300 franchisees over the next three years, a leap that is well within our reach. The major reason to grow is that soon we will have a state license to sell real estate in Mexico. There are 10 states in Mexico in which real estate licenses are approved at this moment, and we hope the whole country will soon have obligatory real estate licenses. The value of some of our franchises is increasing, and we are going to grow very quickly. In the aftermath of the economic crisis that shook Mexico and the world, the best place to invest is real estate. Real estate investments never lose their value; sometimes they dip for a bit, but they always recover. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the state of coffee culture in Mexico when Barbera first entered the market, and how has it evolved?</h4><p><span></span><strong>J</strong><strong>OSÉ ANTONIO DÍAZ </strong>Due to changes in the market, we decided to transition from B2B to B2C in 2001. The decision was mainly for two reasons. First, our customers became too powerful. They were large supermarket chains, and it was becoming harder to make good deals with them as it became too expensive. The second reason was that more and more brands started coming in, especially after NAFTA, so the competition was getting tougher, and making deals with our buyers became harder. Therefore, we started asking ourselves how we could get people to consume our product without going to supermarkets and without putting our product on shelves. The answer was to make the coffee ready to be consumed in many places and make the product accessible for people. OXXO was the perfect match for this. At that time, OXXO had about 2,000 stores; now it has almost 16,000 stores, and our products have been successful there. In 2013, we moved to the other side of the value chain; we went to farms and cultivators. We conducted partnerships in Oaxaca and Veracruz and now have a close relationship with coffee growers. We provide them with support and technology to help them produce more coffee in the same farm with better quality. This close business relationship has given us the opportunity to buy the product directly from them</p><p><span></span><strong>XAVIER ITURBIDE</strong> I frequently compare the coffee culture to the tequila market 25 years ago. Tequila was a worker's drink; it was cheap and had a poor presentation. But then people began to realize that the drink had an interesting history and that it was prepared with high-quality, artisanal methods. What is happening with coffee in Mexico is more or less the same thing. Around 25 years ago everyone was drinking instant coffee. With the arrival of international brands and specialty coffee, people are discovering that there is more to coffee than instant and every day more and more people drink high-quality coffee. Mexico has had the largest per capita increase of coffee consumption in Latin America. However, we still drink 10 times less coffee than Colombians, which demonstrates Mexico's potential for growth. In Mexico, people want to know exactly what they are drinking and are becoming much more discerning consumers. Very large companies are recognizing this too and developing specialty brands to fill this new demand. As a specialty drink of the highest quality, Barbera needs to teach consumers that not all coffees are created equal. This is a challenge, but people are already tasting and learning about the differences.</p><h4>What are your goals in terms of expansion?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAD</strong> We have four business models that we are working on in the coming months and years. The biggest one is the basic concept inside OXXO. We now have another concept in its early stages. We will place a barista and all the equipment necessary inside OXXO stores; we have been testing this in a number of stores for the last two years. We also expect to open around 60 new drive-throughs in the next 12 months. The fourth one is to supply to restaurants, hotels, resorts, business centers, and corporate offices. We have been developing a business model in which people can order coffee through their mobile phones and get it wherever they want. </p><p><span></span><strong>XI</strong> In terms of franchises, this year we plan on opening two or three more cafes in Guadalajara. We want to open a number of coffee shops there and then expand into other cities. If everything goes to plan, we will open another cafe in Mexico City this year. We want to open between 35 and 40 coffee shops in the next seven years. This number may grow, but we believe a conservative estimate is more prudent. In terms of distribution, we are close to entering the retail channel with a national chain. We are also in talks with many specialty shops, boutiques, and gourmet shops because many of the people who will make our brand successful shop at these places. We want to position the brand in this way to attract a core group of consumers who can appreciate the quality of our coffee. We also have plans for deals with luxury hotels and restaurants. We expect to finalize deals with a number of large hotel chains by the end of this year. Any place that wishes to provide the very best for their customers and guests will recognize that we are the coffee of choice. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your client profile developed?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ENRIQUE MARTÍNEZ </strong>Over the last 20 years, the construction industry has undergone several changes that have seen clients become increasingly demanding when it comes to quality and delivery. Industrial construction projects are vital to companies, since they house their machinery and production. This makes it even more important for projects to be on time and high quality. For real estate developers, it is different. For them, we build projects which our clients then sell. Apart from industrial clients and residential developments, another important client base for us is institutional clients such as universities. For example, we built a unit in Querétaro for the Instituto Tecnologico de Monterrey, in addition to a new library for them in Monterrey, which is one of the most important libraries in America. We have also built for Universidad de Monterrey and recently finished the San Pedro Unit High School. We are also keen on participating in the Pabellon Amarillo in the Campus of the Universidad de Monterrey, which is about to be launched. Institutional clients present another type of work. It is delicate work building on campuses. The fact that we have a good track record with our clients allows us to stand out.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>GUILLERMO BACA </strong>We started off doing maquiladoras, industry buildings along the border with the US, and just building the shell, which is then filled with people and equipment. But now we design and build sophisticated industrial buildings, including paper plants, tire plants, chemical plants, pharmaceuticals, and food industry plants, for example. These are high-tech buildings with high-end specifications in line with European and American specifications. We have learned to design and build these kinds of sophisticated buildings as we grew through the years. Naturally, our client profile has also changed in alignment with that. Now, we have clients and competitors from all over the world, from the US, Spain, the UK, France, China, Germany, Japan, and, of course, Mexico. We sell engineering and construction services, and we are a service business. And service is all about people. When you invest in your people, the rest will follow.  When you look at the list of our clients, 70% are repetitive, meaning they hire you again. That vision has been crucial for us. In the last five years, the size of the company has tripled.</p><h4>How did your company expand throughout Mexico geographically?</h4><p><span></span><strong>GB</strong> Copachisa began as a construction company for industrial parks. After our first city, one of our big customers was Packer Electric, a subsidiary of General Motors, and it asked us to go to Monterrey in the 1980s to build another city. This park was followed by cities in Laredoa, Cuahuila, Saltillo, Ciudad Juarez, and other cities. Then, Terrazas founded Enmixa, which designs and builds steel structures, and that further supported the Copachisa business. He then founded Denmec, which designs and builds electrical and mechanical installations. Today, we have 14 companies. Terrazas manages all those companies from Copachisa, so Copachisa was the mother company that owns those other companies. Since we started growing, we decided to create a holding company, Grupo Punto Alto, which manages all our companies.</p><h4>What are your predictions for the medium term for the construction sector in northern Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EM </strong>Developers believe 2017 and 2018 will see projects drop in the areas where we are most active, such as San Pedro Garza Garcia. The cost of land is relatively high in San Pedro Garza Garcia compared to different areas in the municipality of Monterrey, which is why we have seen construction on the rise in other areas. We are also active in other areas such as the Bají­o, Queretaro, Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Jalisco, among others. We are building a new commercial center and a housing project in Hermosillo, Sonora. We have just signed a contract for a new building in Mexico City. This is an exclusive contract to build an underground parking structure at a cost of MXN160 million (USD9 million). However, we are also interested in building the tower above the parking structure. The requirements of the underground parking structures raise the price of the apartments, offices, and commercial areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company filled a gap in the real estate market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CORAL QUINTERO </strong>In the past, it was difficult for someone to have access to a pre-foreclosure opportunity. Therefore, we decided to offer all the people who are interested in the investment opportunity and product a follow up tailor-made procedure with the main focus and final goal being the property. In the past, a pre-foreclosure was not available to the public Mexican market. Individuals interested had to have an internal contact with banks, take the risk, and deal with their own process.</p><p><span></span><strong>OMAR GONZÁLEZ </strong>There is no regulation that standardizes this market; therefore, we created Portafolios Hipotecarios to give credibility to this line of business and its investors. Unfortunately, there have been many companies that take advantage of investors. We do not do this, and we strive to make them feel confident about where they invest. In the past, there were no solid companies in this business and many had a bad reputation for committing fraud. Portafolios Hipotecarios is today the leading company in the market. We have a transparent and clean image and are pioneers in the market. This clarity has helped us grow exponentially. Our company was created with capital from investors. With that capital we made a portfolio of properties before purchasing and reselling them. We acquire properties at a low cost before reselling them at a much higher price. The advantage for investors is that with us their money is guaranteed with a property that has an attractive profit margin.</p><h4>What is the profile of investors you work with?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CQ </strong>There are two types of clients. The first is investors who invest in our services by buying assets with legal deeds at the beginning stage and resell at a future stage, obtaining a monetary benefit since there is an increase in the legal deed's price from one stage to the other. As time passes and the procedure advances, there is an increase in the cost of the assets' legal deeds and that gives our clients a good resale profit. The other type of client we have is one whose final goal is to obtain at the end the property title in order to live there, rent out, or resell with a real estate agent at a normal price. In Mexico, there are different types of pre-foreclosure deeds with different budget range, giving our interested clients a diverse world of possibilities in which to invest.</p><p><span></span><strong>OG</strong> There are two main profiles. First, people that want to purchase cheap property, for which we find foreclosed properties at cheap prices. The profile of a person who is looking for a house is middle- to high-income and is normally looking for an inexpensive property. If it is for leasing, that property may function as an additional income or pension. Our second type of investor is someone that has savings they do not want to put in banks because of the small margin. Hence, they would rather invest in a property portfolio, where there is no risk of losing, but a guaranteed profit. There is a great potential in this kind of investor. People that are looking to invest want to make use of their money quickly. We find a property portfolio and we sell it. As properties sell, they recuperate their investment. Investors compose about 60% of our business. With the depreciation of the Mexican peso, we have seen a boom in property investments. As a company, we see bigger opportunities when there are economic difficulties.</p><h4>Are foreigners interested in this business?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CQ </strong>Most of our clients are Mexican, but we also have clients from many different nationalities. The difference between buying real estate and investing in a pre-foreclosure is that our clients do not have to be Mexican to invest since they are not initially buying a property, but getting assets with legal deeds. For foreigners, there are no restrictions for buying a legal deed, unlike buying real estate.</p><p><span></span><strong>OG </strong>We are looking to expand our business to the US, because there are huge opportunities there. We are also pitching Mexican investors to the US, where there are good opportunities, too. Laws are not similar in Mexico and the US, so we are in the process of understanding the American legal framework to enter that market. Nevertheless, most of our investors are Mexican. We sell in all kinds of cities in Mexico, but are focused in Mexico City and the surrounding states. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you decide to get started?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Renan Bucheli </strong>Juan Antonio Namé is the founder of this project. He purchased an old building in Mexico City about 10 years ago that used to be a hospital. The tenants in the building were a pharmacy, a medical laboratory, and a chiropractor. He realized he had a "plaza de salud,“ basically a health-themed strip mall. We combined the two words to form PlaSalud, our brand name. We want this concept to become the word one uses when they are ill; instead of going to the pharmacy they will go to PlaSalud because it has all the medical services one needs in one place. In Latin America, when people fall ill they go to a pharmacy rather than a hospital. It is hard to find specialties such as dentists and opticians. Most times people do not need a hospital; they just need a few special products or consultations. They do not need hospital services but require more than a pharmacy. Our concept is something in between; more than a pharmacy and not as much as a hospital.</p><p><strong>Jimmy Arakanj</strong>i We identified an opportunity a few years ago when Mexico was facing a public image problem. Everything was negative about the war against drugs and the cartels, but the fundamentals of the economy were still strong. We had a country that was projecting interesting growth over the next few decades. We saw a big window of opportunity to penetrate a huge market with a rising middle class where the current offer at the time was pretty limited, mostly to domestic brands and national tenants. That is where we realized there was a turning point in the country. We knew that perceptions were going to change. We saw the return of institutional capital into the country. At the time, we offered a unique proposition. Our access and relationships with international brands and tenants that were already close to our partners in New York through our equities gave us an edge. We knew a retail revolution was coming.<br>How do you decide what kind of expansion to pursue?</p><p><strong>RB </strong>We have around 25 health plazas right now. In the beginning, we used to have an average of around eight stores per plaza, but now have 12-15. We have 25 plazas right now and are currently building three with two more waiting for the permits and licenses. We will start construction of those this summer. Right now, our first priority is to be the best and most known in Mexico City and its surroundings. Secondly, there is medical tourism near the border with the US for Americans without insurance to purchase medicine or see doctors; there are many dentists and opticians here. Our plazas will grow nicely there in the second phase, and we are already starting one over there. Thirdly, we believe the fastest-growing area in Mexico is Bají­o. There are many people going there, as there is a lack of services, especially in health. We also play an important role in providing health services to rural communities. There is a shortage of  medicine and treatment services in these areas.</p><p><span></span><strong>JA</strong> In Cabo, we are developing the Montage Hotel, which will open in 2017. In Guadalajara we have another exciting project with retail, residential, and office components. In Mexico City, we are doing the Ritz Carlton at Reforma. In Metepec, in the Toluca Valley, we have our largest retail project. In Merida, we have a project called the Harbor, which has a lake. We are currently developing projects in Tulum, San Luis Potosí­, and Torreón, and an island off the coast of Belize where we will have a hotel, parking lots, a marina, a landing strip, and a golf course. Every one of our projects has its charm and prominence in the market, becoming landmarks in each of these markets. Our goal is not to be the largest real estate company in Mexico, but the best. We want to do projects that will change neighborhoods and improve people's lives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you come to occupy this position in the market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JUSTIN FACEY</strong> Mexico was the first country in which TIBA began operations outside of Europe. It will be TIBA's 20th anniversary in Mexico in 2017. I opened the first office here and hired our first employees. The company's evolution in Mexico has been fantastic. Today, TIBA is probably the star product and Mexico the main focus within the Romeu Group, our holding group and owner. Mexico is certainly the main focus for the future development of TIBA within the region. My area of responsibility is North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. We control the entire region from Mexico, including the US, which is quite an unusual structure. Today, we have offices in Cuba, Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala. We have 10 offices in Mexico, with nearly 300 staff. The US will be our next area of development, where we now have four offices.</p><p><span></span><strong>GUILLERMO PADILLA</strong> My father established this company 45 years ago. He started as a customs broker. After we graduated from university, my brother Marcelo and I went to work with him in the international business. Then, we started to grow as freight forwarders; we decided to start a transport business. Now, after 45 years, we have consolidated the group of services centered around international commerce. Previously, Mexican companies lacked technology and knowledge about international commerce and trade. Unfortunately, our balance leans more toward imports rather than exports. After NAFTA, we did not see as many problems because it was much easier to do business. A company only needed a truck to deliver cargo to the border and across the border there are warehouses in different cities; we received the cargo and moved it where it needed to go. However, the rest of the world had open trade with NAFTA, and for us it was a challenge to help Mexican companies bring cargo. That was the main reason we wanted to be here in this business. Now, our company brings technology to the companies to enable tracking via internet and phone applications to check their cargo. If a company does not have business on mobile, it is out. Our clients were nervous before about receiving their cargo, but now they can access tracking information any time via internet or mobile. The technology has changed our business immensely.</p><h4>What major logistical changes have you seen in the country since arriving?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JF </strong>When TIBA first arrived here it was quite difficult to convince clients of the benefits of using a logistics operator. Most clients in Mexico were more accustomed to dealing directly with their customs broker, trucker, or airline, and trying to sort out the logistics by themselves. It took a few years for clients to come around to looking at a different way of doing business. We had to prove that using a logistics operator was beneficial to them. We are experts in our field of business; we control the parties involved, such as the shipping lines, customs brokers, airlines, warehouses, and truckers, and can filter them through for the client. We know whom we are working with and, due to the volumes we deal with, are able to negotiate better rates and conditions. Then we pass on these benefits to our clients. We do not just buy and sell freight like many of our competitors do—that is not our business model. We sit down with our clients and make sure we understand their problems, necessities, business model, and geographical constraints. Then, we provide a solution to these that makes economic and operational sense.</p><p><span></span><strong>GP</strong> NAFTA changed everything. Everything began moving quickly and the ICT business grew. This has been the most important change; NAFTA caused international business to really take off in Mexico. I love the logistics business; taking cargo from one place to another and controlling every step in the chain is my forte. When we started as a customs broker, we had to work with different companies and freight forwarders. We saw problems and an opportunity to integrate all of the services. In the beginning, we formed contracts with third-party logistics providers; however, we decided to start our own companies to take control. Services, for us, are the most important piece. When there are several contracts with different companies,  efficiency is lost. It is easy for us and for the client to communicate with one person who controls everything. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of your company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ENG. GUILLERMO ELIZONDO</strong> After studying agronomy at Tecnologico de Monterrey and working for a company that manufactured fertilizers, I decided to start my own business. I got a small loan from a bank and bought a seed-cleaning machine from the US. I started selling services with that machine to farmers and was hired by them to give them technical advice, and I was able to pay back the loan. After this, I started selling fertilizers, agrochemicals, seeds, and imported Porsche tractors from Germany and invested in other agricultural ventures such as horticulture and cattle raising. At the same time, we diversified and began importing air conditioners and computers.</p><p><span></span><strong>MARCO OJEDA </strong>The company was started 48 years ago by a group of businessmen in the agriculture sector who had seen there was a need to develop a company that could ensure quality on-time delivery. Thus, Agroindustrias del Norte as a group is nearly 50 years old, but some of our companies have been doing business in Sinaloa for over 70 years. At that time, there were similar companies getting starting, but what made this one unique was that it decided to serve everybody's needs. Hence, the company was started as a corporation that would be professionally managed. The families would remain at the board and review its results, but there would be a professional administration. This is important because even today, we are one of the few companies in the industry that is operated by professionals and not family-run.</p><h4><span></span>How did you expand, either geographically or in terms of businesses, to your current presence?</h4><p><span></span><strong>GE</strong> Grupo Ceres expanded into other businesses such as finance and insurance. One of the top needs of farmers was financing, so we formed a SOFOM called Agrocapital, we have a credit line of MXN600 million (USD33.4 million) with FIRA and MXN1.25 billion (USD69.4 million) with Financiera Nacional. Also, the market needed an agricultural insurer; hence we founded ASTERRA. We also formed ARMEX, a crop storage company that is an auxiliary credit institution. We formed a company called Centro de Productividad Ceres to give farmers technical assistance, ensuring production and loan repayment. Our goal is to grow internationally with exports. We are negotiating with Nigeria, Angola and China. We have exported maize to South Africa, Costa Rica and Venezuela. The US produces transgenic corn whereas Mexico produces non-transgenic corn. </p><p><span></span><strong>MO</strong> Being based in Sinaloa makes sense because we are leaders in high-tech farming in Mexico. We export many products to various parts of the globe such as the US, Spain, and South America. As such, Sinaloa is the ideal place in Mexico because it offers advantages and there are large farming supplies here. However, the Sinaloa market is difficult because we have farmers with a great deal of experience that negotiate very well; they are always negotiating prices, conditions, services, and more, which makes running a profitable business a challenge. We decided that when going out of Sinaloa, instead of adapting our services to whatever they're having in the market, we give the same service and conditions as in Sinaloa. This has proven to be an excellent decision because we are growing by six to seven branches a year now. We want to send a message to growers that we are about innovation and are high tech; we can help growers develop and export their product in a better way. One thing that differentiates us is the number of our well-trained technicians and experts in those technologies who are in the field. There is no one in Mexico with as many technicians in the field. Definitely, there is a space for us to go after in Latin America. We have had some talks with different companies in Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Argentina, but there is still much to be done in Mexico. Right now, as a first step, we want to grow in the high-tech areas in Mexico and expand as much as we can there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates your company from its competitors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ALBERTO RAMOS</strong> Our competitors used to do analysis based on old information, assuming a company wants to see some financial reassurance of the last five to 10 years. It is much more important to see what will happen in the future. In our reports, we focus on forward-looking analysis and publish the financial statements of entities. Every year, we do a double check of what we were expecting, our best-case scenario, the stress scenario, and reality. The second differentiator is transparency. On our website, all of our ratings are free. This way, investors can go into the detail of the full reports and the process of analysis of each entity. We also made our methodologies fully available to the public.</p><p><span></span><strong>ALBERTO JONES TAMAYO</strong> Our investors differentiate us because of the insight of our analysis, the depth and availability of our analysts to investors, the analysts' level of expertise, and how frequently we engage with the market to let them know our opinion on everything relevant to what is happening or may happen to a company, industry, bank, country, or sector. In terms of transparency, we have the most diverse set of methodologies for industries and types of financing. We have a huge set for infrastructure and for project finance. Talking about industrials and consumer goods, we have a large array of methodologies with each pinpointing the main drivers of the credit.</p><h4>What is your view of the current situation with the economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AR </strong>In my opinion, the US election has not helped the short term with the volatility of the peso, the economy, oil prices, our slow growth, or the increase in the country's debt. Yet, it is important to let investors know that Mexico is not a country that depends on oil. Oil is important, but our economy is distributed across many different segments and sectors. Our problem is that Mexico still depends on the American market so everything that happens there is important. In 2018, we will have presidential elections. However, in 2017 different prospects from different parties will start appearing. We are going to continue to see volatility but the peso should stabilize very soon, and I do not expect to see the higher volatility we have seen in the past days. We have more stability in our institutions now. Our financial system is well regulated and remains in an excellent position compared to other countries.</p><p><span></span><strong>AJT I</strong>nternational investors have increasingly been investing in Mexican companies or government issuing securities. Despite external shocks, Mexico has a huge population, a relatively high income per capita, and a large and diversified economy, and is a global leader in certain industries. The participation of foreign investors is significant and demonstrates the importance of this country. The investor base of Mexican securities is strong. The currency should also not be a restriction to investing here. Mexican exporters also import and the net is positive for them in terms of how the currency affects them. There is enough financial flexibility for large Mexican companies to switch between financing in one or the other currency relatively quickly. Although interest rates in Mexico began to increase last year and will likely continue to do so, most of the growth and modernization of the industrial platform of this country has been done at interest rates that are much higher yet allowing for a still profitable business. </p><h4>What are your goals for growth in the medium term? </h4><p><span></span><strong>AR </strong>One of our goals is to continue to lead the rating industry in Mexico. We have grown very much in recent years. We have had many challenges, from human resources to operations. That is a part of growing and giving the level of service that we promised from day one. Another challenge is working in the US, which is a completely different and more sophisticated market than Mexico. We are sure we can be competitive there. We do analysis differently from our competitors in the US; hence, the US is our main focus for growth. However, we still want to take good care of Mexican and American companies that want to have insurance in euros. We will also explore opportunities in South and Central America.</p><p><span></span><strong>AJT</strong> Naturally, we hope to continue to be relevant for investors and for issuers of debt regarding the timeliness and accuracy of our ratings. We also want to ensure that our analytical coverage continues to grow to continue to be increasingly important to investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JOSÉ MANUEL CRUZ</strong> Alliance is a network of cooperative savings and credit unions. Today, it consists of 20 cooperatives, each with autonomy. Each usually has the name of the region where it was created. In 1994, all the cooperatives in the country were local. Then, the Caja Popular Mexicana (the People's Savings Bank) was created to unite all the savings and credit unions. However, some unions did not want to participate. Ours were among those; however, we realized that we needed to unite somehow, so we created Cajas Alianza. The idea was to create a framework in which the cooperatives conserved their autonomy and made more decisions locally and faster. We looked for economies of scale and the Alianza project was born. In 2016, we had more than 500,000 associates and more than 100,000 children. We have about MXN11 billion in assets, a staff of more than 2,000 employees, and 200 managers. Today, we are the largest corporate network in the center of the country and perhaps the only model that prevails with all these characteristics.</p><p><span></span><strong>SANJUANITA GARZA BENÍTEZ</strong> We are turning 44 years old in 2017. Before the 1990s, banking was elitist, so people with lower resources didn't have access to opening a savings account or obtaining a credit. I joined in 1986 as an accounting assistant, while I was still studying. We were five employees back then. In 1989, we managed to obtain our first property, and from then we started to acquire other offices too. Every year we are growing in members, assets, and our portfolio as well. Now we are the fifth-largest authorized firm in credit portfolio, with over MXN1.5 billion in placed. We have over 130,000 members with 340 employees and our assets have reached MXN2 billion. We have 37 branches and in the past three years we decided to consolidate the cooperative and look for the rentability of each branch, strengthening our credit products specializing them with characteristics and requirements according to our target market. In 2008, we absorbed another cooperative in Coahuila. It had an important social base and number of branches and we wanted to expand, achieving up to now, a 300% growth in assets in such zone.</p><h4>What distinguishes the cooperatives and unifies its member organizations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JMC </strong>We have a great advantage; the cooperatives that make us up can make decisions quickly. The operating structures are light, economically and in decision making. We have three operational patterns, the first being the intimacy or relationship with our associates; second, adapting products to the market we develop quickly and efficiently, and finally, operational efficiency. We value how competitive it is with respect to the market. We always seek the competitive advantage of our model according to other cooperatives.</p><p><span></span><strong>SGB T</strong>here is a substantial difference between cooperatives and banks, the main being that it is the members that are the owners of the cooperative and benefits do not go to a shareholder or capitalist that is financing. Most surpluses should capitalize inside the cooperative, as it is crucial to have institutional capital. This protects us from a massive exit from our members. Another part that is obtained with the surplus is destined to a social fund that benefits our members; for example, we cover funeral costs. We also have life insurance, and their savings duplicate for the beneficiary, encouraging them to increase their patrimony. </p><h4>What are your goals for the future?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JMC</strong> We want to increase management, technical, and IT assistance efforts to develop the work plan for next year's cooperatives, create a bank for the sector to invite the most important cooperatives, and work in economies of scale with insurance for fleets of cars. In IT, we want to work in the use of technology so that more cooperatives join the growth plan in a cost-effective way, for example generating our own solar energy, using token technology, and notifications with text messages, for example.</p><p><span></span><strong>SGB</strong> One of our priorities is security for our members' resources. The regulatory side is an important weight for us. In the next few years many small cooperatives will not be able to survive, so there are scenarios of absorbing other cooperatives as an area of opportunity for growth. We also have innovation as a priority; this is something we cannot leave behind. Keeping in mind the constant technological evolution of financial services, we are about to launch an app for mobile devices to be able to do transactions from the application. We are always looking at mechanisms to keep being sustainable and not fall behind. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the bank evolved since its establishment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MARIO MACIEL CASTRO </strong>When we received the approval for being a bank it was the crisis of 2008; therefore, our business plan was modified because of financial economic environment. The Mexican banking system was strong and we faced that crisis well. Money is a commodity, which means price is not really an issue. The focus needs to be service. Our customers are looking for security. All the banks in Mexico are strong and are well capitalized and they have a net equity ratio above the standard. We have a base of 10.5 and the authorities are looking for at least 12 and internally we are trying to be close to 13. The Mexican banking system in the national banking commission statistics is well capitalized and security is not as issue; the issue is service. That is what we are doing in order to be competitive with other banks. We are convinced customers seek service and will perhaps pay a little more in order to receive that service. What is important to us is that we must provide excellent service at a good price with security with a secure bank behind. Of course, there are certain products that we cannot provide because it is a matter of infrastructure. Our strengths are the FX market, trust market, and auto loan market; nevertheless, we have a whole range of products like any other bank.</p><p><span></span><strong>FRANCISCO MERÉ PALAFOX</strong> Mexico faces serious problems in terms of financial inclusion, where approximately 50% of people do not have a bank account. Not having a bank account has many implications, not only in terms of financial inclusion of course but also in terms of excluding people from financial services and e-commerce. In today's world, being digitally excluded is a tremendous setback. The issue is also not only about covering people who are excluded but also reaching out to people who are not satisfied with their banks; a world banking report published by Cap Gemini has an index on consumer satisfaction and Mexico has seen a reduction in the last few years. There is, therefore, an opportunity to grow in the Mexican banking sector, which is why we established the bank. The question was how to develop a business model and bank that could cover a number of issues, namely overcoming many of the issues of inclusion and developing a better experience even for unsatisfied customers of traditional banks, and even for people living in remote or suburban areas, all under a framework of being innovative to disrupt the market and become a challenger bank. That is what we decided to do with technology, building a fintech bank as this was clearly the way to go for various reasons. The cost of serving and the number of companies we serve can be exponential without the physical expenses of branches or infrastructure that people no longer want to use. The cellphone coverage is sufficient and people are switching their consumption patterns to being more digital through e-commerce and using digital platforms for many purposes. </p><h4>What sets your bank apart from others?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MMC</strong> At times, certain companies ask who will be in charge of my company relationship with CI Banco and I say "I will be your accounts officer; if you ring me I will try to make things happen." One does not always need the human side on the other side of the telephone line but sometimes it is important to talk with one's account officer. In our niche, we have branches, but people sometimes do not like to go to a branch, they want to have someone to call when there is a problem and so for that they need an accounts officer who is responsible for their account. We have branches because we must locate our account officers close to the customers; that is the kind of service that we must develop.</p><p><span></span><strong>FMP</strong> There are three main differences. The first is that the bank is more a technology company than a bank. We are in the business of banking as well as the business of e-commerce. A customer cannot open a bank account online with a standard bank and they have to go to a physical branch as opposed to doing it online and with the satisfied experience of e-commerce. Our products are designed in this way unlike banks, which are in the journey of digitalizing their processes as we develop products and processes that are digitally native. Secondly, as we have the mindset of being a technology company, we are quick to innovate and go to the market, even using A/B testing of parts. The product development cycle in a typical bank takes a long time and an advantage of being digital is that as we can better understand the patterns in the digital world of our customers and what they do online and thus better develop products that actually meet their demands. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways are you encouraging innovation among your students and spearheading the government's Vision 2021 for a competitive, knowledge-based economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Mohamad Kashef </strong>Firstly, ALHOSN backs the campaign to include more and more young people in the private sector and is proud to have many graduates who have gone on to assume senior level positions. There are some large companies whose workforce is made up entirely of engineers who graduated from ALHOSN University. Every department in ALHOSN University has an advisory board made up of members from the private sector, which helps to forge a strong connection between education and practice, empowering students to become active agents in their work environment. We encourage brainstorming sessions and communication with the public and private sectors, and create student forums. Secondly, we encourage our students to be outward looking and internationally minded. For example, we host seminars with the American Corner, a branch of the US State Department, which attracts many guests from abroad and promotes technology transfer and the exchange of knowledge. We have also hosted the US embassy several times, and our students have participated in many of its initiatives to draft a strategy for business cooperation between the UAE and the US. Finally, we support our students in innovating and pioneering their own ideas, whether in mobile applications or in civil engineering research projects. Through these methods we seek to revolutionize learning, transforming it into an entrepreneurial, dynamic process where the students are actively shaping their futures. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Kenneth Vedra</strong> It is not just STEM and STEM plus Arts (STEAM) subjects that we focus on, but also getting students to think creatively and critically. The International Baccalaureate framework does an excellent job of facilitating this kind of thinking. A knowledge-based economy is not just about generating knowledge, but about knowing what to do with it. The International Baccalaureate framework is inquiry-based learning and results in more out-of-the-box thinking. In Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, the top-two levels are synthesis and evaluation, whereby students begin questioning why and how, thus engaging in a higher level of thinking. In terms of particular subjects, we are heavily involved in math and science and our students perform well in these subjects. Our students are also excelling in terms of what they are producing on the arts and humanities side. We host an annual Art Fair at our Al Ain campus, where students will be displaying between 500 and 600 works in 2017. We are proud of what our students are producing and engaging in and the creativity they exhibit both in the arts and sciences.</p><h4>What projects or developments are you most excited about for 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MK ALHOSN</strong> has three main goals for the next 12 months, namely physical expansion, international outreach, and community engagement. In 2018, we are moving to another campus, which will provide better facilities, allowing us to expand and accommodate a greater number of students. We would like to secure international accreditation for all our courses and enhance our student exchange programs with overseas universities. Finally, we want to encourage our students to be more engaged with the local community, organizing platforms for civil defense and sustainable development in various municipalities through which they can propose solutions for real problems. We hope this will inspire the kind of leadership that this country needs in its young graduates.</p><p><span></span><strong>KV </strong>We have a lot going on. We are currently expanding our campuses in Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah. We have doubled the number of pupils in our International Baccalaureate diploma classes. 2016 was the first year we had grade-12 students graduate with the International Baccalaureate, and it has been extremely successful. The usual pass rate for schools in their first year of graduating the diploma program is 40-50%, and ENS achieved 65%. In terms of individual courses, 71% of our Emirati students passed their classes and our overall success rate was 83% for individual courses. That is a phenomenal success, and we are very pleased. We have double the number of students graduating in 2017 either in one course or the whole International Baccalaureate diploma. Our new strategic plan is focused on improvements in achievements in reading, writing, and mathematics using international-based norms. We also want to focus on the earlier development of second language skills. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the your organization developed since its inception?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Ed Edwards</strong> Abu Dhabi Golf Club was designed by world-renowned golf course architect Peter Harradine to service Abu Dhabi as the capital's first golf club, taking into account Abu Dhabi's future as a tourist destination. Since then, the resort has developed into a five-star golf resort with the addition of the Westin Abu Dhabi Golf Resort &amp; Spa, Hotel. We are managed by Troon Golf, and owned by the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC). We have also become the host of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, which is one of the biggest events of the European Tour with a huge international audience.</p><p><span></span><strong>Barry Bremner </strong>One of our biggest accomplishments was the establishment of the ZSC Academy, the first to operate directly under our umbrella. It has grown exponentially by attracting around 700 members within its first three months. We also entered into new corporate relationships with our partnership with the National Ambulance Service for the provision of ambulances and paramedics on site; our relationship with Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi to do a community program; and a community cycling program for families. We also run an amateur Abu Dhabi football league on behalf of Mubadala as part of a partnership. Finally, we have set our sights on the community goals contemplated as part of the Year of Giving with a big focus on CSR and, specifically, sports.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities for Abu Dhabi as a tourist destination in the region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EE</strong> One of our biggest markets is international travelers seeking a golfing destination. Abu Dhabi very much offers that with its selection of hotels and golf courses. Abu Dhabi is well supported by initiatives from the Tourism and Culture Authority and Sports Council to promote it as a leader in global golf tourism and the hosting of major sporting events. For Abu Dhabi Golf Club in particular, we are very proud to have been recognized this year by the Middle East Golf Awards as the golf course that provided the best overall golf experience in the region. Furthermore, we also have a large membership base of golfers that live in the city and use our course daily, in addition to golfers in the Middle East who visit us.</p><p><span></span><strong>BB </strong>We work around an events strategy focused on international sports and entertainment, which includes music, comedy, and family. We are also working with the Sports Council, TCA, and with a number of other stakeholders around sports tourism. There are six different sectors, and there are a number of specific countries we are aiming to target to bring sports tourism to the country. Through these strategies we have attracted the FIFA Club World Cup for 2017 and 2018, the Asian Cup, and the Special Olympic World Games in 2019. Everybody focuses on football; we are extremely excited to host the FIFA World Cup. We also really excited about the Special Olympics since it will probably be the largest sporting event hosted in the UAE, with 7,500 participants, 15,000 volunteers, and 3,000 press people already confirmed.</p><h4>What is your broader strategy for social development and community engagement?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EE</strong> Our plan is to offer an exemplary product and service to our existing members and guests whilst continuing to attract new people to the facility and ultimately raise awareness and grow the game of golf. We want to be energizing and engaging to make golf interesting for a new generation that might not have played. We want to attract new people to visit that have not been to the club before, whether it is through a golf activity, a social activity, or a community activity. We want to strengthen our appeal to tourists both from the other Emirates, from the Gulf region and from the rest of the world. As a club we also have a social responsibility to encourage future sustainability from both an environmental and social standpoint.</p><p><span></span><strong>BB A</strong>round 60-70% of what we do is around community engagement; we also have events like Ramadan tournaments that we run specifically in bowling. We have what could be considered smaller-scale events such as the Mubadala Community League and the Tennis Cup. We have just finished the Abu Dhabi Wilson Tennis Cup, which had a record number of participants. We also partner with private entities and governmental entities to actually run some of these community engagement events. We are developing more and more community programs that are supplemented by private- and government-sector companies, and there is a huge focus on health and wellbeing now. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the technological features you have added to your services?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Mohamed Al Qamzi </strong>We structured several transformations in 2016, with the implementation of Wi-Fi in all of our taxi units the most prominent. It will be a gradual process starting in November 2016 with 50 airport cabs, and we expect to have full coverage by the end of 2017. We also look to the constant upgrading of our taxis and, in  2016, we introduced 270 Mercedes-Benz units suitable for different purposes to the streets of Abu Dhabi, from family cars for five passengers to friendly vehicles for handicapped people with ramps and other features. On the technological side, we have been active in working on a mobile application to serve customers anywhere they are, and we implemented a lost-and-found tool and a complaint-registering system that will eventually substitute our call center.</p><p><span></span><strong>Khaled Al Mansoori </strong>We have started to look at how we can accommodate our customers better through the use of more digitization and other technologies. One of our major plans for 2017 is to shift into e-learning to provide information to a wider audience and make it easier to digest. One successful example we have already implemented in 2016 is the computer test for theory. Cutting costs without affecting the level of service negatively—or even improving the service—is possible through the right use of technology. We also offer a number of post licenses training, such as defensive driving and school bus and ambulance driver training. We offer eco-driving training for employees, as well as a four-by-four cours e for customers who plan to go camping or on desert safaris.</p><h4>How does the company invest in meeting customer satisfaction standards?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAQ </strong>The drivers are the most important part of TransAD since they are the ambassadors of the brand. The quality of our drivers comes even before the quality of our vehicles, and they are expected to perform well since we do constant training with them. For us, leaving the best impression on the client is the most important signal of success. This is particularly important for the airport cabs since they are the welcoming factor to visitors who come to Abu Dhabi and have their first interaction to the country through them. We recently hired over a 100 European drivers, who will give a more diversified look to TransAD.</p><p><span></span><strong>KAM </strong>We will introduce our e-services in 2017 and can do a great deal of things with e-learning to reach a wider audience of customers using different languages. Currently, we offer courses in five languages at EDC, but would like to increase that number. E-learning will make it much easier to expand the offering rapidly. Regarding our safe driving campaigns, we have a great variety of campaigns running at the moment. We run regular campaigns with the Ministry of Interior regarding all aspects of road safety, for example the dangers of mobile phone use in vehicles. We also increased our presence on social media and disseminated safety information in malls, universities, and schools to help the community.</p><h4>How will the new features affect your position vis-í -vis other services in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAQ </strong>We constantly conduct surveys to measure the ratio of quality and satisfaction in our services. We have a strong focus on security, which is why we installed cameras in 645 of our taxis. This certainly sets us apart from the competition since we rank first in safety, and that is the main concern for customers. We are certified as an ISO39001 provider, and we make sure that we follow the rules determined by the certifying company. Also, we have taxis that work only in specific remote areas, and they cannot take customers outside of that specific area. This ensures that they are always available in the specified area.</p><h4>How does the legal framework for driving in the UAE support your programs and safety messages?</h4><p><span></span><strong>KAM </strong>The UAE has the best infrastructure in terms of roads. The challenge we face in the UAE is diversity of nationalities bringing very different driving cultures to one place. We teach students the local law in our curriculum and educate them about how to have a better, safer mindset for driving and to behave better on the road. This transition to local driving and safety standards is part of what our instructors do. As a result of the implementation of such programs, accident numbers are dropping while the number of vehicles on our roads is increasing by around 10% per year. Ultimately, numbers show that EDC has a positive impact on drivers' education and the general driving culture in the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for the company this year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Bassel El Dabbagh</strong> We had ambitious and aggressive growth targets from the start of the year and had to adjust them to the budget allocated for this year's activities. Fortunately, we were able to surpass those targets without compromising our budget and turned things around to come out with positive numbers in the midst of challenging times in the region. In terms of direct operations, we progressed with our plan to create a logistics hub in Abu Dhabi through our 21,000sqm warehousing facility, and are waiting for the permits in order to proceed to the construction phase. We look forward to awarding the contract before the end of 2016 and to break ground on this project in December. The warehouse will feature temperature and humidity control, compliance with international standards, and the capacity to deal with time-sensitive goods such as food, oil and gas materials, and other major industries in the UAE.</p><p><span></span><strong>Qusai Kankazar </strong>Last year and the year before were tough years for the market. In the past, Massar has been primarily a leasing, fleet solution, car rental, and workshop provider, so we decided to diversify our operations by opening up to the logistics market. We made incursions into the sector over two years ago, and since then have seen over 15% growth. We put our success down to understanding what effect this new economic situation has on the larger players in the market. In response, we have been pioneering smart solutions, developing a reputation in the market so that leading companies from a range of sectors can trust outsourcing their logistics needs to Massar, and therefore enabling them to cut on costs and maximize revenue. Mostly we utilize our existing expertise in the transport sector to find money-saving solutions for our clients. We actively encourage the use of new technologies such as tracking and route optimizing programs to make effective use of manpower.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the growth of your operations in the coming year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BED </strong>Agility is among the top-10 global logistics players in the world. What differentiates us and makes us unique is that we are the only global logistics company that has its roots in the Middle East and, consequently, we are committed to the growth of the region and plan to continue investing here even through unfavorable times, such as the period we are in now. We are here for the long term and market conditions will not deter us from continuing to invest. We see 2017 as a challenging year, but a number of our investments will generate a return by late 2017 and 2018 onward. For example, our new warehousing facility is a 20-year plus investment and we are also planning to expand into the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD) in 2017 because we believe it will be the main industrial area of the future. We hope to finalize the acquisition of a plot of land at KIZAD over the next few months and begin offering logistics services there, including overland transportation, containers, and other services. In the medium term, our investment plans include the creation of a warehouse at Kizad as well. In that respect, we have big plans for the future and look forward to seeing them materialized.</p><p><span></span><strong>QK </strong>With the current market situation, we think it is better to maintain the business model that we have currently, maintain our client base, keep the quality and efficiency of service at its current level, seek out more clients that are looking for a similar offering, and be ready for the upturn when it comes. In general, we are optimistic about the trends in the logistics sector going forward, and there are many projects in the pipeline for Abu Dhabi that will spur growth right across the board, from Expo 2020 to Abu Dhabi's port expansion and the deals that KIZAD is signing. The sentiments and the projects are there, and we should see their products come to fruition in the next six to nine months. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can technology help companies achieve their potential?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Rashed Lahej Al Mansoori </strong>ADSIC's mission is to simplify processes and make the life of local entities easier. Previously, establishing a business in Abu Dhabi was a process that involved 25 entities, and now we have everything unified under the DED Business Centre and the No Objection Certificate (NOC). A year into the implementation of NOC, the number of transactions has skyrocketed as processing times shrank from four months to 15 days. We also launched Abu Dhabi Services, a one-stop-shop app through which users can access more than 1,100 services and make transactions through mobile apps. We also have City Guard, a platform that collects and tracks customers' governmental complaints as feedback in order to make their relations with public institutions much more efficient.</p><p><span></span><strong>Khaled Al Melhi </strong>Nearly every country in the world depends on SMEs, and typically they represent over half of a country's GDP and workforce. Every large corporation in existence today, including Injazat, started as an SME at some point. That is just as true in the UAE, if not even more so. We see SMEs as critical to the health and wealth of the nation's economy, and we see Injazat as a catalyst to support and accelerate the success of these SMEs. Through our partnership with Maestrano, Injazat can offer a true pay-as-you-go capability that enables SMEs to gain all the benefits of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system at a fraction of the cost. This service combines world-class SME applications, which the client selects from the App Store, with Maestrano's patented technology to avoid data duplication and multiple entries. All of this is delivered from the UAE's most advanced cloud-based data center. In addition, the Maestrano platform has many front office, CRM, and e-commerce applications as well.</p><h4>What do you see for the future of the sector in 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RLAM </strong>Our current vision puts 2021 as our deadline for reaching our targets. The most challenging part is transitioning to the changes and the fast pace at which they are happening. This industry will see less and less external assistance as time goes by but this will also come with new larger opportunities for the private sector's services. The cloud is a big example of this, with potential to become a USD1.4 billion project. ADSIC is helping design the UAE's future and we want to remain open to alternatives and any progress coming our way.</p><p><span></span><strong>KAM </strong>The technology sector and the integration of technology in business, government, and domestic spaces has grown tremendously since Injazat's founding in 2005. Additionally, we see a myriad of initiatives to increase the levels of automation in business from retail to banking and transportation to government services, all focused on increasing the quality of user experience and reducing the costs of delivery. Enterprises increasingly want to focus on outcomes, more than the means to achieve them. That is where technology providers like Injazat can make a difference, and offerings such as Injazat's cloud service can make the journey to that vision much more achievable and affordable.</p><h4>How are you committed to helping raising local businesses?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RLAM</strong> We have expanded our network with the private sector. We do not see them as competition, but as a contributor to our work and as potential beneficiaries from our services, too. We work with them under different schemes, such as building their capacities for core and non-core, or for focused solutions that can change one single operation. We provide services through IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and other multinationals at that level. These companies provide services through our management structure, giving more flexibility to the private sector in terms of the platforms they can use to participate and create opportunities for potential users. We are expanding our services with the private sector because we perceive them as an engine for our technological growth.</p><p><span></span><strong>KAM </strong>We are delighted to work alongside du and many other major ICT companies in the region, and we take an active role in many conferences and exhibitions in the GCC. As part of any Maestrano rollout, we work with the sponsor to develop and deliver orientation classes for the use of the applications and the cloud, so that SME staff can quickly add value to their businesses. Our newly revamped website provides information and whitepapers on both our services and on trends we see in the market. Our vendor-agnostic approach means that our prospects and clients receive unbiased advice on creating and implementing their technology and services roadmaps. Injazat is a commercial business, but we are committed to improving the skills and capabilities of the UAE in all aspects of the information systems and technology space. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the company's achievements in the aerospace sector in recent years?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>Ismail Ali Mohammed Abdulla </strong>In 2008 and 2009, when we devised the plans for Strata, we established a technology road map to determine the programs we would like to be a part of in the coming decade. We started with a program for flat pack ferrying on the A380 and knew that by 2016 we wanted to diversify and be involved with a variety of programs and services. Working closely with our customers, we established strategic partners with Airbus and Boeing to support Strata's steady expansion. A decade later, we have raised the number to 10 production lines, eight of them locally produced in our facility of Al Ain and two outsourced externally through our company based in Italy. Today's aerospace industry is globalized, which forces us to think beyond traditional boundaries. We currently manufacture commercial aircrafts such as the A330, A350, A380, 7A7, and 777. For Phase II, we will begin building the Airbus A320, a horizontal tail aircraft. This leapfrog expansion is a central aspect of our technological road map.</p><p><span></span><strong>Abdul Khaliq Saeed</strong> In 2015 TS&amp;S made the strategic decision to merge its aerospace and industrial businesses. TS&amp;S businesses are now integrated under a single management structure focused on aerospace and industrial segments. The integration has forged a more efficient business model and organizational structure, while optimizing potential synergies. With a single decision-making and governance framework under one board, as well as unified financial reporting, business planning, and asset management oversight, TS&amp;S is ideally placed to capitalize on future opportunities. With GE, TS&amp;S Aero are bringing next-generation engine maintenance and manufacturing to the UAE. TS&amp;S will create a regional, state-of-the-art GEnx engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facility within the Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park as a joint venture between TS&amp;S and GE, expanding the current GEnx capabilities. GE will also establish a dedicated GEnx parts logistics center to service the JV as well as regional GEnx operators. As it stands, TS&amp;S Aero is the only independent shop in the region, and in November 2016 TS&amp;S announced its 100th V2500 induction. In early 2015, Rolls-Royce Trent 700 full overhaul capability was achieved. TS&amp;S Aero is the only independent MRO shop in the world.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for Nibras Park as a regional aerospace hub?</h4><p><span></span><strong>IAMA </strong>The project to create Al Nibras Aeropark was set in motion in 2012 as a joint initiative between Abu Dhabi Airports Company and Mubadala. Nibras is a project fully dedicated to the development of a local aerospace industry, as stipulated in Abu Dhabi Vision 2030. In January 2017, Phase I of Nibras was fully completed and leased at a 60% of its capacity. The aeropark currently hosts the Advanced Military Maintenance Repair &amp; Overhaul Center (AMMROC) and the Abu-Dhabi Autonomous System Investments (ADASI), among others. We currently have ambitious plans to establish a material manufacturing and an engine manufacturing business, and to attract more anchor tenants into Nibras to make a fully fledged ecosystem. The growth of our industry depends on four major factors: being able to bring and win technologically advanced work packages; building on the human capital that we have and investing more in our people; building a local supply chain; and an engaging and foreseeing growth strategy. In 2015, we established a dedicated research and development department and now we have announced a 3D manufacturing project with Etihad and Siemens. Our aim is to establish these projects as a pilot project to start manufacturing parts for commercial aerospace through additive manufacturing like 3D printing. This is a new era for Strata and manufacturing locally and globally.</p><p><span></span><strong>AKS </strong>Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park aims to support the expansion of a viable aviation cluster in Abu Dhabi, supporting the government's vision to diversify the economy, create new industries, and generate skilled jobs. Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park will provide the infrastructure for the targeted innovation Mubadala is seeking in the aerospace sector, both on the repair side as well as the manufacturing side. TS&amp;S Aerospace with its rich experience in engine repair and the capabilities will be able to grow with the new engine repair technologies and smoothly introduce the manufacturing capability. Nibras' strategy is based on leveraging Mubadala's existing portfolio, and attracting other international aerospace organizations to develop new opportunities that are knowledge and energy intensive with education, training, and R&amp;D at the forefront of its global endeavors. In addition to TS&amp;S, Nibras' existing tenant list includes Strata, the Advanced Military Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Centre (AMMROC), Horizon International Flight Academy, Etihad Flight College, and other companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your respective companies developed in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p><strong>ROB DICASTRI</strong> Royal Jet was originally created as an offshoot of Presidential Flight to support the royal fleet and serve the rest of the VVIP market in the UAE. Half of the company is owned by Abu Dhabi Aviation, a state-run public company, and Presidential Flight owns the other 50%. This mixed expertise of public and private sectors, under the guidance of our Chairman, HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, has allowed us to have great success over the years and to diversify our operations, serving a larger pool of clients. We still focus on VVIP charter, serving royals, heads of state, and charter demands of the ministries, the government, and the Crown Prince's court. We now also offer medical evacuation services and charter brokerage, growing our fleet to 13 aircraft. In 2015, we signed a contract for pilot and engineer training with the government, specifically the military. We also have our own fixed-base operations with a VIP lounge at Abu Dhabi international airport and an aircraft handling facility. We are recognized for our second-to-none services and are one of the market's leading service providers, which is why Royal Jet has won the World Travel Awards Private Jet Operator of the Middle East for nine years in a row.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>RAMAN OBEROI </strong>We are part of the UAE's growth, and we have been the aviation services provider for ADNOC for the last eight years. We expect that the reorganizing of ADMA, ZADCO, and other companies of ADNOC will bring in more efficiency and synergy to the sector. We also recently became partner of Dubai South with commencement of a 15,000sqm hangar project that will be built over the following 18 months. This hangar is expected to be used as an MRO for business jets. Dubai South has its very own VVIP terminal, in which we are launching our FBO during MEBAA. We are also introducing helicopter services in Dubai to link Dubai to the rest of the UAE. We have adopted a three-pronged approach in Dubai.</p><h4>What strategy have you followed to stay competitive as the sector develops and during times of low oil prices? </h4><p><span></span><strong>RD </strong>In order to stand head and shoulders above the rest, Royal Jet has always focused on customer service. Today there are almost 700 VIP-configured aircraft in the Middle East alone—a number that has almost doubled in the last 10 years—so the customer has more choice than ever. Royal Jet has always been on top of its game, and this has resulted in a dedicated and loyal customer base that has helped spread the word of our top-quality services. We still must be competitive in order to keep these customers and to survive; however, there is no possibility of adding value via customer service if you do not have a good product in the first place and make sure to continuously strive for better. One way we do this is by adding new aircraft to our fleet when customer demand warrants it. Toward that end, we are proud to announce the arrival of two unique brand new Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) aircraft—delivered in 4Q2016. With the addition of these striking new aircraft, Royal Jet has expanded its BBJ fleet to eight—the largest fleet of BBJs of any operator in the world. We also have 24-hour maintenance to ensure that our aircraft are always in optimum condition.</p><p><span></span><strong>RO To</strong> overcome the present challenges faced by oil companies, we worked as a team with the oil companies so as to help them reduce costs and provide more efficient services. With the UAE oil sector restructuring in the coming years we will continue to work with ADNOC as an aviation services provider and will provide more cost-effective solutions. Oil companies have done detailed studies of their logistics requirements. They are in the process of rationalizing their marine and aviation requirements. Falcon Aviation is working as a team with ADNOC and has introduced new generation Fixed Wing Bombardier Dash 8 Q 400 NG for its island operations. Simultaneously, Falcon Aviation has introduced 19 seater AgustaWestland AW 189 helicopters, which have resulted in cost savings for the oil Companies. In December 2016, we are introducing eight-10 seater AW 169 helicopter for TOTAL ABK operations. This will result in cost savings and more efficient operations for TOTAL ABK. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of your milestones in 2016?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HE Dr. Eng. Mohammed Nasser Al Ahbabi</strong> The UAE Space Agency was established in 2014 to create a national plan for the development of the country's space industry. This included establishing a strategic framework for the agency and the national sector as a whole, which was to be objective driven and focused. We started with a proposal for a national space policy by putting different space planning documents together and, following an extensive review process, launched the first space policy in the Middle East in 2016. This was a milestone not only because of the complexities involved with establishing a national space policy, but also because of its potential to impact a wide range of sectors such as education, business, free zones, and the government itself.</p><p><span></span><strong>Masood M. Sharif Mahmood </strong>2016 has been a great year for us; we have signed new partnerships and prepared for the launch of our third satellite, Al Yah 3. Some of the key milestones include signing a multi-year capacity agreement with Eutelsat to provide its Broadband for Africa venture access to high-performance commercial Ka-band capacity for broadband services across Sub-Saharan Africa; a long-term, multimillion-dollar partnership agreement to provide Talia's customers in the Middle East and Africa with a tightly integrated offering and a tailor-made solution to fit the changing demands of their customers; kickstarting our Brazil business ahead of the launch this year with multiple wholesale agreements with leading ISPs such as Telespazio; and making strong advances in developing our aero-mobility platform in partnership with Etihad Airlines.</p><h4>How will a national space policy transform the landscape for the industry and attract wider audiences?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MNAA</strong> The benefit of having a national space policy is that it will foster a positive investment framework in the UAE, supported by our own knowledge and expertise. We want to elevate investor confidence so they come here and invest in the UAE. We are currently working on a Space Law too, for which we just finished the first draft. This law contains important elements for building an attractive environment for international investors and establishes a legal framework to prepare the market for tomorrow.</p><p><span></span><strong>MMSM </strong>We, as a nation, ventured into space a little over a decade ago. Investments in space have promoted innovation and research in the UAE and enabled us to move toward a knowledge-based, productive, and competitive economy. The UAE is pursuing its 2021 Vision, which aims to place innovation, science, and technology at the center of the economy and Yahsat is at the cutting edge of the UAE's space ambitions with existing infrastructure in space, and plans to continue to expand it. We are working closely with the UAE government, the Space Agency, and industry players to enhance the UAE's role in space and the satellite industry.</p><h4><span></span>What have been your main contributions to developing R&amp;D in the sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MNAA</strong> Our strategy is to promote R&amp;D culture. This of course involves universities but  is also open to any institution that is interested in space. We have already managed to establish a research center at the UAE University in Al Ain, serving as a tool to bring students from the university as well as ideas from the outside to develop hands-on projects such as small satellites. We also supported the establishment of a research center at the Masdar Institute with YahSat, which offers the first MSc in space systems and technology in the GCC. We also have an international advisory committee with nine international space experts from different countries who come every year to the Space Agency to check on our progress. Additionally, we regularly collaborate with international partners and have signed agreements with most space agencies around the globe. We are working closely with education institutions to ensure that space science is introduced into school curriculums, and we continue to inspire the next generation of space pioneers.</p><p><span></span><strong>MMSM</strong> Today, the aerospace and space industries in the UAE are key drivers of the future economy. The UAE's investment in space technologies has already exceeded AED20 billion, including fixed satellite communications, TV broadcasting, mobile satellite services, and earth observation and data gathering systems. Yahsat continues to support the UAE's space ambitions through investment in research and development. For example, we invest in the development of our team, alongside Orbital ATK, through on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs for Yahsat engineers. Furthermore, to keep the space industry attractive to the youth of UAE, we collaborated with Masdar Institute and Orbital ATK to develop a specially designed master's program. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><strong></strong>How do you see Colombia's improving reputation affecting its tourism sector?</h4><p><strong>Miguel DIez Trujillo</strong> In 2016, 2.6 million people visited Colombia, which is a small number compared to major tourist countries with highly developed infrastructure. Now that Colombia has signed a peace deal, we expect increases in the number of tourists that visit the country. However, the main problem is a lack of development in infrastructure, particularly in beach areas. Furthermore, there are problems in communication; people cannot search for tourism information online, a factor that negatively affects the country's appeal. The government has to work on improving these infrastructural problems and enable Colombia to compete at the international level. Colombia is in the center of the Americas and allows easy access to the US and southern Latin America. This is particularly important for companies such as those from Spain with multiple branches and headquarters in Colombia. This strategic position also reflects the importance of infrastructure, as hotels and roads make Colombia appealing for companies. </p><p><span></span><strong>Juan Carlos Galindo de la Vega</strong> Without a doubt, the most important single achievement for the country in the past 50 years has been the signing of the peace agreement, which will bring enormous benefits for the country in general, but especially for tourism. It has been proven that the number of tourists who visit countries that have ended a conflict can quadruple within a five-year period. Colombia was a restricted destination during war times for visa issuing countries such as the US or France. Today, with the peace agreement, Colombia is becoming a more attractive country to visit, and this will surely increase the number of visitors, currently at a low level considering the wealth and destinations of the country. We are also seeing growing interest from foreign investors who want a presence in Colombia because they see its growth and development potential.</p><h4>Why was Cartagena chosen for Hoteles Estelar's new flagship hotel?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MDT</strong> We have strategic plans that will guide our actions for the next 10 years depending on the stability of the sector and the country. Our strategic plan includes an increase in hotels when the existing ones no longer satisfy the demands of the region. In Cartagena, we already have several properties. Using the experience we gained from building and operating other properties, we decided to build a corporate hotel in Cartagena. This hotel answers both demands that arose in Cartagena: a hotel for leisure and a convention center. It has 338 rooms, two restaurants, a swimming pool, and a convention center that can host 1,200 people. This building is a leading project of Hoteles Estalar because of its proportions and its location. Cartagena is a crucial city in terms of enabling Colombia to be competitive in tourism, and the government is promoting Cartagena as a top destination. The existing convention centers are on smaller scales and fail to answer the needs of the city. Cartagena can offer our guests multiple services in one visit.</p><h4>In which cities or regions do you see the best opportunities? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JCGdlV</strong> OxoHotel wants to continue growing in the corporate hotel business in the country's main cities in segments with unfulfilled demand; we analyze every detail in each market to determine the appropriate product for cities like Cali, Pereira, Pasto, and Medellí­n. We have also identified a great potential in the vacation market. As a result, we have created a specific division for this market to develop hotels to satisfy the growing demand of national and international tourists that see Colombia as a must-visit destination. We are currently building the first vacation property in San Andres, in partnership with the Spanish group Sirenis, which we will operate. We are in the process of securing more hotels of this type at the main vacation destinations in Colombia.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MDT</strong> 2016 was a good year for the company as we strengthened our position and took a big step with our project in Cartagena. However, we faced difficulties due to political uncertainties. 2017 will be an ambitious year for us since the peace deal has been settled and the tax reform has been implemented. In the coming months, the extent of the reforms will be much clearer. Thus, we are expecting a big development and have a big budget for 2017.</p><p><span></span><strong>JCGdlV </strong>We are optimist regarding the medium- and long-term benefits from peace. We expect to develop a tourism and hotel product in 2017-2018 that will allow us to meet the growing demand of tourists arriving here. The following years will be years of consolidation and growth. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can the palm oil sector contribute towards rural development and reintegration in the post-conflict era?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JENS MESA-DISHINGTON</strong> Colombia has a large territory, about 114 million ha. Of those, 43 million ha are suitable for agriculture, but only 7 million are being cultivated. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN has identified Colombia as one of seven countries with the greatest potential to grow in agriculture. When talking about post-conflict, in many cases, it involves rural areas. Colombia will develop via its agriculture sector. What I worry about is that public leaders discuss an urban model but do not have many ideas about opportunities in the rural sector. If we are discussing opportunities in the rural sector, palm oil comes first on the list as an important sector with many opportunities. The question is what does Colombia need to do to lure investors? A sector like palm oil can grow in Colombia; however, we need investors.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>CARLO VIGNA</strong> Taglianti  Poligrow is fully committed to the post-conflict era. We started to work in Meta, which had been 100% controlled by coca dealers. Local communities would be struggling to make a living if they were not involved in coca plantations. When Poligrow started operations here, we applied two strategies to improve the conditions of the local community. Firstly, we offered them job opportunities. Secondly, we created the Poligrow Foundation, which provides local people basic needs such as energy, electricity, and proper nutrition, while helping them to overcome difficulties. One of the pillars of Poligrow is to improve the quality of life in these communities. A second is to provide quality education and allow locals to secure a better future. We started different programs, not only training them for harvesting palm but also in other general skills. The project has produced 500 direct jobs and an additional 200 indirect ones. People are coming back to the area and witnessing the engagement the company has with the local community</p><h4>What is your outlook on how much the sector can grow in the short term?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JMD </strong>We agreed that we would not place any growth targets as that is a private sector concern; however, our goal is to have better conditions for investors. If we increase our growth rates, that is the best indicator that things are working well. When the rate of growth is slow, that means perhaps things need to be changed. We have had periods when this sector has grown over 10% per year. Many saw throughout those years how much can be done in Colombia. A sector like palm oil is great for a country such as Colombia, especially for its sustainability. The world demands more vegetable oil and there are many opportunities here. Colombia created at some point the conditions for this sector to grow, and if we do not do it again, others will.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>CVT</strong> The first African palm oil plantation was established in Colombia in 1960. The geographical location, climate, and conditions of the country made it an ideal location to harvest palm. Because Colombia has plains available for plantation, there is no need for deforestation to establish new crops. This characteristic allows harvests to be sustainable and environmentally friendly. Colombia is also in a strategic location to send palm oil to Asia through the Pacific Ocean and Europe across the Atlantic. Colombia is currently the fourth-largest producer of palm oil in the world. There is a great deal of potential for growth, especially regarding refining processes and manufacturing products derived from palm oil. This poses a great opportunity for the palm oil business sector to further invest in Colombia. An interesting fact is that to produce palm oil, only one-third of the land is required in comparison to producing other types of oil. This is an advantage because by 2050 the global population will be around 10 billion and arable land will be a primary concern. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are a founding member and president of the newly formed Cí­rculo Empresarial Odontológico (CEO). How do you hope to impact the Colombian dentistry sector? </h4><p><span></span><strong>Dr. Ciro Garnica </strong>The expected impact is a strong benefit for the health and wellness of our patients. We have different lines of work. We work to add value to the dentistry sector by positively impacting efficiency and productivity. Helping the development of dental tourism is also one of our main purposes. Colombia has defined medical tourism as one of the world-class sectors that will contribute strongly to the economic development of the country. By 2032, Colombia will be a global medical tourism power, and the dental sector cannot be unmindful of this reality. Dentistry in Colombia cannot turn its back on developments through new technological advances and global innovations, and we must be a leader in integrating these advancements into the sector.</p><h4>2017 is Figurella's 10th year in Colombia. What does this milestone mean for you and the company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Massimiliano Vallunga </strong>Having celebrated 10 years in the Colombian market represents proof that our brand and method have solid foundations through which we can face an extremely competitive market and target an audience as volatile as Colombia. Our aesthetics and general wellbeing compete with technology while our strength is mainly in services. This has allowed us to always go beyond the trends of the moment and be extremely concrete in our results and those of our clients. For us to have been able to consolidate our brand and be in the market for 10 years is just the first step toward a process of brand expansion, not only in Colombia but also in other Latin American countries. These 10 years have helped us to get to know not only the Colombian market but also that of neighboring countries such as Peru, Paraguay, and Panama. The abovementioned has allowed us to acquire a deep knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of our target while allowing us to understand how to adapt our method and concept to several rather different markets among them. All these learning processes have made us today a much more solid and confident group in our expansion.</p><h4>How was the first half of 2017? What are your expectations for its remainder? </h4><p><span></span><strong>CG </strong>Year after year, the Ciro Garnica Clinic has had double-digit growth. Taking into account the slowdown of the overall economy in 2016, when it only grew by 2%, as well as slow growth in the health sector, we had a conservative but fulfilling 5% growth for the first semester of 2017. For the second half, we have a greater confidence and optimism that the market and our own results will improve. In our plans, we continue to provide the best of services, improving our global visibility and prestige and innovating with new high-quality services and cutting-edge technology. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017-2018?</h4><p><span></span>MV Our priority is to open two new centers in Bogotá and another in Medellí­n. This would lead to a total of six points of sale in the country's two largest cities. Then we are evaluating the possibility of launching a line of foods with Figurella brand as a complement to our service. The combination of personalized physical activity (what we do at Figurella) and a correct diet represent the ideal formula for improving people's health and looks. This is what we have offered for 40 years in 18 countries. Finally, we want to continue with our project of expansion into Ecuador and Bolivia, two markets that we consider interesting for their growth, mainly in the capitals, because of their restricted offerings in said markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you meet the needs of the local market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MATEO FIGUEROA</strong> We get a great deal of feedback from customers, which we then feed back into our R&amp;D and product development processes. As a market, we have a clear voice on what we see and how we should react. Within the wider company, we have an open dialog about what is going on in our particular market. However, we also leave the R&amp;D process to the experts. In terms of what we do locally, part of our legacy for Colombia is driving social impact. It is not only about having the technology; it is also about what it is used for. Technologies have to be relevant to transform their use into, for example, better productivity. Therefore, we have local products such as HP Life. This is a program where we are trying to connect entrepreneurs—preferably from smaller cities—who need to sell, learn, understand, and network. We have brought in this portal so they can do all these things. After just a few months, 35,000 people are now connected to this network and learning new skills, such as accountancy and marketing, and are really learning to develop themselves and their business ideas.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>CARLOS BARAHONA</strong> When I started this company, everybody said I was crazy because we are in Colombia, not China or India. They couldn't understand why I wanted to invest money in the hardware and software market. However, we have a chance because PC Smart is trying to be a company that is neither expensive nor a clone. We want to be in the middle because what is the difference between a big brand and a local brand? Everyone knows who Apple is and not many know who PC Smart is. However, if you develop a new business and give the customer call center and website support then we can try to be the best solution at the best possible price. When low income Colombians want to buy a computer, it is because a parent wants to give his family the opportunities they never had. It is a social and economic investment. Students want the best solution between price and performance, so this is our strategy. We offer a high-end product at a mid-range price. We now want to open a new vertical in applications. One thing you have to remember is that PC Smart is a fast company—we are small but can move faster than larger firms. If those big companies need to make a decision, they deliberate amongst many people, whereas we can react quickly to the market.</p><h4>How are you continuing to innovate?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MF</strong> We face common challenges throughout Latin America. One is the currency; however, this has also brought opportunities in terms of how we innovate, what types of products are relevant, and how we bring products to this particular market. For example, we are rapidly innovating the form of our products and making thinner, lighter, and more powerful computers. We are bringing in technologies where you can print more for less at the same quality. The Colombian market is optimistic in certain ways. There are products that are young and fresh and a great deal of excitement about new concepts and products here; therefore, we are bringing the smallest multi-functional printer in the world into the Colombian market. There is much more to do and a large market share we can still gain.</p><p><span></span><strong>CB </strong>People now prefer to invest more money in phones than computers. This is why we are developing phones, but it's not an easy market. We have been learning for the past two years that it is a completely different market that moves quickly. The speed of the market is amazing and everyone is changing. The problem for a mobile phone company like PC Smart is that time and money is needed to develop the hardware and software. It takes a long time to prepare all the hardware and have the product to launch to the market. A company needs to invest a large sum of money, and if it does not develop the right hardware and software then it will be out of the market before it even begins. This happened with Blackberry because no one knows the future of smart phones. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities have you identified in Colombia? How do they differ from the rest of the region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LEANDRO FORERO </strong>Structurally, BHGE presence in Latin America is divided into geographical areas, and I lead the Andean region. Within this region, Colombia is the common center, which means most of our operations and administrative activities are located here. Thus, from a purely operational standpoint, Colombia is key because we run the region from here. In terms of the local market, Colombia is a country like no other in Latin America. We have probably the most diverse portfolio of customers. We have opportunities for companies to invest in Colombia, and we have many large, medium, and small operators. This brings a great many opportunities to those interested in working in the country. Considering the base of potential customers and the technical challenges that the country has, the potential is spectacular. In Colombia, there are things that are difficult to find in other places. Colombia, for example, has a wide variety of geographies, which require the most advanced technology in the world. The country has so many aspects that add to its potential in terms of the types of business that can be done and markets that can be opened. Colombia had one of the fastest responses to the decline in crude oil prices I have seen. So long as the oil price remains around USD45 a barrel, then we will see continuing investment and recovery.</p><p><span></span><strong>ANDRE VELARDE CHAINSKAIA </strong>Schlumberger has been in Colombia for 80 years, throughout the ups and downs of the industry. The oil and gas industry in Colombia is mature, and unfortunately like other parts of the world, it was severely affected by the declining price of oil over the last few years. Colombia's oil and gas industry began its recovery in late 2016 and now offers tremendous opportunities for offshore and onshore exploration, as well as international operations in gas. The industry here is unique because there is a diverse portfolio of operators. Although the overall size of the market is smaller than the US, the types of players are comparable to the US in terms of diversity. Following the merger with Cameron International over a year ago, Schlumberger now offers a comprehensive range of products and services, from exploration through production, and integrated pore-to-pipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance. These products and services, combined with our expertise, allow us to provide our customers with an integrated offering to help drill faster and reduce the cost of each well.</p><h4>What are your goals in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LF</strong> For BHGE, there will be many opportunities. Offshore is an area where technology makes a major difference, and we offer some of the most advanced and efficient technology solutions in the world. Every year, we invest hundreds of millions of dollars in inventing new technologies to maintain this position, and this makes a huge difference in the Colombian market. We implement the best technology to get the best results, and we ensure that those projects continue to thrive. The service market, both onshore and offshore, is competitive; however, offshore requires a much greater level of technical competency and that is exactly what we provide to all our partners.</p><p><span></span><strong>AVC </strong>We focus on bringing value to our clients. We are recovering from the challenges the downturn had brought over the last few years. During the downturn, forecasting activities as a manager was a totally different game. Now, we have steady activity allowing better planning, and the industry is buoyant again. We are actively hiring, training, and visiting students on university campuses. In addition, Colombia is also the worldwide support hub for Schlumberger human resources, legal, IT, and procurement and sourcing. Before the downturn, Colombia was probably the most mature oil and gas industry in the region. To rebuild, operators, service companies, and government agencies all need to work together to succeed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities did you identify in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Carlos Arturo Vélez Mejí­a</strong> The Panamanian group, first and foremost, saw potential in Colombia because there was only a small insurance penetration rate. This made it an attractive destination not just for the Panamanian group, but for the whole insurance sector. Another aspect was that we were specialized in civil liability and compliance, and President Juan Manuel Santos from the start of his mandate put a great effort into infrastructure. As a result, this was a great opportunity for the company to be in Colombia at the same time as the 4G projects and other infrastructure development got under way for the first time. </p><p><span></span><strong>JUAN CARLOS REALPHE G.</strong> One of the most important decisions in deciding to come to the region was the opportunity to increase the participation of the region in Lloyd's portfolio. Lloyd's is not an insurance or reinsurance company; it is a market with 82 members, so any decision needs the agreement of all the group members. The result of this consultation was the possibility of being first in Mexico and second in Colombia. Colombia was chosen for numerous important reasons. First, its geographical position is strategic for the rest of the region. Another is the economic performance of the country over the last 10 years, which has seen constant growth. Another is because the main reinsurers and insurers are currently present in Colombia. They have regional operations from Colombia making it a hub for insurance and re-insurance. This made Colombia a strategic place to be present, and we opened our office in June 2016.</p><h4>How would you characterize your presence in the market thus far?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CAVM T</strong>his is the beginning of our third year; however, the development we have noticed and experienced since arriving here is that Colombia is dramatic because we filled a basic need that no one else was offering. We are specialized in big projects and have a high level of standards, but we are still agile, providing services in a flexible way that serves the needs of Colombians well. In the first year, we were the 10th-largest company in the market; the following year we were the ninth—a position that we have kept. Last year was a fabulous one, even with all the difficulties and uncertainties of the market. Our goal is to grow in the long term. However, we have noticed that the penetration of insurance and banks is low in Colombia for a number of reasons because of the services they provide; people have low confidence in financial entities. Once penetration of the banking and insurance sector is higher there will be more appetite for the sector, and insurance companies must work hard to change its general view and generate the confidence needed to reach the growth we expect. </p><p><span></span><strong>JCRG</strong> It has been positive. For the future, our expectation is that it will be even more positive for the insurance market. Lloyd's has been leading the market in terms of innovation and new products. For instance, Lloyd's was one of the first reinsurers to cover the LATAM region for cyber risks, terror coverage, and contingency insurance for the cancellation of concerts and sports events. These are specialized coverage models and need specialized knowledge that Lloyd's can bring to the market. With the arrival of Lloyd's to the country, we will bring innovation, new capacities, and new knowledge in order to work with all the different actors in the market. The intention and vision of Lloyd's is to help emerging markets toward one specific but major issue affecting every emerging economy in the world: underinsurance. We have many challenges, like everyone. The insurance industry is passing through a difficult time; there is an excess of capacity, capital, and new actors. As a result, we have a soft market with low rates. Frequently, the rates are not enough to support the operations of companies; this is one of the main challenges we are facing right now as a sector. We are here because we are certain Colombia and the region in general have the potential for growth in underinsurance. We are also focused on educational activities to improve people's knowledge about insurance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your biggest strategies over the next few years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JOSÉ ANTONIO VARGAS LLERAS</strong> Here at Codensa, the company most responsible for energy distribution in Bogotá and the region of Cundinamarca, we have more than 3 million clients. We need to move fast in order to give them the chance to access new technologies and new possibilities related to energy uses and solutions. We are investing in all digital technologies related to smart cities, beginning with smart meters, which will enable us to control all our operations from a centralized system. We are also developing some new programs like those related to electric mobility, which are necessary to improving our environment. We are optimistic in the fact that the city will choose electric options for public transportation. Transmilenio should be electric. The new metro line will, of course, be electric. This is one of our main goals in Colombia, specifically in Bogotá. In the city, we are starting to work on distributed electricity; we have installed solar panels on our rooftop, for example.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>FEDERICO ECHAVARRÍA </strong>In general, the electricity and energy sectors are going through interesting times with all the developments in new technologies. For example, we are the global leader in energy storage. Technology is one component that is going to change the way we do business in the electricity sector. The other major change is the more active role that consumers will play—with smart grid and distributed generation, for example. AES, as a whole, is well prepared and positioned to take advantage of this changing environment. This is what we are doing in Colombia. We are trying to develop energy storage, as we believe this will provide an interesting solution to many of the transmission constraints we have in certain parts of Colombia such as the Caribbean coast. The development of solar and wind will also create great opportunities in Colombia. Finally, we need to get even closer to our clients and make sure we provide a full service to our clients, not only with Chivor energy, but with other types of non conventional energy and products.</p><h4>What opportunities are you currently pursuing? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JAVL </strong>Our group is developing new energy solutions for the entire Colombian market different from power generation. Most of these new services and products will be focused on digital developments for the grid. Solutions are being focused on the three main challenges our industry will face in the future: electrification, digitalization, and decentralized systems. We have also been working on the project connecting Colombia and Panama for 10-12 years. At times, it felt as though the project's construction was near, but at the moment I do not see a clear solution. This is a pity because we spent years studying the benefits for each of the two countries and regions. This is a project that will not only benefit Colombia and Panama, but Central America and possibly Ecuador and Peru.</p><p><span></span><strong>FE </strong>Colombia is a country highly committed to private investment. Colombians believe that private and foreign investment are key components to the growth and development of the country. The electricity sector works within this framework. Second, we have well-structured regulations. We have stable rules and a clear framework that allow players to understand the challenges and the strategies to implement. Third, the electricity sector participants have the same vision as the government in thinking that we need to grow using the most efficient energy. In the end, companies, the regulator, and the government all want to ensure that we have competitive, sustainable, and reliable energy. Finally, Colombia is a rich country in terms of resources: we have gas, coal, solar, wind, and hydro. So, all this allows a business environment in which every technology can compete. Accordingly, we have been promoting the idea that in Colombia there is no need to promote or support certain technologies; all of them are able to compete, including renewables, guaranteeing the most competitive, sustainable, and reliable energy for the end consumer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities are there in the finance sector in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JORGE VALDERRAMA </strong>In terms of opportunities, there are many in construction and infrastructure. The 4G infrastructure projects are large and comparable to Mexico's energy projects, which suffered from the decline in oil prices. In the region, this is still the main group of projects where we see many opportunities because BNP Paribas likes infrastructure. As a European bank, BNP Paribas also knows and likes product financing. We need to have international standards in developing our different toll roads for 4G. The same applies to the Bogotá Metro. Since BNP Paribas has participated in metro projects throughout Latin America, we have the expertise and knowledge. The other opportunity is related to capital and global markets. There are many opportunities in the development of Colombia's capital markets, though there are several initiatives needed to have asset managers be more sophisticated. These clients are mainly institutional investors, such as pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>WILLIAM SHELTON SALAZAR</strong> We will see a strengthening in business intelligence and the management of data in the finance sector. There are larger investments going on in these areas, in data management and client services. After all, the main aim of financial companies is to adapt and identify the needs of their different clients; that is what Multibank is also doing, understanding and adapting to the needs of SMEs and tailoring solutions for them. On a more macroeconomic level, the outlook is positive because Colombia has a great administration and a growth economy, one of the fastest growing in Latin America, and that means we have a many foreign investors doing business here, as well as local investors seeking new opportunities. We are open to new investments, and our inflation, employment, and infrastructure figures are all healthy and strong.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for Colombia? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JV </strong>The international financial community plays an important and necessary role here. The overall USD20 billion budget needs funding from every available pool in the world. We are also demonstrating the extent to which domestic banks can support projects with international standards. As an international bank, we also help to develop the financial industry in Colombia. Before 4G, the Bogotá Airport was the only project under a project finance structure. BNP Paribas is a kind of exhibit where international investors come to see and learn about the country. We hear from three to four companies each quarter looking at Colombia and seeing what they can do. The perception of Colombia has undergone a major change. At times it is unfortunate because Colombians probably have an image of their country that is not as positive as the one that foreigners now have. I do believe investment will continue to grow in Colombia. There are many opportunities in the country, and people from abroad are looking at them seriously. We track our reputation digitally, and one of the analytics tools we use shows a dramatic increase in the number of people and investors looking at us from abroad. </p><p><span></span><strong>WSS </strong>We have three main goals in the long term. The first is to strengthen the technological infrastructure and capacity of the company to create new and better opportunities for consolidating ourselves in the market. The second goal is to consolidate our business positioning as the leading bank in SME specialization in Colombia. The third goal is to develop and see to the needs of companies in Colombia with the support and backing of our Panamanian headquarters. We have a strategy that covers 2020-2021, which is to diversify the business. We want to be a business that helps companies export, and we want to create strategies to help companies export from here. We have faced various challenges here. The first were the technological restrictions in every area of banking. Procedures needed to change all around and technology needed to improve to serve the segment we wanted to serve. Second, we had to close all operations we had as a finance company so we could position our new brand as a bank. The strategy changed and we wanted to finalize the earlier business. The re-branding has not been completed yet, and we still have more to do in all possible channels. There is a high level of competition in Colombia's finance sector, and everyone has to keep repositioning in different ways. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the city's biggest strengths?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Juan Gabriel Pérez</strong> One of Bogotá's biggest strengths, and what makes us competitive, is its GDP and powerful economy. Invest in Bogotá not only represents Bogotá, but the entire metropolitan area, which includes 22 municipalities that interact with the city in a daily symbiotic relationship. In this case, what Invest in Bogotá has done is strengthen its proposal, looking for businesses that are competitive and generate jobs and economic development. The size of our economy is one of the most important factors to highlight; Bogotá represents one-fourth of Colombia's economy, but if we look at the Bogotá Metro Area, it represents approximately one-third of the country's GDP. In addition, Bogotá is a city where the middle class has emerged and today constitutes 50% of the city's population. With the size of its economy, Bogotá has an economical potential equal or higher than some Latin American countries such as Ecuador, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and Paraguay. Bogotá is a city with an interesting dynamic; in the last 10 years the city has been growing and is expected to grow above the expected 2-2.5% national growth rate, helping pull up the national economy, which struggles due to its mining-energetic dependency. This robust economy makes us attractive, and various international rankings see Bogotá as one of the most attractive cities to invest in in Latin America. When Invest in Bogotá started 10 years ago, América Economí­a placed us in 16th; today we are fourth. Currently, the city is among the favorite destinations for investors, and Colombia is the second-highest growing economy in Latin America after Peru. Up until now, Invest in Bogotá has supported more than 260 investment projects throughout the city and was the first regional agency created specifically to bring FDI to Colombia. In the next four years, through our Strategic Plan 2017-2020, we expect to identify more companies that will use Bogotá as an export platform, identify the anchor companies that are transforming the city, maintain and increase current investment, and support an additional 160 investment projects throughout the city. A decade ago, there were a little more than 500 companies with foreign investment capital in Bogotá; today there are more than 1,600.</p><p><span></span><strong>Marí­a Camila Salas</strong> Cartagena is well known for being the top tourism destination of Colombia, but similar to what we show investors in national and international locations, we are more than just tourism. Cartagena is also one of the most important industrial cities in the country, not to mention its logistics platform. We manage more than 60% of the container cargo entering the country and our strategy has been a strong focus on PPPs to show all the benefits of our strategic location for international companies to locate here. This enables them to access every Caribbean and Latin American market. What is more, our airline connectivity is growing quickly, which is also important for tourism and business. Our strategy has been to focus on strategic markets in strategic sectors where we are strong and can offer a competitiveness different from other regions in the country. The petrochemical, logistics, and metal sectors are part of this focus. We also focus on renewable energies; it is a sector we are just getting started in but will be important for Cartagena and the Caribbean. We are also working to promote Cartagena as the hub for country's growing offshore industry. Due to its benefits from a bay that remains open year-long, ships entering Cartagena that require repairs have access to the most important companies and services in the industry. This is precisely where Cartagena is working with the public and private sectors to focus on promoting the city as a hub in the region.</p><h4>What impact will the Tax Reform and post-conflict era have on Bogotá?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JGP </strong>Colombia is currently looking to be part of the OECD and this requires it to follow better and improved practices such as fiscal discipline. This is why the tax reform is a 'necessary evil' that will generate rules of play, which in many cases will be good. Even though it will affect many existing businesses, it will also incentivize new businesses looking to invest in Bogotá and level the playing field in these two scenarios. In regard to the post-conflict era, it will be a great opportunity for many foreign companies that did not have Colombia in mind, since factors such as violence will be highly reduced. This will help agencies such as Invest in Bogotá promote the country and look for companies interested in investing here.</p><h4><span></span>What is your long-term vision for Cartagena?</h4><p>MCS Cartagena is a logistics and distribution center for every company in Latin America, so we are focusing on making Cartagena the hub and logistics platform for all of Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Thrifty Lounge, and how does it align with Dubai's Smart City program?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Karunesh Arya</strong> Thrifty Lounge is another step toward providing a car rental experience at a different level. Traditionally, customers deal with the sales agents standing across the counter, make a decision, and complete paperwork, which takes about 20-30 minutes. We realized that many customers in Dubai like to deliberate on all the options and also involve their family in the process. We realized there was a demand to create an environment where families could come over and make their car renting decision in comfortable, family-friendly surroundings. This is how the Thrifty Lounge came to be. At Thrifty Lounge, customers are provided with lounge-like comfort while choosing their rental car. The lounges include free Wi-Fi, digital screens, and coffee to engage the entire family and make them comfortable. We have started with the first Lounge at Burjuman Mall and will add three more by the end of 2017. We are also adding digital catalogs and our systems are geared to ensure faster transaction time for our customers.</p><h4>How can corporate customers benefit from leasing a car?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Aswini Borkotoky</strong> There are significant benefits to leasing from a business point of view, which explains why so many local and multinational firms take the leasing path for vehicle acquisition. The core benefits include the fact that corporate lease customers receive favorable contract terms, and we can analyze their requirements and tailor agreements to their specific needs. Depending on the scale of their business, we can price accordingly. We look at providing fleet management solutions, which include registration, maintenance, servicing, replacement vehicles, and toll administration. This removes the need for a company to maintain an in-house transportation department and allows clients to focus on their core business. Businesses also do not have to deal with asset depreciation for the life of an owned vehicle, or the net loss when they sell it on. This is a stress we take off their balance sheet.</p><h4>What potential for growth do you see in the B2B part of your business for the next two to three years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>KA</strong> We see a significant opportunity in the B2B space, especially with upcoming projects for Expo 2020. We intend to strengthen our corporate leasing portfolio and add staff transportation as an additional service line. We are investing heavily in our fleet and technology to ensure we continue to offer the world's best renting and leasing experience to our customers. We have developed our propriety customer-to-cash system and are adding a customer portal to enable our corporate customers to have their fleet-related information available at the click of a button.</p><h4>How would you assess demand in the market and what are your expansion plans?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AB</strong> We are extremely confident in the appetite for the car lease sector due to population and tourism growth. Consequently, we expect that demand to keep growing. We have driven ourselves to become the most customer-friendly rental company in the UAE, and we strive to make each customers' journey seamless. We believe that once customers receive an exceptional level of service, they will become accustomed to the quality that we can deliver. Our future plans for expansion will always be dictated by our customers' requirements, be it advancements in the way that we balance technology with human interaction, or setting up new branches in locations to meet demand. </p>]]></richbody0content>

There has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of paperwork and most of the work can be dealt with via online portals and payouts can be made by bank transfer. Medgulf Group has decided to take this further to another level, so we developed our own advanced platforms. Becoming one of only two insurers currently applying a real online pricing tool, the rest of the players are still developing theirs. This is a substantial use of resources, and we believe it is the right investment in future technology. Online services and automation are coming into the insurance industry, and it is something we need to adapt to. Regulators have helped encourage the insurance companies to do this because the government is leading by example. </p><p><span></span><strong>JACQUES ALOUAN</strong> We are experiencing an unprecedented rate of growth in new technological developments in the healthcare space, especially around mHealth initiatives. This is causing major disruptions in the industry in terms of the democratization of healthcare by empowering patients to participate in their treatment decisions. Specialist organizations are playing a major role in introducing a wide variety of tools to feed this change and no single organization will be able to efficiently introduce such a wide range of technology. This is why our strategy is to supplement our in-house development capabilities by partnering with organizations that are offering a unique value proposition to the market and are aligned with our mission to improve the health of our members. As innovation and cutting-edge technologies continue to lead our way in a demanding industry, we have developed Automated Medical Rules (ARC) Engine with a unique architecture based on expert dictionaries comprised of coding, medical, pharmacy, and dental rules to automate medical and cost control measures as well as to digitize the entire claims life cycle. </p><h4>How are your products being tailored to the changing market? </h4><p><span></span><strong>SAM </strong>The Medgulf Group is known for its appetite across all lines of business. We are a company that wrote almost USD1.5 billion gross premiums across the region, and it is not favorable for us to be restricted to health insurance lines only in the UAE. We would definitely rather have a wider range of lines. We have established a solid relationship with the insurance brokers in the market, and we have reached out to around 45 registered insurance brokers in Dubai and intend to approach 25 brokers in Abu Dhabi since our recently attained HAAD approval. These brokers represent our sole distribution channel because we are not planning to build a direct sales force in the UAE. We intend to build special relationships with our strategic partners, and focus our attention on the service aspect of our business here. Instead of investing time and effort in building a sales force, we decided to divert both of them to focus on investment in technology to develop our level of service. Our brokers will be able to secure quotes online through our SME pricing tool, which in turn reduces the turnaround time so that companies can get an SME quote or a revision within a minute; also, a competitive turnaround time is pursued for large group pricing. Being the most recent company to join the market implies that we have to create a key differentiator from the rest of the players. We have focused on technology, our turnaround times, and deliverables that have put us on a separate preferred providers list with the brokers.</p><p><span></span><strong>JA</strong> GlobeMed is a Third Party Administrator (TPA) operating in the UAE and a member of GlobeMed Group operating in 11 other countries in the Middle East and Africa, with 26 years of experience. As a TPA, we manage healthcare benefits of insured members through separate arrangements with each of the insurers and healthcare providers. GlobeMed handles the full claims cycle including checking members' eligibility, generating automated medical coverage decisions, claims processing, adjudication, and settlement. We also assist members to ensure swift delivery of health services from healthcare providers. In addition to our role as TPA, our business model as system vendor provides payers—including insurance companies, public administrations and other TPAs—with access to our system to manage their members' healthcare benefits on their own. Of course, we offer them all the necessary training, user guides, and manuals. Companies working with us are offered solutions that ultimately provide the necessary balance between cost containment and the quality of service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you approach the Dubai market in terms of differentiating yourselves and the services you provide? </h4><p><span></span><strong>NAVIN M. VALRANI </strong>Originally, we were joint venture partners with the founders of Clima Uno Air Conditioning Industries, and we fully acquired the business in late 2015. We are currently operating out of medium-sized facilities in Dubai Industrial City, and we needed more capacity to scale up the business. Therefore, we invested in a factory that will be ready in 3Q2017. This brand has truly global potential, and our target market is far beyond the UAE. We will be rolling out globally and exporting products from our new factory all over the world. We will be participating in exhibitions in Italy and possibly the US. With Leminar Air Conditioning Industries going into India, potentially Clima Uno Air Conditioning Industries will be the next of our companies to enter that market.</p><p><span></span><strong>TARIQ CHAUHAN</strong> Facility managers are expected to reduce operating costs, maintain and improve service standards, help clients maintain an environment of compliance, strengthen safety standards, and bring in more sustainable practices in terms of economics, energy, and labor. There needs to be an ecosystem of understanding to make facilities management a feasible and effective tool, and to reach that stage will require more compliance measures and a stronger regulatory mechanism around the construction and licensing process for buildings. This stronger understanding has to be held at the stakeholder level. The ultimate goal for all is to reduce cost through increasing efficiency. We need to keep evolving and generate stronger convictions about the importance and value addition provided by facilities management. At the moment, there is a structural disconnect between how facilities management should be perceived, but we are trying to engage and educate people and clients on the importance of enabling facilities managers to achieve the goals of clients.  </p><h4>What should businesses be prepared for when doing business in Dubai? </h4><p><span></span><strong>NMV</strong> There are always places where you can manufacture with cheaper labor. Cheaper labor is a misnomer because you have to look at productivity. We find labor productivity rates in Dubai are extremely high, higher than in any other part of the region, and definitely higher than in India. This is largely because of the economic institutions that have been created by the government that make business easy to do here. You can set up a company in Dubai in less than a week. The approvals, licenses, and exporting procedures, along with the ports and airports infrastructure make life easy for business. On the face of it, you may feel you are paying a premium, but when you calculate your cost per unit of production, Dubai is one of the most competitive cities in the world.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>TC</strong> There is a shortage of skilled resources in the technical field. More and more people are coming out of education and opting for desk jobs rather than field jobs. At the same time, the construction industry is experiencing exponential growth and there is the potential to leverage technology to reduce the number of people that are needed in the field. Finding employees with practical skills is a challenge, especially as there are more facilities management companies in the region now. The other thing to keep in mind is that for many years, aesthetics were the most important aspect for architects, then there was a move towards prioritizing a new building's sustainability. The cost of managing both of these types of buildings is quite high. To reduce this, facilities management representatives should come in at the design stage and give critical operating cost and structural feasibility input, and how how these can be made more sustainable from a facilities management point of view. </p><h4>What are your prospects for the future? </h4><p><span></span><strong>NMV</strong> Al Shirawi Group's latest addition is an acquisition we completed in November 2016, entering the parking business. We already have a big service side to our business activities, with Al Shirawi Facilities Management, which is the largest private, local facilities services company in the city of Dubai. We also have the largest chiller service company in a joint venture with US Chillers. We see parking as an industry that is set to grow in the city of Dubai, and we have global ambitions for that business. </p><p><span></span><strong>TC </strong>Over the past two quarters, we have added a billion to our revenue stream. We had 100% client retention in 2016, and almost 25% of business has come through retained clients. In 2016 we will have grown 24%, but our contract backlog is growing by 32%. Challenges remain in the way facilities management is approached, but generally, the sector is on the right track. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sectors hold the most promising opportunities?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Shailesh Dash </strong>When Al Masah started six years ago, it assumed it would be involved in consumer-related segments like healthcare, logistics, and education, where it can provide services with value while assessing where demand will continue to come from. The reforms we are seeing on the back of the drop in oil prices is why we still strongly believe in healthcare, education, logistics, and retail. It is a great time to enter these businesses because there are many legislative changes that have had positive impacts on these segments. As a group we will continue to be in these areas, looking at investors' needs as they change with structural changes to the economy and the wealth that is being created. We will continue to tailor our products to the market's needs. The best businesses to be in today are sectors where you can add value to the economy, create employment, and provide quality services for the right price. That is what populations need, and this is what we have to create or invest.</p><p><span></span><strong>Rohit Walia </strong>Tourism is the country's biggest growth sector. There is nothing specific; we see a lot of hotels coming up, so the expected room rates are a little soft but there is a lot of demand and that is what HH Sheikh Mohammed's philosophy has been; if you create the infrastructure then people will come and use it, and this seems to be what is happening. Our airports are still seeing high levels of arrivals, which adds credence to this philosophy.</p><h4>What does a typical customer currently want?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SD </strong>They look at asset management as financial advice that will help them to diversify their wealth at a lower risk. Every institution has its own particular demand or need. For example, an institution might have had very low returns for the last seven years and might want to invest in alternatives or private equity, while some institutions might only want a fixed return and are therefore very happy with bonds or commercial real estate property. At the same time, some people might only want to invest in real businesses that they can see and feel to be growing, so they can be a part of it. We work with investors, high net-worth individuals, family offices, and young companies that want to be part of the venture capital or SME segment. This is why everybody is needed in the market, because there is space for everybody, whether it is an institution, a high net-worth individual, or a family office. Increasingly, we have seen a lot of bankers changing out of their jobs with the private banks and starting their own boutique firms because they believe the banks do not meet the needs of investor demand. Investors do not want to invest into a lot of debt products and do not only want to be involved with structured products. They want to be part of a real business where they can see and feel that they have a yield. These are the kinds of needs that are not being met by many of these private banks.</p><p><span></span><strong>RW</strong>: In every business, there are some good companies so there is not any one particular area that we are avoiding. In real estate, for example, there are bits and pieces that are doing very well, such as the downtown and canal areas, but there are other areas that are struggling. It depends on which business the client is in. Some of the commodity trading businesses are suffering, which has been a little dangerous due to the huge fluctuation in commodity prices. However, this is purely trading and does not affect the businesses that are driving the economy, per se. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you facilitating remittances to destinations where there is not the same level financial infrastructure as in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Osama Al Rahma</strong>: Financial inclusion is about having the entire ecosystem for remittances be transparent. For receiving remittances, we partner with the top regulatory financial institutions. In the case of India, we are connected to banks that are truly advanced in their adoption of technology. The country is one of the best in the world in terms of software engineering, and we find that their financial transfer infrastructure is setting global trends; for example, we use API with Indian banks, which is one of the latest technologies for exchanging remittances. The same trend is applicable to other receiving countries whose governments are paying attention to how these formal channels are contributing positively to their economies. For example, Pakistan developed its own remittance initiative that waives charges, and they have gained a lot of business by facilitating and encouraging formal remittance channels. We are looking to deliver what the consumers look for. This mainly relates to the adoption of technology and trying to provide what we call a personalized service that utilizes the technology that we have at our disposal.</p><p><span></span><strong>Sultan Al Mahmoud </strong>Our core business is currency exchange and money transfers for individuals and corporations. 2016 was a strange year but, at the same time, a good one. India has greatly contributed to our business because the people that used to send cash did not have any other option when the government decided to come out with new bank notes. These people were looking for an alternative to notes, so they moved to wire transfers, which is also something that a lot of regulators are encouraging instead of the cash payout method. There were some challenges during that time, but now it is business as usual. Dubai also remains a trade hub, and there are lots of tourists and traders visiting the Emirate. There are a lot of businesses here that import goods from China, Europe, and the rest of the world. Therefore, on the corporate side we deal with many local businesses and help them complete transfers to their business partners in these countries. Meanwhile, we also deal with a lot of financial institutions and buy and sell currencies from them. For individuals, we mainly do transfers for expats who want to send money to their home countries.</p><h4>What trends is the industry seeing in terms of technology systems?</h4><p><strong>OR </strong>There is widespread use of e-wallets in India, and the government has demonetized to further this shift toward digital payments. In 2016, the UAE published the digital payment law, which provides guidelines as to how each country should act. This is reflective of a broader change in the move toward digital and artificial intelligence-based products. For example, high-resolution biometric identification technologies are shaping the entire industry. Most financial institutions are engaging with this, which the regulators are aware of and developing a clear legal framework that can facilitate this development in a responsible way. Our sector as a whole is being enhanced—not disrupted—by technology, and we need to continue to develop this capacity for the benefit of both parties.</p><p><strong>SM </strong>Diversification and strategies that cater to this are key to our plans going forward. Our vision is to become a total financial solutions provider, but we are still in financial services and introducing new products and services. We are mainly targeting government departments and private companies that do collections. We assist those organizations, both government and private, to help them in the collection of their revenues. This is the main role that we are playing at the moment. We have partnered with the Dubai police and are appointing collectors to accept their fines and payments. Both the public and private sectors are very important for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your respective companies move to Zambia?</h4><p><span></span>NIMROD NJAMBA B. Braun needed a way to develop its business in Zambia. We began looking for companies in Zambia that would make good partners and could import B. Braun products and sell them to the private sector. Our products are typically imported via a local distributor and then sold to local hospitals. We also discussed the option of opening a subsidiary in Nairobi. The Zambia operations currently operate under the authority of the South African subsidiary, because southern African countries have a much easier time operating in Zambia. Despite certain economic challenges, Zambia has a great deal of potential. Zambia is open-minded, politically stable, and well located. Doing business is straightforward and easy. Such an atmosphere fosters development and growth. In comparison to our neighbors, we have a large population; therefore, our market has a great deal of potential.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>JACOB THORUP COHN </strong>Initially Missionpharma focused on supplying pharmaceuticals to Christian missions, primarily in Africa and in 1996 it began its first collaboration in Zambia through a local wholesaler, Ngansa Pharmaceuticals. Over the years the collaboration has expanded into a strong partnership, which culminated in early 2016 when Missionpharma acquired Ngansa Pharmaceuticals with the purpose of establishing Missionpharma Zambia. We believe that the right way to participate in the acceleration of the new Africa is to be nationally established. Countries in Africa are strengthening national skills aiming to be less dependent on outside assistance and subsequently there is an increased focus on national job creation, heavily supported by the donor community. Zambia has strong ambitions on the healthcare side, and it is not difficult to understand why the government wants money spent on buying pharmaceuticals to be circulated within the Zambian economy, through job creation and subsequently taxation.</p><h4>What products do you offer to the Zambian market? </h4><p><span></span><strong>NN</strong> B. Braun has more than 5,000 products in its portfolio, 95% of which we manufacture ourselves. In Zambia, we focus more on dialysis-related products. However, we also have dealings in general hospital care, including products such as anesthesia products, wound care, and surgical instruments. B. Braun does not manufacture in Zambia, and although we are unsure when this will occur, it is on the horizon. As a company in Africa, we want to have our manufacturing as close as possible. We currently produce in Johannesburg, and it is likely that a similar operation could open in Zambia.</p><p><span></span><strong>JTC </strong>Missionpharma has been predominantly focused on the public market, while Ngansa has been operating in both. The establishment of Missionpharma Zambia will see a continuation of the work in the public market, with an increased focus on the private market. Missionpharma Zambia is investing in building an equipment and service portfolio, which will both enhance the use of current equipment in the hospitals and also create national jobs. Instead of employing bio engineers from abroad, we will employ locally and train internationally when needed.</p><h4>How do you assess the domestic market? </h4><p><span></span><strong>NN </strong>We are approaching the level of care and quality that can be found in a European facility. If a government hospital has a B. Braun machine, then international standards of care are being met. We are almost on par with the region in terms of equipment and product offerings. At B. Braun, we seek to learn from the doctors here while simultaneously providing our own know-how. We support various Zambian medical organizations and associations by bringing in doctors from around the world to host workshops and seminars, and also support conferences through the Pharmaceutical Society of Zambia and the Anesthesia Society of Zambia.</p><p><span></span><strong>JTC </strong>There is domestic manufacturing ability in Zambia, and it offers a lot of potential, but several measures need to be put in place for this to be boosted. We are discussing the possibility of importing expertise to Zambia in order to train and foster local expertise. We have many years of expertise in finding ambitious manufacturers who are willing to do what it takes to exceed national expectation and reach an internationally acceptable quality, and we work with them to these ends. The future of the pharmaceutical industry in Zambia is not to supply cheap products that no one outside the country will buy. The future for Zambia is to build in-house capacity and develop an industry that produces quality products worthy of export. Zambia is keen to ensure quality and quality investments, and we hope that the Zambian Medicine Regulatory Agency (ZAMRA) will play a key role in this. There is also a drive to make ZAMRA an authority independent of the Ministry of Health. This will help to ensure quality pharmaceuticals are developed, and that there will be no conflict of interest when tendering supply contracts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your respective facilities developed over? </h4><p><strong>DR. CLARANCE CHILUBA</strong> UTH is embarking on a number of projects, particularly in the area of cardiac surgery. We have employed more staff to work in this unit, for example, to perform valve replacements, treat atrial septic defects, ventricular septal defects, and pericarditis infections, and install pacemakers. In addition to robust cardiology services, we are improving our renal services and offerings, as well as dialysis, tissue typing, and transplants. We have linked the renal unit to our infectious disease unit to mitigate against infections caused during transplants. Finally, we look to develop a plastic surgery and reconstructive surgery unit, as well as a burns unit.</p><p><span></span><strong>DR. JABULANI MUNALULA</strong> Since I took up the mantel as director, we have focused on specialty care, in particular surgical specialties, surgical oncology, laparoscopy, neurosurgery, and ear, nose, and throat, as we identified these as lacking in the public and private sectors. We currently boast one of the most active intensive care units, as well as one of the most active private sector operating rooms; therefore, we seek to increase capacity there as well. We are acquiring the necessary equipment for these fields, which, although an expensive process, is a necessary one. The other issue surrounding equipment is that there is a lack of corresponding technical know-how on the part of medical staff. It is necessary to train personnel, holding courses locally or sending staff abroad, and so on. However, this is an investment that must be made if we want to take healthcare in Zambia to the next level and properly develop our specialties.</p><h4>How has the structure of your services changed in line with expansions across the sectors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CC</strong> UTH is a large institution. In the past, it was managed by one entity, which presented a number of challenges in regard to the efficiency of service provision. Our future focus lies in developing centers of excellence, and we have consequently split up UTH up into several sub-entities, among these, the cancer disease hospital, the emergency unit, internal medicine, and surgery. In internal medicine, we have sub-divided into specialties such as a renal unit, a cardio and cardiothoracic surgery unit, and an endocrinology unit. Developing these centers of excellence will be the cornerstone of our eventual plan to make Zambia a medical tourism hub in the long term.</p><p><span></span><strong>JM </strong>We have a base of general practitioners, who we built almost to capacity and are the gatekeepers, funneling clients to specialists. There are two models: a hospital can either hire specialists, which is not always financially feasible for an institution, or it can partner with privately functioning specialists. At Fairview our strategy is a combination of both. In total, we have seven general practitioners and six specialists.</p><h4>How are you working with the Ministry of Health to increase access to healthcare across the country? </h4><p><span></span><strong>CC </strong>The ministry's commitment to health promotion and disease prevention is instrumental in the mission to widen access to healthcare across the country. We introduce sports days and health days to raise awareness about the importance of a healthy lifestyle in combating non-communicable diseases. We have also shifted our focus to working with communities, employing a grassroots approach to promoting healthcare. A directive was formed to look into the empowerment and social determinants of public health, and measures have been put in place to improve access to clean water and provide community nurses in all areas of the country.</p><h4>What are some of the remaining barriers to boosting investment in the sector? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JM </strong>One of the major obstacles we face as an institution is reimbursement. The government can do more to foster communication between reimbursers and providers. We have tried to form alliances as private hospitals to generate block agreements with providers; we have tried, as an alliance, approaching the Ministry of Health and seeking support. It would be beneficial for the government to even acknowledge that there is an association of private hospitals in Zambia, and empower us to be able to approach payers as a group to facilitate timely reimbursement for services so that the private sector can continue to provide the level of care our clients need. Another serious problem is the lack of qualified personnel. There has been a big push for decentralization, sending doctors and nurses to more remote parts of Zambia and so on, which in principle is a positive development. However, there should be a more strategic, integrated, and well thought out approach to healthcare personnel distribution. In the last six to eight months, with public sector staff relocating, critical gaps have been left in services, and that has hit us hard. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your ambitions for developing your respective companies? </h4><p><span></span><strong>PETER COTTAN</strong> Superior Milling aims to be the number-one milling company, and we want to take advantage of the government's new policy, supporting and developing value-added production, and diversify in line with this. We have plans to build a stock feed plant to supply small- and large-scale livestock farmers. By-products from maize can be utilized for the stock feed mill, making the whole operation efficient and environmentally sustainable. We will also build a wheat mill for similar reasons. We already sell flour to supermarkets, so it makes great business sense to replicate this model with wheat. Both of these mills will not be commissioned until 2018, because it takes 12 to 18 months to put up a mill; however, we already have the site earmarked for expansion at the Multi-Facility Economic Zone (MFEZ), and everything has been approved by Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA). The government will be our landlord, supplying the 4G-fiber optic, the raw water and sewage facilities, and electricity through a ZESCO 300MW substation, with a 100MW solar backup generator, funded by the World Bank. The other major benefit of us locating the mills at MFEZ is the tax-free concessions for five years under the program. Our new mills will be fully automated to improve capacity, speed, and efficiency. The costs of fuel and electricity are increasing to normal rates, so we look at all sorts of power-saving strategies and technologies and measures, right down to using LED lights and power factor ratios in the mills.</p><p><span></span><strong>DAVID BOSSE </strong>Our three main products are maize meal, flour, and animal feed, which have remained solid staples of our portfolio, with change only coming by way of how these are packaged or sold. For mealie meal, we have tried different variations; however, people remain sold on the traditional kind. Rather than buying one 25kg bag for the month, people buy 5kg plastic bags once a week, presumably because of ease of accessing the product. Zambia's flour market is typically a bakery flour market, and although we see more business with specialty flours and specialty breads, on the whole this is still an immature market, from which we expect substantial growth. Our feed sub-market has also been an area in which we seeing great growth. Although exports in eggs and chickens have dropped off, especially with DRC's recession, one of Zambia's largest trading partners, the five-year trend in the domestic market is for rapid growth. In 2016 we had a majority market share on feed and flour, and the biggest share in mealie meal, though since it is a highly fragmented market, this amounts to less than 5% of the total market.</p><h4>What measures need to be taken by the government and private sector to boost agribusiness in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PC</strong> Firstly, it is up to the government to create policies that are conducive to growing agribusiness. It needs to show that it supports value addition by limiting exports of raw materials and supporting the exports of value-added goods. We border eight countries, the majority of which import almost 100% of their goods; hence, there is a huge opportunity for Zambia to become an exporting nation. Furthermore, the suspension of maize exports needs to remain in place to boost reserves, although we expect the food balance sheet to show 1 million-ton surplus in 2017 owing to good weather conditions. Later, we could comfortably open up borders and reduce restrictions.</p><p><span></span><strong>DB </strong>The number-one challenge is inconsistency in policy: it is difficult for anyone in the industry to make a five-year plan. We are relatively low on the value chain, as a basic processor; for us to add value it is a matter of having the right priced raw materials to sell our product anywhere in the region. If our wheat is the right price, we can send 100,000 tons a year of flour to the Congo. This year, for example, there has been a great deal of talk about maize that was exported to Malawi, but early on in the year, mealie meal exports were banned. Therefore, the 500,000 tons of maize that went to Malawi could have been 400,000 tons of mealie meal. Typically, we export continuously to Malawi, even when there is no shortage. In maize meal the country probably has 150% extra capacity per year, but the policy blocked the value-added product for export, instead allowing raw materials to go out. This had a negative impact on the country's 40 mills and results in small short-term market growth. However, on the whole we are positive about the market: the population is growing, productivity is up, and with some policy consistency and a positive macroeconomic environment, businesses can thrive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the inception and development of Yalelo in the Zambian market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Bryan McCo</strong>y Yalelo commenced operations in 2013, and in five years has grown to become the largest fish producer in Africa. Zambia and several of its neighbors have a strong cultural affinity for fish, particularly tilapia, but local wild-capture supply has been depleted due to years of overfishing in lakes and rivers. This presented a commercial and social impact opportunity for Oakfield Holdings, Yalelo's majority shareholder, to establish a sustainable fish farm. It has been necessary to develop an integrated business model due to underdevelopment of the aquaculture value-chain in the region, including a hatchery, primary production, processing, distribution, and retail. As an example of strengthening the value-chain we recently partnered with Danish firm Aller Aqua to construct Sub-Saharan Africa's largest aquafeed factory. We received environmental permits in 2016 to increase production to 30,000 tons and are in the final stages of planning a significant increase in production for the second half of 2017. Thereafter, we expect to increase volumes by around 50% per annum.</p><h4>How did the partnership between Yalelo and Aller Aqua come about?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Adam Taylor</strong> Oakfield Holdings, the majority owner of Yalelo, realized that securing large volumes of high-quality fish feed was critical for its medium- and long-term aquaculture growth strategy. If it takes 1.5kg of fish feed to produce 1kg of fish, that amounts to 45,000 tons of fish feed for Yalelo's 30,000 ton medium-term target for fish production. It was clear that the local fish feed industry was not growing in line with our requirements. Oakfield has a proven ability to execute within the Zambian operating environment, particularly in terms of implementing international best-practice operations and project management. However, we do not have experience in fish feed production and, therefore, felt that a partnership would give the best chance of success. We found Aller Aqua to be an ideal match: the firm is one of Europe's leading fish feed producers and its board already saw the opportunities of long-term African economic growth, including demand for affordable protein in Southern Africa. In October 2015 we formalized the partnership and have proceeded quickly, with first commercial production from the Zambian plant on schedule for August 2017.</p><h4>What is the makeup of your distribution?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BM</strong> The majority of our distribution remains within Zambia due to the large latent demand; however, we do export to DRC and Malawi and anticipate that exports will lead volume growth on a medium-term horizon. To expand our geographic reach on the continent while remaining price competitive, we expect to establish an additional farm further afield in the next one to two years. Within the Southern African region there is significant room for further expansion of the production operation on Lake Kariba, and we are proceeding down that path.</p><h4>What opportunity exists to support smallholder fish farmers within the region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AT</strong> Smallholder fish farmers present significant commercial and social impact opportunity. We believe any scalable solution must be commercially viable. Smallholder farmers are a large potential market for fish feed from Aller Aqua and for fingerlings sales from Yalelo. Yalelo already works with local smallholder farms in the Siavonga area, providing the necessary inputs and then purchasing the fish upon harvest. This enables smallholders to focus on fish farming without needing to worry about breeding, cold-chain distribution, and market access. We intend to leverage Aller Aqua's significant experience in smallholder extension services in Egypt, where the firm sells approximately 75,000 tons of tilapia feed per year to small- and mid-sized farms.</p><p><span></span><strong>BM </strong>If Zambia continues to expand in this sector as it has done of late, then in the next five years there is potential for significant exports of fish from Zambia into regional markets. The aquaculture sector in Zambia is still small today but growing rapidly, and Yalelo is the fastest-growing aquaculture business in Africa. Given that the two most advanced fish feed plants in Sub-Saharan Africa will both open in 2017 in Zambia, it appears the requirements for a strong sector are falling into place. We also see significant demand in neighboring countries, meaning there is a receptive market for this increased production, too. From a foreign exchange perspective, the net effect of this fish movement will have a positive impact on the Zambian economy. This drive is very much a combination of the efforts of the government and the private sector. The Zambian government enthusiastically supports the development of aquaculture. Even President Lungu himself has established fish ponds at State House. The private sector has identified a market in Zambia for fresh fish, and as long as the government continues to create an investment-friendly environment, the aquaculture sector will grow as a result. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was Zambia at the top of the list of places where J&amp;J sought to expand?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Oscar Gutierrez</strong> Zambia was chosen as the natural center point of the Southern African countries in which we operate. Additionally, Zambia shows potential for future growth with its vast mineral and agricultural sector. J&amp;J Transport Zambia geographically forms part of the strategically positioned workshops, offices, and container depot that help us provide a full range of logistics services for freight. Over the past years the ease of doing business has been a further factor in operations within Zambia. The regulatory landscape and government agencies have positively affected the ease of doing business. Recently there have been some dramatic changes owing to the Zambian National Budget for 2017, which includes the introductions of tolls and increases in transport tax. We will only see the impact of those changes on J&amp;J in the coming months. Our team is committed to ensuring constant improvement and development of services to ensure our customers always have a competitive advantage. We pride ourselves on our health and safety, ethics, integrity, reliability, and proactive and open communication.</p><h4>What impact has Yendelela Trading had on the local economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Tembwe Mutungu Yendelela</strong>, which was founded in 2015, is the exclusive distributor of Bajaj products in Zambia and Malawi. Over 1 million Bajaj motorcycles are sold annually in Africa, making it the most popular motorcycle brand on the continent. In Zambia, Yendelela focuses on providing accessible and affordable transport solutions for rural and urban markets through non-traditional distribution channels. For example, customers within Monze district can purchase locally assembled motorbikes through agents supporting four sales points in the district. After-sales service and spares are accessed through eight Bajaj-trained mechanics, all at the customer's doorstep. Yendelela's innovation goes beyond distribution. Through an MoU with the Dairy Association of Zambia, modified auto rickshaws and motorcycles have the potential to change the economics of the dairy sector by making it possible for farmers to deliver milk to dairy companies twice a day. Previously, the high cost of transport meant farmers could only deliver once a day, losing any milk that had been produced in the afternoon. In urban areas, a variety of firms, from SMEs in the courier business to multinationals in telecommunications, are using motorcycles and auto rickshaws for marketing, goods and service distribution, and operations. In the past, this would only have been possible with the purchase of an expensive pick-up or bus, an unaffordable investment for most, with operational costs five or six times higher than a two or three wheeler. Today, Yendelela has Zambia's largest distribution footprint for two and three-wheeled vehicles, with coverage in four of Zambia's 10 provinces. The company's key differentiator is district-level provision of after-sales service and spares throughout the country, and customers outside the capital city appreciate having service centers within their province. The company aims to establish sales, spares, and service access in every province by the end of 2018 and in every district by the end of 2019.</p><h4>Does Zambia have the potential to become a logistics hub for southern Africa?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OG </strong>Yes, Zambia is geographically well placed on the map and is a logistics hub for Southern Africa. Zambia, although land locked, has the advantage of four different corridors, which in turn ensures the natural competitiveness between the corridors to secure the Zambian business.   J&amp;J is honored to have been part of the development and growth of the Beira corridor for over 20 years.   Beira is by far the nearest port serving the major centers in the region. Also, road infrastructure is continuing to improve, which will further improve trade, as well as harbor infrastructure, which has been upgraded. Now, international shipping lines are calling regularly. It is the historical, natural, and most cost-effective gateway serving Zimbabwe, Zambia, the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and Malawi. Zambia is still a relatively young country with great potential. Further development in road infrastructure within Zambia, specifically roads linking major areas of export and the Copperbelt will assist trade within Zambia. We are confident that road taxes and maintenance charges will continue to be directed toward improving infrastructure. J&amp;J Africa is positive about Zambia's future and will continue to invest in people and our infrastructure within Zambia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations developed in line with transformations in the industry?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Jonathan Lewis</strong> Largely, our business model has remained the same, though some of our services have become more popular. Our main business is loading and offloading cargo from aircraft, and most of our revenue comes from this part of the business, though in 2016 we saw a marked decline in imports and exports that we are currently still experiencing. Nac2000, by the nature of its operations, is highly sensitive to any changes in the economy. As soon as people stop importing, there is an almost immediate impact on our business. Having said that, currently we are optimistic about possible growth in agricultural exports and have subsequently invested a lot of time, money, and effort in the last five-10 years.</p><p><span></span><strong>Joseph Whittall </strong>Rather unconventionally, we first bought the aircraft before looking for the business. Our initial focus was on the charter process rather than seat rate schedules, and this had a direct impact on our business growth. After purchasing the aircraft we pursued routes that were more likely to use those aircraft. The mining industry is our largest client, which is odd perhaps as we initially targeted the tourism sector. It is perhaps indicative of the extent of Zambia's current reliance on the mining sector. We are in the process of trying to reposition our business to become more tourism focused, and we expect to diversify more over the next six months or so.</p><h4>How positive are you about the planned expansions in the aviation sector, and the impact these can have on tourism in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JL</strong> From an aviation perspective, Zambia is geographically blessed. Lusaka is just two hours from 15 different capital cities; hence, the potential for inbound and outbound travel is huge. The investments in aviation here are pushing us closer and closer to realizing this potential. We hope that there will be growth across the board in order to support and feed into this kind of investment. We do not want the developed airport to become a white elephant. Another concern is that we are spending USD1 billion on airport infrastructure, but failing to invest in human capacity and training. With the expansion plans, we might need a workforce of roughly 1,000 people; however, I am not aware of any programs that are available right now to train people to run those facilities when they are ready.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing Zambia's aviation and transport sectors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JW</strong> We realize that the problems with transport in Zambia, which in turn influence the tourism sector, are not domestic, but international. We have to solve the issue of getting people here cost effectively and directly. The loss of British Airways had an impact on that process. Currently, only Emirates flies directly to Zambia, which has an impact on international tourists arrivals. Furthermore, the Zambian aviation sector has been plagued by low volumes as we have tended to pursue the high-value, low-volume tourism. It is evident that backpackers today are the luxury travelers of tomorrow, and it is thus vital to attract the lower end, and likely return, customers. Aviation, however, requires higher seat occupancies to make it viable. That said, the flights are the enabler, and without flights we will never be able to build up the numbers in the first place. We are looking at working with a number of international carriers on a partnership arrangement that could assist this situation.</p><h4>How volatile are current volumes of imports and exports? </h4><p><span></span><em><strong>JL </strong></em>Extremely. Sometimes our total volume received per week can be 80 tons; sometimes we receive 747s full of cargo—roughly 60 tons—in one day. This volatility is also compounded by some of the carriers having their own network issues as well. There are airlines that do not operate to schedule, and also airlines whose schedules are cut overnight or last minute</p><h4>What are your most popular destinations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JW</strong> We have daily flights to Solwezi and to Kalumbila, and our sister company, the Royal Zambezi Lodge, charters us on a weekly basis to Livingstone to pick up clients there. We are expanding our services for Royal Zambezi guests, since we believe a strong collaboration can come of this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new ICT solutions are you planning to roll out across the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Charles Molapisi</strong> MTN Zambia is the only mobile operator to offer both 3G and 4G technology on a large scale. We have strong coverage in terms of LTE 4G network, excellent 3G coverage, and metro fiber. In Lusaka, our metro fiber runs right through the city, which allows us to connect enterprises and corporations and easily bring them onto the network. We have also invested in the normal fiber backbone, which comprises about 2,000km of fiber from Lusaka to the Tanzania border. This enables us to provide services to homes across the country. In terms of working with other industries, we have developed platforms to share music across the country, and we have also emphasized developing online and mobile entertainment packages. Our mobile money products are doing very well in the Zambian market, and we are looking to link up with insurance and financial services companies to make these kinds of things widely available via our network. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Sydney Mupeta</strong> In the short term, we intend to recover the fixed customer numbers we have lost. The kind of challenges we faced related to theft of copper cables resulted in the loss of a large chunk of fixed customers. The intention in the short term is to first address those existing customers who have been affected by copper cable theft, and then grow our fixed network to areas where we could not take it before, using fixed wireless. We are rolling out mobile and fixed wireless coverage across the country with over 1,000 sites, a project that should begin by mid-2017. As part of the project, we have deployed our first 18 LTE2300 Sites (LTE operating in the 2,30 MHz Band) in the Copperbelt, while the rest of the 172 sites will come with the main project. Here we are talking about 4.5G with shared throughput per cell of 250Mbps, and this sort of capacity can easily accommodate 300 customers simultaneously per site with a guarantee of at least 2Mbps. As part of the same rollout, we are also looking at another fixed wireless solution, targeting areas that are sparsely populated.</p><h4>Does MTN also work with large corporations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CM</strong> MTN Zambia's rich portfolio of solutions is the key differentiator between MTN and all the other industry players on the market. Along with our voice and Mobile Data offerings, MTN continues to deliver a rich range of cutting-edge products. In 2016 alone MTN Zambia launched: its 4G Home internet solution, now enjoyed by over 10,000 dwellings; global MPLS, which can now provide you with connectivity to over 150 countries globally and every town in Zambia; and APN/VPN, which provides secure branch-to-branch or device-to-device connectivity for your office WAN connectivity. MTN is now the partner of choice and is delivering the APN/VPN service to over 300 corporations in banking, mining, agriculture and other industry verticals nationwide. Through our machine-to-machine product offering we now have over 6,000 POS SIMs in the market and over 3,000 independently tracked moveable assets. The MTN Zambia cloud offering has over 120 specialized software services that include Microsoft 365, Cloud IVR, and backup/hosting to name a few. Through our mobile advertising and bulk SMS solution, MTN Zambia provides its customers with access to a massive market place at the click of a button. Through Mobile Money we can offer bulk payment solutions, automated collection services, and swift real-time cash transfer both nationally and internationally.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourselves from the competition?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SM</strong> The only real differentiation we can have is the quality of service. In a highly competitive market, where the competition is still playing out based on pricing, what is important is how attractive your service offering is. One of the most phenomenal shifts in communication technologies is the focus on data that is currently occurring in Zambia. In the past four or five months, our data has grown from about 4.5TB to about 13TB of data. Of course, this sort of traffic growth starts to impact your network, causing a serious strain, and we saw this playing out in terms of network quality deterioration. Because of this, we have been constantly on the lookout for expansion to maintain our network quality, which obviously correlates negatively with increasing traffic. We have an active team constantly monitoring quality of service and addressing quality issues to try and mitigate the impact on end-user experience. At first, to keep up with traffic, we started with adding all the resources we could to 3G, such as multiple carriers, but ultimately as the traffic becomes more than we can support, we will soon be scaling up to 4G even for mobile. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your mining line of business fared in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Ashwin Devineni</strong> Zambia has coal, and it will benefit from utilizing it. There is a fair bit of scope to increase coal-generated power operations in Zambia, and Maamba Collieries is set to expand into phase two of the project, by a further 300MW, since the transmission and water systems cater to 600MW. This should take just two years to complete once construction commences; however, we will only begin constructing once we have assurance of demand from a committed client base. The government, through the Ministry of Energy, remains committed to give the go-ahead on this expansion, since it will have a positive impact on domestic power generation levels.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Dr. Pius Kasolo </strong>In spite of all the difficulties in the sector, a number of the mining firms in our portfolio continued to invest in equipment to increase production and also to reduce the cost of production. In 2016, President Lungu commissioned the USD323-million Synclinorium Shaft at Mopani Copper Mine's Nkana shaft in Kitwe. The shaft will provide Mopani with access to about 115 million tons of ore at a grade of 1.9% copper and 0.09% cobalt. We are waiting to commission Ndola Lime's VK2 Kiln and have so far invested more than USD100 million in the operation. Ndola Lime used to be the only serious lime producer in the country, but there are new entrants into this market, which has forced us to compete. Obviously, the downturn in copper prices was a severe challenge; however, we expect an improvement in copper prices, with continued demand from China as well as what could be increasing demand from the US. What is more, there are a number of African nations with strong growth, above 5%, and we see these markets as places for serious growth potential.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing mining companies in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AD </strong>Mining companies in Zambia are not getting their due share of energy owing to the severe power deficit. On the other hand, ZESCO has been grappling with an asset liability mismatch in which the old power tariff to mining companies is no longer cost reflective. The Minister of Energy is spearheading a tariff revision, and we are hoping that mines will cooperate.</p><h4>What is the importance of PPPs for Zambia's future economic success?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PS</strong> President Edgar Lungu has recognized the importance of PPPs, and has even appointed someone at the state house to look into this. This is a start and will drive further developments in this area. We need jobs to ensure economic development, and we want to see this happen in any way we can. From the government's point of view, the best way to ensure jobs are created is to avoid 100% state-owned companies to allow private sector participation. From our point of view, we want to bring capital and grow businesses through PPPs.</p><h4>What lies ahead in 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AD</strong> First, we will roll out Phase II of the plant, which will be a full-time job in itself. ZCCM, our shareholder, owns 35% of Maamba Collieries and together both the Sponsors would like to usher in the expanded capacity in the near future. Nava Bharat Group has also begun diversifying. One of the sectors we have been looking at is agriculture. In fact, we are working to get the necessary approvals to commence preparation of 10,000ha for sugar plantation and processing in the northern province. Here we also plan to set up a plant that will use the sugarcane post-crushing to generate power.</p><p><span></span><strong>PS</strong> At the moment, there is a large gap in the energy market, and we want to explore how we can fill that gap. We have a few projects, such as Maamba, that we believe can truly be game changers in this area. Renewable energies, such as solar, also have a great deal of potential, and we plan to devote a great deal of time looking into ways to develop and integrate technologies that stabilize the grid so that there is always a constant supply of electricity. This might be something like a hybrid technology combining lithium battery power with the traditional solar grid in order to store energy and distribute it when it is needed. Finally, we also looking at micro-hydro power stations that can be installed in small river areas and provide energy to smaller communities and more rural areas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you positioned to enable new businesses to capitalize on renewable energy?</h4><p><strong>Jorge Vialette</strong> We are an investment fund out of London and are focused for the time being on Latin America. We invest in distributed energy, which is quite different from utility scale. This means that we own and operate renewable energy-generating plants that provide cheaper energy to the end customer.  Faro signs a contract with a commercial or industrial client and will build a plant (usually but not necessarily) on their site, always at our own cost. Our value proposition is that businesses can become more profitable by gaining access to lower energy costs from day one. Also, customers hedge against rising energy prices, while investing more predictable profits to expand their business and create jobs. Additionally, by consuming solar-generated energy, the customer is doing its part to protect the environment. As of today we have a presence in three regions: Brazil, which is its own region due to its size; the Andes, which looks at investments in South America focusing on Colombia and Peru; and Central America and the Caribbean. In this region, we began concentrating on Honduras and the Dominican Republic, as they are attractive markets with high electricity prices and also have important transmission losses. We recently started looking at opportunities in Panama and Nicaragua, and while we are looking at opportunities in other countries, these are the ones where we have been more aggressive.</p><p><strong>Hector Aguilar </strong>The region offers attractive potential business for every industry, which is a result of the growth of the middle class. That economic development has created a greater middle class that demands more products from different segments such as healthcare, transportation, and energy. Education is growing but is still developing, and these are the things that attract people. It is truly a combination of different things that make Panama the place to be and the place to have the regional OPEN office for Latin America. We are connected to almost every place in the world. Despite the problems that Panama has faced, it continues to grow, and growth is here to stay, despite challenges. The energy market in Panama is still a large challenge for the country because the cost of energy is high. People are still surprised by how much they pay. If the country truly wants to be one of the top hubs for new businesses, it has to be more efficient in the energy sector. As long as we can be more competitive, then we will have more business and attract more opportunities. On the other hand, green technologies are also great because if a country wants to be one of the best, what it does with the environment is also important; we cannot just be efficient without being green. That opened the sector, and is why solar and wind power production are growing so rapidly. Investors here in Panama are still the typical Latin American investor who wants to invest only in something that works. If they invest in a building, they get a good return that is safe and fast. Why would they invest in a new technology that they do not know about but that may give them a much greater return? Building a restaurant or commercial space used to be easy; however, now that market is shrinking, we must look at new alternatives to invest in.</p><h4>What are your consolidation and expansion plans over the short term for this region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JV</strong>  The strategy is to retain balance. Our balance through geographic diversification is part of what makes us very attractive. For example, we invest in markets with large populations with immense room for growth while also investing in smaller investment-grade countries. Several countries in Central America, for example, enjoy a fully dollarized economy, which is very attractive for our investors. Our investors also enjoy wide project diversification, as we have developed the knowledge to invest efficiently in small- and mid-sized projects starting at 100kWp.</p><p><strong>HA</strong> We have three areas in the company: fundraising, project management, which is all about assets and product identification, and business development. We do not want to "just invest the money;" we want to be part of the management team that develops and grows something. If we invest in a solar panel company in Europe or sign deal for products and distribution in Brazil, we want to be part of the board of directors. That is our strategy to secure the right control and maximize returns; we want to ensure that the money is being put to good use. We focus a great deal on fundraising currently. We will then focus on asset management and business development as we can start selecting those projects and businesses to invest in to create capital appreciation and generate income for our stakeholders. <br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key growth areas in the Zambian market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Jason Ullbricht</strong> We primarily focus on two key segments: the mining industry and utilities. When the copper price was at its peak, we benefited from key strategic accounts, such as First Quantum Minerals. In addition, because of the supply of our products through local partners into the market, we also saw growth in our business to smaller scale mines. In 2015, we saw a slight decline in this segment, though our overall business grew from 2014 to 2015. We attribute this growth to the presence we created in-country, namely our strong relationships with local partners and end users. In 2017, mining will continue to be a focus area for Schneider Electric, as will our dealings with utilities. We intend to grow this business primarily through local companies. Complementary to that, we also focus on growing our client mix in the food and beverage industry. This too we focus on doing through our local authorized partners.</p><p><span></span><strong>Yahaya Yunusa </strong>Puma Energy Zambia has been expanding in the retail business in the last few years adding new service stations, and rebuilding some of the old stations, such as the one in Livingstone, copper belt, and in Lusaka, to consolidate and gain more volume out of those strategic locations. We have a budget and target to expand by at least three new stations and three new affiliates every year. Puma has earmarked in its 2017 strategy some strategically located sites within Lusaka that should come on-stream within the year. As for products and services, being a downstream oil marketing company our most popular product remains premium petrol; however, we have also seen steady growth in diesel sales. We sell our fuels through the retail segment, which has about 40% of our business; however, Puma Energy is also a major player in the B2B segment, which includes mining and lubricants, supplying mainly gas oil and lubricants to bulk and industrial consumers of petroleum products. Some of our largest clients include Zambia Railways and Zambia Sugar. We give these companies products on credit, at agreed rates, and they pay us after the duration and expiration of the credit. The B2B market is highly competitive, and it is vital to provide the lowest prices, especially on bulk purchases; otherwise a company is in danger of being encroached by competitors. Puma is also the market leader in aviation, with over 70% of the market in that segment. We have secured contracts with major airlines such as Emirates, KLM, Ethiopian, Kenya, Proflight, and Executive Airlines. Puma Energy supplies the 3 main airports in Zambia, being KKIA Lusaka, Livingstone and Ndola international airports.</p><h4>What are your plans for the coming years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JU I</strong>n 2017, our strategy will be to focus on the traditional side of our business, and then, in addition, to engage more with the end user to understand where the OPEX opportunities are. Following the power deficit, load shedding, and drop in commodity prices, many in the market faced some challenges in 2016. However, on the flipside, many companies cut down on CAPEX and instead spent on OPEX where available. This, therefore, became an opportunity for some, including ourselves. At Schneider, we have a wide product portfolio, allowing us to provide various solutions. For many of our clients, this includes secure power, power factor correction, and energy efficiency solutions. We encourage our customers to undertake energy audits of existing installed bases to understand where their energy inefficiencies exist, and then recommend some of our solutions to resolve these issues.</p><p><span></span><strong>YY</strong> There are a few gaps in our operations that we need to work on. In particular, bringing more services to our filling stations will give us the edge over our competitors. For example, we will install POS machines and improve on the Puma Card offer for cashless customers and also add value for our fleet customers. We are currently discussing innovations regarding mobile money transfers, since we see this as a dominant trend in the market. Puma Energy will consolidate on its value proposition at the stations, mainly the enhancement of customer service within the forecourt, shops, and the various eateries in partnership with international brands, located within the stations. All of these initiatives fall within the area of non-fuel income, and it is an area pinpointed for growth and also consolidation. Apart from increases to our retail network, we have also added value to our service stations across Zambia. These stations are managed through dealers and franchises. Today, we see ourselves as providers of a service, and our network represents more than just the filling stations from the past. We have led the retail segment for a long time in Zambia, and intend to keep this mantel by consolidating our business here, investing where we can to refurbish and modernize stations. Our strategy for the next two or three years will be more aggressive on the retail segment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the LuSE performed over the last year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Priscilla Sampa </strong>Over the better part of 2016 market activity was characterized by less than favorable trading patterns, induced largely as a result of pre-election political uncertainty and a weakening kwacha. However, the market demonstrated resilience toward the close of the year owing to the strengthening of macro-economic factors. In addition, the Ministry of Finance made significant policy changes that will encourage an influx of FDIs that will boost the market's performance. Furthermore, there is a governmental drive to encourage SME growth through credit reforms that will allow smaller enterprises to forge partnerships or joint ventures with larger, international companies, and this is anticipated to provide additional impetus to the market's performance. The initiative will certainly build capacity and inject capital into the exchange.</p><h4>What was the motivation behind the establishment of the SEC?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Phillip K. Chitalu </strong>The SEC was set up in 1994, prior to the establishment of the LuSE. We were formed by an act of parliament, making us a statutory body. In 1991, after the liberalization of the economy, the government wanted to pull out from several Zambian companies and needed an avenue through which to divest these entities. The stock exchange was the obvious platform for this, but there was the need for the kind of facility that would have regulatory oversight, hence the creation of the SEC. When the government finished selling off most of these entities, the financial landscape in the country changed, becoming much more private-sector oriented. Our current role still involves a great deal of liaising with private entities, engaging them in alternative ways to raise finance.</p><h4>How can innovation in Zambia be encouraged?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PS</strong> Innovation is more easily expressed when the availability of financing to support research and development as well as new technologies is not restricted. While I am confident that we will see increased innovation in Zambia, the lack of access to finance that start-ups encounter must first be overcome. The LuSE offers a clear solution in this regard, and has witnessed increased enquiries from companies about the requirements of listing on the exchange. We, therefore, educate companies on how to draw up business plans and the different products available on the exchange. As a market, we hope to be able to provide the capital new ventures need to expand their businesses.</p><p><span></span><strong>PKC</strong> There is a strong belief that we could be selling the wrong products, products that are not targeted at our market and that have kept levels of participation low. As a securities regulator, we should be wary of the capital environment with which we are dealing: In Kenya, for example, mobile solutions flew off the shelves because the market was extremely receptive to this type of finance model. However, in a credit-type environment, cash-dependent products are likely to flop. Looking back historically, offices such as ours were set up, and set up well, by institutions like the World Bank and its IFC; however, in the process we were issued a standard security product and not one that was accurately tailored to our business environs.</p><h4>What are your upcoming priorities?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PS </strong>First, we plan to broaden the options available to companies that want to trade on the LuSE. We want to grow brokerage and investment bank presence across all of Zambia's provinces, and already engage with banks to increase trading activity and product offering. We also look to introduce several additional instruments to offer on the market, such as deposit receipts, exchange traded funds, and special securities to add to the usual portfolio of equity or bonds. We have entered into discussions with the government about making available certain instruments that could help more SMEs get listed once they are capitalized. We have also run a successful radio program in partnership with certain listed companies, as well as a TV program that explains the basic principles behind investing, and several forums on SME development to better inform people about the differences between money and capital markets.</p><p><span></span><strong>PKC</strong> The SEC is implementing a strategic plan that runs from 2015 to 2018. With this, we have set goals to ensure that people are geared to invest in the market and that their investments are properly protected. Our outreach objectives include radio and other media campaigns to educate people about the safety and benefits of investing. It is possible that without disseminating that type of information, schemes will not take root and people will lose out. This is a key strategic objective to ensure a transparent market that people can trust, which will ultimately lead to growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you developing your business, and how do you assess innovation levels in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Nitesh Pate</strong>l One of our most creative recent projects under consideration is a plastics scrap plant, which is a nod to our efforts to be more environmentally friendly, and to source products that are compliant with international standards from suppliers also working to lower energy emissions. The idea is that anyone who has scrap plastic can bring it to our plant, where we can break it up and use it as a raw material to produce certain kinds of commonplace products that do not need to be aesthetically attractive, just practical and robust. This is just one of the ways we seek to innovate in our businesses. In Zambia, more generally, while entrepreneurial spirit and innovation levels are tremendously enthusiastic, projects often remain paralyzed in the embryonic stages owing to a lack of proper planning, implementation, and execution. One of the major constraints for start-ups and other small businesses is a lack of support in terms of capital be it in the form of debt, equity, family capital, or crowd funding, and whether from the private sector or public sector. </p><p><span></span><strong>Mohamed El Sahili </strong>In the FMCG sector, we have developed our operations to have more than 10 filling lines producing carbonated and non-carbonated drinks. When we bought Fairy Bottling in 2009, the company only produced one stock-keeping unit (SKU) of mineral water. Now, in addition to producing Aquasavana, the number one mineral water in Zambia, we also produce more than 12 SKUs of carbonated drinks. We designed our factory to have the only fully automated canning line in Zambia. In the healthcare sector, we are building a hospital under the company name Medland Health Services, and also produce pharmaceuticals, non-pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment under our subsidiary Pharmaland. In retail and leisure, we have two projects underway. We recently delivered the concrete phase on our pastry café, which will be the biggest in the region, and will soon begin construction of Villagio, the first shopping mall designed in the style of a village in Zambia.</p><h4>What are your expectations for growth in the near future? </h4><p><span></span><strong>NP</strong> 2017 will be a difficult year for many businesses. The IMF's intervention in March is a cause for concern across the board, since it will mean tightened government spending. This adverse economic situation has only emphasized our need to diversify more in Zambia, specifically in agro-tourism and manufacturing. However, in the short term, we see copper prices picking up gradually and this being the main foreign currency earner, will somewhat give a boost to the economy. We understand there are new mines opening up in the DRC, which bodes well, since mines are multi-million dollar investments and do not appear overnight without a thorough analysis of the extractive sector and future price prospects. There is, however, the danger that once the copper prices start rising, the country will again fall into the trap of "grabbing low hanging fruit,“ focusing its attention on the mining sector predominantly because of the great benefits it provides employees, local suppliers, revenue authorities, and other stakeholders. The zeal to diversify the economy to agro, tourism, energy, and manufacturing must continue together with the necessary infrastructure build-up. </p><p><span></span><strong>MES </strong>We launched the Vision 2020 in January 2017 with the aim of catering and delivering services to everyone, right across the spectrum, in Zambia. Fairy Bottling produces quality products that are available at low cost. For example, we produce water in bottles as well as in cups, which are cheaper, with a lower grammage of plastic. Our energy drinks are not targeted, like traditional energy drinks or the middle class, but are priced much lower. We entered this market in 2016 and our energy drink has since been classified as the fastest-growing consumer drink in Zambia. In the healthcare sector, our services are for everyone: from VIPs to regular treatment. The medical services are of course the same, but the VIP experience is of a higher hospitality quality. Negotiations on our tenant mix for our mall are underway; we want partners who cater to the low, middle, and high class in order to create a balance. Around 80% of the space will be reserved for public use: gardens and recreational areas, with free Wi-Fi. All our projects will be launched between now and 2020. Work has begun on the electric and mechanical works at the hospital, though it will be a further 12-14 months before it can be opened. Construction of the Villagio begins in March, and will be operational within roughly one and a half years. Our patisserie will open in June or July 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your profile in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Tsidi Tsikata</strong> The IMF has good working relations with Zambia, and in recent years the focus has been on providing policy advice and technical assistance in a wide range of areas. In our press release at the end of the October 2016 mission, we noted that the economy was suffering from the effects of external and domestic shocks, including low copper prices and electricity shortages. We also highlighted that an unbalanced policy mix had contributed to the difficulties facing the economy. In particular, while government revenues were falling short of expectations, spending was well above budgeted levels, leading to increased borrowing and a large accumulation of arrears. Concurrently, a tightening of monetary policy succeeded in stabilizing the exchange rate and lowering inflation, but the tight liquidity conditions, combined with the accumulation of government payment arrears and the slowdown in economic activity, put enormous stress on the private sector and the financial system. The main challenges facing the authorities is the achievement of a more balanced policy mix—fiscal tightening to allow room for some easing of monetary conditions—and creating the conditions for sustained and inclusive growth based on a more diversified and resilient economy. </p><p><span></span><strong>Ina-Marlene Ruthenberg </strong>We have a portfolio of 21 projects, which are a combination of national IDA lending and regional IDA lending, and some trust fund operations. The cumulative total of these 21 projects is over USD900 million, a significant amount, and we are even expecting to grow further, following the positive outcome of the IDA18 replenishment negotiations. We will still await the new IDA 18 envelope for the next three years, for which we expect an increase of up to 70%, which means an envelope of up to about USD600 million. Zambia is an IDA country (benefitting from the soft loan window of the World Bank Group), transitioning, after meeting key criteria, to IBRD. The Zambian government has been paramount in this evolution, and IBRD will permit Zambia to have access to more financial resources. Because of this, we are fortunate to be able to implement a variety of projects in different sectors, though we are primarily focusing on water, energy, the environmental impact of mining, and on agriculture—including climate change resilience. Finally, we have recently expanded human development programs, including social protection. </p><h4>What actions must be taken by Zambia in order to reduce the country's fiscal deficit?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TT </strong>In his budget speech to parliament in November 2016, the Honorable Felix Mutati laid out clearly the economic challenges facing the country and how the government was going to address them. The theme of his speech was very apt, "Restoring fiscal fitness for sustained inclusive growth and development." Achieving the objectives he spelt out in the speech requires strict controls to limit spending to available resources, and lower public debt (measured in relation to GDP) from its current path to a sustainable trajectory. In view of the debilitating effects of government arrears on the financial system and the economy at large, it is critical that the government exercises better control over its spending to ensure that while it clears the outstanding stock of arrears it does not create new ones.  <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>IMR</strong> We need to recognize that Zambia is once again facing the challenge of a high national debt and the high and growing cost of servicing the debt is crowding out developmental expenditure. Zambia has switched from a reliance concessional debt to tapping the international debt markets, including USD3 billion in Eurobonds, and this has made the portfolio riskier. The rapid depreciation of the kwacha in 2015 highlighted the country's exposure to foreign exchange risk as the debt to GDP ratio shifted above 50%. From our perspective as a Cooperating Partner, this is disappointing, since Zambia benefitted significantly from the multilateral Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt (HIPC) initiative in 2005. However, we are increasingly confident that debt can be better managed and a first step would be to develop a clear debt management strategy. The debt issues are linked to repeat fiscal deficits, so what can be done to reduce wasteful or poorly targeted expenditure? Recent budgets have included unsustainably high levels of subsidy, especially in the fuel and electricity sectors where the government has set the prices and tariffs below what it costs to deliver them. Now though, we are pleased to see the Ministry of Finance addressing these, in particular those subsidies that have benefited segments of the population that did not particularly need government help, most notably the costly fuel subsidies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your role within the business community developed since being established? </h4><p><span></span><strong>John Paton </strong>Since launching in February 2015, we have noticed enthusiasm and support on the part of both the private and public sectors. The British High Commission has also played a significant role in terms of access and facilitation. We have had an active 18 months since organizing our first event in April 2015, which was sponsored by Standard Chartered Bank. For example, we have held about 14 or 15 speaker events on topical and relevant themes related to trade and Zambia's operating environment. These are always popular, as they offer opportunities to network, as well as space to analyse the economic and business developments in Zambia. Our turnouts show there is a demand for such in-depth, up-to-date analysis; on average we have around 60-130 people in attendance. In general, we are a small operation, but we always look to stimulate the conversation. Our database comprises about 540 contacts, with about 10% of these as members, from across 450 to 480 companies. </p><p><span></span><strong>Johannes Kurt </strong>The AHK is the largest bilateral chamber is Southern Africa, with 600 members in total, and an increase in membership of around 1.3% per year. Approximately 400 of our members are based in South Africa, 100 in Germany, mainly from the private sector, and the remaining 100 members are spread across the region with strongholds in Namibia and Mauritius. The AHK opened its office in Zambia in February 2016. It is a prerequisite for companies that want to become members to already be engaged in investment or trade relations between Africa and Germany. The German Chamber is a point of contact for German companies that are trying to access the Zambian market and who need initial contacts, advice, and market information. With companies that have been active in countries like South Africa, Mozambique, or Zambia for a longer period of time our role is more about interest representation and in some cases the mediation of conflicts. We have a code of ethics that companies sign when they join the chamber covering anti-corruption and money-laundering issues. We have 35 German companies based in Zambia, among them multinationals such as Bayer and BASF, but also engineering companies like JBG Gauff who are successful in the field of rural and urban infrastructure construction management.  </p><h4>Why are British companies interested in what the Zambia market can offer?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JP</strong> Zambia usually ranks within the top five or six best countries to invest in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that is partially because of its abundant resources such as copper and water reserves, its access to markets, being surrounded by eight countries, and because it is one of the safest and most peaceful countries in the region. The Zambian economy might not be the best in the world; however, we have seen sustained—and for the most part substantial—growth since the turn of the century. I hope the new government will continue to seek greater engagement with the private sector, since it cannot patch up the holes in the business environment single-handedly; it cannot continue to subsidize fuel and agricultural production, and so on. An outward-looking approach would encourage investors. According to almost all foreign investor perception reports, the pre-requirements to create the right investment climate in any given country include political stability, predictability, access to labour, both skilled and unskilled, reliable power and water, and the ability to remit dividends or foreign exchange, and these are defining factors of Zambia's business landscape.</p><p><span></span><strong>JK</strong> Many companies are attracted to the political stability and vast potential of Zambia's resources. There has been talk of diversifying the economy away from traditional mining, and increasing activity in agriculture, agribusiness, manufacturing, food processing, and packaging. In addition, with more companies entering the market, it is a necessity to modernize in order to compete, especially with relation to South African players. The German industry not only has the technical solutions but also the training expertise to offer Zambia, and that has been a USP for many German technology providers. In contrast to this potential, however, the financial situation remains highly challenging in Zambia: the banking sector is fairly flat and interest rates are sometimes prohibitive. Therefore, we advise companies to come in with their own financing solutions to offer long-term payment options. That said, companies already active in other parts of Africa find adapting to the environment and network here relatively easy. Over the long term, Zambia has been one of the biggest success stories in Southern Africa, experiencing rapid growth from 2005-2015. Despite the economic downturn Zambia and the region have seen from mid-2015 onward, we see stable development and political calm here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you combine and balance an international curriculum with local traditions and culture?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VANESSA WHAY </strong>The British system has a strong curriculum that constantly changes and adapts to the needs of the student population. The British government is ready to adapt the educational system to provide the necessary skill sets for students to flourish. Therefore, the flexibility and dynamism of the British system, around a fundamental core of investigation and the concept of learning to learn, is what makes this system truly stand out from other systems. We believe that learning should be a lifelong skill, not just applicable to the classroom but to life. At the same time, there is a rigorous assessment. Children know where they are and they know how to benchmark against a standard that has got a strong global reputation, and that is important for our international parents. The British curriculum is an exciting curriculum too. In primary school, it is a creative curriculum, as close to real life and the surroundings as possible. We have room to adapt to suit the local culture and environment, as long as we stay true to those certain core values at the heart of the British system. In addition, we are governed by the Ministry of Education and are obliged by law to have Panamanian studies in the curriculum.</p><p><span></span><strong>ANDREW MELNYK</strong> We are an International Baccalaureate (IB) school, part of a worldwide system of schools that has been serving students all over the world for more than 30 years. Our curriculum is prescriptive, rigorous, and prepares the kids to go anywhere in the world. We want to be a part of that group so that students arriving here from anywhere in the world can easily fit in to our school and vice versa. Whether you are coming from Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, Canada or the US you will be welcome. Parents who travel or are diplomats or businesspersons can come in for three years or so and if they must move to another country, they can always find an IB school with no effort. Therefore, we believe in the IB system; it is a solid, well-developed system where kids really learn and are ready to enter universities anywhere in the world. Our approach to learning is modern and progressive and works for the kids. Our graduates are not only global citizens but are comfortable in all situations anywhere. Overall, it is an excellent system.</p><h4>What are your respective plans for expansion and consolidation projects?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VW</strong> We are fully renovated and at full capacity. We will build a purpose-built campus in Clayton in the next three to four years. We are seeking permissions and licenses with the government now, but we do have land in Clayton. We opened in Clayton, we have a reputation in Clayton, and it is the perfect location. It is important to ensure that parents who started with our school there have faith in us there, and with over 350 children a school does not just up and move somewhere else. It is also one of the most beautiful parts of Panama City. The school will embrace the local environment too, and we seek to develop a school without causing too much environmental impact. We will finish our fifth year, which is a big target. We will start our first English secondary education certificate (IGCSE) group for exams. Our debate team represented British education and Panama in the Pan-Am Debate in Argentina too, and those are all big milestones for the school. And then the biggest milestone that we look forward to is our first batch of graduates in 2020.</p><p><span></span><strong>AM </strong>We are looking closely at opportunities in Latin America, In fact, Latin America is our primary focus in terms of our business strategy. Our business development manager is actually located in Colombia because Latin America is a main focus, and we are always busy exploring other opportunities for KSI in the region. Part of it is growth. We have met with the French Lycee to discuss how we can cooperate with them on the new campus by doing things like sharing the football field, tennis courts and swimming pool that would be built on campus. Our short-term plan is to purchase the land in the next year and to get an architect to draw up the initial plans. There are models in other parts of the world where two schools share a large campus, and it works well; both schools benefit significantly and have reduced costs. This is what we hope to achieve. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of the agro-industrial sector in Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RAFAEL DEL RIO </strong>The territory Latin America North is one of the fastest-growing areas in terms of agriculture, given that it covers a vast group of countries, from Peru to Mexico. Syngenta LATAM growth will be supported by the development of this territory. Today, we are seeing the retreat of years of drought; hence, the opportunity for a fast agricultural development. The main land scape of this territory is made up of small holders who do not have the same opportunities and financial resources to acquire technology as larger producers.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>JAVIER A. MONTEMAYOR</strong> Panama is a country dedicated to services. The new generation does not study or dedicate itself to agriculture. The young people of Panama see their future working in services, logistics, industry, the canal, banks, or other service-related activities. The previous governments did not invest in agriculture or agriculture education, and the country is lacking good laws and programs for the development of the sector. Panama has not developed agricultural product exportation, despite having the potential to produce rice, coffee, sugar cane, melon, and watermelon. Beef production is great, because all the cattle in the country are 100% natural, since pastures are the principal food of our cattle. Coffee is an important product for export, but it is for special varieties. The normal varieties are used for national consumption and special varieties are reserved for export.</p><h4>In which specific regions are you seeing an increasing demand for new products? </h4><p><span></span><strong>RDR</strong> Mexico is the largest country in my territory of operation, and it is growing and doing well. We have high market participation. In Mexico, the greenhouse vegetables segment is growing particularly fast as it supplies the US market. In addition to this, Mexico needs to produce more as the country imports a great deal. The second-biggest country is Colombia and now that the government has signed a peace agreement, a large amount of extra land can be brought under cultivation. The government has to provide the right infrastructure: roads, ports, legal framework, and access to financial resources in order to incorporate this land into production. Cuba can be mentioned as well. If the embargo ends, there are nearly 2.5 million hectares that can be incorporated into the global market.</p><p><span></span><strong>JAM P</strong>rovinces of Azuero (central provinces) and the province of Darién. This is because there is a lot of land for development not currently used for agriculture production. The province of Chiriquí­ has better land, but its cost and value have increased, due to the development of tourism and housing. The potential for land in Boquete is incredible for agriculture, but the value at this moment is increasing because of ongoing tourism development projects. The Stockton Group always sees Panama as being a major logistics hub, not only for Latin America but the world. For three years, Stockton developed a logistics company for Latin America in three steps. We have a warehouse in the Colón Free Zone where we label and dispatch our products to Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Honduras, Costa Rica, Mexico, and all of Latin America. Stockton is also developing a new project focused on aquaculture. In Panama, this project is dedicated to the production of organic products for the reduction of diseases in shrimp and the cultivation of fish. Stockton has a solid team of developers and scientific researchers.</p><h4>What are the main targets and ambitions Syngenta has set for 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RDR</strong> Our vision is to continue growing in a profitable way. Our main target is to achieve our ambitions under our Good Growth Plan, as it is really what makes us proud of our work and our company. The Good Growth Plan is related to how we bring about sustainable agriculture. The population is growing fast and there is no more land. We have the means and need to speed up the introduction of technology in order to feed the world. This is really the most important goal for us—to act fast and in a way that is sustainable. Syngenta is an activator that boosts the performance of the agricultural sector in different economies in the territory. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the opportunities currently available for architectural firms in Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Eduardo Quintero </strong>There is absolutely a great deal of opportunity for architects here. Panama is a young country and, therefore, new ideas are continuously required to expand the economy. So definitely, an architect who is altruistic can meaningfully touch many people in Panama.</p><p><span></span><strong>Gustavo Arango</strong> For a country that has been growing rapidly for the past eight years, Panama has a large inventory of different types of projects; therefore, this is the moment when only the smartest strategies are rewarded. We are busy because our focus has always been on having innovative projects and being focused on niche markets. We found many clients seeking that approach because if companies do not differentiate their products, they will not do well.</p><h4>How does your firm contribute to developing innovative architectural projects in the local market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EQ </strong>We are a unique office and not representative of all architecture firms; in our office, we are committed to our goal to only do architecture that will make us and our society proud. We always pay attention to urbanism and sustainability and only take on projects where architecture is a key ingredient to success. Typically, architecture here in Panama is just seen as an obstacle to development; however, we only take on projects where architecture is the main ingredient of success. In general, we try to do architecture that pursues an artistic and a social component. We are successful in being able to marry both; sometimes it is difficult to have an outcome that can both improve lives and also improve the quality of the discourse of urbanism, architecture, and art. Where we can accomplish those things, then these are the projects we take on.</p><p><span></span><strong>GA</strong> We like to believe we help improve people's lives. Relevant design should be about improving people's lives in the same way that we as consumers value things. We do not only purchase things based solely on aesthetics and looks, important as this is. We purchase based on performance and fulfillment of brand promises. Architecture is the same: if a beautiful and innovative buildings leaks every time it rains, then you have failed in the most basic requirements. Architecture should be about improving people's lives and not just appealing to the aesthetic. From day one, we have always been about service; we are client-focused, which is not usually the case with most architecture firms, we are interested in buildings that exceed our clients' expectations. As it is, the market requires that people be attuned to details: 90% of all the projects we do come from repeat clients. We have been investing for 16 years in tailor-made services and solutions for our clients.</p><h4>What are some of the key projects your firm has been involved in?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EQ </strong>The Calle Uruguay project is a seed project and it is important that it is successful to demonstrate its importance to those who resist the idea of widening the sidewalks at the expense of cars. This is particularly important given the introduction of the metro system in our city. The cost of the metro project is close to USD6 billion, which is more money than was budgeted in the expansion of the canal. Therefore, our project is essential to support the people emerging out of the metro stations to walk in the city. Calle Uruguay is centrally located in the vicinity of the metro system. We are excited about not only meeting this transportation necessity, but also the promise of creating spaces for social interaction that will humanize society. This will be a catalyst for the private sector, the public sector, and for people to change their behavior and lifestyles.</p><p><span></span><strong>GA </strong>We designed most of Buenaventura, a premium Panamanian beach resort, and are still working on similar such projects. In Buenaventura, we are currently developing an oceanfront property with 19 units that will each go for USD1.5 million and all units but three have been sold. It is the only beachfront property in what has been so far built of Buenaventura suitable for an apartment building because all the others are independent houses. The time where every project found a buyer is over; for projects to be successful they require the utmost care and developers need to have the best of reputations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your app benefit your customers?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Alan Rosell </strong>We offer a tailor-made service that does not involve contracts; our app is a distribution service for trucks but without long contracts. Customers are free to decide when they need someone professional who can provide a great service; this is the first benefit for the market. On top of this, many companies do not want to purchase a truck. Our prices are within the price range of the market; we are 10% higher than the market price and for this slightly higher price we provide a much greater service. Large companies are also able to meet urgent requests when they do not have trucks or drivers available so SMARTRANS is a great solution for larger companies as well. Our app has been extremely well received; the public acknowledges it is a great product and idea, while entrepreneurs are impressed with the product and the solution it provides.</p><p><span></span><strong>Juan Pablo Restrepo </strong>Uber has been a strong player in Latin America by revolutionizing the concept of mobility. It has been amazing to see how Uber has been accepted in all the countries and cities we have expanded into, from Brazil to Colombia. We are now in more than 20 cities. We were initially focused on Santiago in Chile and are now focusing on expanding our presence not only in the capitals but also in secondary cities: we have launched an aggressive expansion plan in Central America, delivering this reliable transportation for everyone in the world. In the last three months of 2016, nearly 200,000 people used Uber in Panama. If we compare that to the population of the city, this is a high penetration rate. We are keeping our promise; we are committed to delivering a quality service and making it available to everyone. We are expanding our service to more people and communities and are reaching different neighborhoods and areas such as the west side of the city. What we really want to do is help the city and country become connected.</p><h4><span></span>What strategic partnerships and alliances are you establishing in Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>A</strong><strong>R </strong>In October 2016, my partner and I decided to invite the same partners of Truckslogic and presented the product to them. Everyone wanted to be a part of this, and we quickly received funding. We are doing well with those partners. We have to position and prove ourselves in Panama and understand how to win the market. When we have the trust here, that will be when we enter another country and seek other partners. The moment we need more money is the moment that we will enter a new country. When we created our product we put it in a niche, a cluster in B2B. We have to do it for B2C as we have the platform and understand the work; this is the moment we have to go to the consumer. </p><p><span></span><strong>JPR</strong> We are working with COPA to manage a certain amount of activities that promote new destinations through our app. We also partnered with the team of COPA and allow our riders to earn miles through trips. We have formed partnerships with different banks, and there is definitely more opportunity for people to use the platform and get joint benefits for credit or debit cardholders. Our partnership with Banco General is another interesting thing we have done in that regard. We have several ideas in the pipeline for campaigns with insurance companies like ASSA. We have partnered with a large number of people because Uber taps into every single need that people have.</p><h4>What are your targets, priorities, and ambitions for 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AR</strong> We will change the way the sector does business. One example is inverse logistics, where 80% of trucks come back without cargo and this is one opportunity to improve the sector. Also, we have a product that responds in real time and also tracks the roads, bringing many benefits that will change the sector. Our platform will change the ways we work not only in Panama but in other countries. This is our objective and the sector gives us the opportunity to understand that we are here to help our clients.</p><p><span></span><strong>JPR </strong>My wish list is to complete the mission of delivering transportation to everyone everywhere. We would like to increase the amount of daily users and convert the occasional riders to far more regular ones. There is an instilled car ownership culture in Panama for three reasons: it wasn't expensive, the city was designed for cars, and people want to own them. We are encouraging people to think twice before deciding to use a private car. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of your success stories in the sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Jorge Iribarren </strong>In Panama, there are many companies that offer hybrid fibers; therefore, we decided to work on a company that only focuses on optical fiber. The pillar for any company is great connectivity; reliable fiber optics is fundamental and we have been able to successfully develop fiber optics, especially in the capital. Today, there are no tools in the system that are better than fiber optics and that is what we offer our clients: permanent connection. If a company wants to connect various branches it can do so, no matter if it is in the interior of the country or in the city center: this is the service that we provide. Moreover, we provide internet access dedicated internet-based fiber-optic infrastructure. We also work in maintenance and are working on two aspects for fiber optics. The first is on growth and space; the goal is to have the fiber network grow by 200km every year. When a company installs a fiber, it also has to maintain it and use specific equipment to develop and boost the connection. Every year, there is a growing demand for high-speed service; therefore, every year we have to invest in equipment that gives us better performance.</p><p><span></span><strong>Moises N. Abadi</strong> We became the sole provider for the Internet Para Todos initiative in 2009 because we had the right technology and experience to be able to do a rapid deployment of stable service across the country. We have over 3 million registered users and hundreds of thousands of users connecting to the network every month. The initiative is extremely important, and we believe it has made a significant difference. We have seen the results over the years; students, people with special needs, and people with no access to connectivity were able to participate in the rapidly advancing world as a result of Internet Para Todos. The project has significantly changed the entire country. When we created the solution for Internet Para Todos, we sought to extend the reach as much as possible. It is a business; at the same time, a company has a bigger responsibility when it participates in such initiatives. We sought to get the system to as many people as possible. Places in the interior such as Santiago and Aguadulce are becoming hubs in Panama and some of it has to do with the fact that we gave people in those cities access to global knowledge with Internet Para Todos.</p><h4>How do you generate greater create awareness about your brand and the benefits to a potential user?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JI</strong> We seek clients who want a permanent connection, clients that need to be connected 24/7. We work with those who truly need continuous access to the internet to provide excellence of service and reliability. In 2017, we focused on new client expansion we have been working a great deal on the creation of the network and its expansion. Internally, we want to have the best product and this is the message we want to share with our clients. We have also started to educate the markets; we promote this in the media and on the radio, and will launch a new digital promotion. We will promote our services in the interior of the country as well. We are here to provide a quality service for our clients.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>MNA </strong>A decade ago, we started selling the WiMAX modems in the supermarkets and people could buy them, plug it in, and have access to the internet. We now have the next version, an auto-provisioned service. Customers can purchase it with a credit card and it activates itself. For broadband home service, this is peculiar because it is not seen in many places. We have had many visitors from other countries come in to see what they can replicate in other cities. In Panama, we also saw an opportunity and sought a way to provide access similar to Internet Para Todos that would be commercially sustainable. We decided to create an entire platform called Wigo that allows us to use segmentation and location to create a live portal based on different features taking place at the moment. People do not go onto websites anymore and if companies truly want to communicate with customers we give them enough room in the portal that they can use to promote their services. We have 1.4 million users right now and 8 million connections a month. It is a large network with a great deal of activity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did the company decide to enter the Panamanian market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Daniel Chanis </strong>About 12 years ago, BWSC was constructing, designing, and operating independent power plants in the country and was also an independent power producer (IPP). For example, BWSC built, designed, and operated the power plant for Pedregal, of which we still own 10%. We are a one-stop shop; we do EPCs and IPCs, we design, build, and operate power plants all over the world. Two years ago, the previous manager had a vision to open a branch in Panama. We operate power plants all over the world, but do not have a branch in any of those places. We find people, allocate the resources as per clients' needs, and take care of it from our headquarters. However, we saw an opportunity to open a branch in Panama, from which we could service Central and South America and the Caribbean.</p><p><span></span><strong>Elio Palacios </strong>We see Panama as one of the best-kept secrets in the region on several levels. Panama has a great business environment. Many companies want to be in Panama just because of its geographical location and it is easy to do business here. This is a friendly country when it comes to investment and establishing an operation. If a company comes here with the right attitude, perspective, and legitimate goals, doors open and people are willing to cooperate. If a company comes to Panama to create and develop business sectors and markets and provide a good employee base for the country, the environment is supportive, especially the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The SVF Group works to ensure we are more efficient in leveraging the benefits Panama offers. For example, we store parts and equipment in the Colón Free Trade Zone and do not require extensive infrastructure in Panama City for our operations.</p><h4>Where you see the greatest potential to expand your operations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Dc</strong> The greatest potential to expand our operations is in fact right here in Panama. With the new canal, waiting times will be a little longer than before. Even though there is an additional channel, the increase in transit will overcome the volume that the canal can handle and that waiting time will mean we can do more work on engines. Typically, ships and shipping companies do not want to waste time on getting work done. However, with greater waiting periods, they will be more open to getting that maintenance and engine work done. The greatest opportunities are here.</p><p><span></span><strong>EP</strong> Definitely Panama and Costa Rica in the Central American region; Mexico also presents an important opportunity for the group and we continually monitor any updates to NAFTA since this may encourage Mexico to turn elsewhere for its business development and commercial allies. We will have to align our strategies to capitalize on any opportunities.</p><h4>How do you shape your competitive advantage, maintaining a leading position in the local market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DC </strong>We are a famous brand, with the highest reputation for quality. The Panama market is competitive, saturated with several large players; however, competition pushes a company to excellence, and without the competition a company might start to get sloppy in terms of quality. It is still a challenge to be competitive in terms of providing great quality, and that is the objective we have set for ourselves as a high-quality service company with competitive prices. Price is important too, but it is not the most important thing; it is more about delivery times and the quality of the product a client receives. If they get what they paid for, the company has done well. We send people all over the place, doing work all over the Americas, Venezuela, Peru, the Caribbean, and Mexico. We want to use Panama as a hub to expand out into the Americas region.</p><h4>Will the recent expansion of the Panama Canal have a positive impact on SVF's operations given that the marine industry is at the core of your business?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EP</strong> It will have a positive impact because there is more commercial marine activity taking place in the sector. The canal expansion has opened up the opportunity for an additional port on the Pacific Coast. A new port would bring more logistics and commercial marine activities here and they will require additional equipment and support, which we continue to service with our marine brands, such as MTU and Scania. In terms of the operation of the canal itself, SVF supports around 140 engines and generator equipment in the canal today. We support the canal with all our different brands and equipment. Our technicians are certified because of the nature of the brands we represent and the Canal Authority requires this from suppliers for such support. The canal expansion has and will definitely continue to have an important impact on our business and in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us more about your company's CSR work?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Jorge Azcárraga</strong> We have a commitment to the country and in everything we do we want to improve it. As part of this we have gone into social responsibility programs starting with our own workforce. We found we had five or so people who did not know how to read or write and other staff who were living in dwellings without concrete floors. For the first few years of our CSR program we worked to resolve these issues for our own employees alongside a parallel strategy to help the wider community with these educational and housing issues. We want people to know that Cemento Interoceanico seeks to improve their world and the country. We have launched several programs around the area. We have used our products to improve schools, roads, and pavements. Internally we also want to make it an enjoyable place to work. Cement is a dusty product to work with, but our idea is to treat the work environment more like a chocolate factory, so it is as clean and dust-free as possible. We have made a commitment to have dust levels lower than the government standards.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Rosmery Aguirre G. </strong>When we develop a new project, we focus on interacting with local communities as much as possible. For example, we hire mainly locally. This allows us to make sure that locals feel like the projects we develop are theirs. We also donate different types of materials, especially recyclable material, to the municipalities where we operate. For example, we donate the material that is not good enough for our high quality projects to local communities so that they can use it in local roads. Finally, we also organize social events in certain communities where we are based on a regular basis. We are currently building new sanitary batteries for the IPT educational center in the community of Chilibre.</p><h4><span></span>In 2014-2015 cement production in Panama dropped by 7.5%. Has this trend changed since?</h4><p><strong>JA</strong> The canal expansion consumed most of that production and in fact there was a cement shortage. From 2H2014 and into 2015 some clinker had to be imported to meet the demand. In 2013 Cemento Interoceanico was in expansion mode because at that time the cement industry was around 2.3 million tons per year in Panama. Our facilities are grinding facilities: we take clinker and grind it to produce cement. During the market turnaround Cemento Interoceanico was able to capture market share at a time when the industry was going down. We have lost about 4-500,000 tons as an industry. So although Cemento Interoceanico has gone up, the cement industry in Panama as a whole has gone down. This means it is now a more competitive market here. Plus, as a company we have had to rapidly reinvent ourselves because we started out with a focus on structural cement to supply all the infrastructure projects that were going on in the country. The demand for ready-mixed cement was high. However, the demand shifted quite quickly and we had to change our business model to focus on more stable products and those targeting sustainability.</p><p><strong>RA</strong> Our main customer is the state, though we also operate with private companies. For the coming year, we see plenty of opportunities with the government; we participate in large projects and there are other major ones lined up. For example, we bid as suppliers of hot asphalt mixture with Superpave technology for the tenders of the extension to eight lanes of the highway from the Bridge of the Americas to Arraiján, and also we will bid as suppliers for other important projects for the country like the extension of the Panamericana highway from Chorrera to San Carlos. We hope to be a mix provider for whoever wins this project. We still need to further develop our concrete products in order to become even more competitive. We were just focused on covering the basic needs as well as the asphalt mix. At the same time, our approach to the competition is based on investing in new technologies. In the last few years, there have been great developments in the mixtures of asphalt and concrete in a country that was just focused on basic things. The government has been pushing for that. For example, mixing asphalt with certain polymers makes the asphalt more resistant over time and has less impact on the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company evolved in Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Olivier Nanzer</strong> We have been based in Panama since the 1960s and are exclusively focused on wealth management here. Outside of Switzerland, the bank has three main divisions: wealth management, which is the core business; asset management for the institutional side; and investment banking. We are still the only true global wealth manager. We have clients around the world and, in 2016, we generated over CHF40 billion of net new money in our wealth management businesses. At the group level in 2016, on the net revenue side, we generated CHF3.3 billion in net profit. So humbly speaking, we have had great results. We cannot be complacent, however. Market conditions are difficult, both in terms of cost pressure and in terms of volatility. In times of uncertainty, some clients are reluctant to invest or increase their activities. With the challenges of 2016, we focused on generating value for our clients and providing diversification in this volatile and constantly changing global climate, without forgetting our shareholders and employees.</p><p><span></span><strong>Paulo Miguel Filho </strong>We focus on cross-border transactions across all Latin America, mostly M&amp;A, hence our name, Kreuz, which is the German word for cross. Panama is the perfect location for us to cover North, Central, and South America, as well as the Caribbean. It is also a business-friendly country and has great infrastructure from which to operate and is extremely well connected, which makes travel less expensive than other countries. Our founders have Swiss citizenship in common, while each of us is a citizen of a Latin American country as well. We have been based in Panama for several years now and have extensive experience in the region. Since M&amp;A opportunities in Panama are limited and well covered by established local players, from here we can look at the entire region, mostly Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and even Brazil, despite their economic and political crises, as many multinational organizations have or are settling their regional headquarters here in Panama. There are also many opportunities in Central America and the Caribbean, where we already have certain projects in the pipeline as well.</p><h4>How do you manage to find the right human capital in Panama and how do you help facilitate knowledge transfer into Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ON </strong>The most interesting and challenging aspect of my job is drawing the line between where UBS has to adapt to the local realities while remaining UBS. We have 14 different nationalities in our office here and are an international and multicultural team. It is a luxury to have such a cultural mix in the office. Every market and country has its own peculiarities and unique traits and it is important to know how to deal with this and understand this. We try to leverage this multicultural dimension in our services and business. We ensure we bring local people on board and train them where necessary. We have an internship program for recently graduated Panamanian students, giving them up to a 12-month internship program at UBS and later offering them the chance to stay on and work with us.</p><h4>How much do you focus on alliances to facilitate your expansion in Latin America?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PMF </strong>We form a great deal of alliances and have been doing so in various countries, even locally in Panama where we are based. We prefer to work together with local bankers so we can focus on other countries and on certain competitive advantages such as our unique understanding of private equity. We form alliances with local investment banks in different countries, even where we have our own team members. For example, in São Paulo we have a senior team member but also work together with local investment banks there in order to have a stronger extension of our team when required. We sometimes talk to other investment bankers or consultants after we get a mandate and after having prepared the information material for a deal, but then we also like to work from the beginning alongside other people in order to exceed our clients' expectations and create even stronger alliances for the future.</p><h4>What are your priorities for this year?</h4><p><strong>ON</strong> My focus will be on making sure we are relevant to clients in our expertise as global financial advisors. In 2017 our aim, once again, is to make sure that our clients sleep well at night.</p><p><strong>PMF </strong>We have no specific targets for 2017 because we have very long-term thinking. We have accepted that it can take a few years to just close a single deal, so we may just have two deals that we will be working on in a single year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Panama for ABB?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BLAS GONZALEZ R.</strong> The main reason Panama is ABB's headquarters for Central America and the Caribbean is due to the country's central location. The second reason is due to the laws for multinationals, under which we can bring in as many foreigners as we need. In this office, about 35-40% of our employees are from overseas. In addition, Panama has grown the most in the last five to six years amongst other Central American and Caribbean countries. Panama has great new projects such as the canal expansion, the second and third lines of the metro, the bridge over the canal, and the airport, which are great opportunities for industrial infrastructure companies such as ABB.</p><h4>How did ABB perform in Panama in 2016 and what are the main highlights?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NICANOR RIVERA </strong>We expected a little more in regard to the economy of Panama. The government handles ABB projects and some of our projects have taken too long to start. The metro project started with great traction; however, the business is complicated at the moment as there are many companies that have come to Panama seeking opportunities. Four years ago, we only had two competitors; now there are 25, which makes it difficult to participate in projects with others. Some smaller companies are keen to participate and it is easy for these companies to handle all the issues and items of the project. We need to cooperate and follow many rules and it is tough to handle many of these projects and compete with these engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies.</p><h4>What main projects is ABB currently working on?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NR </strong>At the moment, our main project is the Panama Metro. The new niche is ports and in 2016 we won a tender for a new port at the entrance of the canal, which is a great opportunity. We try to go after such projects. Another is a transmission line and complementary to this line are sub-stations, which we will bid for. The connection between Panama and Colombia is one of the main projects as it is a USD160 million project, which would be great for ABB, though it is still in the pipeline.</p><h4>How is ABB positioned to improve energy efficiency and introduce new technology in the energy market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BGR</strong> ABB has a great deal of developments in improving energy efficiency. Panama is not a country with huge industry. We produce robots that are efficient and we work in renewables; however, our efforts here are mainly with the government and energy generation. There, we have many new developments in micro grids, which are areas that are not connected to the main country grid and transmission lines though there are diesel generator units, small solar devices, and certain wind devices. We can connect them all to create a micro grid, where we can produce stable energy.</p><h4>What are your priorities and targets for 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NR </strong>We want to have two sub stations. For ABB, there are USD15 million in business opportunities and that is our key focus for 2017. The idea is to participate in upcoming bids. There are many competitors but we try to make the best bid for this opportunity.</p><p><span></span><strong>BGR </strong>We will invest more in Panama and will take advantage of the developments at Tocumen Airport. We want to take advantage of that and not only for Central America and the Caribbean but for all of Latin America. We will invest in Panama because of all the advantages the country has compared to the rest of the region. Regarding the region, Central America and the Caribbean are the best-kept secrets for ABB. ABB needs to discover more of the region's potential. We are a European company and all people imagine about the region is crime and corruption; we need to demonstrate the opportunities here for ABB to take advantage of. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of your company in Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ANDREY GORSKY </strong>Punto Pago is not a national company; it is an international company with a presence in a number of countries worldwide. We started operating in Panama eight years ago. Initially, it was hard to penetrate the market; however, our products and services started to be well received by the local population. Our technology simplifies people's lives and brings many benefits. Every year we introduce new services and new products, which means every year our client base expands and grows. After eight years of successful operations, we have reached over 1 million regular users of our services. The first thing that we have executed is to introduce the possibility of making payments at our kiosks. We then introduced the possibility of paying via our app. Our next step is to help facilitate the activities of banks and we want to make it possible to make deposits at our terminals. They will basically resemble ATMs, and we are currently discussing and negotiating the activation of this new service with leading banks in the country. We seek to expand our services not only in the capital, but also in other regions across the entire country.</p><p><span></span><strong>Giovanna Cardellicchio</strong> The company was founded in 1957 and this year is our 60th anniversary. We are a credit bureau and our history is a little different from credit bureaus in other countries; in other countries, a credit bureau starts with banks trying to share information or exchange information about their customers. In Panama, we started working for people in the retail industry, especially for furniture companies, who started sharing information and built up a basic database. At first, it was more of a blacklist rather than the positive and negative information we have today.  That was how APC began, as a non-profit association. It evolved until 2012, when it became a private company with shareholders and in 2015 we went public on the Panama Stock Exchange. This year we re-branded APC with the concept of "Intelidat,“ which we believe widens the scope of what we do in terms of being a platform for data exchange and business intelligence solutions. We have a great deal of information in Panama, but we are also regulated by Law 24 of 2002. We collect information on payments, installments, the starting and end dates of loans, the number of payments a customer has made, the amount of the payments, and so on. We have approximately 7 million references in the system and the population of Panama is 3.5 million; therefore, almost every person who is economically active is in the system. We have around 1,000 customers who exchange information through our database.</p><h4>What are your main targets and priorities for this year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AG </strong>We definitely want to implement and expand our service and our collaboration with leading banks; we are already working with Banistmo, the second-largest bank in the country. We will continue to work with new banks and financial institutions and sign contracts with them. Our commercial relations with Banistmo are extremely important; it is a priority as it is one of the leading banks in Panama and we have a great relationship. We would like to replicate this model in Colombia as well. In 2017, we do not want to stop growing; growth is the key word for this year and the future looks bright. We are taking into consideration the entire region and the countries in which it is more convenient to start operating. Mexico and Peru are on our radar.</p><p><span></span><strong>GC </strong>One is to choose our strategic partner, which we are in the process of. We are evaluating several candidates to determine the best fit for APC and for the Panamanian market. The second is to work on adding what we call "alternative data“ into the system; in order to have other products that are not credit-oriented we need information that is not merely related to credit. We are trying to get, for example, government information from different branches of the government, public services, and demographic data. We also want to continue with compliance solutions. We are currently working on a due diligence workflow that will be available online. Many companies do not know all the information they need to request and keep related to their customers.  If we can automate the process, they would be able to fill up formats already proven to comply with the regulations. I believe this will be a success. We are also working with the World Bank and the International Development Bank (IDB) on important initiatives such as financial inclusion and data protection regulations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main trends defining the insurance sector in Panama?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Emanuel Abadia </strong>The insurance market in Panama has been through many changes. The industry is used to an annual growth rate of 9.5%-10%, but in 2016 growth was only 4%. Investments are down and there is no growth. We do not see large infrastructure projects taking place. In general, the sector is slowing down. In comparison, we are growing in the health and life insurance segments. In 2016, these segments did relatively well. Marsh Semusa is focused not just in the development sectors, but also in all areas of the insurance market: individual policies, the middle market, large companies, and many other practice areas as well. Now with Marsh we have the opportunity to develop a number of areas where there is little expertise in the market in Panama, such as renewable energy.</p><h4>The canal expansion is reinforcing Panama's position as the maritime epicenter within Latam. What is the potential offered by this segment and how will you capitalize on this?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Sucelt Pitty </strong>We have different options in this segment; at the moment, I cannot disclose our market strategy, but we currently have an existing portfolio of clients active in this niche. Cargo and logistics companies in particular hold appeal to us. Companies that offer maintenance for the shipping industry are important players that we would like to work with. The number of vessels that cross the canal is steadily increasing, which implies great potential for the logistics sector in general, and we are ready to offer our insurance services to all the companies operating in this rapidly growing segment.</p><h4>What specific services do you offer newcomers to the energy sector and what is the composition of your existing portfolio at Marsh Semusa?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EA </strong>The most important thing we offer is expertise because, when it comes to insurance, companies need an expert to manage their investments. They need an expert in risk and risk management, and Marsh Semusa has many experts to do this around the world. Our most important value is our experience in the industries where we work. Marsh Semusa is a diversified company. We have a division that handles liability and risk insurances for large companies and another department that manages employee health and benefits insurance, such as life insurance cover for employees. We have other departments managing all the individual lines of insurance and the middle market. We are present in all the insurance segments and each department is able to manage all the needs of our clients. We offer all the types of insurance that the local market needs, as well as other financial products such as bonds. When a new investment takes place in Panama, we seek the assistance of experts in that particular field. Then, we collaborate with our clients to find the best deal for them with the best reinsurance companies, cover, deductibles, and conditions for their individual portfolio needs. Marsh is present in more than 160 countries around the world and has more than 27,000 employees globally.</p><h4>What is your strategy to consolidate your presence in Panama, differentiating your brand from the competition?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SP </strong>Approximately 15 years of continued success and growth are key components of our identity. Service is an asset and quality service is our key resource. It is not that easy to find great service in Panama. My background and education laid the foundations for the success of this company. We are constantly informed about trends, opportunities, and challenges. We know how to manage our business. Offering a tailor-made service to our clients is a pivotal component and a differentiating factor in our daily activities. Our clients need solid relations with the insurance company that they work with; we are a reliable partner. In this business, service is the secret. We sell an intangible product and everything comes across as a service. That is how we ensure we maximize the efficiency of our operations in the country: with an excellent service provided by an excellent team. HR is a real challenge in Panama and we have managed to solve this by investing in education and training. We are service oriented. We always solve our clients' issues. Efficiency, service, and quality are our core values and the differentiating factors that have led to the growth of our reputation in Panama. It is fundamental to educate our potential clients about the importance of investing in our services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of LATAM?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Daniel Boersner </strong>The region is important as there is a major gap in Latin America between the water needs and the existing infrastructure, especially in sanitation and wastewater treatment. Potable water coverage is adequate in some places, less so in some, and nonexistent in others; overall, however, there is potable water in some shape or form. On the sanitation and wastewater treatment side, however, virtually nothing has been done. In places like Chile and Mexico, it is extremely advanced, but smaller countries, especially in the Caribbean, have virtually no sanitation. Coverage is probably around between 5-10%, and everything goes into rivers and the sea. This has to be addressed quickly. Having said that, on the water treatment side, there is also a big issue as a great deal of the network infrastructure is old, there is a great amount of leakage and waste of potable water that has been treated, pumped, and costs money. Where people lack water services 24 hours a day, it is mostly because they lose the water rather than do not have it. Therefore, the challenge for this region is to catch up with the water and the non-revenue water and sanitation. There is a huge amount of investment required, and therein lies another problem: How can we bring that up to speed, as we cannot charge that development of infrastructure on the backs of end users as tariffs? The social and economic fabric will not allow it.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Sergio Castillo</strong> Our key efforts have been to strongly link environmental with financial sustainability because we know that around 95% of entrepreneurs and managers understand they need to do something for the environment. The problem is that only 5% of them are willing to invest in environmental programs alone. Given the situation, we understand that businesses want to improve their use of resources in an efficient manner so we need to have something that is also financially attractive; if not, they will listen but never invest. There are others who only think about opportunities in the short run.  Having competitiveness as a working guide, we established offices in the US, Mexico, Panama, Colombia, and Chile and work with dealers and representations in other countries. Mexican and Colombian entrepreneurs and industries think about being as competitive as the US. Most Panamanians, however, are just starting to move toward the competitiveness concept. We have our company headquarters here because we know the market is changing and because Panama has a well-known financial advantage in terms of tax management. We thus work a great deal with Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and the US. To orient and therefore facilitate our work, we have prepared a listing of every company that allows us to know what they do so we can get in touch and offer our technological solutions. We do not offer something that is not financially and environmentally suitable to them. Agriculture is an important division, and here we are moving toward precision agriculture and production strength farming with the use of better water for animal intake to reduce the use of antibiotics and drones needed for monitoring crops.</p><h4>What other countries are in need of your service and where do you focus your attention?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DB </strong>My sights are on El Salvador and the Dominican Republic, which have severe problems not so much with water supply and production but wastewater treatment. In El Salvador, when we install wastewater treatment plants, the difference will be significant because their rivers have turned black, and this is the source of all kinds of illnesses. That is also the case in the Dominican Republic; there are some smaller towns that simply have no wastewater treatment whatsoever. Operation and maintenance is always a problem and there is unfortunately a culture here of building something but not maintaining it because other things can be built with the maintenance budget. There is no culture of maintenance, though some people are trying to change that.</p><p><span></span><strong>SC </strong>Beside services oriented to energy efficiency and water treatments in food, beverages, and other related industries, Eco BCG has a strong participation in the region's agriculture sector. Precision agriculture uses drones to obtain health images from agriculture activities to identify timely problems related to water usage, insects, illness, and nutrition, among others, and therefore identify the required treatment for that precise site. We have created strong alliances with international organizations and NGOs, public and private agricultural organizations, and large agriculture producers. We have also installed water treatments in shrimp industries to prevent Vibrio attacks and chemical contamination in shrimp larvae production. Both the use of drones and water treatment have proven to be financially and environmentally attractive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some key events over the past year for AUK?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Prof. Nizar Hamzeh </strong>The key events that have characterized the past year are program accreditation, faculty recruitment, and expanding campus facilities. Overall, the past year would not have been successful without the support of the entire AUK Community. The past year was also characterized by concerted efforts in faculty recruitment, due to the increasing of number of students in certain programs and also in anticipation of the opening of new programs such as systems engineering and human resources. The aim is to recruit high-caliber faculty that combines both excellence in teaching and research. With regards to campus facilities, the construction of a new student center and an additional academic building that will house the College of Engineering is underway.</p><h4>What areas of improvement do you see in the local education sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Prof. Moudi A. Al-Humoud K</strong>uwait and all the other Arab countries need to invest more in education to move forward. Furthermore, there is a need for a new education reform. Even though the number of graduates has significantly increased, we still have to improve the quality of their knowledge and skills. Thus, a reform must be put into action in a serious manner rather than cosmetically and superficially. I have tried to implement these reforms for two years, and while some were successful, some were not. We have to consider the quality of the education we provide and give our students the hope that they can compete in the labor market. In addition, we have to focus on the necessity of skilled laborers and not only knowledge laborers. There are real challenges facing our education system in Kuwait. Priority should be given to reform our education system.</p><h4>How can the education sector partner with the private sector to enhance the curriculum?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NH </strong>We continue to collaborate with the private sector on at least three levels. One level encompasses creating business incubators on campus that would provide training, workshops, and services to students. A second level is through internship and practical training programs that connect our curriculum and students to the business sector. A third level involves the business sector in supporting student activities and competitions whether national or internationally. Investing in students by business sector not only is a civic responsibility, but also as a national one. A fourth level is through providing consultancy by our faculty to the business sector, if requested by the latter.</p><p><span></span><strong>MAAH</strong> Some steps can be taken to bridge the gap between industry requirements and employability, including focusing on the quality of the education, openness to a new education system, and revisiting the higher education system in order to observe its compatibility with the market. In Kuwait, we are flourishing in the financial and service industries and, thus, the education sector should aim to prepare the students for these sectors both locally and regionally.</p><h4>How do you work on building up your partnership network with universities from around the world?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NH</strong> All private institutions in Kuwait are required to have a foreign partner. Our formal partner has been Dartmouth College. In addition to Dartmouth College we have signed MoUs for collaboration with George Washington University in Washington, DC; Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia; Sciences Po in Paris; the University of Göttingen in Germany; and the American University in Cairo.</p><p><span></span><strong>MAAH</strong> We have degree accreditation programs with The Open University. The curriculum enables our students to study what their friends in the UK study, and have the same examiner in the UK evaluating our students' results, with identical standards. Currently, we are in the midst of signing our fourth agreement on degree sharing and deepening our collaboration with The Open University. We started with 400 students and today have 34,000 students and 32,000 graduates. This system also allows us to bring an international institution to the region. Such an education requires one to be open to new cultures and systems and also have a high-level competency in English, which can be quite challenging. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was your institution established and what have been its achievements?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Dr. Sultan Al-Duwees</strong>h The Kuwait National Museum has the nation's history on display, from mammoth bones and great empires to old Kuwait. The heritage museum is like a walk into an old Kuwaiti souk, with antiques displayed. Our planetarium is unique because it presents astronomy concepts in 3D. Our archaeological halls have the gems of Kuwait's archaeological past, and the temporary hall exhibits new discoveries. The Mohallab dhow speaks of the maritime past of Kuwait. All these areas are currently being renovated, as they were built in 1983, and most of them destroyed by the Iraqi invasion in 1990.</p><p><span></span><strong>Abdulaziz Abdulrahman Al-Duaij </strong>The TSCK was established to promote and engage people in science and environment awareness and to be a landmark tourist attraction in the region. TSCK has truly became something unique as it has an aquarium, an IMAX cinema, and a science center all under one roof. Also the architecture is distinctive, as it has taken the rich cultural history of Kuwait and its heritage as a maritime nation into consideration, combining the traditional Kuwaiti souk, Sadu weavings, and Islamic art. From the entrance to the various attractions, there is Islamic art and ceramics that display our cultural heritage. In our dhow harbor, we have an evolution of the nation's ships, with original wood and sails. Since our opening in 2000 we have received more than 9.5 million visitors, which is tremendous considering the population of Kuwait is just over 4 million.</p><h4>What are your plans for the coming years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SAD</strong> The National Museum is currently undergoing a major renovation, and we will soon see it as the cultural face for Kuwait, with a state-of-the-art theater and numerous museums, where Kuwait's past will be presented in a more interactive and attractive way. We also focus on capacity building and human resources so that the new generation will be equipped to manage world-class museums with international standards. We also will continue to highlight archaeological sites, artifacts, cultural practices, and our heritage through UNESCO and other international programs and conventions. Finally, we hope to see a young generation of museum employees, visitors, and tourists who will promote and share their pride in Kuwait's culture.</p><p><span></span><strong>AAAD </strong>After 17 years of operations, we want to offer our visitors new attractions, interactive exhibits, and experiments. We are working on a large expansion project, with more facilities for education areas, exhibitions, and discovery centers. These plans include the construction of a dolphinarium in the future. We are aware of the two opposing views on using animals for shows, but envision developing this center for educational purposes and to explain to our visitors how we should take care of nature and to raise awareness. The IMAX cinema theater, like our aquarium and discovery center, plays a big role in science education and environmental awareness.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the development of the cultural and scientific sector of Kuwait?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SAD </strong>We have a strategic plan to strengthen the areas of the national library, culture, arts, monuments, and museums. By developing these areas for locals and expanding the cultural sector to attract tourists, we hope to see continued success and involvement with culture in Kuwait. In the archaeology sector, we have found that by hosting international archaeology seminars, we have increased the visibility of and interest in Kuwait's archaeology as well. Just as important is to highlight the sites that are inscribed on UNESCO's various culture lists. By adding new events to our yearly cultural calendar, such as Qurain Cultural Festival, International Book Fair, and Summer Festival, amongst others, and by having cultural exchanges with other countries, we will continue to welcome guests and culture lovers.</p><p><span></span><strong>AAAD</strong> We will now focus on more collaboration between the scientific and cultural centers in Kuwait, which is great for our mission to engage people to understand science. Jointly, we will start with the Jaber Al-Ahmad and the Abdullah Al-Salem centers to work hand-in-hand on these objectives. The first one just opened and the second will follow, both of them complementing our mission. Kuwait needs more cultural entities and centers to complete its mission for the benefits of the public. We are a non-profit organization and our objectives are public as well. We are planning to study more about the composition of our audience, and for the development of our exhibitions, we are keen to find out more about that. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What developments and trends have you seen in the industry in recent years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Omar Al Banna </strong>We have a great mix of business and leisure travelers going in each direction. That said, we seek to grow outside of Kuwait. We travel to 154 destinations and serve all of them from Kuwait. However, there are some destinations in Europe and the Far East that are extremely popular from Kuwait. North and South America are increasingly popular as well. For the time being, we operate seven flights between Kuwait and Dubai, six with the Boeing 777, and one with the Airbus 380, the largest passenger aircraft in the world. In addition, we schedule additional flights for holiday periods, such as Eid, for which we have a cooperative relationship with the civil aviation and airport authorities.</p><p><span></span><strong>Hussein Al Hasaseen </strong>The demand for air travel continues to grow. The largest growth markets in the near and medium term are expected to be on the African continent and India. Things have changed in the past year. The drop in fuel prices adversely influenced the travel market in Kuwait, and the government started to ration its resources. Right now the competition is stiff; we used to have two competitors in 2015 but now there are four. Looking at the concept of services that the other airlines provide, it can be seen that as a full-service airline, we are competing with three low-cost carriers, which have caused prices in the market to drop. In fact, prices this year have fallen by some 35% compared to last year. We are constantly reviewing our strategy; at the same time, we have to function directly and indirectly, as the average prices of our competitors are lower than ours. We cannot match all our competitors as we are a full-service airline. In addition, our taxes in Kuwait are USD186 and we work based on a margin of USD216 inclusive all taxes. This means that the average fare will drop to USD33, with taxes of USD216. Last year we were selling tickets at a minimum of USD325.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for Kuwait?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OAB</strong> Our ambition is to focus on our growth and to try to make the best of the opportunities that work for the business. We are optimistic about the future; however, given the intensity of the competitive environment and the economic and geopolitical forces currently at play, we need to remain smart and ahead of the game. Our ambition for Kuwait is to focus on connecting Kuwaiti travelers to our worldwide network and providing unbeatable value for money and unmatched levels of service.</p><p><span></span><strong>HAH </strong>Royal Jordanian Airlines is committed to providing the highest quality of customer care and services to our passengers in Kuwait. If fuel prices continue to decline, we will see more challenges in Kuwait. It will be tough for full-service airlines, providing low-cost businesses an opportunity to boom in that period. Low-cost airlines offer the cheapest fares in the market. Relying on this, Royal Jordanian will try its best to offer the lowest fare available for its flights based on the date, route, and class of service requested.</p><h4>What partnerships do you seek to form outside of air travel?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OAB I</strong>n Kuwait, we have had a longstanding partnership with ABK, through co-branded credit and prepaid credit cards. We also have the ABK Skywards Miles program, and our co-branded program offers exclusive benefits for our premium customers and delivers rewards and a regular stream of benefits, features, and services. Emirates Skywards also has partnerships with other airlines through joint frequent-flyer programs, car rental companies, global hotel chains, and retailers in the UAE and around the world. We are continually on the lookout to partner with other interesting entities to offer more options and rewards for our travelers.</p><h4>How important is the Kuwait branch for Royal Jordanian compared to others in the region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HAH </strong>Royal Jordanian Airline started operations in 1963 with two Handley Page Dart Heralds and a Douglas DC-7 aircraft, serving Kuwait City, Beirut, and Cairo from Amman. Kuwait is a constitutional monarchy with a high-income economy backed by the world's sixth-largest oil reserves. The Kuwaiti dinar is the highest valued currency in the world. According to the World Bank, the country has the fourth-highest per capita income in the world. In addition, Kuwait is the second-richest GCC country per capita after Qatar. Petroleum accounts for half of GDP and 90% of government income. Significantly, Royal Jordanian Airlines launched flights to a number of high-profile destinations including Kuwait, which has been an essential contributor to the airline revenue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><strong></strong>How would you describe the range of your operations in Kuwait?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Ali Jarouche </strong>The logistics sector is vast and dimensionless, and there are always new ideas and methods for moving and handling cargo, and we are constantly developing and adapting. We began primarily as a sea freight firm, but have grown and evolved into other models and now offer other services in air freight, overland transport, and other logistics services like warehousing, storing, packing, crating, labeling, loading/unloading, distributing, and other related services. We offer an integrated service portfolio to our clients as a single package. We have extensive tracking capabilities through our international network of agents to ensure our operations are fast and effective. We begin tracking a shipment as soon as an order is placed, from the shipper and point of manufacture until the final delivery at consignee warehouse. We are providers and offer door-to-door services, multimodal transport, and full logistics solutions.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Ossama Nazir </strong>In Kuwait and the region, Maersk Line supplies ocean transport to exporters and importers. We serve the two main ports, Shuwaikh and Shuaiba. We have fixed weekly vessel calls and can provide customers with reliability in their supply chain. This allows importers and exporters to choose the port they wish, with heightened efficiency. Maersk Line has a global presence in 112 countries, which gives Kuwaiti customers the ability to import their cargo from all over the world as well as for the exports of Kuwait to the global market. That is one edge that we have and helps us continue to be as big and successful as we are. Our hub for Kuwait is in Jebel Ali, where Kuwait's exports are connected to the mother vessels and then to the rest of the world. Imports to Kuwait meanwhile connect to local feeders through the Jebel Ali hub, too. Our customers in Kuwait have access to the most modern vessels, the world's largest and most sophisticated container pools, which give them access to and from all major ports and trading spots in the world, bringing Kuwait's products to the world and allowing customers to bring cargo from the world to Kuwait.</p><h4>What have been your primary markets and partners?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AJ </strong>Kuwait imports cargo from most producers around the world, and our main origins in order of size include: China, our largest market and the biggest volume of consumer items; Italy, because it ships a great deal of high-quality goods and is also involved in gas and oil pipelines; Spain, due to the volume of building materials, food items, and consumer goods; Northern Europe, for agricultural equipment, food items, and cars; and the US for cars, oil industry infrastructure, equipment, and pipelines. The transport of oil as a commodity is handled solely by the Kuwaiti government company. We are pioneers in the logistics sector as we have agents all over the world and they are integral to our operations, covering all the main cities, international ports, and airports. Due to the market situation, competition has become stiff, and in addition to many local competitors, we also see competition from many multinational companies. We often work with other shipping firms as partners in our logistics operations such as Maersk, MSC, CMA, United Arab Shipping Co., Kuwait Airways, Cargo Lux, Gulf Air, Emirates, and others, with which we handle cargo projects jointly, give them our traffic, and cooperate with them closely.</p><p><span></span><strong>ON </strong>In Kuwait, we have relationships with all the well-established businesses that import and export out of the country. It is not about naming them because even the biggest companies do not deal with just one shipping line; all the big firms work with us. In general, our customer base seeks high service levels and reliability. We also have a wide range of customers comprising medium, small, and microenterprises. We have certain customers that just ship one container per year. We have different solutions and, in 2017, we will go over a new customer segmentation. We are able to provide sophisticated services for customers and individualized solutions for them. For the small customers, we have online services and phone apps that allow them to book containers from A to B as well. We seek to make it as easy as booking a flight, though it is not that easy in shipping because we need documentation for ports and customs. However, even the smallest customers are able to reap the benefits of our services in a big way. Customers do not have to be big to get the service that is expected from our company. We look forward to automated systems coming to life in GCC ports so that our customers can benefit from the digitalization of transport infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[private-healthcare]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your current position in the private healthcare landscape of the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Dr. Yousif Abou Zahr</strong> The government provides almost 90% of healthcare through its hospitals and primary healthcare centers. The remaining 10% is private, though there has been a noticeable shift toward private, as big national companies like KOC provide their employees with private insurance plans. Al Seef Hospital opened in 2010, and in the first year we had 10-20% of our patients covered by insurance, as compared to 90% today. We position ourselves as a leading private healthcare facility, with high-end care and comfort, but without the unnecessary extra luxury. We offer a clean environment, top-notch Western-qualified doctors, and the latest equipment and techniques. Wherever we see growing demand, we will add more resources to cater to medical needs of our patients.</p><p><span></span><strong>Dr. Alexander Varghese</strong> We stand as a high-end secondary care hospital, with some services up to tertiary care. In the field of fertility, from gynecology and delivery up to IVF treatment, we are among the best in the region. Another specialty where we provide tertiary care is pediatrics, including sub-specialties like pediatric pulmonology, pediatric endocrinology, pediatric cardiology, and pediatric neurology. Thirdly, we are highly specialized in physical medicine and rehabilitation for which we provide end-to-end services. Our center has everything that is needed for rehabilitation, developed with a US-trained professional who has been with us for 20 years. Our last area of the highest expertise is our ophthalmology division. We do anterior surgeries, glaucoma, LASIK, and essentially everything within the field of ophthalmology.</p><h4>Does Kuwait seek to become a magnet for healthcare for the region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>YAZ </strong>We are establishing centers of excellence in certain specialties, and word has spread around the region. Our modus operandi is to establish partnerships with consultants abroad, so we bring specialists here on a regular basis. Currently, we welcome patients from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE. In addition, the foreign armies that are stationed in the region use our services. However, other countries are moving at a much faster pace in terms of medical tourism. To compete with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, we need better privatization and more public-private collaboration to ensure a more dynamic market. Most public hospitals are not profit centers; rather, they are cost centers at the moment and are run by the Ministry of Finance without much accountability. There needs to be an element of autonomy in running hospitals to compete for services, technology, and excellence.</p><p><span></span><strong>AV K</strong>uwait is extremely well placed, geographically and climate wise, for medical tourism. Kuwait is taking steps to attract medical tourists to the country and we in the private sector have and will support any government initiative. For the public sector, Kuwait is the only country in the world where expatriates can get the same care at the same rates as Kuwaitis. When an individual gets a work visa here, there is a small fee for employers, and the employee can then access any public health center in the country. Also, the country provides all services end to end, and some of these services are world class. An expatriate can visit any hospitals, only paying the admittance fee of KWD1. Even outpatients are treated for almost free, which is unique in the world.</p><h4>What are the challenges in finding and retaining medical staff?</h4><p><span></span><strong>YAZ</strong> Recruitment is the biggest challenge facing the private sector. When we recruit a doctor or a nurse, we have to get the license from the Ministry of Health, which is a lengthy procedure. Our choices therefore are limited, so we target Egypt, as it has designed its system to have an easier transfer, India, which has a longstanding tradition of recognized degrees, and the Philippines, where there is a supply of doctors, nurses, and technicians. At the specialist level, we try to get Western-qualified doctors with UK, US, Canadian, or European qualifications, but we also target doctors from Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt who are working in Europe or the US and are willing to relocate back to their home region.</p><p><span></span><strong>AV T</strong>here are certainly challenges, and Dubai and Abu Dhabi seem to have found a way of fixing it while other states are still catching up. The strength of the Gulf region is that there are strong economies and we can afford to pay good salaries. A challenge is that it takes time to recruit from abroad, especially at the doctor level. We have more than 10 Kuwaiti doctors, so we do find local talent. Kuwait provides a great medical education and after their education Kuwaitis often move to the UK, the US, or Germany and later come back with more experience. For nursing, the situation is more manageable; we can get them on board usually within a month. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the challenges in the area of water supply in Kuwait?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Sultan A. Alkhalaf </strong>Most Gulf countries suffer from desertification due to a lack of rain, dryness, high temperature, and overgrazing. To solve these problems we need cooperation between Gulf governments represented by the ministries of agriculture and international organizations, especially the World Bank, which can fund anti-desertification projects. As Kuwait owns 371 groundwater wells with a daily production average of 160 million gallons, the expansion of irrigation for the production of animal feed will lead to the depletion of many of the wells, as the currently available production does not meet the fresh water needs of the state. The Ministry of Electricity &amp; Water has taken action to secure the future of groundwater, as Kuwait currently uses about 80% of its groundwater. As a private company, we can help the government through our expertise and experience in the building of forestation areas.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Osama Khaled Boodai </strong>KLTT was established mainly for food security, as we do not have enough quantities of livestock for local consumption here in Kuwait. We bring in livestock from around the world and slaughter it in the Arabian Gulf. In Kuwait, the only source of water is the government. We have to maintain the water at a certain temperature, as animals cannot drink hot water. We put a piping system for them deep in the ground so that it cools the water as it moves down and use chillers whenever needed. We continue to check the temperature of the water that sheep drink. We feed the animals every morning and evening so that they can eat and graze without feeling the stress of the heat. We have more than 500 employees working in our operation—it is huge.</p><h4>With significantly reduced production levels, what are the biggest challenges in maintaining food security?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SAA</strong> Food security is one of our major concerns. Meat suppliers have to meet the growing demand for meat over the next 10 years, while an increase in the food security gap will see, in return, a fall in global food consumption due to the lack of sophisticated food infrastructure. With regard to the supply of livestock, Australia and New Zealand primarily supply the Kuwaiti market with sheep. However, these countries suffer from drought, a lack of rain, as well as high grazing costs, which resulted in in a significant decrease in the number of sheep. This and other reasons are why it is important to look for alternative supply sources. Dar Al Khalaf prepared a feasibility study and consultation service for a Kuwait investor to establish a 2,500,000sqm sheep production farm in Ethiopia. This project will produce 10,000 hybrid sheep, crossbreeding Ethiopian sheep with Arab Awassi sheep. Projects such as this will have a great effect on providing livestock for Kuwait.</p><p><span></span><strong>OKB </strong>In Kuwait alone, we import more than 700,000 heads of sheep per year. Our biggest challenge is to find new sources for livestock supply. We stick with Australia, as it is the only country that can supply ships with 80,000 heads in two days as we import of around 1.2 million heads per year of livestock. For our new operation, we are starting with 3,000 ewes of local breeds (Neami), which we buy from the market and breed locally for the future. We will not cover the quantities needed for the country, but we want to start with something. With 3,000 animals, we can reach 50,000 ewes in the next 10 years. This will form the new generation, which we will use for breeding. The livestock quantities in Australia are, in fact, reducing, as there used to be 180 million heads as a flock in 2000, while today there are only 90 million: a 50% reduction. So, if they continue with the current production levels throughout the next 10 years, we might find that there are only 40 million.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the upcoming year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SAA </strong>Governments, especially in the GCC, must work together in developing other sources to overcome a possible shortage of food and feed resources, particularly in funding research in agriculture, water resources, fisheries, and lack of available arable land. As an expert in animal studies and consultations, I feel the Kuwaiti government is still far from ensuring food security.</p><p><span></span><strong>OKB</strong> By the end of the year, we expect to make 12% net profit, and the same for the next year. By 2018, after opening the new slaughterhouse and adding the new vessel, we expect to reach 15% net profit. On June 30, 2016, we announced a net profit of KWD2 million, which is almost 10% of our paid-up capital of KWD21 million. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations advanced in recent years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Amir Fahim Ipsos </strong>has been in Kuwait since 1997, as our second office in the MENA and GCC region, only after Lebanon. Things started to move rapidly in this region, and Ipsos made sure to be present early enough. Ipsos globally is in 88 countries with 177 offices and 16,500 employees. Our largest clients are in the banking sector, and we deal with almost all the banks in Kuwait, so we have a big market share in the financial services sector. Kuwait is considered a great place for banking research, and we do communicate our best practices to other Ipsos teams in the region. Kuwait banks are increasingly operating in the region, and have ambitions to become more international. The leap from regional to international is much larger than from local to regional, and we have the expertise to provide support for that through our global network and expertise. Kuwait's largest banks are now investing in Turkey, Malaysia, and Egypt, and smaller banks are in Lebanon and Jordan. Secondly, we work with telecommunications companies, the obvious clients, as well as with FMCG and hospitality chains. Currently it is becoming more challenging to measure and to predict consumer behavior, which is why Ipsos continually invests in R&amp;D to find new tools and methodologies for this. To better develop specialized research tools and methodologies that cater for different client needs, Ipsos has established six business lines specializing in specific research types.</p><p><span></span><strong>Mazen A. Ishbib </strong>Data is everywhere now but data protection has only become more urgent with cloud technologies. Although it is a wonderful product, people do not trust their data on the cloud fully. Our task is to manage the security of data. Around 60% of our business is with the government. Kuwait has been the leader in IT in the GCC region, and the country has the ability to be frontrunner again. From Kuwait we currently serve international customers in the GCC as well as India, the US, and the UK. Due to the internationalization of business and the rapid spread of information, our customers know what is available on the market, so we need to be at the top of our game to meet demands. We differentiate from other IT companies that are box movers, primarily involved in trading hardware and software. With our outsourcing activities, we provide end-to-end IT services as system integrators, so after delivering the package, we do the implementation and offer continuous support, including a 24/7 helpdesk. Since we are strategic partners with major leading technology vendors and consultants, we can offer solutions that not only offer their current needs, but also make their investments get better ROI and make them future proof. Amongst others, we currently work with Oracle, HP, Microsoft, Dell, Fortinet, F5, Barracuda, and Nutanix. In Kuwait, we were the first large company to start complete outsourcing for IT infrastructure, and our first big project was Kuwait Airways in 2005. We recently signed a new contract; we were awarded a large infrastructure-leasing project, worth nearly USD40 million for five years, for a major oil sector company.</p><h4>What services are in great demand in Kuwait?</h4><p><strong>AF</strong> The greatest demand is for pure market research and the loyalty-centric types of studies that we conduct: customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and mystery shopping. This is the backbone of what we do in Kuwait. Occasionally, we receive requests for brand strategy and marketing reputation; however, we work on these projects usually in collaboration with well-established international firms. Our primary task is to provide market insights, and that is where our expertise lies. There is a difference between data/information and insights, and we provide the latter; the story behind the information and the figures.</p><p><strong>MAI </strong>E-government has been the initiative of the Kuwaiti government for the past few years, but to date it has been limited to online payments and some other services. There are many opportunities for the Kuwaiti authorities to connect with its citizens through online portals, and we do not envisage any major challenges given the fact that technology is widely available and adopted amongst the GCC countries and with a generally tech-savvy Kuwaiti population. The government is definitely stepping up faster than we expected and the current administration seems to be providing enough resources financially to the ministries to solicit offers to bring the service level one or two steps higher. There is a sense of urgency there now, and it used to be more relaxed. If the ambitious plans are implemented, online services would be extended to both industries and residents. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is your company positioned within the Kuwaiti construction market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Hamad AlMutawa</strong> Louis Berger is a US-based firm with an international presence in more than 100 countries. In Kuwait, we operate both under our global brand name and via a local company that we have established in a joint venture with the Al Mutawa family. So essentially, we can deliver our projects through our local or international license, giving us the best of both worlds. Our advantage stems from the local know-how that we have developed during the past decade being involved in some of the most prestigious projects nationwide. We aim to diversify our work as well; we have always considered ourselves to be more than an engineering company and we help the developing world with institutional development work. We increasingly seek social and economic development work that will help strengthen our overall mission of being a multidisciplinary company that offers solutions for a better world.</p><p><span></span><strong>Haitham M. Al-Refaei</strong> In the last year, most of our projects have been with the government, including the oil and gas sector. Just recently, we completed the Kuwait Oil Sector Hospital and the head quorate Kuwait Authority for Investment, and ran several projects with the Ministry of Public Works, the General Authority of Housing, the oil sector, and the private sector. Thus far, we have seven subsidiaries in Kuwait and three associated in Oman. In Kuwait we have SandCo Company and Bayan Company, supplying the market with sand and other gatch and agricultural soils. These two companies have about a 50% market share in Kuwait. We also have Boubiyan Ready Mix, a landmark factory producing concrete for most high-tech projects in Kuwait. In addition to that, Tasheed, a general trading and contracting company, owns Kuwait Tower factory, which produces interlock, pavement tiles, concrete tiles, and cement blocks. We produce additives for concrete and all chemicals for construction materials via our company EPO Gulf, and have a good market share there even though the company was only recently established. In 2015, we established Insha'a Ahliyah Real Estate Company, which specializes in investing and managing industrial real estate.</p><h4>What are some of the large-scale infrastructure projects in Kuwait that you have been involved in?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HA</strong> Most of our recent work has been with the Ministry of Public Works, focusing on infrastructure projects. Our core focus is on design, supervision, and project management services. The largest project we are involved in right now is the design and supervision of the Al Jahra and Jamal Abdul Nasser roads, which should be completed by 2019. We have also been involved in Boubyan Island, designing the bridge from the mainland to the island, and a 26km highway leading to Mubarak Al Kabeer Port. Another project that we are very proud to design is the Northern Regional Road, which, when built, will be one of the largest projects in Kuwait's history. Kuwait Metro is of an interest to us as our experience in metro projects in the region will add significant value in Kuwait</p><p><span></span><strong>HMAR </strong>Our subsidiaries have submitted their bids as a construction materials supplier for large infrastructure projects, similar to most local factories in Kuwait that produce a construction material. Internationally, everyone is talking about these large-scale projects and it is important to encourage it. However, the government has to let local factories participate in this project. As there are not enough rules and regulations in Kuwait that protect national factories and producers, sometimes the main contractor purchases concrete factories to produce concrete for the project, depriving local factories from participating in large-scale and unique projects, such as with Hyundai in the Jaber Al-Ahmead bridge project.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>HA In Kuwait, there are a number of projects that we look forward to being a part of, such as the Kuwait Metro, the railway, some new cities that will be developed by the Public Authority for Housing Welfare, as well as few solar projects through Kuwait Oil Company and the Ministry of Electricity and Water. We have a great deal to offer and seek to be successful in future bids.</p><p><span></span><strong>HMAR</strong> Recently, the government announced a new plan seeking to depend on other sectors rather than only oil and gas. We have seen a great deal of movement recently. Hopefully, this gives an indication that the government is serious about this, and it is not only a matter of propaganda. Recently, the state has applied a reduction of subsidies program from the consumption of water and electricity for most sectors except for industrial sectors. In my opinion, this is a message that the government is still supporting these sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new technologies and innovations are currently having the largest impact on the petrochemical industry?</h4><p><strong>Mohammad Al-Farhoud </strong>First of all, there is a continuous development in the petrochemical industry that looks into operational efficiency and catalyzing processes. The second major driver is the growing development of available feedstock, especially with the adoption of shale gas and coal processing technologies. These low-cost feedstock production technologies are expected to have a significant impact on the petrochemical markets across the board. We currently do not work with these two technologies; we keep continuous track and will anticipate our strategy accordingly. One of the consequences of this development is that integration of refinery and petrochemical industries are speeded up to remain competitive. Integration of the two industries ultimately goes beyond feedstock security, as it will also widen the product portfolio and thus provides more downstream opportunities for local industries. In addition, in the Middle East, integration is moving fast to face the challenges of ethane availability constraints. In Kuwait, we are adopting this route for our new integrated complex in Al-Zour.</p><h4>How would you assess the effect of low oil prices on the downstream sector in Kuwait?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Mohammad A. Husain</strong> It is a global phenomenon, not just a Kuwaiti one. Looking at numbers, oil prices dropped almost 50-60%, ethylene glycol prices dropped about 30-37%, and polyethylene dropped about 24-27%. So they are not really eye-to-eye, but there is of course an impact. That being said, demand remains healthy. But there is still caution with people waiting to see what happens. We are not over-supplying, because the utilization rate for ethylene glycol and polyethylene stands at almost 90%. Taking into consideration the amount of maintenance, we are almost at 97%. So the market is healthy. We need to keep looking at our value proposition, make sure it is reliable, keep looking at our area in the Gulf, and keep creating value for our shareholders. That is what we have to build on while we manage the current cycle of things at a macroeconomic and global level.</p><h4>Which regions outside the GCC hold the most growth potential for PIC? </h4><p><span></span><strong>MAF </strong>Both our own and our JVs' operations span the globe, and our investment strategy allows us to look into attractive projects in any part of the world. Apart from the Middle East, we currently assess Asia and North America as important growth areas for petrochemicals. North America has vast amounts of advanced feedstock as well as an attractive market. In Asia, we are primarily present in India, where we anticipate growth of the demand market especially. Our China project is currently on hold as the market regulations are tough on foreign investors at the moment. If we can work out a good partnership with Sinopec, we are interested in moving forward, as we are keen to be in China. Closer to home, after a recent meeting with the Minister of Oil in Bahrain, we are now in the final stages of launching an aromatics project there. As we want to build a balanced portfolio, it will require extensive investments from our side with little initial revenue, but we see great potential.</p><h4>What are the key developments and changes that have characterized the past year for EQUATE?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAH </strong>The main achievement for EQUATE was the acquisition of MEGlobal as a wholly owned subsidiary in December 2015, which shifted us from being a local operator to becoming a global player with operations in Canada, Germany, and also in the US. That has positioned us completely differently in the international market. Having our product in the US now with this acquisition has really been a major boost for us. We have not had considerable growth since 2009, so this has been a major increase in scale for EQUATE through that MEGlobal acquisition. It positioned us as the second-largest player in the US market after SABIC, with a 12% market share. In reality, we are the most active player in the US market, and everybody sees us as a global leader there. We produce 2.4 billion but actually bring in around 3 billion including through trade and other means. Our debottlenecking project for our polyethylene plant has been finalized and tested, so we are very happy about that. It will increase our polyethylene production from 825,000 tons per year to 1 million. That has pushed us into a good position. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your take on the OPEC decision to reduce output by 130,000bpd?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Ziad Jeha</strong> We do not expect the strategy of KOC to change or that activity to be affected by the new agreement. Post-agreement, most activities have been maintained. It is a challenging target for KOC to produce 4 million barrels in 2020, which is its main objective, so to steer in that direction, most activities are continuing. It could utilize the production cut as an opportunity to do some extra maintenance, but as far as surface and sub surface activities for Schlumberger and for other service companies are concerned, there has not been much impact.</p><p><strong>Wafik Beydoun</strong> I do not have the necessary skills to speculate on oil prices. I prefer to anticipate, adapt, and stay focused on what we can control to stay profitable, and tackle short-term challenges with a long-term vision. Whatever the ups and downs of the oil market, we are prepared with our operational excellence mindset and able to manage complex to fully integrated projects while maintaining low costs.</p><h4>Have you seen a strong appetite from KOC for new technology?</h4><p>ZJ For the past 78 years that Schlumberger has been in Kuwait, Schlumberger and has been a major supplier of technology into the country. Kuwait has keenly developed and deployed technology to support its operations often in partnership with Schlumberger. It is my personal ambition to get Kuwait to be the first users of the new technologies that Schlumberger brings to the market. There have been several projects that KOC have executed with Schlumberger, where key parts of the technological development took place in close collaboration, thus creating great value. One example of this is in directional drilling, we have deployed our PowerDrive, which increases the efficiency of drilling into these high temperature and high-pressure reservoirs, delivering wells much faster. We have introduced new highway and broadband technologies to frack tight reservoirs and bring extra oil from existing wells, and we have received a number of awards from KOC in Kuwait for exceeding production expectations, mainly because we fracked wells that were perceived to be unfrackable.</p><h4>How will you contribute to KOC's objective of increasing production to 4 million barrels a day and how viable do you think that objective is?</h4><p><span></span><strong>WB </strong>There are two interrelated ways we could contribute to this objective: (1) provide the necessary skilled professionals who can work alongside KOC teams and transfer their know-how. For example, we will work on methods, processes, and strategies on field development plans and executions, and most importantly on cost discipline and cost reduction, while guaranteeing project excellence; and (2) bring the most innovative technologies that will be customized and deployed efficiently in complex and large assets, such as enhanced reservoir characterization and monitoring, sour hydrocarbon processing, cutting-edge multilateral drilling, extended reach drilling, and completions. Fundamentally, with a strategy based on improving oil recovery for each field, and an execution plan resulting from cementing the two ways described above, we share KOC's objectives that they are attainable.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ZJ</strong> Schlumberger operates almost all its global business lines in Kuwait at the moment, and over the past three years we have expanded adding two more. Drilling rigs services are an established and integrated part of our portfolio. Today, the flagship project for Schlumberger is the Rig of the Future, which is intended to revolutionize the way and the efficiency of the drilling process. The prototype will be out this year, and it is my ambition to have the first rig deployed and used in Kuwait. We have recently conducted a workshop within Kuwait and see good momentum and opportunity to have this new project here, as well as to showcase the robustness and efficiency of the new technology.</p><p><span></span><strong>WB</strong> We are looking forward to finalizing our discussions with KPC, KOC, and others to grow Total's partnerships and projects in Kuwait. As an IOC, the TSA/ETSA business model in Kuwait is unique compared to our core business in other parts of the GCC. However, Kuwait's determination and vision to remain one of the top oil and gas producers in the world will expand our relationship for Total to work here, and contributing to the country's ability to attract, develop, and retain more skills and technologies. This would also increase human capital development, in which Total can help in ensuring that KOC objectives are efficiently and effectively planned and executed at the operational level, with industry's best practices, cost reduction, and innovative technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent can you help companies when entering the Kuwaiti market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Hannelore Graf </strong>The most we can do is connect them with the right people and help them with information, i.e. where to go and what to do, but nothing beyond that. We lay a foundation of connections, contacts, networks, experiences, and information, providing a platform. We can also give market information on whether it would be a good market for a company or whether the market might be saturated, and so on. We also have a lot of cultural events, which help create a community, create new contacts, get people acquainted with local culture and people, and mix business and pleasure. We also cooperate and work with SMEs in Kuwait. We had a women's SME conference with people from eight countries from Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. There were also two Kuwaiti female entrepreneurs present, talking about the difficulties they met and their experiences in overcoming those challenges. Those SME conferences will continue, as will other conferences next year. The aim is to motivate Kuwaitis to opt away from public sector jobs and choose the private sector, considering 90% of Kuwaitis are employed in the public sector, only 10% of Germans are employed in the public service, we have a lot of experience in how to meet that challenge for Kuwait.</p><p><span></span><strong>Juliet I. Dinkha</strong> The ABCK is a not-for-profit organization and was developed as a support for Americans doing business here, to help them network, and provide them with an opportunity to meet with the embassy. However, the ABCK's primary mission is to collaborate with American and Kuwaiti businesses. Recently, one of the biggest challenges has been the various legal reforms. One change is that it has become more challenging for American companies to come because there are a lot of legalities regarding sponsorship and licensing. By the time employees get their sponsor and finish their paperwork, they additionally require work visas. Americans used to arrive on a visa and, every six months, they could go to Bahrain and renew it until they got a new visa. Now, Americans can come on a visa, but have to go back to the US for residency. If they go all the way back to the US, employees stay away from their job for 2-3 weeks. Moreover, non-Kuwaitis could have a driver's license for 10 years, but now you can only have it if you have a residency permit. In my opinion, the Kuwaiti government needs to loosen restrictions for certain countries in order to attract more foreign companies.</p><h4>What have been some of your key developments over the past year? </h4><p><span></span><strong>HG </strong>We have introduced the new GBCK website and directory, and we also have a larger board that can take care of many more subjects than before. Our business contacts have been developing between the Swiss, German, Austrian, and Kuwaiti community, both socially and in terms of business. We have a new German ambassador, and he has been very active and enthusiastic about working with the GBCK. We work closely with the US, Australian, UK, Indian, Canadian, French, and other business councils. We hold joint events and cooperate closely in many areas, which also benefits the Kuwaiti business community. We also have very close relations with other chambers of commerce in the GCC. In Kuwait we also have the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), which is here to help cooperate with the Kuwaiti Public Authority for Applied Education, mainly in the area of vocational training, to be able to ensure there is sufficient trained personnel to deal with foreign companies, German or other. The GIZ is located in Kuwait but it is for the whole region. </p><p><span></span><strong>JD </strong>We have just revamped our website and hired a social media coordinator and an event planner on a part-time basis. I was appointed as the new Chairwoman in June 2016, but I have already hired two employees, changed the office, and come up with a sophisticated strategy to invite more corporations and change the benefits. In this regard, one of the ABCK's biggest benefits is that we offer a network through which our members can get more business. For instance, we already organize events in association with the US Embassy and are further looking to collaborate with other organizations such as the American Women's League, Canadian, and British organizations. It is an American organization, and we do not want to lose sight of our members, who are mainly from the oil and gas sector, but also hotels and IT companies. We do not have any hospitals yet, and I am hoping that we will get some clinics interested in our corporate membership. Essentially, it is all about providing the platform and seeing how we can expand from there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects (KAPP) has crucially facilitated the influx of foreign companies to Kuwait. Which sectors and industries in Kuwait hold the most potential for PPPs?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DR. HASAN MERZA </strong>The main issue with Kuwait is the capacity to implement; we need to transition from vision to implementation and strengthen institutions in order to have the ability to implement projects. There are a few sectors that need to go to the private sector and utilize these partnerships. However, first a great deal needs to change in Kuwait's business environment. The water and electricity sectors and certain service industries are currently ripe for PPPs. The main obstacle is the environment for doing business in Kuwait. The Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) has placed a great deal of effort into changing this environment because it is a prerequisite for any PPP project. Kuwait has the relevant laws now and there are attractive industries here, especially in the downstream oil industry; however, Kuwait needs to finetune the regulatory system and business environment, which is what KDIPA seeks to do in Kuwait. There are companies interested in coming into Kuwait to develop their business in certain sectors; however, this will be difficult without a clear regulatory environment on tariffs and ownership. This is where conditions need to be changed in order to have a successful implementation of the PPP law.</p><h4>How does UNHCR partner with funds and the private sector in Kuwait? </h4><p><span></span><strong>DR. HANAN HAMDAN </strong>In 2015 and 2016 important partnerships started evolving with the funds and the private sector. An MoU was signed with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) during the visit of the HC to Kuwait in May 2016 and a field visit to Iraqi Kurdistan was conducted in January 2017 to look into the possibilities of supporting refugees and internally displaced people. In terms of the private sector, UNHCR successfully established key relationships with multinational Kuwaiti conglomerates including Zain Telecommunications Company and Alghanim Industries, which have committed to promoting UNHCR's mandate and advocacy efforts. On April 19, 2016, UNHCR signed a cooperation agreement with Zain Telecommunications Company in the UN-House, Kuwait, with the sole objective of supporting refugees worldwide through UNHCR.  More recently, a field visit was done with Zain to the refugee camps in Jordan in January 2017, and an online campaign to raise funds for winterization assistance for Syrian refugees was launched in November 2016 in collaboration with UNHCR. The campaign, which ended in January 2017, was titled #ZainwithRefugees, in addition to another campaign launched a few years ago in collaboration with Zain titled "Warm Their Hearts." This is an important milestone as it is the first cooperation agreement signed by UNHCR with a telecommunications company in the region. Other organizations that UNHCR Kuwait is currently in contact with are Alghanim Industries and Agility. We have more initiatives on the way with several other private-sector entities under study, and we anticipate the new collaborations to be finalized and announced shortly.</p><h4>What are your respective expectations and forecasts for Kuwait's future?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HM </strong>Kuwait is an easy country to turn around. The country has human capital, decent infrastructure, an excellent location, and many financial resources. Therefore, it will be easy to turn Kuwait around in terms of diversifying its economy and developing the service industries. The vision is great and is moving in the right direction; however, the challenge remains in implementation. Our forecast for Kuwait is that it needs to reform and if this is delayed, the future cost will be exacerbated. We believe there is no choice but to reform; the question is when. If we delay the reform agenda and do not look closely at the fiscal situation, subsidies, wage bills, productivity, efficiency, and the public sector, then the cost later on will be higher both socially and economically.</p><p><span></span><strong>HH </strong>In 2017 protection and humanitarian needs are expected to grow significantly. Given that the refugee crisis continues to be the largest in the region with displaced people reaching the highest record since World War II, the challenge ahead requires us to maximize our efforts in this coming year and work closely with governments and NGOs to continue providing aid for refugees. I also want to emphasize the importance of the role of the private sector in support of the humanitarian work. We will look at ways both in Kuwait and regionally to enhance and strengthen our partnership with the private sector. We look at the resilience component and how we can support the host communities and refugees as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After opening the Croatian embassy and the Hungarian visa center, respectively, what improvements do you expect to see in your bilateral relations?</h4><p><strong>KOLINDA GRABAR-KITAROV</strong>I It is important to have an embassy in this part of the world. During the two days that I spent visiting Kuwait, I saw what possibilities exist for the development of business relations between Croatia and Kuwait and the broader region. It is of pivotal importance to encourage concrete projects that we discussed in Kuwait, especially regarding tenders to which Croatian companies have applied. Our business delegation had the opportunity to meet their counterparts, and also spoke with the Chamber of Economy. For the last four years, we have been working on the establishment of this embassy, and we are pleased to have done so with a fully fledged presence including staff on consular, economic, diplomatic, and political departments.</p><p><span></span><strong>ANDREA GULYÁS</strong> Kuwaiti people are open to exploring new destinations, and Hungary certainly is a very attractive alternative to many popular European countries. A lot of elderly Kuwaitis can recall personal stories about family trips to Hungary by car in the 1970s and the 1980s and how much they enjoyed the time they spent in Hungary. Although the political and security situation has dramatically changed in the Middle East and it is no longer feasible and safe to travel from Kuwait to Hungary by car, we are determined to do our best to encourage the people of Kuwait to visit Hungary. The opening of the visa center is an important step in this regard. We aim to facilitate visa application procedures to meet the expectations of our Kuwaiti applicants, while we also strive to better accommodate their needs in terms of flexible opening hours and availability and swiftness of service. Since its opening, we perceived a marked increase of interest and attention toward Hungary, which is also reflected in the number of visa applications submitted through our new visa application center. There is a noticeable increase in the number of applications, especially for tourism purposes. Also, based on data from the main carriers the sale of airplane tickets to Budapest has increased to 7.3% this year. We believe that the number of Kuwaiti tourists who visit Hungary this year will be around 3-4,000.</p><h4>What are the pillars of trade and industry that connect business between your two countries and Kuwait?</h4><p><span></span><strong>KGK</strong> Croatia is a relatively small Mediterranean country, but with a powerful culture. Especially as a tourist destination, we have much to offer given the fact we have 1,200 islands, a 1,200km coastline, and already around 17 million tourists visit us annually. The Adriatic Sea is around 24 degrees in summer, which is wonderful for swimming. Croatia has been awarded for its clean seas, on which we pride ourselves over neighboring Italy. Reversely, we have a strong shipbuilding tradition and along our coastline we have numerous shipyards and wharfs. Croatian companies have already participated in several Kuwaiti tenders for the construction of yachts and ships, and we hope to increase our economic relations here. Kuwait has shown great interest, and we do believe our quality surpasses offerings from China and South Korea. Other areas include the food and beverage industry, as there is potential for Croatian exports of fresh consumer goods. Croatia has a long history of producing military equipment and we have exported to many regions of the world. There is a company that has already delivered to the National Guard of Kuwait, for which it also has the maintenance contract.</p><p><span></span><strong>AG </strong>Hungary had a trade mission in Kuwait already in 1966 and since then Kuwait has remained an important partner for our exports. The volume of bilateral trade has been fluctuating during the last few years between USD40 and 55 million with a significant surplus of Hungarian exports. The most important fields of our export are still related to the Hungarian engineering knowledge, which was well known in Kuwait even back in the 1970s. Approximately 80% of it is made up of power generating and electrical and industrial machinery equipment and road vehicles. Here I would highlight again the role of the ICT and the pharmaceutical industry, which could serve as potential fields of cooperation between our countries. There is also potential in the field of agriculture, as agricultural technologies related to animal breeding or the dairy industry may be of particular interest for Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In terms of economic stability, the coming year looks stable and positive. This is essential for our business, and the automotive business has a great deal to do with stability and the exchange rate. Fortunately in the last few years interest rates have been stable, so we believe there are no big surprises for 2017 in terms of any external factors that might affect the business. We expect the country to grow in the next couple of years, which directly correlates with the growth of our business. </p><p><span></span><strong></strong>Donald J Pimentel Reid This year looks promising compared to the last three or four. Even though it is an election year, the government has been able to control the main variables that affect our industry: the exchange rate and interest rate. When we are able to maintain stability throughout the entire year then obviously our clients and consumers feel more comfortable making the important decision to purchase a vehicle. After buying a home, this is the second-most important decision one can make. Part of our growth and stability is due to the actions our government has taken to maintain stability in this country—even though there has been turmoil in the rest of Latin America. It is real growth, although we should not depend entirely on growth financed by international loans.</p><h4>What have been your main growth factors? </h4><p><span></span>OR Service; companies have to focus on service. Of course, innovations are important, but this type of business has to focus on services. We are also focusing on social media this year. CRM handling will be the future of the automobile business. The more companies understand their customers and data base, the better ways they will find to adhere to customers' needs. This will also enable us to let them know about special offers in the service shops and in sales. We want to take the vehicle to the person, not the other way around. In the next couple of years, the company that manages customers' needs the best will succeed. Everything will be online and data-driven, and customers will probably conduct their search and purchase a car from their laptops at home. We have five models and the fastest-growing one is the Range Rover Sport. It was launched at the end of 2014 and is one of the best-selling models together with the Discovery. We had a launch in 2015 of the Discovery Sport, which is a brand new member of the Land Rover family. It is a 4x4 SUV vehicle and we expect in the next month a new Range Rover Evoke convertible and a Discovery. These are the two vehicles expected for the next year. The Discovery will lead growth because it is a large SUV and has a bigger market.</p><p><span></span>DJPR Our company is divided into many products, which can be divided into three or four areas. We do everything related to the automotive, construction, and industrial sector, in addition to services. Part of our group has a small financial institution that we use to finance new or used vehicles. We have seen growth in different sectors between 10% and 18%. The vehicle sector in 2017 should hit around 25,000 to 26,000 new vehicles. It will be much better than last year, with closer to 3,000 units, or more than 8%, growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the competitiveness of today's education sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ALMAGUL KANAGATOVA</strong> Competition is tough in the education market. Currently, the main players in the Kazakhstani education sector are in a period of transition and need further development and innovation. We cannot work as we did yesterday; it is a different period and there are different values now and different requirements for education. High school graduates have more requirements for university so they expect more today. There are 20 intellectual schools and 30 Kazakh-Turkish schools, and the level of education and preparation of students is extremely high so universities should be prepared for talented undergraduates. Nazarbayev University is an example of a successful university that meets the requirements of high school graduates so all national universities, state universities, and private universities should follow that example. Successful high school graduates should not only dream about getting into Nazarbayev University but should dream about getting into national, state, or private universities. </p><p><span></span><strong>CHAN YOUNG BANG</strong> In relative terms, in the CIS, Kazakhstan is number one. There is no university comparable to KIMEP, even in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Georgia, or Belarus. So in that sense, Kazakhstan is superior in terms of education. However, in absolute terms, there is still a long way to go to become an equivalent of a university in the UK, US, or even other countries like  South Korea. The number one problem is that the people who are in charge were educated under the Soviet Union and their inherent way of thinking is more or less comparable to older traditions. KIMEP is different; we want to emulate western systems, where transparency is crucial and decision-making is democratic. The people in charge are accustomed to the Soviet way of management, which means quantitative control from one to 10. When I visit the US, I never even hear about the Ministry of Education; it does not get involved unless to provide a loan.</p><h4>Another important goal for your university is internationalization. How is that progressing and what is the university doing to further attract international students?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AK</strong> We work hard towards improving internationalization. We now have more than 80 students from Central Asian countries like Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, as well as students from Russia, Turkey, France, and Austria. We also work closely with embassies and consulate generals; for example, we expect a number of students from China, Iran, and Azerbaijan as we have agreed with the local diplomatic missions of these countries for them to help promote our university there. Our university also offers scholarships for students from overseas with excellent academic performance. AlmaU provides double degree programs on undergraduate and postgraduate levels with partners from France, Switzerland, South Korea, and Russia. Given that Kazakhstan was included in the Erasmus agreement some time ago, AlmaU has expanded its opportunities for internationalizing its curriculum and student and faculty cohorts. We already have one faculty member from Belgium who arrived last semester to teach and we expect most of our Erasmus+ students and faculty exchange to arrive next year. Next year we expect to have more students and faculty members from France, Bulgaria, Poland, Malaysia and other countries as well. To ensure the internationalization of the study process, AlmaU invites foreign faculty to teach full-time and deliver guest lectures.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your goal to be among the top-100 universities?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CYB</strong> We are currently one of the best universities in the world. Employability is a great way to assess an educational institution. KIMEP students invest USD8,000 a year for four years and that has fallen to USD5,000 due to the tenge depreciation. This means USD20,000 in four years, and the rate of return means they can repay everything in two years. In comparison to Georgetown University, KIMEP University is better because a Georgetown University degree costs around USD50,000 per year, which takes five to seven years to repay. In terms of employability, Georgetown cannot claim 93% but virtually all our students find a job. This is what we consider when assessing a university, including student levels of satisfaction, employer approval ratings, and rates of return. However, there is another aspect of academic institutions: the advancement of knowledge. When we went through our accreditation, an Oxford University professor visited KIMEP and was impressed. In terms of training, our faculty, and students, we are successful; however, in terms of the advancement of knowledge, Oxford is one of the best and we are not there yet. The quality of our research is not comparable to the one at Georgetown University, and this is where our quality has to improve. We have to produce and publish journals to enhance knowledge and contribute to research. We have to study and publish an article about Russia, for example, and other relevant articles. Many articles come from Georgetown, Oxford, and Harvard but there are not many from KIMEP University. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you deal with the limited consumption of chocolate here?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MARK POTHAST</strong> It is limited because of culture and tastes; it is also affected by finances, especially in the last year and a half, with all the currency devaluations. For most Kazakhstani people, chocolate, for example, is not a necessity. We have had to significantly raise our prices along with our competition as a result of the devaluation; a bar of chocolate a year-and-a-half ago was half the price it is now. For people with local salaries the prices have obviously affected them. Consumption figures are basically falling across the board. Most categories that we do business in, especially at the beginning of 2H2015 and the beginning of 2016, saw double-digit falls. People were either buying cheaper products or downsizing. We do advertising and a great deal of sampling, but it is not just us; our competitors are also in the same boat. In terms of investments, together with some of our competitors in coffee, we spent a great deal of money but there was no significant increase in the amount of coffee consumed.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>MIKHAIL BAZANOV</strong> Compared to Europe, per capita consumption here is certainly lower. In Switzerland annual consumption is 10kg while in Russia it was about 5kg, though probably less now. In Kazakhstan, the figure is about 3kg; however, in China it is only 100g, so it depends on with what country we are comparing. There is a great deal of potential not only in the chocolate segment but also in the confectionery category as a whole. To develop this potential, we need to invest in building capabilities of our associates and work collaboratively with our partners: key national customers, regional customers, distributors and retail shops.</p><h4>What are the main challenges of doing business here?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MP T</strong>he main challenges are trying to be as efficient as possible and working with the right partners. We have the right distributer partner so it is about making sure you have full trucks going everywhere. Transportation over huge distances is still a challenge because the infrastructure is not that well built. About 60-70% of our business comes from small mom-and-pop stores, which always presents a logistics challenge. Modern trade is growing quite rapidly but companies focus on building stores and not their logistics infrastructure. Their biggest focus now is to build as many stores as they can, either to sell to one of the big retailers in Russia or just block many other retailers from coming in; it is still early on but that is the idea. We do a good job with logistics; 85% of what we sell comes from Russia so we have good routes.</p><p><span></span><strong>MB </strong>There are both similarities and differences if we compare the market to that in Russia or China. For example, both Kazakhstan and Russia experienced a disturbance with the currency in the past few years. As a confectionery and pet care company, we purchase a large amount of ingredients for our products from overseas. We do not grow cocoa in either country and thus need to purchase it on the international market, so for us the currency is an important element of our cost structure that increased significantly in 2016. However, we managed to overcome the challenge and with the currency and oil price stabilizing, we set ourselves for the growth trajectory in both markets.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MP </strong>I see people becoming smarter shoppers. In terms of the number of goods we have on promotion compared to a few years ago, the figure is much higher because that is what people seek out. The bigger key accounts here demand a bigger discount because they see the same thing. People are becoming smarter with the money they spend so companies have to make sure they give the customer what they want. Another challenge is that even though we get products from Russia, there are still many parts of our products and our P&amp;L that are exposed to foreign currency. Nestlé buys cocoa in pounds and coffee in dollars so the two biggest components of our products are exposed to currency fluctuations. In general, we are doing better than expected; however, I do not expect developments in 2017 that will show a significant increase in consumers' point of view, which means we will have to be smarter.</p><p><span></span><strong>MB</strong> Annual chocolate consumption in Kazakhstan could grow further, which will result in the confectionary category growth. We see also huge potential for growth in pet care, as many people have pets and start feeding their pets with prepared pet food. However, pet food currently accounts for only 4% of every 100 calories in dogs' daily diets in Kazakhstan, while the remaining 96% comes from food off the table. Our expectation that this percentage will increase and the pet care category will grow in the next several years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you preformed over the past few years, despite an economic downturn and turbulent automotive industry? </h4><p><span></span><strong>KANAT AKISHEV </strong>We had major changes on the government side because there were new taxes from the last two years and in 2016 we had a new utilization fee and new registration fee, which caused great confusion for the global Kazakhstan market. In our company, we take more deliveries from Russian Volkswagen production. For all marques, for example, we saw in the last two to three years the share of Russian production in Kazakhstan and Kazakhstani production increasing dramatically, while the delivery of imported cars from Germany has fallen. Production in Russia of Volkswagen for other brands has increased in that time.</p><p><span></span><strong>FARRUKH MAKHMUDOV</strong> Any crisis is an excellent stress test to evaluate the sustainability of the business. It is an opportunity to determine and reveal our advantages, as well as areas for further improvement. Several years of intensive work in a challenging environment have strengthened our team and prepared it to overcome the difficulties. At the core of our business success lies effective team effort, which has allowed us to go through these crises smoothly.</p><h4>How would you define your position in terms of market share in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>KA</strong> Our target for Volkswagen is to have 5% of market share for this year. I hope to exceed this target with 5.3%. We also distribute Audi and Porsche. We concentrated on the Volkswagen group as it is for us an ideal business strategy. Volkswagen AG can suggest the perfect product for every customer—premium segment cars like Audi and Porsche and semi-premium like Volkswagen. Volkswagen is not truly affordable; semi-premium means a customer can buy a premium product at a great price. The last two years we have had some strategies not for the internal market because we have large deliveries from Russia as cars from Russia are cheaper.</p><p><span></span><strong>FM</strong> How to identify the company's market share in such uncertain times? Well, that is mainly the question to the market: How will it define us. I am confident that our business has demonstrated a degree of consistency and stability, and has been sufficiently reactive to the external events.  We regard customer-orientation as our key source of competitive advantage and prioritize client satisfaction. We continuously develop our product range to offer various solutions to our customers, including package offers, flexible trade-in, auto-replace, a diversity of financial services, special entertainment programs during the waiting time, as well as pickup and transportation to destination. </p><h4>What is the potential of the automotive industry in Kazakhstan in the coming years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>KA </strong>We depend on oil prices as this is connected to the economic situation and if it is better then we can sell more. However, our company has a strategy to develop not only car sales volume. Depending on the economic situation, there is huge potential in dealer network development to sell more accessories and spare parts. That is our long-term strategy and we are seeking good regional partners in Kazakhstan. We work with dealer centers and look for new business people who want to have partnerships with us.</p><p><span></span><strong>FM</strong> The automobile market has shrunk three times relative to its previous period indices, when we used to sell an average of 160,000 cars annually.  I believe that we have reached the market bottom and upcoming years will treat us with moderate growth and steady stabilization of the market. In the short run it is probable that prices will exhibit an upward movement: after initially reducing prices to sustain market share, manufacturers have now started to increase them back systematically. In the long run it is expected that businesses who left the market will re-enter it and a subsequent redistribution of market shares will follow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights of your company in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Catalin Radu</strong> Our company has been committed to the Kazakhstani market since 1994, and we have the same commitment today. We transitioned from a small operation to a fully fledged legal entity that includes all our pharmaceuticals, consumer health, and life sciences. Our business has developed consistently over the years and today we are number five in pharmaceuticals in Kazakhstan in terms of prescription and non-prescription drugs. Bayer Healthcare has developed throughout the year via both organic growth and acquisitions. The largest acquisition in pharmaceuticals was Schering, back in 2006, later notable acquisitions include Sagmel and the OTC portfolio from MSD. All those acquisitions also contributed to our dynamic role in Kazakhstan.</p><p><span></span><strong>Ranga Welaratne </strong>Sanofi is a life-science company present in more than 100 countries. Sanofi is a major player in emerging markets including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia. We have around 350 employees in our team in Central Asia. As a pharmaceutical company, our mission is to bring innovation to our patients across the globe. Today, we have a diversified portfolio widely used among the general population of Kazakhstan that allows us to provide them with innovative solutions. In recent years, most children born in Kazakhstan are vaccinated with high quality combination vaccines manufactured by Sanofi, because we are one of the main suppliers of vaccines in the country. In 2017 we will celebrate our 20th anniversary in the region. In the last 20 years, we have been introducing many new innovative products to the country and provided patients in Kazakhstan with access to important medicines.</p><h4>What are the particular features of the Kazakhstan market compared to other countries?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CR </strong>Kazakhstan is not completely different from many other territories. Diabetes is a big topic here, similar to many other countries, and it is one of the national priorities. Cardiovascular diseases are another important area of concern, with heart attacks and strokes causing major fatalities. Vaccinations are a high priority on the public health agenda. Public funding is significant here as well. Kazakhstan has a growing population. Overall, the opportunities are great and we expect the healthcare market to diversify and develop. Personally, I expect to see more private service providers, healthcare providers, private clinics, and private hospitals; this is a natural trend because it can both lift the burden of public spending a little and also adapt the market better to what society needs.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>RW </strong>In emerging countries, there is a high unmet need for high-quality innovative products. The government tries to spend more money in the development of healthcare systems. The one thing common across former USSR countries is hospital treatment versus primary care. In developed countries, 80% of the time patients go to a GP, get the prescriptions, and go home; that is primary care. Here, it is completely the opposite as perhaps 50-60% of cases are hospital care. It creates great pressure on the government. Primary care should be developed as opposed to hospital care. Institutions need to be robust, policies need to be set up properly, and funding needs to be handled in a befitting way. With the "Densaulyk 2020" program, we are getting there.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CR</strong> For 2017, we remain optimistic and committed to Kazakhstan. We expect to reach our targets, which are ambitious. We will be able to show growth in our business, and this is valid for all divisions here, all the while keeping a healthy financial position and good debt collection rate. This also shows our confidence that the economy is stable and that the reforms taken by the government will show results.</p><p><span></span><strong>RW</strong> In 2016, we did a strategy exercise called the Central Asia Roadmap 2020 wherein I proposed that the total business in Central Asia will be doubled by 2020. We have looked at macroeconomic data and pharmaceutical data, pharmaceutical reform data, and external indicators. In 2017 I will focus on five areas: vaccines, CHC, diabetes, cardiovascular, and rare diseases. We will still work in our eight countries but we will be focusing on Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Contextually, the region will recover and there will be some pharmaceutical reforms. We can move the needle in Kazakhstan by focusing on bringing innovation to Kazakhstani patients in need. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Europharma is currently engaged in pharmaceuticals distribution in Kazakhstan. Do you intend to start manufacturing drugs here?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Ruslan Berdenov </strong>One of our goals is to produce pharmaceuticals in Kazakhstan. In terms of the timeframe, we have processes ongoing at the moment for production. It is not feasible to produce just for the commercial market in Kazakhstan because local pharmaceuticals manufacturers only have a 10% market share here; foreign manufacturers hold the remaining 90%. Our aim is to produce pharmaceuticals for the government's needs in the public health sector. The pharmaceuticals market is split into two, with 50% of demand coming from the commercial market and the rest from the public health sector. Europharma currently seeks great international partners to go into manufacturing with. A company cannot produce great products in Kazakhstan without western partners because the R&amp;D is not here. It will take around 30-35 years to establish an R&amp;D base in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>Viva Pharm started in 1999 solely distributing and then built a factory in 2010 to locally produce generics. How have operations changed since then?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Batyrbek Mashkeyev</strong> It is interesting to produce, even just generics. Generics seem simple but in fact our generics are competitive bioequivalent, though the ingredients are a little different. It is interesting compared to mere distribution because we start from zero, buy substances, purchase and maintain technology, and do a bioequivalent study in the hospitals on 18 or 21 patients taking our medicine and compare it with originals. If a hospital or laboratory confirms it is a bioequivalent, then we submit the generic for registration. We do not only deliver products but have received accreditation for two laboratories. We do feel the competition from foreign products as they are well developed and Kazakhstani consumers like products from Europe. When we say this is a local product, unfortunately, people perceive it to be of poor quality, and thus we need to promote this to doctors, who in turn explain to pharmacies and customers that ours is a bioequivalent. We have done a study in clinics and our products have 100% the same ingredients and work the same as other products.</p><h4>Would the market be more competitive if it was more of a retail commercial pharmaceuticals market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RB </strong>I do not think so. There are two types of pharmaceutical products: over the counter (OTC) medicines and prescription only (Rx) drugs. The government only purchases Rx medicines, and companies cannot sell these drugs over the counter in a retail pharmacy. A new healthcare insurance system will be introduced in Kazakhstan in 2018 and certain things will change. It is great that the government is investing in healthcare and that in the future patients' insurers will pay for their treatment. This is one of the government's healthcare optimization programs.</p><h4>Will Kazakhstan find its niche in the production of pharmaceuticals or will more complex drugs always be imported? </h4><p><span></span><strong>BM</strong> More complex drugs will come from abroad because we do not have the capabilities here yet to produce them. From history, we know we cannot find molecules within 10 years if others have spent 100 years to find these great molecules. Companies need a background because they cannot produce from nothing; they have to spend millions of dollars and need extensive experience and the right culture in order to produce. We can only do great quality generics or biosimilar, which is also an interesting niche for local producers. There are biotech products that are expensive and in great demand; however, here we can produce biosimilar. </p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for 2017?</h4><p><span></span>RB For 2017, our goal is to grow by 50%. We have targeted certain projects and will move forward with those. The main breakthrough for us will be in the public sector, retail and online sales. In 2016 we signed contracts for exclusive products with certain large global companies. I believe we can meet our targets in 2017. A good margin in our market is 10-15%, but in 2016 the margin was lower. We will have to increase our turnover to compensate for this. Europharma took a number of steps in 2016 to optimize our performance and operations. For example, we have made improvements to our IT systems for our pharmacy chains and our wholesale and commercial operations. Growth of 50% for 2017 is realistic</p><p><span></span><strong>BM</strong> My goal is to produce quality products and become popular with certain OTC products. We seek to be successful with our Vitamin C 500 mg or painkillers and want to be the local leader in cardiovascular medication. The sector has not been majorly impacted by the devaluation; people get sick and need to take their medication. The sector will start growing again, especially with the introduction of mandatory insurance. Perhaps the Eurasian common market will bring about more competition and we will be able to register with this Eurasian market. The outlook is great. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of your most recent plans for working across Central Asia?</h4><p><strong>Sergey Chernovolenko</strong> Xerox has been operating in Central Asia for more than 25 years with companies and organizations from most industries in the region. Our Almaty-based office is responsible for the business operations in Kazakhstan and four other Central Asian republics—Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, plus Mongolia. In these markets, we offer the major products and services that Xerox provides around the world (apart from specific business process outsourcing services), which brings efficiency and productivity to document-based business processes and helps our customers optimize their document flow. We are still considering providing business process outsourcing services in case we see a demand for these types of projects on the market.</p><p><span></span><strong>Ben Yoon</strong> 2016 was a challenging year for Kazakhstan's economy, which was affected by unstable oil prices in the global market and a weakened tenge. Those issues had a significant impact on the market. Like many other market players, we are a global company. We import products produced all over the world. The lack of stability of the local currency has definitely affected pricing policies in the consumer electronics market as well other business sectors. 2016 has been tough, but I believe we have managed to overcome difficulties and showed solid market performance. We maintained our undisputed leadership in the market across major product categories, including mobile devices. Furthermore, we have increased our market share in the TV segment, widening the gap with other market players in Kazakhstan. We also launched new innovative products such as refrigerators and washing machines last year. These product groups are considered less "thrilling" from an innovation standpoint, however we have managed to bring new features to wow consumers. We have launched a washing machine line-up with AddWash technology. Essentially we have introduced an additional door that can be opened at any time during the cycle for adding additional clothing items. So, through our market leadership and product innovation we have managed relatively well in 2016.</p><h4>What would you define as the main features of the Kazakhstani market in particular?</h4><p><span></span>SC Throughout my career at Xerox I have worked in different countries and generally cannot outline many differences in the business climate. Most of the companies work in the same way as they have one common business goal: generate revenue and profit. Most of the issues they face are very similar: low productivity and efficiency and a lack of innovation, which can possibly directly benefit revenue and profit. The only big differences concern the economic and political environment and the level of technological development. It is a quite interesting and challenging time in Kazakhstan. In terms of the business environment, the difference is the level of technical and business outsourcing. In most of the places I have worked, like Turkey and some countries in Central and Eastern Europe, there was a high demand for technology outsourcing even 10 years ago, and it was a standard part of being successful in most industries. Outsourcing is new to Kazakhstan and the demand was accelerated by a challenging economic situation. Another point is the cost of capital. When we outsource, companies' links and access to capital in a cost-effective manner is a critical point as outsourcing requires investment and sometimes investment is on the horizon for two to four years. In this case the government needs to continue to make progress here and decrease the cost of capital, especially if Kazakhstan wants to compare itself to Turkey. Companies' profit margins in Kazakhstan do not necessarily justify going with more expensive investments; an investment of two to three years is quite a long period of time. Perhaps these are two big differences; the first is access to cash and its cost while the second is the level of outsourcing integration and readiness to invest. People in Kazakhstan are hardworking and open to innovations.</p><p><span></span><strong>BY</strong> Kazakhstani consumers are sophisticated and receptive of new technologies. I have noticed a lot of premium cars on the roads; the ones you can hardly spot in South Korea or European countries, where smaller cars dominate the roads. The situation is similar in the terms of the mobile market. Kazakhstani consumers want new devices from established brands. They are looking for superior design, quality, and functionality. For example, local consumers prefer high-end models with larger screens, while their Western counterparts tend to lean to smaller 3-4 inch screen phones. The situation in the TV market shows similar trends. Many consumers across the globe still purchase TVs of 32 inches and smaller, while Kazakhstani TV viewers prefer to watch their favorite shows on 40-inch screens and higher. While Kazakhstan is not immediately perceived as the largest market in terms of size, it holds great potential for our business in terms of our brand's performance in the premium segment. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you contribute to the development of the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Igor Girnyk</strong> The decision to establish a representative office in Astana was based on the idea of expanding our presence in the region, being closer to our local customers, and increasing our level of support to them. It is a significant advantage for the company to be present in the local market, to match our products and technologies with customers' needs. We have been working in Kazakhstan for many years but the decision to open an office here five years ago was timely and right. We actively promote our technical service and programs for oil and gas technologies. Doing this at a distance was difficult, so our current local presence allows us to broaden our participation in the oil and gas sector as well as to enter the construction market here. Astana is a growing and developing city. The upcoming Expo 2017 will be dedicated to new energy and innovations, and we will participate with our products and solutions for the construction industry. We also pay great attention to mining and copper production. The Dow Water &amp; Process Solutions business unit offers a wide product portfolio of services for the mining industry.</p><p><span></span><strong>Saule Baitzhaunova</strong> BASF has existed for 152 years, 25 of which have been in the Central Asia market. Subsequently, we can see that the company is a long-runner and has vast knowledge in different sectors. BASF will support and share its knowledge in the country's efforts to diversify. We will expand our production and increase our range of materials. Our main contribution to Kazakhstan will be to bring all these technologies together here. We are the biggest chemical company and can supply chemicals as well as raw materials for other producers too, which in turn can also help the country. We can be main players in the production chain for other producers as well. Our materials are used in agriculture, mining, oil and gas, automotive, nutrition, animal feed, farms, and cosmetics. Around 90% of cars in the world have a piece of BASF in them. We are in televisions, mattresses, toothpaste, perfumes, as well as smartphones, where our materials help reduce their weight and make them more sensitive to touch. We are not only globally important, but also specifically in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p><span></span><strong>IG</strong> In the last four years we have increased our share in all the industries our products and solutions are present in. In addition, we found new opportunities in other business directions, such as construction. Nowadays, this sector is fast developing in Kazakhstan, so we supply our products for building and construction as well as for coating materials, which are used for the production of paints. A couple of years ago we investigated and observed the market situation and dynamics. Now we feel confident here; we know the local aspects and offer a wider variety of products than when we got started in the country. As a global company with a high level of technical expertise, we offer our knowledge and technologies to Kazakhstani producers. We are very strong in the oil and gas area: we supply our water treatment technologies to the local market, and our products are very well known in the mining industry. Moreover, the full list of products and solutions we offer to local businesses is much wider. We are planning to develop more in the areas where we are already strong and are always looking for new opportunities, customers, and applications for Dow technologies in the region.</p><p><span></span><strong>SB</strong> It will be a challenging year, but for now we are prepared because our business is diversified. If the construction sector goes down we will increase our industrial business, and with this we will remain stable. Nonetheless, hard times will not last forever and there are other opportunities for growth on the market. Therefore, owing to our experience, valuable employees, and the support of BASF's global team, we are ready for whatever challenges and opportunities may come this year. Lastly, BASF has a commitment to sustainable development. The principle "We never compromise on safety“ is anchored in our "We Create Chemistry“ strategy. Together we are committed to economic competitiveness, sustainable development, and our responsible care philosophy, which permeates everything we do. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><strong></strong>What are the biggest opportunities for you at the start of 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Bolat A. Tenyzbayev</strong> Opportunities are huge, export wise. China is extremely interested in buying our products and selling them, either with our own brand or through a localized brand in China. We also see opportunities in Russia, where we have had talks with potential Russian customers, as well as Central Asian countries. In terms of our overall expansion plans, we prioritize projects in Turkey and Ukraine. Iran is still just coming out of sanctions so it is a little tricky for now, but we have our eyes on the country. We originally just wanted to ship our products to Ukraine and Turkey without a physical presence, but now we want to open branches in those countries. Every market requires a special approach. In Ukraine we have established partners that we have been working with a long time; the same is true for China. In Turkey we sought businesses working in the same area as us—lubricants—and approached them either directly or through trade fairs and expos.</p><p><span></span><strong>Murat Omaro</strong>v The company was established in February 2009 and its main activity is manufacturing plastic products. Before this time, KNK had trader experience for polymer raw materials and sold about 10,000 tons of raw materials per year. Today the company is already spending this volume of raw materials for its own manufacture of plastic products. One of the important factors of the company's growth was the development of its own production capacities. In seven years the company started the manufacturing of packaging films, agriculture films, PE films for building, plastic shopping bags, PE pipes, PVC pipes, and other fittings. If we consider the share of sales of our products, then of course the pipe products take a large share, since the weight of the pipe products is more than the weight of the plastic bags and films. The share of pipe products is about 60% and 40% of sales is for PE films and plastic bags. Our pipes customers are servicing companies that use it in the water and gas supply, as well as for uranium mining.</p><h4>How can you help further develop the downstream sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BAT</strong> We have great plans for the future. We increased our output annually through extensions to our existing blending plant, and we also plan to build another facility, a base oil plant. That is an ongoing project also in Shymkent. That will increase production capacity substantially, which is in line with our overall export and expansion plans. It will increase our production by a minimum factor of five. The crisis has definitely had an impact on the downstream sector. In terms of Hill Corporation, our customers purchase less due to the decline in demand and the overall slump in the sector. To offset this decline in sales, we approach international oil and gas companies like TCO and NCOC to get more business from them. So we are definitely making huge strides in the downstream sector in Kazakhstan.</p><p><span></span><strong>MO</strong> The plastic market in Kazakhstan is increasing, and accordingly competition is increasing. But, to give the best growth in this industry, Kazakhstan needs its own petrochemical plant for the production of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and other raw materials. After all, Kazakhstan has the necessary raw materials (oil and gas), but still needs to develop the deeper processing of raw materials. After that, Kazakhstan will come near world exporters of polymeric raw materials. This will give a big impetus to companies like us. To produce such raw materials will be a great advantage for companies like ours. In general, the business climate in Kazakhstan is favorable, but is at an embryonic level. For business development, it is necessary to fundamentally review and simplify the government acts, both in the sphere of organization and liquidation of business, its security, as well as in the field of taxation and investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide us with some background on the company's operations since its establishment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Boltabek Nazhmetdinuly</strong> Our business is currently concentrated in three main areas: transport logistics, production of building materials, and crop production. In 13 years Dala-Trans has become the largest transport and logistics company in the southern region of Kazakhstan. Dala-Trans transports goods through the territory of Kazakhstan, as well as through Europe, Western Russia, Siberia, Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Our second business line is the production of building materials. Dala-Construction was founded in 2002 and its main activity is turnkey construction. The company started by developing an industrial site in the South Kazakhstan region, and today there are three crushing and sorting complexes operating at a quarry with a production capacity of up to 100,000cbm. Our third business line, Dala-Fruit, was established in 2012 to carry out activities in the field of crop production. In view of the lack of storage facilities in the south of Kazakhstan, the company built and commissioned a storage facility with a CWG equipped with modern Western European equipment, including freezing and refrigeration equipment, adjustable gas environment equipment, sorting and packaging equipment, and auxiliary loading and unloading equipment.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Nuraly Abishov Bortye Milka</strong> was founded in 2003 in Shymkent in the South Kazakhstan region. The primary type of business is animal husbandry. The company has its own farms for breeding small cattle and large-sized cattle. At the moment the amount of small cattle is 350,000 heads. In 2005, Bortye Milka launched a dairy farm project to start producing milk. Overall, the farm is designed for 1,000 head of mulch cattle. Currently we have 400 Holstein-Friesian cows being milked. The average daily productivity per each head is 30 liters. The dairy farm was constructed using the latest advanced technologies of Swedish company DeLaval. This company is the leading manufacturer of equipment for automation of milking processes, feed distribution, and other technological processes of dairy farms in the world. DeLaval is a part of Tetra Laval Group, which also includes Tetra Pak and Sidel. The dairy farm also has extensive equipment such as six robotic milkers, automated equipment to remove manure, including a modern manure separator, cows' cooling system on feed table, a ventilation system with weather station, daylight system, identification cameras to identify cows' body mass, milk piping with milking machines, equipment for calves, and so on.</p><h4>How would you assess the overall sector in which you operate in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BN </strong>Over the past eight years, Kazakhstan's total cargo turnover has grown 1.5 times. At the same time, freight turnover of road transport increased 2.5 times, and according to preliminary estimates of experts in 2016-2017, growth will only continue. The overwhelming majority of enterprises in Kazakhstan are small enterprises, which indicates that the market for logistics services is still developing. Economists very often point to a shortage of storage facilities in Kazakhstan, especially of class "A." An efficient warehouse system that minimizes the costs of cargo transportation is needed in Kazakhstan and attractive for investment. The active development of the logistics sector meets the goal of developing Kazakhstan as a transport and logistics hub of Eurasia and realizing its transit potential. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>NA</strong> The implementation of the milk processing project became possible due to the following factors: government support for the development of milk production companies; increased demand from the population, which prefers natural products with European quality; lower competition between producers of natural milk products; and the ability of the company to invest resources in this project.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BN</strong> For 2017 we have big plans: we want to bring our transport fleet of Dala-Trans to 100 units, launch the third facility for the production of reinforced concrete products of Dala-Construction with a production volume of up to 150sqm of products per year, launch the full capacity Dala-Fruit storage facility with a total storage capacity of 8,200 tons, and expand fruit storage to a volume of 15,000 tons. In the medium term, we plan the creation of a service center for the maintenance and repair of large-capacity transport, expansion of activities, and increase in the range of production of building materials, the establishment of the production of agricultural products.</p><p><span></span><strong>NA </strong>In 2017, on the basis of the dairy farm project initiators, we will set up a milk processing plant with a production rate of 50 tons per day. Contracts have been signed to provide equipment for the plant, with several Italian companies specializing in the manufacturing of milk production equipment. The establishment of the plant is planned for October 2017. At this moment construction on workshops at the future plant is being completed; once it is completed, equipment installation will begin. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your history in Costa Rica?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Enrique Bolaños</strong> INCAE Business School was established in 1964 at the request of the presidents of the Central American countries and then President Kennedy at the time of the formation of the Central American Common Market. Nicaragua was the location chosen for the first INCAE Business School, which opened in 1969. Due to the political changes that occurred in Nicaragua in the mid to late 1970s, INCAE Business School decided to move to Costa Rica in the early 1980s. We have grown our operations and now have a campus in Costa Rica and have reopened our campus in Nicaragua as well. We offer MBA programs at both campuses in addition to executive training and education. Between our specialized and global MBA programs, we have around 220-240 MBA students. In total in Costa Rica, we have around 5,000 to 6,000 executives a year coming to train with us. We have 120 students in our executive MBA program in Nicaragua and another 90 MBA students there. In total, over both campuses the number of students is more than 400, which is a good number for a region of this size.</p><p><span></span><strong>Daniel Velásquez </strong>Costa Rica is perhaps the most important country for education in all of Central America because of its educational strategy. In the 1950s, the country restructured its education budget, and as a result years the education system here has continually improved over the last 60 years. There are more schools, universities, and think tanks here than in all the rest of Central America. Costa Rica does not have an army, but it has a lot of schools. Costa Rica has a highly skilled workforce that gives the country a competitive advantage within the region. We currently have around 100 students taking a variety of classes with us. We have small class sizes of around 20 students. We also hold different programs for the largest companies.  Our company programs are tailor-made; therefore, we adapt the content and structure of our programs to fit what each company wants in terms of the length of the course, number of participants, and so forth. We provide on campus, e-learning and blended programs for all of Central America in addition to public sector training courses.</p><h4>How does ADEN Business School stand out from other educational institutions?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DV </strong>The principal value that ADEN Business School adds into education is innovation in terms of the results that this brings. For example, our graduates go on to become company executives and managers, and in these senior positions they need to consistently produce results in a timely manner. Thanks in large part to our methodology ADEN Business School produces graduates who achieve successful results in their business endeavors. This is because we take a practical approach and we embody the attitude that our students will go on to become the future CEOs of the largest multinational corporations. Every day, we expect our students to apply what they learn in the classroom to obtain measureable results. All of our classes have tailor-made action plans for our students to follow up, which encourages constant improvement on the part of our students. We have been particularly successful as a result of applying this practical methodology backed up by sound instructive theory.</p><h4>What are INCAE's main priorities for the next year?</h4><p><span></span>EB We have several things going on such as our new entrepreneurship program. We are working on our Women's Leadership Center because society and the business community would be better if there were gender equality. We are trying to ensure we have an equal balance of men and women in our classrooms. We are trying to launch our Social Progress Index (SPI) throughout the region. Internally, at INCAE we have embarked on a major renovation of our campuses, as they are 40 to 50 years old and students today require different standards. As our students live on campus we have to ensure we have all the proper facilities. We are focusing all our executive training in Costa Rica rather than Nicaragua because there is a strong business community here as well as good communications and air transport links. We are trying to grow the area of executive training. </p><h4>How would you characterize higher education offerings in Costa Rica?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DV</strong> Students enrolled in higher education in Costa Rica study for three years for their bachelors' degree and then for another two years beyond that in order to earn their specialization. This is essentially the same system as is used in the US and Spain, and it gives graduates a competitive advantage over those from countries like Colombia and Nicaragua.</p><h4>Does INCAE have plans to expand beyond Costa Rica and Nicaragua?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EB</strong> We have no intention of growing our number of campuses beyond two. That said, if there is a need in our executive education program to hold specific training in another country such as Peru, Ecuador, or Panama, we do that. Our professors go there for short-term training courses. Our MBA programs are offered either in Costa Rica or Nicaragua, and nowhere else. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company developed in Costa Rica over the years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Javier Quirós</strong> In 1957, my father was working in agriculture and was looking for a four-wheel drive vehicle. He had heard of Toyota. He ordered a few cars and later realized he liked the business of selling. By 1959, he quit his career in agriculture and worked with Toyota. He later set up its first assembly plant. This lasted until 1983 when the law changed. Toyota had the number-one market share in 1971 with the Corolla model and has remained in that position. In 1997, we hired the CEO of the company and set up a board of directors and things started to change more professionally. We have been lucky and the company has grown greatly nationally and internationally, mainly in the US. </p><p><span></span><strong>Juan Pablo Schneider</strong> AutoStar was established in 2003 as a small operation. The Kaufmann Group from Chile has represented drivers' products for more than 65 years. The Kaufmann Group now has a presence in Chile, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, and we have been in Central America since 2010. We are the exclusive dealers for Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram products, as well as for Freightliner trucks. I am the regional manager overseeing Costa Rica, Panama, and Nicaragua and we have two general managers—one in Nicaragua and one in Panama. However, the biggest operation is Costa Rica, where we have 275 people working with us. Our sales figure in 2015 was around USD113 million and we expect a 6% increase in 2016.</p><h4>In 2016, Purdy invested USD11 million in Costa Rica, mostly in infrastructure, opening the Ciudad Toyota. Is Purdy planning further expansion?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JQ</strong> Ciudad Toyota is like a big hospital; it is where everything goes for after sales, body shop insurance, and so on. Ciudad Toyota is a big facility. We just bought 20,000sqm of land to move the body shop over because we were having many problems hosting the body shop externally. We are also placing an assembly plant for Hino trucks there. Hino has been owned by Toyota for many years, and it was a mostly local brand in Japan. Now, it has decided to go worldwide and open markets and assembly plants. With this new assembly plant, we will only produce a few trucks a month. Our idea is to convince Hino it can build a bigger assembly plant and export to Latin America from Costa Rica. We are located in the middle of the Americas and can export to South America, the islands, and North America</p><h4>What are the characteristics of your market share evolution in Costa Rica and how do you foresee the market evolving?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JPS </strong>Take the example of the luxury market; when you normally talk about Mercedes-Benz, it is usually along with BMW and Audi, not Lexus or Land Rover. In this area, we have seen strong growth of around 50% YoY in 2016 with new SUV products and our market share has grown considerably as a result. In 2015, our market share was 26% and as of 2Q2016 we are at 33% market share in the luxury realm. As for the market in general, it is clearly growing. We had a significant boom with exports in March and the last two years have been good in Costa Rica. However, I do not expect this growth to continue at the same rate. In 2H2016, business will freeze a little and I expect growth of perhaps 15-16%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major transformations CCCL has implemented in the past year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Hana Chaar Choueib </strong>We are celebrating our 14th anniversary this year and are introducing innovative ideas to be able to cope with the increasing number of patients approaching us. The economic environment is anything but positive at the moment, and we need to raise USD15 million to secure treatment for our patients, which is why we are mobilizing our efforts to guarantee the money despite the downturn in fundraising. Our strategy has been reoriented to approach as many donors as we can, regardless of their potential to donate money. We have introduced a wider spectrum of programs dedicated to individual and small donors and the response has been positive so far. We have always been completely transparent with our donors, have good brand recognition, and are open to people who want to see how we work and how we invest donations.</p><h4>What are your main partnerships abroad and how do they contribute to the work of CCCL in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HCC</strong> Our most significant partnership in the US is with St. Jude Hospital, which contributes USD1 million annually, used for research and certain medical programs to provide early diagnosis to patients. Even if a patient is not accepted into CCCL for capacity reasons, we can still provide them with diagnosis and testing protocols to continue the treatment elsewhere. Our survival rate reaches an average of 80%, and that is a main driver to continue our work. We have also created a separate entity called CCCL UK Limited through the Lebanese diaspora settled in the UK to raise funds for the center's needs here. Regarding other Arab nations, we have hosted events and meetings with other centers since 2006, and they have turned out to be supportive of our cause and we try to keep them close. This year we will have an event in Kuwait and another in Dubai to raise funds. Of the funds we raise, 70% comes from Lebanon and the rest from abroad.</p><h4>How would you assess the support from the public sector for children's cancer treatment in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Dr. Hassan El Solh </strong>There is a high level of awareness regarding childhood cancer in Lebanon, which motivates a great amount of support from society in that aspect. There is a great sense of social responsibility to battle this catastrophic disease, and this is evident in all the volunteering work carried out here at the center, whether it is for medical, financial, or educational reasons. We also get support from the Ministry of Public Health and from the National Social Security Fund for partial coverage of the patients' expenses during their treatment, including chemo and radiation therapy. We have come to realize that people maintain the support when they see the results in children that leave the center healthy.</p><h4>What is the main challenge currently facing CCCL?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HCC</strong> The main challenge is the cost of healthcare since the treatment involves hospitalization, medication, intensive care, surgical procedures, and radiation. Moreover, the biological modifiers employed during the treatment are truly expensive and can cost around USD200,000 in some cases. The challenge for us is to provide treatment to as many patients as possible whilst maintaining the best technological applications and a state-of-the-art treatment free of cost to our patients. We also require our staff to be experienced in their fields and to be trained for some of the varied tasks the center carries out, and that implies a challenge as well.</p><h4>What would you like CCCL to achieve in the upcoming year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HES</strong> Aligned with the AUBMC's 2020 Vision to expand to the new Medical Center of the American University of Beirut, which is being built next to the existing campus; we intend to be able to help a growing number of patients. This is a major expansion at the level of clinical care. We also established the Genomic Center recently thanks to a generous donation and now have the platform and infrastructure to conduct research at the biological level of cancer. We have had a great outcome in terms of cancer treatment and aim to go to a higher level to reach other places in the region and internationally. We want to become a world-class center with the leading vision on childhood cancer treatment. That will not happen in a year, but we aim for it to occur as soon as possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has recent macroeconomic volatility affected your operation here?</h4><p><strong>John Matallana</strong> In the local market, prices rose due to the increased price of raw materials following the depreciation of the peso. However, in terms of exports our prices were much more competitive. One of our main allies in Colombia is Postobon, a soft drinks producer that we support in cold chain services. If Postobon increases its sales, it has to sell its products cold, so we have to be behind it, providing it with fridges when necessary. Another positive factor is the strong campaign that we launched to encourage SMEs to buy or renew refrigeration equipment. In Colombia, businesses are growing day by day, and we closed 2015 with 43% growth in sales in COP compared to 2014.</p><p><strong>Sakae Machida</strong> The exchange rate had always been stable, but this year the COP dropped by 40% against the US dollar. Normally, we import some products from the US from brands such as Sony, LG, or Samsung, so it affects us. In order to find a solution, we started to import from China, but the project did not work. Colombians want well-recognized brands for their home appliances. It is difficult to import at those prices, and major international companies have their own stores in Colombia as well.</p><h4>Which segment of the market does Electrojaponesa target?</h4><p><strong>SM</strong> We sell home appliances, televisions, audio products, smartphones, tables, PCs, and more. We target the middle class in Colombia, providing it with basic home appliances; the middle class in Colombia is growing and the market is changing, which is why we are constantly adapting our business strategies. In Colombia there are six different social classes according to income. For the majority of our 45 years here, our market was exclusively the high-income segment, but there are important market niches to be filled in the lower economic classes.</p><h4>Do you have plans in place to expand beyond your current markets?</h4><p><strong>JM</strong> We are interested in Florida in the US and Central America. We are not interested in Mexico because it is a country where there are many big players already. To be competitive there we would need a local factory, whereas other countries can be accessed from here, such as Ecuador and Chile. It is important to highlight that our location in Cartagena is close to the port, a factor that helps us distribute our materials efficiently.</p><p><strong>SM</strong> We do not have expansion plans at the moment, but if the economy improves, we would like to open new stores in other regions. In terms of internationalization we do not have planned strategies, we prefer to put all our effort in one country rather than expanding our business abroad.</p><h4>What is the production capacity of your manufacturing plant?</h4><p><strong>JM</strong> We can manufacture around 10,000-12,000 refrigerators a month. This year we are exporting three times more than in 2015. Also, we are renewing the plant to reduce our carbon emissions and improve our energy efficiency. Our new products are not harmful to the environment; for example, old refrigerators needed around three years to be degraded, now all of the dangerous gases can be removed in two weeks.</p><h4>What unique advantages does your company leverage?</h4><p><strong>JM</strong> One of our main advantages is our location in Cartagena, specifically its port. It helps to develop the local economy and for our business it is cheaper to deliver products through the port than via the road network. It provides direct access to Central America and the east coast of the US. For example, this month 80% of our goods were delivered though the port. The key point is to optimize all the options and see the opportunities that the location offers to organize production processes.</p><p><strong>SM</strong> We have had an online presence for three years, but we are still making improvements. Online demand in Colombia is slow in comparison to other countries. Colombian people are much more traditional; they prefer to see items in the store before buying them and the culture is distrustful of online platforms and even banks, but the mentality is changing. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p><strong>SM</strong> Our main focus is constant innovation. Our purpose is to improve our products that we sell and improve the customer service that we provide. We aim to be different due to our service and learn how to advise people according to their necessities. Another goal is to have a faster logistic process with effective delivery to the client. We also aim to offer high-quality technical service and everything related to reinforcing the costumer service.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company perform in 2015?</h4><p><strong>Carlos Alberto de Jesus </strong>2015 was positive for the company. We had positive results and a large portion of that came from a real estate development that we are doing. We had positive results in our textile operation as well, in which we made investments in high technology to increase our production and reduce costs. </p><p><span></span><strong>Fabian Duque </strong>2015 was a wakeup call for Finotex as we saw the dollar increasing, which generated many uncertainties and difficulties. Nevertheless, we saw positive earnings in 1H2015 compared to previous years. In 2H2015, we saw a boost in the local textile industry. It benefited from a stronger dollar, which made it more difficult to buy abroad and increased demand from local players. For Finotex, this made it easier to export as well as increased the size of our local market. </p><p><span></span>How can the textile industry in Colombia compete against other markets?</p><p><span></span><strong>CAJ </strong>Turkey could be a good point of reference. The Colombian industry cannot be a low-cost producer, but it can instead provide high-quality, added-value products. Colombia has to be an innovative player with technology in the textile world, and countries such as Turkey or Brazil can be a reference for Colombia.</p><p><span></span><strong>FD</strong> Colombia has a strategic plan not to compete in basic products because it is not competitive in this segment in terms of labor costs. We are competitive when we provide added value to clothing and other products because then we can serve certain specific niche markets where Colombia is well recognized. This is where we should focus our marketing.</p><h4>How do you balance the implementation of new technologies with providing employment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CAJ </strong>Implementing new technology can be challenging in the textile industry; however, it is ultimately necessary because if a company focuses just on trying to maintain its number of jobs, it will become inefficient, after which point everyone will lose their jobs. A company has to be accountable and maintain high productivity levels in order to remain competitive, and that is the idea we implemented at Fabricato to turn it into a profitable business again. A profitable company can increase its production and consequently can generate new jobs.</p><h4>Why do you think some SMEs lack ambition to go abroad and succeed as exporters?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FD</strong> The most important factor is to believe in what you produce. Sometimes Colombian companies need to believe in their potential and their strengths. There is a great deal of talent in Colombia that has not been successfully harnessed yet. Some years ago I led an industry cluster delegation from Colombia to events in Europe, the US, Mexico, and Central America. Of the companies involved, only two were able to consolidate important proposals; the other companies did not want to invest in order to go abroad. You need to have the right culture and ambition within the company and some Colombian companies lack this.</p><h4>How important is the textile industry in Medellí­n?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CAJ </strong>This industry is important for Medellí­n. The city is acknowledged as one of the main places for the textile industry worldwide, so it is the right place to be for a company like ours. We see a strong level of know-how in Medellí­n. Colombia is also an important domestic market, as the people like to consume fashion goods.</p><h4>Finotex competes internationally with several companies. What factors have helped you achieved that position abroad?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FD </strong>From the beginning, when the company was founded we focused on providing a standard of service you would find in the US or Europe. We have worked on this through R&amp;D and investment. Part of this growth was due to our location in Barranquilla; we are close to the sea, which makes us more outward looking compared to other cities in Colombia. The natural focus is to look at opportunities abroad because it is cheaper for us to take advantage of the ports' infrastructure. Step-by-step, we have increased our presence in the international market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for2016?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CAJ </strong>We expect 20% growth in our business. We downsized the company and focused on certain business units in order to be efficient. We will grow while remaining efficient and that is mandatory for the industry, which we expect to do well thanks to the local market.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>FD </strong>2016 will be a positive year. At the industry trade fair in Medellí­n in January, the outlook and atmosphere was optimistic. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Mexico to your firm globally?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Héctor Hugo</strong> Miranda Orica's international operations are divided into four zones: Australia and Indonesia, North America, South America, and the fourth zone is made up of the rest of the world, mostly Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Mexico is a part of our North American zone. Although the country is our third largest market area in North America, it is an area of rapid growth.</p><p><span></span><strong>Leif Lindholm </strong>Mexico represents a little over 10% of the global business, maybe 15%; therefore, Mexico is important for the company. As we still see possibility for growth, from here we have a major project for a copper mine in Panama that will go online in about two years. And, of course, a second plant is starting up in Cananea in the northern state of Sonora, where we still see great potential. Sonora and the Cananea mine represent 35% of our business, making it an important center for us.</p><h4>Has your business been affected by stagnant commodity prices?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HHM</strong> Our growth has definitely decreased in the last few years, but we have nevertheless continued expanding our work in Mexico with copper, gold, and coal. Copper is our fastest growing market, due to investments from Grupo Mexico, and the country is also growing strong in gold. Coal has unfortunately not grown as much. Silver remains an important part of the local economy, as Mexico is still the largest producer of silver in the world. </p><p><span></span><strong>LL </strong>I would say that it is a more normal environment today. Most mines are still working despite the difficulties the industry has seen. There aren't as many new projects going on now as they used to before but I do not see it as a negative, since our service business is still growing. Now, the industry has moved more toward the services sector, and we started that business 10 years ago so we are ahead of most of the competitors.</p><h4>How do you integrate environmental concerns into your operations?</h4><p><strong>HHM </strong>Environmental preservation is key for us. We have a comprehensive environmental impact plan worldwide and we are subject to global supervision. We respect and abide by all the environmental regulations of any country in which we operate, and we are strict in terms of applying our own standards, which are even higher than those of many governments. </p><p><strong>LL</strong> When it comes to the global environmental issues in the mining industry, Mexico has been doing well. Without a fair level of precautions, it will be more and more difficult to get permits to build mines; hence, future trends point at a reduction and reuse in water consumption. Metso has a strict program for these things, mostly because it is a Finnish company, and we are aware of the environment. </p><h4>What is your outlook over the medium term?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HHM</strong> We are the main player in Mexico and North America. To maintain our leading position and market share, we have to find new ways to grow ever faster and we are prepared to help modernize the mining sector in Mexico. We are convinced that we can help this industry become more competitive and we want to introduce technologies to facilitate that. We can contribute not only new technologies related to equipment or products, but also knowledge transfer and practical know-how. One of the advantages of being the big player in the country is that we can bring best practices into the sector here. We want to set the standards in the market and introduce new methods and technologies into all areas of mining, be it blasting, hauling, digging, transporting, crutching, milling, or leaching. </p><p><span></span><strong>LL </strong>We need to ensure that we keep growing, especially in the service area. This is a cyclical business; therefore, we will not see very many new projects in the following years. As long as the economy continues to grow, the mining industry will still be there. Mexico still has areas that have not been explored yet, leaving room to grow. We still have a lot to do with existing customers. Most of the mines in Mexico are our customers, though not all of them are in the same area as they should be. We are currently getting close to Frisco to deepen our ties. We still have a lot do to, especially with the smaller companies, many of which are Canadian-owned. I see a great future for our business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can ABB leverage on Panama to expand in the region?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Blas González R </strong>We based our headquarters for Central America and the Caribbean in Panama. One of our tasks is to develop those countries where we do not yet have offices, like Nicaragua. Part of our growth strategy is to increase post maintenance and preventative maintenance for our equipment. We currently have two servicing stations in Panama, but want to expand our capabilities in repair and maintenance as well as customer training both in Panama and the rest of the region. This is where we believe we will grow. Here in Panama we manufacture equipment for industry and utilities. The latter will continue to grow but industry will not be as strong in Panama. We have some small industries like cement plants, water plants, and some mines, but other countries like Trinidad &amp; Tobago, which has a huge petrochemical complex, or the Dominican Republic, which has not only sugar but also nickel, have the advantage in industry. Panama is a country that supports the rest of the region more than its own industry.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>Nicanor Rivera</strong> At the moment there are many opportunities for ABB to expand into the region. One of these is the proposed $200 million interconnection between Panama and Colombia, a project in which we would like to get involved. ABB has a presence in both countries, selling equipment to the engineering and construction companies that are carrying out projects. The problem is that we have to wait for the government to announce the project, open bids, and select contractors, and then we can approach those companies to see if we can supply them with the equipment.</p><h4>How much progress has been made in the interconnection project between Panama and Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NR </strong>The project is currently in the environmental study stage. When this is finished, they will make the decision on whether to go ahead with it. Colombia is pushing to finalize the process by going across forested areas, but Panama wants to try going under the sea. We do not yet know which way it will go. We think the submarine cable will be the final decision, and I hope this is the case as it will be better for us.</p><p><span></span><strong>BG</strong> ABB is a manufacturer of submarine cables, so that would be good for us. We are not in the transmission lines industry because we sold that division of the company eight years ago. We also want the forest to be preserved for environmental reasons. We do not carry out projects, but sell loose products and provide services to major players. Unless we go enter into a joint venture with another company for a specific project then we are an electrical automation company. It is important for us to work with local contractors who have good quality and knowledge of the market.</p><h4>How has Panama performed over the last year compared to the rest of the world and how do you assess its future potential?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NR</strong> Panama is a country that is developing rapidly, and thus there are many new projects, such as the canal or airport expansion. The metro system is another opportunity for us and we believe we have a good chance of getting involved in that. In addition, there is the expansion of the harbor, the development of an airport for the Panama Pacific area, and many other opportunities.</p><p><span></span><strong>BG</strong> In the long term there are major opportunities in Panama in the industrial electrical sector for a company like ours. Our performance this year was good but not as strong as we expected, simply because there were not as many government construction projects. The metro was supposed to have started in the first quarter of 2015 but was only awarded in October. Similarly, the expansion of Tocumen International Airport was delayed by a year. We are still waiting for the official opening of the bidding process for the airport expansion, which we expected in January or February. We are waiting on another $400m project. Though this year was not as good, in the long term Panama is the country to be in because it will continue to grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about how the entry of multinationals is changing the way that business is done in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CARLOS RODRÍGUEZ</strong> There are two clear general trends: internationalization and accessing capital markets. If you are entering the international markets, you have to change your board. You can't have a board of seven Colombians, with one or two having some international business experience. If they are thinking seriously about international expansion, they need to adapt the board accordingly. Meanwhile, many other companies are realizing that to grow they need to raise capital. They can do it one of two ways, either through bond issuances or equity by going public through an IPO. Being a publicly-traded company, or having public debt in the market changes the dynamic of the board rather substantially, and it changes the profiles required.</p><p><span></span><strong>BELTRÁN BENJUMEA </strong>When multinational companies set up shop in Colombia, they face a real shortage of people fluent in English, and their main objective is finding people who can fill this gap. The level of talent in Colombia is high, and the only downside fluency in English. For foreign companies, this communication breakdown makes it hard to build teams. Many observers are waiting for the peace agreement, and the country is entering an important period. All indicators point to a solution in the future, and when that happens, it will open a floodgate of international investment. The current macro-economics outlay is not so attractive, because the dollar is very expensive, the oil and gas sector has declined considerably, and the country's rating in the global security index is worse than previous years</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in the kinds of multinationals that are expanding their presence in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CR</strong> Colombia remains a promising market for many multinationals, across a variety of sectors, from Consumer Goods, to Financial Services or Natural Resources. Given its size and relative stability (vis-í -vis most neighbors), large multinationals continue investing and betting on growth in this market. When Europe and the US were in recession, many companies invested in emerging markets and Colombia delivered solid growth during this period, which has given the country credibility with these organizations. Multinationals in some industries such as Infrastructure, Financial Services or Consumer Goods, are still betting on growth while extraction industries, such as mining and oil and gas are facing a much tougher environment due to dramatically lower commodity prices.</p><h4>How will redundancy in the hydrocarbons service industries—up to 20%—affect your revenues and your base in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BB</strong> Even though activities in the oil and gas sector declined, the infrastructure, construction, and civil construction industries picked up, and that balanced out potential losses in other industries and offset any declines we might have experienced. Bear in mind that we experienced 50% growth. But if the oil industry did not decline, our bottom line would have been even more substantial. Today we are growing in infrastructure, IT, FMCG, and the financial services sector, in both banking and insurance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We are trying to reverse this and reclaim our reputation and position, and with the prospect of peace we consider this a field that the nation will need. We now have a research center in the north of Chia, where we conduct research and maintain greenhouses, the science of which we have a strong pedigree in. We are also working with Leuven University in Belgium to restart agricultural research. Additionally, we are considering the establishment of pre-graduate programs, potentially in agricultural engineering. Today, we offer food engineering, which links biology, agriculture, food, and engineering, and are working to establish another engineering program that links to the agricultural sector. </p><p><span></span><strong>LEONIDAS LÓPEZ HERRÁN</strong> We have a technology park that promotes various technological innovations and activities, and we work closely with other educational institutions in various countries, including universities in Japan, Spain, and Brazil. On top of that we have various rural programs to improve the use of technologies, the quality of agricultural practices such as irrigation, innovation and sustainability, and social and economic development. Our students and staff also actively travel throughout Colombia and work in various parts of the country.</p><h4>What are the university's key investments and expansion plans?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CMVW</strong> We are developing another building for the arts, due for completion in January 2016. And additionally, we are modernizing management and are putting an integrated information system in place, which has been extremely challenging. All processes have become integrated, which has required comprehensive input of all data without exception. We integrated the finance system last year and this January we initiated the academic system, which is part of our 2020 vision for development. We have to adjust all university procedures into this system. This has been an expensive investment in terms of time and money, and we hope to complete it by the end of this year. </p><p><span></span><strong>LLH</strong> We always invest first and foremost in the quality of the education we provide and the quality of our academic offering. We work to constantly improve our staff, our technology, our infrastructure, our administrative platforms, where we use the SAP and Banner systems, for example. We seek to keep identifying the various educational needs of different parts of the country and see how we can help meet those needs. We always enter new projects with partners and through alliances, be it with the government or private institutions. Our aim is to increase our services and educational infrastructure to all regions that require it, and that can sustain and support it. Our main objective in the coming year is to keep offering more opportunities to more people. We believe that will also translate into better communities and contribute to the development of Colombia overall. There are increasing opportunities to help the people at the base of the pyramid, and it's only by helping the development of this segment of the population that the country can truly develop as a whole in the long term. </p><h4>What alliances have you developed with international organizations and institutions?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CMVW</strong> We are conducting research and bringing in PhD holding academics from all over the world, who almost always come with links to external universities. For example, we work together with L'Université Paris Decartes and we have experience in science pedagogy, through which we are better able to foster scientific thinking among students. We have been working with that institution for two years reinforcing a project that we call the Tadeolab to develop an interdisciplinary methodology. We also work together with the Alveiro University in Portugal. Through our association with this institution we intend to link the university with a network of innovative universities. </p><p><span></span><strong>LLH</strong> We have two types of international activity: one is classic academic activity, sending members of our academic staff and students to other universities in exchange programs like any other institute of higher education. But secondly, we also have a model whereby we transfer our educational model to African countries, starting with Ivory Coast, and shortly expanding to include Benin. We have packaged our model and our system, with everything from how to operate and manage it, how to set it up, how to conduct research, and undertake academic processes, and administration, among others. We want to establish this system in the Ivory Coast, which will require around six or seven years, and we are receiving funding and support for this project from the IFC and the World Bank, as well as other agencies including the governments of both Colombia and the Ivory Coast, who are keen to promote rare South-South programs such as this. The Ivory Coast is very similar to Colombia, in terms of being a developing country, a tropical country with similar climatic conditions, and similar needs in rural areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about the role that your respective organizations play in promoting agriculture in Colombia?</h4><p><strong>CARLOS HERNANDO MOLINA DURAN</strong> The Colombian Association of Manufacturers and Suppliers of Sugarcane, Procaña, represents its members and the agroindustrial sector of sugarcane in their interactions with the state, assisting also with sourcing the means for sugarcane growers to develop their business, creating jobs and helping to develop and modernize the sector in Colombia. Procaña has the responsibility to encourage producers to work toward improving productivity, and to adopt innovative practices that render them competitive and efficient. We also promote programs and partnerships to take advantage of economies of scale, funding research and development projects that foster the social, economic and environmental development of the sugar cane producing communities in the Valle de Cauca and other regions of Colombia. With regard to generating energy and processing sugarcane as a bio-combustible commodity, we are investing to improve energy efficiency in our sugar cane mills, where we are modernizing our boiler and turbine generator equipment, allowing for more efficient use of the fibers in the combustion process. This line of agro-industrial production is one of the most promising in Colombia today.</p><p><span></span><strong>LEONARDO ARIZA RAMÍREZ</strong> The Federation is committed to research into, as well as the technological, economic, social and environmental development of its panela (brown sugar) sub-sectors. The federation guides public policies, and manages public and private resources in order to improve the quality of life of those families that belong to the federation. There is an outlined vision from 2009 until 2016 that guides all the paneleros in Colombia. Nowadays, there are more than 350,000 families in Colombia whose livelihood depends on the production of panela and we have an important direct and indirect employment generation of 855,365 employees. After coffee, production of this product employs the second highest amount of workers in Colombia's agroindustry.  Panela cane is a part of daily consumption, in the form of brown sugar. Today, we have 240,000 acres planted with sugar cane in 27 departments, which encompasses 511 municipalities; this means that about half of all municipalities in the country produce panela. We produce more than 1,200,000 tons of panela annually, and as you can see, this is an important social and economic source of revenue in the regions and its value rises up to $1.2 billion per year.</p><h4>What are the main challenges faced by Procaña today?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CD</strong> Procaña is working to position the image and reputation of the agribusiness of sugar cane, and as opinion makers, we are lobbying for policy and creating projects that positively impact sustainability indicators, and always working to ensure the environmental interests of the whole sector. From the agro-industrial sector of sugar cane, there is a significant commitment to actively reducing climate change.</p><h4>Can you talk about what makes Panela an important product?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LR</strong> Panela does not originate in Colombia, and has its origin in India. Yet in Colombia, the crop is rooted in culture and family tradition, whereby today it is one of the main products in the family diet. Colombia has the number one panela intake per capita in the world and ranks second in panela production, after India. Actually, panela consumption per capita is about 20 kg per year, which shows its importance. 95% of Colombian families consume panela in various forms, basically as a hot or cold beverage, drunk with food, or else served cold with lemon. Panela is also used widely in the treatment of colds. Another way to use panela is grated or powered for healing scars. Doctors used it during the Second World War. Nowadays, many surgeons still use panela to heal scars. It is also used in cosmetic facemasks, and it is starting to appear in cocktails, bread, cakes, and cookies. This product adds flavor to food and is a 100% natural sweetener, and is classified as a functional food in its own right, which provides us with an excellent opportunity as the world increasingly turns to natural products. I know for example, that in Europe 50% of sweeteners are natural. And so, panela has a true opportunity to enter the major markets; indeed, during the past year our exports we have grown 20% to around $1.5 billion dollars.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What projects are you undertaking, and what role will they play in Colombia's economic development?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PEDRO GÓMEZ</strong> We have built numerous shopping malls. The first key one, Unicentro, was built 37 years ago, and since then we have put up 20 additional schemes. We are building a residential compound in the city called La Felicidad, comprising a city of 17,000 homes, and around 60,000-65,000 inhabitants. It has all the amenities that a city requires, such as parks, a large shopping mall, a library, and schools. We have also factored in what we call and entertainment center, which involves a large area over which people can enjoy a wide range of sports as well as find wellness facilities such as spas, saunas, physiotherapy, and health foods. The mall will also feature beauty facilities making it more than a familiar retail outlet.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>LUIGI NARDACCI </strong>In terms of Colombian infrastructure we are still participating in the construction of the Palotal Bridge in Barrancabermeja. This is important work has a significant impact from technical, knowledge, and reference perspectives. The project involves a bridge in swampland with a significant environmental restriction, and we are working with technology not before deployed in Colombia. Other infrastructure on which we have worked includes Calle 6, on which a reclassification of the road was made. And currently we are working on Desnivel Laureano Gomez en la Calle 94 con NQS, which is a rather significant project in terms of contract value and technical aspect, we are using a system founded by threshing sheet pile definitive up to 39 meters deep. Another important infrastructure project on which we are working is the Tailagua Bridge over the Magdalena River. Other important works we are involved in include residential schemes, shopping centers, and office towers. We are engaged predominantly in Bogotá, and are working on the largest skyscraper in the capital.</p><h4>Lately, your work has been focused on a new chapter in urbanism in Colombia's cities and peripheral towns. How do you feel urban centers ought to expand throughout the country?</h4><p><strong>PG</strong> As a constructor, city planning is of considerable interest to me. The science of the settlement of communities has developed clearly in the intervening years since the 1930 Athens Conference resulting in the Athens Declaration. The latter document defined urban zoning and subsequent conferences have led to a more humanistic definition of how a city should be laid out. We offer consultancy services that improve cities for the benefit of families and wider communities. <br>My company has contributed to the improvement of the city and its inhabitants, by fostering the notion of cities developing into self-sufficient urban centers, essential services and facilities as well as homes houses, business, and places of work, all within walking distance. This concept runs hand in hand with efforts to reduce chronic traffic congestion.</p><h4>What strategy has Galante followed in its regional expansion?</h4><p><strong>LN</strong> Galante has two branches offices in the Dominican Republic and one in Ecuador. From here we manage Galante Cimentaciones Peru, which is an approximately 99% subsidiary. We collaborate and operate with Trevi Galante at a management level. We intend to seize opportunities and expand in Central America, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. Trevi Group is present throughout the American continent, mainly in Venezuela, the US, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. Galante is a strong partner for construction projects because of the technical ability we bring to the project. For example, in Bogotá, we acquired a large contract, the Centro Mundial de Negocios America (Pedregal).  This project is a combination of residential and infrastructure construction. We are going to run deep foundations, through large diameter piles, diaphragm walls perimeter and fingers with a new technology never used before in Colombia and in various parts of Latin America. We are importing Trevi's highly specialized machinery called Hidromill from Italy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do ports play in the regional economy, and how does the connectivity that you offer play into the national transportation network?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OSCAR ISAZA BENJUMEA</strong> I consider Antioquia to be the Colombian region with the highest development potential in the Agro Industrial Business, with one million hectares of lands. The region of El Valle de Cauca has 250,000ha. Another factor that makes Antioquia particularly interesting to me is the location of the harbor. In fact, it is the nearest port to Medellí­n and Bogotá, two mayor consumption nodes of the country. In this sense, there have been major developments in transport infrastructure. Relevant works have also been done in 4G, as well as Mar 1 and Mar2, Tollo's tunnel and Las Americas Motorways (Pací­fico 1 and Pací­fico 2). Puerto Antioquia is a highly competitive harbor infrastructure for import and export activities in Colombia, especially for Medellí­n and Bogotá. For example, the banana sector delivers almost 75 million 20 kilo-boxes to Europe and the US. Today, all production reaches those markets through the port of Uraba (80%) and Altamar (20%). The port of Antioquia will be the next agro-industrial export hub thanks also to its proximity to 75 million ha. The region also has an airport with almost 25 daily flights. It is an advanced and modern structure. It's a regional airport but it has all the necessary conditions to achieve our objectives.</p><p><span></span><strong>JUAN PABLO CEPEDA</strong> On June 1st we started receiving trucks in order to check the systems for transferring liquid from trucks to tanks; shortly thereafter we received the first liquid vessel, marking the first official operation on the maritime side by the Pacific Group. We discharged 138,000 barrels into tanks, which allowed us to test our equipment. The rest of the product was taken directly to barges. Those were the very first official products that were received at the terminal. At this point, they are more oriented towards calibrating our equipment at the terminal. The first commercial operation will take place in the first weeks of July 2015, even though we have continued to receive trucks with products and are set to deliver products to the landside. The port is complex in the sense that it has many possible combinations beyond simply receiving by truck and delivering by vessel. We can receive or deliver by vessel, receive or deliver by truck, and you deliver by barge as well, which provides a wide spectrum of possibilities. And meanwhile, the multi board facility is almost ready too.</p><h4>How do you envisage competition between the new harbor and the other main ports in Colombia's Caribbean coasts playing out in the future?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OB</strong> Cartagena has advanced port infrastructure, with a high level of industrialization in the region of Mamonal. Nowadays, the port is very competitive as well as ports in Barranquilla and Santa Marta. In Uraba, there are very good conditions for the banana market. They still load up bananas in a traditional but very efficient way. They do not use cases, but rotating drums with refrigerating pallets. Recently, the use of cases has taken off from Uraba to Cartagena, which are then sent to Europe and the US. This requires a huge investment in logistics and transportation, of almost $80 million, but this is going to be the future of this industry. Currently, more than 80% of the total shipments are loaded into refrigerated vessels.</p><h4>What aspects of the port operations have become more competitive due to the FTAs?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JC</strong> If you consider all operations in conjunction, on the liquid side, Puerto Bahí­a has considerable distinguishing offerings. Puerto Bahí­a financed a bridge connecting Cartagena with Baru in what was an investment of about $11.8 million. We were also involved in dredging the access channel to the Bay of Cartagena. This had a 15m draught eight months ago, which worked for Panamax-sized vessels. Yet in partnership with a private company and the government, we dredged it to 20.5m in an investment of $60 million.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the company's key milestones since it was established?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LENNART RODRIGUEZ</strong> Canal tr3ce has achieved significant financial success by developing three distinct lines of business. The first is a production company within the network, which provides services to government entities and private companies, which benefit from an existing technical capability and talent pool. We generate the entire concept, develop the audiovisual product, and launch it on social media. Our second line of business is event organization and planning, as there is high demand for government institutions and private companies for events that can impact their image and develop their brand recognition. We work with enterprises to develop their promotional strategy. When the concept is approved, we organize the event and carry out the strategic campaign. The third line of business is related to digital content. We reach more the 11 million viewers, and are up to date with new technology and it is important that content is broadcast widely. Studies show that children, adolescents, and parents no longer simply watch TV shows for an hour or so, but instead continually switch between media. In response, we design content according to the client's requests, and transmit it through digital pathways, creating a small piece, which has almost the same impact as a 30 or 50-minute broadcast. These lines of business render us self-sufficient, and allow us to produce high quality content on our platforms, and ultimately improve the creation of our digital content. Our goal is to establish digital land broadcasting.</p><p><span></span><strong>MIGUEL ANGEL HERRERA GARZÓN</strong> Burson Marsteller arrived in Colombia in 1997, having opened offices throughout Latin America in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Venezuela. We started working through our network, because we have a group that is well established in this country. This group is composed of several companies such as JWT, Thompson, Albury, and General Wika—we were the first multinational group in this industry to enter Colombia. We have proven successful in Latin America and are in our fourth consecutive year as the leading division in terms of growth in that market; we are outperforming Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. The primary reason we were able to register rapid and stable growth was the strength of the Colombian economy, which politically speaking is indeed stable, especially when compared to our neighbours. The second factor is related to our changing strategy; historically, ours was a low profile company highly dependent upon our brand, and, hence, expected clients to approach us.</p><h4>Which subjects other than the convergence of technologies are you working on today?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LR</strong> We have certain principal categories. The first is technology, where we focus on correct use, and develop content that promotes the appropriate utilization of technological advances. We have created a number of programs with this format, including IATIC, Viajeros 3.0, En ti confio, and Vive digital, among others. The second category is the construction of values. We are firm believers that values should be encouraged from a young age. We promote messages of tolerance, respect, and responsibility during the education process, to ensure the development of better citizens. The third category is related to entertainment such as music and other forms of leisure, such that children and young people spend their free time with positive alternatives to the temptations of substance abuse. We work with schools and universities to create this content in the best manner possible. We also have periodicals, which target a broader audience. Music is the strong suite in this category, and we leverage the format to educate. Our content is not similar to the music video shows on other networks, because we take a historic approach to music that appeals to both a young and older audience. </p><h4>How has the company adapted in light of the economic development of Colombia?</h4><p><strong>MAHG</strong> Colombia is currently on a major public affairs offensive; keen to have its voice heard on major platforms such as the OECD, and is working with public agendas, policies, and commitments. Because of rising national prosperity the nation needs a better regulatory framework across its industrial matrix. It is essential in this context for our clients to know how to operate, and best shape the agenda most relevant to them. The fact that clients often lack the internal knowledge or capabilities to shape such agendas prompted us to create the Public Affairs Group, comprising professionals from government and trade associations, who know the language, have the contacts and experience with government, and are ready to help our clients to share the public agenda.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><strong></strong>What have been the major achievements of your company since it was established?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FERNANDO RESTREPO</strong> Being in business for 95 years is a milestone for us, as not all the companies enjoy such longevity. We achieved 95 years by being the principal distillery in Colombia, as a financially solid company in a world where public distilleries tend to be weak. We feel from the financial and commercial point of view we are stronger than ever. We celebrate our Anniversary firstly with our workers, who have remained with us over the years. We celebrate it with our public, our distributors, and our principal clients. We also celebrate it with our owners; the governor and his cabinet.</p><p><span></span><strong>JAIME ECHAVARRIA LOPEZ</strong> Our enterprise is the third most important distribution company in Colombia. We are active across three product categories, namely wines and liquors, personal care, soaps, and detergents, and food, with an essentially even distribution. We currently reach 55,000 points of sale, and while we supply medium-sized convenience stores, arguably our most important clients are the neighborhood "Mom and Pop“ stores. Well established today, the company was founded 57 years ago. The other two distributors are huge in that they distribute their own production output. Although we do to an extent, our orientation is not to work extensively with consumer commodities, and we pride ourselves on building new brands and products.</p><h4>What is the company currently focusing its investments on?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FRR</strong> In 2014, we worked considerably to modernize our factory and the installations, because we have been present for 45 years and there were many upgrades needed. We assembled a bottling line, which is state of the art, allowing us to produce faster and in a more integrated manner. From the moment the bottle arrives, it is packaged and sent to the winery, all of which is totally integrated. We have increased our alcohol storage capacity, with many infrastructural and office improvements. We have invested heavily in the brand, at around $25 million dollars in 2014, in advertising and promotions. In 2015, we plan to invest around $30 million. We are going from 25 to 30 in brand investments, not just in above the line investment, but also promotions, events, parties, and so on. In 2014, we increased sales by 2% and sold products worth around $480 million.</p><p><span></span><strong>JEL</strong> We are in an important phase for the company, which was formerly heavily sales oriented in nature and centrally managed. Today, however, the company is prioritizing efficiency in the markets it serves. We have operations at nine locations in Colombia, each of which are different. If I am able to communicate effectively, we will operate better locally, with distribution efforts adapted to local markets. We are working toward a new structure that cedes autonomy to each local operation. Our structure's basic components are its corporate architecture, choosing the right products for the markets, and working on a new administrative model to implement this. And beneath these components is an efficient IT platform. We are in a market of lower margins, and, therefore, improving productivity, achieving faster turnaround times, and better communication with the consumer are imperatives. We are bringing in new talent and better utilizing our optimized IT platform. </p><h4>What are your objectives for the next year?</h4><p><strong>JRR</strong> Our main goal is to help to make Antioquia the most educated region. This is always our priority, helping our stakeholders with resources sent to education and health. Secondly, we are going to work hard in our two principal categories, aguardiente and rum. Once one is a leader going from 55% to 60%, it is not important. Growing the categories overall and making that 55% represent more bottles is the important thing. Therefore, we need to focus on defending our market in Antioquia. </p><p><span></span><strong>JEL</strong> We are not particularly ambitious in terms of results for 2015, although we forecast YoY growth of 7%. Once you discount the 3% to 4% increase in price, it emerges that we have grown in unit terms. We are also working on interesting categories (candies, health drinks, and canned foods) experiencing rapid growth, and will be distributing new brands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of your operations and the sector in general?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>Fabian Dario Llano</strong> While gold is a widely purchased commodity, we used to have to choose whom we would sell to for legal reasons. We develop stable relationships with our customers, and with the recent crisis, the demand for gold rose as many became reluctant to invest in bonds or equities; yet we are prohibited from selling the commodity as desired. We face strict regulations in Colombia, requiring us to submit monthly reports, and to report our sales to regulators, which means that we scrutinize our customers closely. In Colombia we have two variables, which are the price per ounce, and the dollar. The current price per ounce has decreased, but the peso fell from 1,800 to 2,400 to the dollar in 2014, which caused the gold price to rise nationwide. Mine earnings are up by 20% thanks to dollar fluctuations. Meprecol commercializes gold, so the price does not affect us as much because we have a commission business. On the other hand, I expect a decrease in the next year due to the new regulations. But whenever companies start acclimatizing to a decrease in the sector, it starts growing again. Thus in the short-term, the sector will decrease, although in the medium-term it will resume an ascent.</p><p><span></span><strong>Eduardo Jaramillo Cuervo</strong> We are highly dependent on the industry, which ostensibly concerns plastics for consumer goods and pipes. We are heading into glass for construction. If local industries do not consolidate and strengthen sustaining investment would be a challenge. You cannot invest in a country where the industry your business depends on is declining. With the decline of the peso, it is likely these industries will increase production. In the end, everyone is against the US dollar, which is tough competition. Minerals are entering the market from Spain and Turkey that we need to compete against, although the pipe industry has no issues with imports being a local market. The prices of raw materials for plastics should be down currently. If the price of PVC declines, you are not so relevant to the formulation. And if the price of oil continues to decline, there would be scarce incentive to keep introducing your products.</p><h4>What have been the key legislative changes in the mining sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FL</strong> Mining has been active in Colombia since the days of Simon Bolivar, and the first regulations were introduced along with early mining projects, with some of the codes intended to be permanent. Yet over time legislation became anachronistic, and reforms were necessary. Mining requires legislation, state sponsorship, and a serious program that can remain in place for at least ten years. Yet the projects that we undertake are characterized by legal uncertainty. There have been so many sudden legislative changes that investors have become wary. There must be serious and clear norms for all of those involved, which means unifying information and above all, legal certainty and political will. One of the recent legislative changes, Case 214, was particularly interesting. The change barred sudden regulatory amendments in the sector that would have an abrupt impact on miners. Colombia is adapting, but we are adapting in a climate of limited legal certainty and political will.</p><h4>What are the main segments you want to develop at the moment? </h4><p><span></span><strong>EC</strong> For oil and gas, the minerals needed are sand, calcium carbonate, and barites. We are traditionally very strong in calcium in Colombia. It is the most present mineral in the country, and it is used in almost everything from toothpaste to anti-acids and food, among others. While producing the product, one can also specialize in the high value segments. These industrial minerals are commodities because of the price, but the commodities are negotiated on the stock exchange. The positive regarding these minerals is that we are limited in sources and destinations. This provides us with the opportunity to add value through innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important developments that you are witnessing in the energy sector these days and how they relate to your activities?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Jose Arcos Gas</strong> in Colombia is a highly dynamic industry, with considerable private investment, and we are representative on all levels of the supply chain, from exploration, to commercialization. The best companies in the world are in Colombia exploring for gas; Exxon, Shell, and our own Ecopetrol. With regards to commercialization we have the most renowned management companies in the world helping maintain this segment as an attractive one for investors, such as Fenosa of Spain, EMP, our national company from Medellí­n, and Promigas. We aim to ensure effective public policy so that investment remains at the desired rate. We need to make sure that our legal stability remains, not only to attract investors but also for the benefit of the public sector. A process is underway, for better distillation facilities, and exports, for which we need to ensure that the rules and system are symmetrical, and that international trading standards are in place. In the future, if the supply of our gas is restricted, we have measures and mechanisms in place to ensure that national demand can be met, this means that we give clear signals to investors that investments are safe, whilst ensuring that national demand is always protected—it is our job to oversee this.</p><p><span></span><strong>Magí­n Ortiga Pareja</strong> Nowadays Colombia is the 7th or the 8th country in the world in terms of compressed natural gas use for transportation. Recently we reached a record high of having 500,000 gas-powered vehicles in Barranquilla, reducing negative externalities on the environment. We also have mass transport vehicles. In Medellí­n, for example, all mass transportation uses natural gas. Cartagena is going to use natural gas as fuel too, and we will be launching this for 2016.</p><h4>What measures is Colombia taking to ensure that all levels of the supply chain are prepared for the potential expiry of gas resources?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JA</strong> This implicates the three different parts of the supply chain: Exploration, infrastructure, and commercialization. In exploration the most important thing is to ensure that we maintain the rhythm of exploration. It's worth noting that in this country there is no real distinction between the exploration of petrol and gas, they are searching for hydrocarbon reserves. In infrastructure, the remuneration aspect is very important, we have transports tubes, and distribution tubes, and all infrastructure offered by the service industries. The remuneration is fundamental because it depends exclusively on the points where gas is found in the exploration process and the gas that is commercialized for end users. These people have very little management over the economic variables of the two points, so we have to guarantee them with effective regulation. We have been establishing commercial criteria to ensure that all transactions are real, and remunerated at all levels of supply in such a way that ensures sustainable commerce. The final seller of the gas needs to ensure that they are paid as that is what the sustainability of gas flow depends on. This stage is subject to various different rules, environmental, commercial, competition and trust related laws. This is also essential to incentivize the consumption of gas with various commercial schemes and ensure the supply chain remains dynamic.</p><h4>How much does local industry account for gas consumption, and how is this ratio changing as household consumption gradually increases in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MP</strong> Almost 100% of industry uses natural gas as a fuel, as it is suited to cogeneration. There has been strong support from politicians who tend to see the gas issue as a driver of national development. Gas has also begun to arrive in the interior of the country. The Guajira and Cuisiana gas deposits are located there, with Gas Natural and Unión Fenosa, the Spanish company, present in the latter. In the west of the country is Gases de Occidente, which is the second or third biggest company in Colombia. Gas has been the cause of a true social revolution in Colombia, and whomever you ask will tell you that its benefits are numerous.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends have you noticed, and what are your expectations for your respective sectors moving forward?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Daniel Cortés McAllister</strong> Up until now, the biggest contributor to fiduciaries was mutual funds, or Fondos de Inversion Collectiva (FICs). A lot of these grew to have Fiduciaria Administration y Pagos, which is basically a government or corporate mandate to set money aside and make payments. This is usually seen for the construction of roads and for government contracts where the process needs a third party to ensure that the flow does not go from one party to the other without certain controls. Before the mortgage crisis in 1999, a constructor erecting a building would sell future units that weren't yet built. When the crisis hit, many of those constructors were using that money for other purposes. The industry went through a process that placed the fiduciary companies in the middle. The buyers would only deposit their money in these trust companies with a specific mandate, and not until a certain number of sales were achieved.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Pablo Trujillo Tealdo</strong> Real estate in Colombia is attractive for local and foreign investors. There are a lot of people coming to Colombia to invest in infrastructure and construction. People feel that Colombia is an attractive destination these days. For now, prices are going up and demand is stable. Businesses are sound good and providing healthy returns to investors. Energy projects in Colombia are also very attractive, but these are restricted to the bigger players. The only way for a small investor to enter the energy market is through a public company that has shares. There are currently 11 free zones. These are in the form of, for example, health free zones, oil field free zones, and industrial free zones. We are also involved in various PPP projects, the biggest one, which is Bacatá, and another one in Barranquilla called Clinica Portoazul, which is a hospital. We are proud of these new kinds of investments that people are putting in their portfolios, which make big projects possible, and also return profits to people that they are not used to having, as they are not used to participating in these kinds of projects. </p><h4>You have been a critic of some of the pension funds and the way they invest in AAA companies. How do you think they need to diversify their portfolios to become more sustainable?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DM</strong> The regulations force all pension funds to invest alike. There is a minimum return that you have to attain, and it is a percentage of the industry average. Companies do not want to deviate too much, in case something goes wrong. If I have a great return, it is for the customer, and if I have a low return, the company could end up paying for the difference. This starts a herd-effect whereby all actors act and move in the same way so as not to stand out and expose themselves to too much risk. What we have seen historically, especially in the last 12 to 13 years, is that buying Colombian assets was good business. In the early 2000s, Colombia was almost a failed state. The prices were fixed accordingly, the exchange rate was high, as were interest rates, and we started to see a fixed income market develop. When the first ten-year securities came out, they were priced at 18-19%, whereas now that figure is close to 6%. It was hard for a local institution investor to justify investing abroad. </p><h4>What have been your most significant projects in the last year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PT</strong> The most significant for us is real estate, as we have more than 500 projects in real estate. With these kinds of projects, they are perpetually open to investment. This generally occurs in the hotel and clinic sector. This year we are going to roll out a forestry business, and there are also closed businesses selling property. We also offer fiduciary rights funding projects. These investments are popular because the property that people own is not a fund, but rather, something specific. </p>]]></richbody0content>

To this end, in January 2013, we made the decision to join the Costa Rica operation. This means that we have a plant only five days away by ship that supplies us with products at a rapid pace, which was something we used to lack. We were bringing products from Japan, US, or Brazil, which took between two and six months to arrive. Now 60% of the products we sell come from Costa Rica. Ecuador was a complicated market for us in 2013 due to regulatory change at the time. We sought alternatives to complying with these regulations, and now we are growing by 37% more than in that year.</p><p><span></span><strong>JOHN LUIS TORRES TOVAR</strong> We are investing in new technologies for the new generation of MRT, or radio tires. We are still in the process of that investment so I can't give you the exact numbers. The focus is to increase our capability to produce the new generation of truck tires. We're introducing new tires for trucks to increase their speed at a cost per kilometer rate. The market is changing notably. Every year we have find new opportunities in the market and also introduce custom packet products. This is especially because our Asian competitor's tires have very competitive costs. Also, we're more flexible in terms of capitalizing on opportunities as we produce our tires locally. But that is no sufficient, and we have to provide other added-value services like delivering support across the country for more of the truck fleets. Fleets in Colombia are in the process of professionalizing and owners today are more demanding. In the past, the business goal was simply to sell tires, now we have to provide a service; we have to follow every tire on every truck. We have to take care of every single tire. We advise truck owners on how to reduce their costs per kilometer. We work with 70 dealers nationwide to support fleets with good service, providing the tires, caring for them and also support re-treading. The latter is a key part of our business as it reduces cost per kilometer.</p><h4>Which are the sectors to which you distribute more products and which have more potential for growth?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SP</strong> Our products are oriented to the transport sector, which play a important role in the development of the economy of Colombia. This was even more so the case when once we signed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, while three FTAs are about to be signed with Costa Rica, Japan, and South Korea, which are already being discussed in the chamber. We are highly involved in the oil and transport sectors at a national level, in projects such as the "Transmilenio," and with different transport companies in multiple cities. Beyond that, we are also aligning with these sectors and encouraging rethreading, we own our Bandag brand, which is a rethread trademark. We are heavily involved in the national development, working closely with Andi on a post-consumer collection program for used tires and their disposal. </p><h4>How have the country's efforts to integrate its markets affected your business?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JT</strong> In the past we had to manufacture tires in each country and for that reason we established around 10 factories in Latin America. In recent years, as Colombia has established free trade agreements with different countries, we combine our local production here in our factory where we focus on commercial tires and OTR tires with several other imported tires, such as small car tires, SUVs and light truck tires. Our factory is focused on MRT. MRT is high technology for truck tires. We are very focused on planning for this side of the business. We are now open exporters for the Andean region and also Brazil and Central America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are your organizations promoting innovation in Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LINA VÉLEZ DE NICHOLLS </strong>In particular, the sector that requires the most changes is the textile production, design, and fashion sector. This generates high levels of employment, but in the globalized economic setting it faces many competitors. At the Chamber of Commerce we offer specific services for this sector, as exemplified by INEXMODA, an institution that undertakes systematic research into global trends. INEXMODA also organizes two large textiles exhibitions, namely Colombiatex and Colombiamoda. Regarding the energy cluster, we are focused on the internationalization of local energy companies. Colombian and regional companies in this cluster have a long history of outstanding trajectories with high quality standards. A good example is Empresas Públicas de Medellí­n (EPM), which has excelled on an international level. The goal of these companies is to provide strategies to penetrate new markets with their products or services. We are continuously reviewing free trade agreements to acquire an overview of supply and demand. Concerning the health sector, Medellí­n has been a reference for the health sector in Colombia, given that the Universidad de Antioquia has a highly ranked medicine program, and is the city in which the first private clinics were established.</p><p><strong>JUAN CAMILO QUINTERO</strong> Currently, we have an area focused on delivering the products and services of entrepreneurs to the market, where the main focus is how to support various players in the innovation ecosystem and put their ideas and products into production, as this is the most challenging part of the innovation ecosystem. We have financed a number of products; these include seed capital risk, and we are investing in the area of ICT. In 2014, we reviewed 400 projects, investing in around eight of them. Some of the projects are specialized; yet we are confident of swift turnaround in realizing them. The other component involves giving entrepreneurs funds to increase their ability to create new products and services, either at their existing company, or by establishing a new company. This program is called Product Innovation. We recently closed and evaluated around 300 projects, and are expected to disburse $2.5 million over 2015. We have another line to commercially sell the resulting products and services abroad. Our resources have three components; the first is providing new capital for companies, and then to withdraw from them to let them develop alone. Another component is the lost fund, namely the resources that will stimulate new products and services to provide innovation in the company or start up, while the final component involves the commercialization of that product or service.</p><h4>What have been the most significant initiatives for the development of a culture of entrepreneurship and competition in Antioquia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LN</strong> The most important initiatives that the region has undertaken to support development over the decade have been the fostering of social equality, innovation, and productive specialization. Social equality is important because Medellí­n has owned the profitable public service companies under Empresas Publicas de Medellí­n EPM for the past 50 years. The profits generated are directed to the city to support social development programs. Secondly, in Antioquia and Medellí­n, innovation has helped the region to become recognized for its industry. The globalizing economy has been a catalyst for the transformation of EPM and as a result an agreement was finalized between the public and private sectors to create Ruta N.</p><h4>How do you plan to transfer the knowledge and experience gained to other regions of Colombia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JQ</strong> In 2015, the board of directors approved the creation of another area inside Ruta N, called New Projects, with a work plan that can define our model, not only the Ruta N model, but the ecosystem model, which is more important than Ruta N. This is because I do not want people to see Ruta N as the regional leader. We facilitate a connection between relevant actors to permit faster growth in different institutions. That area is codifying the system, including both ecosystems and Ruta N to integrate it into their project management system to stimulate revenue and confirm our efforts of the past five years. Each region can take whatever it requires, because you can't copy an ecosystem.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><strong></strong>On which geographical areas and sectors does your institution focus?</h4><p><span></span><strong>José Alejandro Guerrero</strong> Today we have 134 agencies across more than 500 municipalities, and by November of this year we intend to have 140 agencies in 80 additional municipalities. We also have an expansion strategy through our correspondents; currently, we have 18 and we will end the year with 78. It is important to have alternative channels of representation, which we establish in municipalities where we lack offices, by having a counter at a drugstore. These correspondents disburse credit, open savings accounts, or facilitate deposits and withdrawals. This allows us a banking presence at a very low cost. </p><p><span></span><strong>Bernhard Eikenberg</strong> In terms of geography, our focus has in the past been weighted toward Latin America and India, with 55% of our portfolio being invested in Latin America, although we are moving toward a more equitable and a diversified location policy, which includes more of Africa and Southeast Asia, beyond India, in order to have a more balanced currency and country portfolio allocation in place. With regard to sectors, Bamboo Finance is heavily focused on microfinance, or financial inclusion, which represents about 70% of our current portfolio. Healthcare is the second most important sector. The focus for our future investment activity is really centered on the delivery and distribution challenges of essential goods and services to the low income populations in developing countries, which include amongst others financial services, energy, education, or housing in target markets, and we specialize chiefly in innovative distribution models of these essential goods and services.</p><h4>What differentiates your lending activities from other financial groups?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JAG</strong> The idea is to replace the "gota a gota" system for financial products, so people will not have to pay high interest rates when borrowing money. For example, if someone borrows COP1,000,000 through the "gota a gota" model, compared with a loan from our bank, the client would save about COP2,000,000 per year in interest. As you can see, this kind of informal credit is very expensive. People use it because sometimes no bank will support them or give them a loan. What we are doing is trying to understand the client's needs in order to help them financially. We are a microfinance bank with clients that are micro entrepreneurs, the kind of people that do not earn a steady salary, but rather partake in informal productive economic activity. We want to get to the base of the pyramid with our products and as a bank diversify the risk since all the products are in the same basket. We will be entering the auto credit market, but our main objective is microfinance. We have a 28% presence in Cali, Valle de Cauca, and we are also expanding to other regions of the country. </p><p><span></span><strong>BE</strong> We view ourselves as a pioneer in bringing commercial funding to developing countries. We started here 12 years ago funding microfinance institutions with debt financing, and over our history have funded close to ten institutions in Colombia. Four years ago we invested in the "Fundacion WWB" in Cali , which has by now successfully become Banco WWB in Cali. We have always insisted on the double bottom line, which means to us that financial returns do not compromise social returns and vice versa; they are not mutually exclusive and we have always tried to prove that what is good for your clients is good for your business. We have proven that both are possible, having established a track record, which was key to attracting institutional or mainstream investors to this industry. I think that one of the key elements to success has been to design products having a proprietary insight into where the market is headed and designing products to meet the needs of the market and risk appetite of investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main profile of your typical guest?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MARK MCCARTHY</strong> There are a variety of reasons why people choose to stay at Arjaan by Rotana. We have a good mix of guests visiting both for business and leisure, and we are very popular with corporate customers visiting nearby offices. We have also seen increased demand from companies that regularly hire people for short-term projects lasting one or two months. We host families visiting Dubai from the GCC area and many other countries looking to stay in a family-friendly environment. We also have guests who keep an apartment here on a long-term basis who work regularly between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. All of our guests, both leisure and corporate, find great comfort staying in serviced apartments where they have all of the hotel services, along with extra space and the freedom to relax, cook, invite friends over—all the comforts one could find in one's own home. </p><p><span></span><strong>ROCHELLE LOBO</strong> We cater mainly to customers that want to spend a night in Dubai who are looking for a home away from home, coupled with luxury and convenience. We have corporates coming to stay with us as well as companies choosing to use the hotel as guesthouses for their executives. A typical customer looks at metro connectivity; almost all of our properties are close to a metro station. The presence of a mall nearby is also an added advantage, and we offer shuttle service and other auxiliary services, like airport transfers; these are things customers look for. Dubai generally has a specific trend for every season, and people from different countries visit the emirate at different times throughout the year. For example, Eid brings in more of the GCC nationals to Dubai, while the Dubai Shopping Festival brings in a mix. As for the rest of the year, when other parts of the world are getting colder, Europeans and people from East Asia come to Dubai to enjoy the warm weather.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for Dubai's tourism sector considering the upcoming World Expo 2020?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MM</strong> Everyone in the industry is anticipating World Expo 2020 and what effects it will have on the hospitality sector. We have already experienced a large increase in hotels, and this is going to continue. Already in 2014, compared to the same time in 2013, the supply of hotel rooms has increased by about 7%. All of these hotels were already in the pipeline before the announcement of the Expo; however, this strong growth trend is now likely to continue at a very rapid pace. Fortunately, Dubai has also shown the ability to increase demand quite effectively through tourism department promotions, growth of Emirates Airline routes, new exhibitions, sporting events, and recreational activities. However, we are now starting to feel the pinch of the additional supply. Our primary strategy has been, and will continue over the coming years, to enhance our services and property to maintain our competitive advantage against all of the new hotels. Our first priority will be to retain our guests.</p><p><span></span><strong>RL</strong> The Expo 2020 provides us with a ray of hope and high expectations. We anticipate an inflow of visitors, looking to participate in the 2020 exhibition. Dubai has become and is becoming one of the central tourist destinations in the world. The luxury sector is going to pick up with the addition of four- and five-star hotels to the portfolio. Beyond the introduction of new properties, our hoteliers are working to give customers much more than just a luxury hotel experience. With the announcement of the Royal Palm and similar prestigious projects, Dubai could easily be referred to as the world's next luxury hotel destination.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Tourism needs retail and restaurants. Cities with many good quality restaurants are attractive. It brings more and more people to enjoy the food factor here. Like many retailers, we are getting brands that are very much glamorous and have an effect on improving the quality of the retail sector in this part of the world. We have done a lot of investment in our ERP, in restructuring and training, and getting people ready for the challenges that His Highness is going to attract to this part of the world. Here, the operations and the philosophy of His Highness go hand-in-hand. When he initiates a project, it is supported by different kinds of hotels, airlines, airports, shopping experiences, and so on. It completes the whole equation of a very successful destination, Dubai. I think today Dubai is the result of fantastic leadership and is a land of opportunity.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>CHRISTOPHE NICAISE</strong> The training of our sales team in the store, the training of our technicians in the after sales service—these elements are extremely important and are ongoing projects, because if Dubai is to welcome the world in 2020, service level and customer experience need to impress people as much as the Expo does. Stepping up the quality of service in general is something that needs to be improved and strengthened, and I believe that the government has understood that because they are making a significant effort to promote performance and excellence at all levels; the private sector should be inspired by what is happening.</p><h4>Where do you see the primary area for opportunity for growth?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MDB</strong> As tourism is improving and growing in this part of the world, retail is another part of the backbone of industry. People love the ocean and the sun, but they also want to enjoy shopping. That opportunity has now been made possible on a world-class level in Dubai. We are blessed with big numbers of wealthy people around us. Nevertheless, we need tourists to come here and enjoy themselves. These satisfied people become return visitors. The journey has to be a great experience from the time you land to the time you take off. It makes the journey pleasant and beautiful.</p><p><span></span><strong>CN</strong> We have witnessed over the past decade a complete switch of the luxury good market distribution strategy and distribution channel format. In 2007, wholesale used to account for as much as 79% of the luxury good market revenues against 21% for retail. As of end of 2014 the wholesale share has come down to 68% whereas retail has grown up to 32%. Considering this trend, it will only be natural for our company to seize any opportunity to grow our mono-brand boutique retail portfolio.</p><h4>How important is it to continue attracting these premium partners for the expansion of BinHendi?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MDB</strong> For any corporation, growth is important. When we look around us, there are great potential opportunities in the MENA region, GCC, and beyond, such as India, Pakistan, and Iran. These are all highly populated cities with a desire to have what we have. Dubai has become a showcase for people that come here. Therefore, we are looking at opportunities to franchise our brands to these people. Hence we restructured ourselves to see that we have the right footing to enter that part of the world. </p><h4>How do you envision your strategy playing out? </h4><p><span></span><strong>CN</strong> When the situation is tough and you are lucky enough to be in a corporate environment where you are still financially strong, I firmly believe that this is the best period to invest, gain market share, and, therefore, strengthen your market position. How do I envision the fact that we are just renovating and will continue renovating our stores in 2015? Although the circumstances are not positive, I believe this is the best way to maintain our leadership position. Economic crises are cyclical, meaning if your company is well positioned and continues to invest sensibly during difficult and challenging times, then you can take full advantage of any potential rebound and accordingly accelerate your growth to outperform the market growth rate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your hotel stand out in Dubai's saturated hotel industry, and what amenities do you offer guests?</h4><p><span></span><strong>WALID AL-AWA</strong> We have a mission and vision that comes firstly from our religion; everyone here is equal. Our approach is that once you enter the hotel, you feel safe and calm—like you have come home, and whenever there is feedback from our guests, we act immediately on it. The building Tamani Marina Hotel is housed in was originally intended to be a residential tower. We offer huge rooms with a fantastic view of the Palm, in a great location. Throughout the hotel, we display Islamic art, which is one way in which we stand out from Western hotels. Tamani supports charities, and we host charity events every month with the participation of our employees. In order to show our responsibility to the community, we participate in events ranging from cleaning up the city to sponsoring yearly Ramadan activities. We have hosted an art auction, from which all profits went to charitable organizations. We not only respect our guests, but our employees, owners, suppliers, associates, and society in general. It is easy to work here, and we have a fantastic employee environment. This is our approach; our philosophy differs from other hotels.<strong></strong></p><p><strong><span></span></strong><strong>SAMIR MOUSSA</strong> From 2013 to 2014 we saw significant changes around our property, starting with the main hotel lobby. We have refurbished the entrance, choosing marble tiles in soothing earth tones. Dubai Marina View Hotel Apartments is primarily a family-oriented hotel, and the idea was to make this a home-away-from-home for all guests from the moment they step inside. The second set of notable changes is in the poolside area. Some landscaping was incorporated, and we updated the swimming pool tiles. We organize games and activities daily for our guests to participate in, such as water volleyball. Accordingly, it was important for us to create an aesthetically pleasing as well as practical area for visitors to enjoy. We also expanded our family restaurant, building a terrace for the spill over of diners we receive. The terrace is a relaxing area with two large screens, four TVs, and an impressive audio system, airing international sports. The terrace seating area was very popular during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In our experience, not many hotel apartments within our category can honestly match the number of onsite amenities we offer. For example, we have an electronic shop that sells mobile phones and accessories. Here, guests do not need to go far to pick up any gadget they may need during their stay. The gentlemen's spa and ladies' salon are other unique features not typically found at hotel apartments. These subtle differences appear to have positively impacted on the hotel's popularity.</p><h4>How will new infrastructure and investments in Dubai help the Emirate become a top tourism destination?</h4><p><span></span><strong>WA</strong> Dubai has come a long way over the last 15 years or so; you can see what it looks like now compared to the early 1990s. When the metro was built people questioned its usefulness as everyone drives cars, but is has been incredibly successful. The new Marina Tram will likely see similar results. With an increasing number of hotels, it is becoming easier for tourists to come to Dubai. We will need even more hotels to support the sector. Dubai is now competing with major cities around the world, like Istanbul and London.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>SM</strong> With the upcoming Expo, Dubai is expected to receive 20 million visitors annually over the next few years, almost doubling 2014 figures. Additionally, over 100 new competitors are set to enter the market considering the new developments in the pipeline, such as the Mall of the World that is expected to feature at least 100 new hotels alone. As a brand, Dubai should be positioned as a futuristic city, the world's main business and leisure hub, and a safe haven for travellers. These points are crucial to the Emirate's development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your organizations doing to develop the medical sector in Dubai?</h4><p><span></span><strong>THUMBAY MOIDEEN</strong> Being a teaching hospital, we have lots of patients enter the hospital because the prices are cheaper in our hospitals, yet we manage to maintain our superior quality nonetheless. We make our services affordable, allowing more patients to receive treatment. Directly, every Emirate wants us to come, including Abu Dhabi, and the insurance companies want us to come, too. Affordable healthcare makes a huge impact on the community. In our case, our new strategic plan is to ensure that our university is fully research based in the next five years. We are working towards that, and right now we are raising funding through our own company. Our foundation is currently funding our research department with over 10 million dirhams, but we are hoping in the future that more funds will come in. We are taking a lot of initiatives in the private sector, and we aim to actively  collaborate with the government on this.</p><p><span></span><strong>Dr ABDULKAREEM SULTAN AL OLAMA</strong> We believe that supporting homegrown medical talent is just as important as developing state-of-the-art infrastructure, and we are proactively doing this with a number of scholarships, grants, and fellowships. Scientists can receive up to AED 300,000 in seed grants to fund medical research projects; our fellowships support Emirati medical students to train at some of the most prestigious medical institutions around the world to bring global best practice back to the UAE; and our scholarships enable Emirati healthcare professionals to further their specializations. While we invest in the future health of the UAE, we value the importance of supporting those in need today. Our A'awen ("support" in Arabic) program provides access to quality healthcare for those who cannot afford it, and we have helped many patients reach their true potential by funding life-changing treatments. Meanwhile our Ta'alouf ("harmony" in Arabic) program trains the parents and teachers of children with special needs to understand their children better and act as therapists themselves, a model which is highly sustainable.</p><h4>How do you see the sector developing in the years ahead?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TM</strong> The government's strategic plan for Dubai aims to turn the Emirate into a hub for medical tourism. Being in the private sector, we were the first business to take this initiative. We started five years ago, and we were planning on being an example for other countries, to bring in their people for medical tourism. Today, we are bringing in people from over 20 countries, and right now we are targeting countries with a shortage of healthcare, for example on the African continent or Afghanistan. Medical tourism does not only mean good healthcare, it also means good prices. India is a fantastic country for healthcare, but the issue there is the lack of strong supportive infrastructure, such as we have in the Gulf.</p><p><span></span><strong>AO</strong> Developing effective medical research and sustainable healthcare is a long-term process that requires significant resources. We are grateful for the support we have received from generous corporates and individuals so far. As a Foundation that is fully funded by donations, we are thrilled to see more philanthropists and business leaders eager to join Majlis Al Ata'a, a national movement launched in 2014 to support the sustainable development of a thriving medical research sector in the UAE.  Visionary leaders are lending their financial capabilities and influence to support medical research for the long-term. This continued support will enable Al Jalila Foundation to facilitate cutting-edge research. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the future. Our rulers have named 2015 the "Year of Innovation," and we will help to make this happen by driving innovation and progress in healthcare to benefit current and future generations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your hospital fit into Dubai's broader healthcare sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MUNA TAHLAK</strong> The objective of Latifa Hospital, as a specialized hospital for women and children, is to provide the comprehensive and best care for this category of the population in Dubai. We want to be able to provide what our clients need in terms of healthcare and to be center for referral. It is well known that high-risk cases and difficult cases require more resources and expertise and also costs a lot more. As we are generally a tertiary center, we get all of these referrals from all the UAE, whereas the private clinics usually take care of the lower-risk cases. We see ourselves complementing each other in relation to the public and private sector.</p><p><span></span><strong>DR. ABUDULRAHMAN MOHAMMAD SALEH AL JASSMI</strong> Dubai Hospital is a tertiary medical care provider, which is unique for Dubai and we want to remain like that. Medical care in Dubai has been available for the past 40 years and it was developing in all aspects, but development in tertiary care is not to the optimum level. We still have a group of patients who are traveling aboard for certain kinds of treatment and we at Dubai Hospital are targeting that group and are continuously enhancing tertiary care and developing several fields of healthcare with a focus on super-specialty in those fields. Our objective is to provide a variety of advanced care in different specialties.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans for the coming period?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MT</strong> I see a bright future with many new things happening. One is that with the insurance legislation coming through we will see a positive impact on how we manage our hospital. It will provide everyone with access to healthcare, promote positive competition in the health sector, and help investment in healthcare. We expect to see an increase in the number of patients we serve. With more people being insured, we expect more people seeking treatment that otherwise would not. We have plans to expand and to add new services. We have just finished our master plan for the region, and there is a lot of development in infrastructure and human capital. EMR, the electronic medical record system, and the health record is another great project that we are looking forward to. I can see that we are getting closer to where we can transform healthcare in Dubai.</p><p><span></span><strong>AMSAJ</strong> We intend to develop at least one center of excellence per year and this year the Dubai Kidney Center will be the first. It currently holds 48 beds and we provide care for about 260 patients in terms of dialysis. Once the new center is operational it will have an enhanced capacity to treat 350 patients and in 2016 we aim to carry out our first kidney transplant. In terms of cancer treatment, we already specialize in several services but we want to become a center of excellence in this field and therefore in the next few years, the aim is to continue to enhance our services, add new oncological services and ensure we can provide the highest quality care. Our hospital currently receives approximately 50% of pediatric cancer cases in the UAE and therefore the aim is to continue focusing on this service and eventually provide super specialization in this field. We want to concentrate on certain specialties; we have to concentrate on the quantity of care and the quality of it, too. Our central concentration is on tackling diabetes because of its high prevalence. We are also focusing on cancer treatments, cardiac disease, kidney disease, orthopedic and joint diseases, pediatric service facilities, and fetal medicine. These areas are our targets for the next five years and we are working on these programs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements for your company over the past year?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MARWAN AHMAD ESSA AL THANI</strong> Al Salam Investment is focusing on the SME segment in two areas: the advisory business and private equity. What we discovered in Dubai is that we have a number of SMEs, but there is a lack of understanding about these entities. This means a lot of SMEs require advisory services to improve their visibility and to guide them in a new direction. We set ourselves up to be in the advisory business, and we communicate with a range of companies, as well as the government. My focus is on the GCC countries for many reasons. Firstly, there is still a gap in this market in terms of SMEs at the moment. There are both large and small companies, with a huge gap in SME businesses meaning there is a lot of potential. Also, the government understands the importance of the SME sector and we are focused in the same direction. I think the country needs to focus on the SME sector over the next five to 10 years.</p><p><span></span><strong>DAVID HUNT</strong> It has been an interesting year for GFC where we have continued to see strong demand for our lending products. This demand is driven by a dynamic and fast developing SME sector in the Emirates, and the need for small businesses to obtain quick and easy access to funding in order to expand their businesses. With a 15-year track record of having served the countries' SMEs, we have over the past year also expanded our lending capabilities to cater to companies that can be found in the micro business space. Micro-businesses, for example businesses that typically employ less than 10 people and have an annual turnover of up to AED10 million, have historically been underserved when it comes to funding as many conventional banks view these businesses as being too small, however we see lending in this space as an opportunity and plan to focus on servicing the micro business segment going forward.</p><h4>How does your firm support SMEs, and how do they contribute to the broader economy?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>MAEAT </strong>We can help Dubai through private equity investment focusing on SMEs. Another tool there is Islamic finance for the government and development, and there are major investors and bankers involved. From our perspective, we are focused on the SME sector and private equity, and we think this is Islamic and fundamental, because if we have this concept for any fund, investors will want it. However, because they do not have any source on the ground to feed them information and knowledge, they do not have the tools to invest, even though they have the money. They need the channels to make the right investments. In 2015, we expect a major rise in the SME sector; we expect to see growth of up to 40%. We also expect a huge jump this year because what the market needs has been achieved to the required level, and we only need to give a little push to reach our target.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>DH</strong> One of the key constraints on the part of SMEs to obtain financing has been their inability to provide adequate financial information and accurate historical data, information that is needed in order to be able to make a credit decision. Because of this, lenders do not perceive these companies to be 'bankable'. Many small business owners therefore look to finance their businesses themselves or tend to rely on family and friends for initial investments. At GFC, we offer help and support in developing for instance a good business model or a suitable financial plan and aim to act as partners to our clients. Over the past few years we have seen an increasing number of banks enter the debt finance segment. Given that access to funding has traditionally been one of the main obstacles to obtaining growth capital for SMEs, this is an encouraging indication even if it means that the market for lenders is becoming more competitive. Today many local banks offer SME loans, however since Gulf Finance is not a bank but a finance company, we are slightly different in the way that we operate in that we are able to offer our customers a broader variety of more flexible products which we tailor to suit each client's individual needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current nature of the Mozambican market?</h4><p><span></span>Jorge Reis One of the challenges of cement commercialization in Mozambique is that the client only focuses on price, whereby it is difficult to explain the need to focus on quality. We are working with our clients and holding workshops precisely to inculcate a sense of the importance of testing the quality of cement before it is purchased. Here we produce two types of cement: 32.5 and 42.5, and we need to teach companies precisely what they should buy. If you need a 32, why buy a 42 that is more expensive? Or indeed, vice versa, as where strong cement needing grade 42 should be specified.</p><p><span></span><strong>PIYUSH KUMAR</strong> It is impossible not to note the rapid growth of infrastructure in the country, and I anticipate many more construction projects being realized by both the government and the private sector. Many new roads, bridges, and industries will be constructed in the near future and the real estate business is set to boom fueled by economic growth. In this light, we anticipate no serious challenges to selling cement locally.</p><h4><span></span>As a long-established company, how would you describe the local business environment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JR</strong> Doing business here is not as easy as in other markets because of the prevailing constraints to be found in the country, notably logistics and a reliable electricity supply. Moreover, there is also a measure of unfair competition detrimental to Mozambique, which can seriously damage local industries. And meanwhile, the informal economy, too, remains problematic.</p><h4>What is the current status of your cement plant?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PKB</strong> We will commence the construction of our 1,500 ton-per-day cement production unit in June 2015, and the plant will be implemented in two phases. The first phase involves the construction of our grinding unit and will take from 12 to 16 months. The second phase, which involves the clinker production unit, will be implemented two years later. Thereafter, we will manufacture cement mainly for the local market, which we can readily cater to, although we might also consider exports to South Africa, Swaziland, and nearby areas. Once we establish ourselves in the market, we will enter the next phase of clinker production on an investment of around $50 million.</p><h4>What is the installed production capacity of Cimentos de Moçambique, and to which markets is your output destined?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JR</strong> We have a capacity of 2.9 million tons in total, but in 2013 we only produced 1.1 million tons. In 2014, by September we had already sold 1.1 million tons, whereby we expect to have surpassed the 2013 figure. Meanwhile, the unused available capacity is accounted for by certain bottlenecks that we are currently addressing, and which we expect to overcome in the near future. Mozambique's Mutirao, or "collective effort" project is focused on the two main pillars of industry and the people. Accordingly, our production is currently geared solely toward satisfying the local market, although given the right margins, we could also export.</p><h4>What could the government do to ensure that projects become a reality?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PKB</strong> The government should have a time-bound program for each clearance. This should encompass the allotment of land, clearance, access to mines, and a connection to power and other utilities. The allotment of land should be decided on within three months, without compromise, and there should certainly not be any re-examination or review of the terms of business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your organization's strategic priorities in the short term?</h4><p><span></span>Barbara Mommen Roughly $350 million has been spent on the building and maintenance of roads, and for the remainder of the concession there are still upgrades, improvements, and maintenance being done, because it is a build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreement. It is anticipated that over the next 16 years, we will see a further $400 million investment in infrastructure. The rail line upgrade, or rehabilitation, was finished in 2008, and that investment was roughly $100 million, which included upgrades to the rails and bridges and additional rolling stock and locomotives. Over the next four years CFM is going to spend roughly $204 million on the line in doubling and electrification of the line and improvements to signaling, amongst others. Additional capacity on this line will assist the corridor in creating a more balanced ratio of road-to-rail cargo. In terms of port Maputo, an integrated master plan was developed in 2008 that looks at increasing the capacity of the port, improving current facilities, and accommodating new vessels by dredging to minus 14 meters. Meanwhile, the car terminal is a great success story with increased volumes ensuring maximum use of the recently expanded terminal area.</p><p><span></span><strong>IOLANDA WANE </strong>The strategic priorities for the next two years are defined in the 2012-2016 Strategic Plan, which is still under implementation, and clearly outlines the strategic guidelines for the company. Special attention will be given to continuing efforts at improving public transport services for the citizens of Maputo and its environs, increasing our operational efficiency and efficacy and proceeding with the operation automation policy of traffic and charging policy. We aim to improve the corporate model for the repositioning of the company in the transportation market in Maputo Municipality, and to proceed with ongoing restructuring in various operational and managerial areas in order to permanently align the company mission to the demands of the market. We also plan to redefine our social responsibility policy for internal and external public, and reinforce the sensitization actions against fraud in all departments of the company. We need to ensure strictness and respect for public goods, and must be careful in expenditure control.</p><h4>How does the development of transport infrastructure in Maputo affect business?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BM</strong> I would really contend that infrastructure development enables access right across the spectrum; from multi-national companies through to SMEs.  If you create the environment for moving goods, you are enabling economic development. It is not only the major companies that benefit.  Much of the investment in infrastructure has been made by companies who obviously see the possibility of a return on their investment, so the challenge for us is to ensure that the charges levied for the use of infrastructure do not compromise the economic viability of the corridor.</p><h4>What are your strategies for improving accessibility to public transport services?</h4><p><span></span>IW We work as part of the Municipality project for installing bus lines, which differ from normal vehicles lines, and are known as BRT (Bus Rapid Transit). We believe that this system will improve the medium commercial speed, and that subsequently, we will see greater user satisfaction, since, greater speed and lower variability (resulting from line separation), will lead to a better circulation of buses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company's business developed over recent years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ZUBEYIR</strong> <strong>DEĞIRMENCI</strong> established itself here in 2009, although we actually first came in 2007 to conduct market research, before establishing a pavement and block company. It was intially called Akdeniz, a Turkish name. The DECO group is not only engaged in construction, but also operates DECO Stone, which sells construction materials such as concrete, pavement materials, and blocks, while DECO construction is engaged in building. DECO Stone is a factory located in Tchumene with a workforce of 130 that produces and sells concrete. We began by renting a plant, but once this proved insufficient, we had to build our own. All our current production is geared at meeting local demand. Our largest construction competitors buy their concrete from us, which is a clear indicator of our production quality. The DECO residence is a symbol of DECO construction, and is a 23-floor building with three underground parking lots, offices, and 42 apartments. We applied the best quality possible, considering Mozambican standards. The project is now complete and was sold out prior to completion. Assos condominium is a 45,000sqm construction with 160 apartments, 12 shops and two floors of parking, and will be completed within 20 months. The first block should be opened by June 2015 at the latest, and the project has won the African Property awards for best apartments in Mozambique.</p><p><span></span><strong>JOSÉ CARLOS PINHEIRO</strong> We started in September 2014 in Tete with our first strip mall, at 7,700sqm. These are not exactly shopping malls, but more open strip malls. They are not venues for Louis Vuitton or Chanel, but essentially retail services for the mass market. The concept behind this project is to take formal retail to various areas of the country that lacked it before. We are sure of making a positive economic and social impact as consumer prices will tend to decline, and we offer people different purchasing opportunities that they do not have access to today, while introducing a diversity of brands. Currently, people beyond Maputo do not have proper retail options, and this lack of competition favors the retailers. After the Tete development we will probably build our next malls in Nampula, Pemba, Massinga, or Maxixe, and perhaps Nacala. We will have a minimum of two additional projects under construction before the end of 2Q2015. By April-May, we will have three under construction in Tete, Nampula, and Pemba. We estimate our investment for the 15 malls will be in excess of $150 million, with a minimum of another $50 million to $60 million from tenants. We are not a construction company, but a real estate developer, and will therefore develop, rent, and manage the malls.E</p><h4>How would you describe the quality of human capital in construction in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ZD</strong> The skill level remains insufficient. We need to keep our quality especially high for an award-winning project. Now we have a team that we trained during the construction of the DECO residence, but we need more trained workers, which we will bring from Turkey. Sometimes they can just come for two or three months to give training and go back. It is difficult to bring people here for work. The government sets the limit of foreign workers and they should be more flexible.</p><h4>How would you describe the local business environment for establishing a new company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JCP</strong> Ours is not the easiest market to enter, but you must understand that were this a developed country there would not be the same opportunities to grasp as exist here. Having said this, it is important for an investor coming to Mozambique to understand that this is a country with its own laws, and that if you are fully aware of them, it is not a difficult environment to do business in.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>How is your commercial infrastructure set up within Mozambique, and what kind of products do you produce?<strong></strong></p><p><strong>PEDRO CRUZ</strong> We have three breweries located in the main three cities of the country, namely Maputo, Beira, and Nampula, and a network of sales depots in each provincial capital. We have close to 1,400 employees, we produce approximately 2 million hectoliters of beer, and have a higher capacity installed than our current production output. We are producing at approximately three quarters of our capacity. The last plant we built was in Nampula, and while we have no plans to build new breweries, we do intend to expand our existing facilities. We intend to complete major extensions at all three of our breweries within the next three years, although this depends largely on how the market develops in each region. We produce approximately twenty brands including beer, alcoholic fruit beverages, wines, spirits and Chibuku, a traditional African beer with a lower alcoholic content, made from sorghum and maize, and known as an opaque beer in some areas.</p><p><strong>MIGUEL A. SOTO</strong> Until July 2012, Diageo had no direct presence in the country. We have a long relationship with our distributor, CICOTI, which has a large portfolio and was providing us access and understanding of the market. I deployed in July 2012 and by January 2013, we knew this was the right place to be. We established a company in Mozambique and by August 2013 we had purchased Lusomoc Ltda, which was not performing at the time, changing the name to Diageo Supply Marracuene Limited (DSML). We immediately got all hands on deck to see how we could produce spirits in an affordable format to explore more opportunities in the mainstream spirits market, without compromising our values as a responsible producer of quality drinks. We started production in July 2014 through an innovative facility called "The Cube," and launched two brands with three different formats. This is a plant shipped in containers, which is tested and then shipped to the destination and assembled. We offer Gilbey's Gin, in 75cl and 25cl format, as well as a premium branded spirit, Master's Choice in 20cl format. We then started producing Smirnoff Spin in late November 2014.</p><h4>How have the sales of your products developed over recent years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PC</strong> The biggest beer brand in the country is 2M, which is 50 years old this year. We  consider 2M representative of Mozambican culture, being colorful, vibrant, and social. We also have Laurentina, with its different varieties, which turned 80 years old in 2013, making it the brand with the longest tradition in the country. Manica is also a major brand, with a strong presence throughout the country. In relation to the evolution of our sales, we have been successful over the many years that we have been present in Mozambique. CDM celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2015, and we have been growing consistently year after year and have made a positive impact on society, providing employment, expanding capacity, and investing in facilities, equipment, and in producing better products. We export the 2M, Laurentina, and Manica brands to South Africa and Portugal.</p><h4>What demand is there for your products in Mozambique?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAS</strong> The growth of mainstream spirits is limited by the large number of competitors selling in extremely small formats and exceptionally depressed prices. We believe that is unsustainable in terms of quality, in terms of consumer choice as well as legislation. We believe the market will formalize and diminish in size; however, it will increase in terms of quality and affordable quality choices. Our greatest challenge on imported spirits is the large amounts of product that flows in from different places, sometimes through the borders, and not paying the right taxes. We are working with the authorities on this because we believe that Mozambique is losing revenue and we, as a company, are missing the potential to invest and grow further and faster in Mozambique.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you plan to take advantage of current growth levels moving forward?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MDGM</strong> Over the forthcoming years, and as part of our ongoing commitment to the social and economic development of Mozambique, Millennium bim plans to continue funding both individual and SME/corporate loans and advances, while also maintaining its leadership in customer deposits. Once more, the bank's approach to innovation in new products, services, and functionalities will be a key driver for our business, aiming for further penetration of services and customer enrollment to different banking business lines. Furthermore, Millennium bim will remain focused on its branch expansion efforts, including rural areas, therefore contributing to a greater and better accessibility of financial services in Mozambique, as a way to promote the financial inclusion of the population, as we have done, historically, since the bank's inception.</p><p><span></span><strong>AC</strong> As a bank, we have been closely involved in the infrastructure sector. It's absolutely fundamental for the success of any operation in Mozambique that the infrastructure actually functions. Proper infrastructure is required to meet the needs of the investment being done. For example, we have been involved in financing the railway line that transports coal, the ports, and Nacala Airport, as well as the road from Maputo and South Africa. Infrastructure for us is, and will remain, absolutely key. When you talk about resources, you are not just talking about assisting businesses in Mozambique, but also need to consider the stakeholders around them and ensure that the project goes ahead as smoothly as possible.</p><h4>How does your bank cater to market conditions, and how does this affect your customer base?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MDGM</strong> Millennium bim is leader in all market dimensions. With approximately 1.3 million customers throughout the country, about 50% of the total banked population, Millennium bim has the largest commercial network together with the highest capillarity shown by the 161 branches located all around the country on all provinces and in 54 districts. We are a universal bank; therefore we cater to the mass market, the affluent, and corporate customers. In each of these segments, we address our customers' needs with a specially designed value proposition, in accordance with their main profile and expectation. Concerning the corporate segment, the high level of customer sophistication is addressed with our capacity to tailor our products and services. We have a dedicated Relationship Manager who is responsible for the customization of the bank's offers to specific customer's needs.</p><p><span></span><strong>AC</strong> The key is to target the real sectors, and the companies of which span everyone involved in the sector. By that I mean that if you are going to focus on coal, you need to focus on the main players in coal, but not just the big corporate interests in the middle, as there are many other stakeholders involved in the chain, such as SMEs, and huge numbers of people working for those corporates. As a bank, you look for a value proposition that really takes the interests of all suppliers and workers at the various corporations into account, as well as that of government stakeholders. Standard Bank generates the second highest profits in the Mozambique banking system. As a business, we look at what we can contribute to the country. We want to be an African player, and for us, the real value of this footprint is how we can link customers to other countries around the region. Linking is what Standard Bank is particularly good at. As a business, we have seen dramatic growth over the past few years, which is a mirror of what has happened in the economy. We are a key contributor to the Standard Bank Group, and a solid investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Many of these SMEs are producing, but have no idea how or where to sell, or into which markets they can channel their products. We assist them throughout the whole process in order to create the skills to produce and fulfill the needs of the international market.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>ROGERIO MANUEL</strong> The main achievement of our 18 years in business has been the institutionalization of a private-public dialogue and consolidation of a partnership with the government. This has helped to pursue reform initiatives. CTA has grown as an organization, putting us in a position to meet the demand for reforms in Mozambique.</p><h4><span></span>How would you describe the current level of Mozambique's international trade?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JJM</strong> Although international interest has increased, the current account is booming because of the country's natural resources. Nevertheless, we recognize that the importance of a sustainable economy depends on agriculture because the country is agriculture-based. That is why we think that to be sustainable in the long term, we have to become involved in agro-processing by adding value to our products. We are no longer interested in selling raw materials, which is why we are in the process of talking to investors and inviting them to come and set up processing plants. We are still not satisfied with the volume we are seeing, although we are exporting to Europe and even to the US.</p><h4>What are some of the major SME operations in Mozambique, and what are the main challenges they face?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RM</strong> The lack of a reliable national database of companies makes it difficult for analysts and policymakers to get a clear perspective of businesses operating in different sectors and provinces. However, several studies reveal that access to credit, technology, and land remain major challenges for SMEs. Operating in Tete and Moatize, there are nine coal mining companies including Vale Mozambique, Rito Tinto Mines of Benga, Mine of Moatize, JSPL, Mines of Revubué, Mid West 1151, Rio Tinto Coal Zambezi and Nkondeze; this group of companies invested $8.5 billion in 2012, which represented approximately 60-70% of GDP. In Nampula the main mining operations are the heavy sands Moma, Kenmare, and more recently the heavy sands of Sangage in the Angoche district, operated by the Chinese company Haiyu Mozambique Mining Company.</p><h4>What are your objectives for the next few years?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>JJM</strong> We want to develop, and increase the country's potential to become a global player, starting first with the region. We are confident that the enthusiasm and commitment arising from the recent elections, and the clarity and vision of the incoming president, will contribute tangibly to development. Our target is SMEs, which if supported are likely to improve not only the welfare of those working in them, but of the country as a whole. That underlines the key role of IPEX, which requires resources that are often scarce. Yet I think that government investment within the institute is widely recognized as a facilitator of socioeconomic development.</p><p><span></span><strong>RM</strong> In terms of the CTA's role as the leader of Public-Private Dialogue (DPP) to improve the business environment, the priority is to reform the current DPP model, and the CTA is already working on a blueprint to this end. Another critical consideration is Mozambique's need for a policy on local content and an aligned industrial policy, to ensure that the benefits of natural resource exploitation are also extended to Mozambicans, and to set up bases for industrial development and structural transformation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes the fast moving consumer goods market in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MARK POTHAS</strong> The market certainly presents challenges that we don't see elsewhere. The primary difficulty is distance, and there are 15 million people residing in the ninth largest country in the world. And another challenge is an inadequate supply of talent, whereby despite the presence of bright young people, many are highly inexperienced. Meanwhile, compliance is also an issue. We need to make sure that business is conducted appropriately, and it is actually a question of perspective. I would stress that Nestlé is not an "international" company, as such, but rather, one that works throughout the world. Ultimately, we are invited guests here, and therefore work hard on compliance and making sure the business community and general public is well aware of our values.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>DAVID MANZINI</strong> Kazakhstan is what we call the Full Force Growth Market—for us it is a top priority market, like Russia and China. We have a very ambitious plan in place for the next three to five years. Our ambition is to double the size of our business. We have a road map and we are still on track for 2014, in terms of gross delivery and expansion. In 2015 we are planning to increase headcount by 30%. The level of chocolate consumption is far below the regional average. People are consuming around three kilograms of chocolate per year, whereas in Russia, we are at five and a half to six kilograms per year, so there is a big opportunity to boost chocolate consumption here. The pet-care segment is similar to the chocolate one: the calorie-coverage per pet is very low in Kazakhstan and one of the missions of Mars is to bring products to a local consumer so they can take care for their pets. The proportion is even more important in pet care in terms of gross opportunity, we think that we can double or triple the size of our business to go above $100 million in three years time in this specific segment.</p><h4>How do you plan to consolidate your positions in the market, and ensure that you are on supermarket shelves in the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MP</strong> Nestlé works hard to create shared value in this market. Of all the product categories, the major challenge is coffee. The local population consumes just 40 cups per year, in stark contrast to around 300 cups per person in Russia. Instead, the average person in Kazakhstan consumes 1,500 cups of tea per year and the challenge is to convert them into more active coffee drinkers. Chocolate consumption, at 3 kilos per person per year, is also limited. Moreover, the format in which chocolate is consumed is a critical factor. Here it is mostly consumed in bulk, a segment in which Nestlé does not really compete.</p><p><span></span><strong>DM </strong>The strategy of Mars is not to overload people with products; rather it is to increase market penetration. We are mainly selling our product as single bars, to raise the per-capita consumption of the country. We prefer to have one hundred consumers buying one time than 50 consumers buying two times the quantity; this is our philosophy. Some manufacturers here in the chocolate market are focused on one channel. However, we prefer to be everywhere. In terms of coverage and penetration of stores we want to go as far as we can. So far we do not have any plans to build a factory in Kazakhstan. Here in Kazakhstan, there are several non-wrapped or homemade products, which might be good products, but from a hygienic point of view, they might not be. Mars ensures that its products are high quality, and prepared to the highest standards of biotechnology. An important factor for us is the state of the Kazakh stani economy, which is characterized by solid GDP growth of 5.7% last year, despite the devaluation, and by political stability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your opinion of the education sector here in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SHIGEO KATSU</strong> The education sector is, like many other sectors here in Kazakhstan, rapidly developing and evolving. In general terms, the government has overseen what is called the Roadmap Project, which takes a comprehensive view of the overall education system from early childhood, pre-school, and primary school, through to higher education, and the research sector. This gives a holistic picture that was run through our university, and our Graduate Center for Education Policy. This policy research program is extremely ambitious, and it will definitely attempt to push forward the overall reform theme of modernizing the education sector. It is commendable that the authorities are putting an emphasis on early childhood, and not just building new kindergartens, but really focusing on the quality. This is, in many ways, a theme of the education sector. Access to higher education, overall, if we are speaking about the number of institutions, is not an issue. At the moment there are 132 institutions, and for a country of 17 million, in my view, this number is still too high, and you worry about the standards and quality of some of them. Having said that, with regards to access overall, about two-thirds of the universities are public, and the tuition fees are low.</p><p><span></span><strong>ASSYLBEK KOZHAKHMETOV</strong> The education sector is changing very rapidly. Since the Republic of Kazakhstan became independent, 10 Ministers of education and science were replaced. Every new minister contributed his ideas how we should reform education. Of course, the changes were necessary because it was impossible to keep all the organizations that we had during the centralized economy of the former Soviet Union.  We have moved to a new system of awarding academic degrees; preparation for degrees followed the Western model. Another innovation, which I think is positive, is to empower the non-governmental sector in the field of education. There is an understanding that the reform of the country and the economy is impossible without strengthening the role of universities. Thus, the forum "Expert-200-Kazakhstan" took place in November, at which  the concept of the "triple helix" introduced by Henry Etzkowitz was discussed. The concept puts universities in the first place in the formation of new type of economy. I think that this forum and the questions raised will be developed in the near future. We are gradually moving to the dual system of education. In this respect, today a lot of work is carried out by JSC NWF Samruk-Kazyna, the Ministry of Education and Science of the RK, and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs headed Ablay Myrzakhmetov who is a member of the Board of Trustees of our University. Gradually, the structure of financing universities is changing for the better, but it happens very slowly. If Europe provides up to 7% of GDP for education, we devote only 3.5-4%. Last year this figure was 3.8%, and I hope that this year will be no less than 4%.</p><h4>How do you position your university in the international arena, and what is your relationship with other international universities?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>SK</strong> We started off establishing ourselves by entering into strategic partnerships with top-class international universities. Our partners include Duke's Fuqua School of Business, and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. We are also working with the University of Pennsylvania in higher education management; Cambridge University in education, leadership, and management; University College London in engineering; and University of Wisconsin-Madison in humanities and social sciences. Therefore, for each of our schools we have one strategic partner, and for the medical center we are working closely with the University of Pittsburgh. Further, we will be setting up a school of mining and environmental engineering. Our approach has been to identify good, strong partners.</p><p><span></span><strong>AK</strong> Today there are two main goals of the Almaty Management University; internationalization and entering to the top 200 World Business Schools rating. We would like to get all three global accreditations for our business education: AACSB, EQUIS, and AMBA. MBA programs of ALMA University, the only one in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, are already accredited by AMBA, thus standing in one row with the 200 best business universities in the world. We are very proud of it. Furthermore, our goal in terms of internationalization is that every fifth full-time faculty member and every fifth student at ALMA University are coming from abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the presence of international companies changing the way that firms in Kazakhstan handle human resource needs?</h4><p><strong>AIGUL </strong><strong>SHAMSHILDAYEVA</strong> International companies have high standards they would like to maintain in Kazakhstan and they are looking for people to match those standards. Sometimes they can find people themselves by advertising, through internal recruitment, or their HR departments. When they cannot find it or the time frame is narrow, they ask recruitment agencies to help. In addition to highly-skilled, English speaking workers, companies are looking for someone who would be committed, someone diligent, with the right attitude, someone they can rely on and that presents another challenge. Even qualified, well-educated, experienced people can be swapping jobs: competitors offer a more attractive package or career development opportunities. The company has to consider salary levels compared to other companies, as well as the overall compensation package, the career development potential, especially to mid-level management.</p><p><strong>DAVID MASHURI</strong> International companies are not the only ones hiring expatriates. If you look at the banking sector, which is not all that active right now, you will notice that even local banks have expatriates in their management team. That is an industry, by the way, where we have the most properly developed talent in Kazakhstan. We have many graduates, who want to enter the financial sector, but we have seen many executives, who are not from Kazakhstan. We are able to assess the potential of the candidate, who is entering the organization, or the potential of the employee, who is up for promotion. We are able to do this through our patented products such as "ViaEDGE," which is an online assessment tool that is based on Lominger competencies library and identifies the Learning Agility of our candidates. Our international clients, such as Philip Morris or Mars, utilize this competencies library, so that when they hire people we receive a job description and competencies that we have to look for. Our clients also use it for internal assessments for the high potential or succession planning programs.</p><h4>How do you expect the recent regional agreements to affect the labor market in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> We will have an outflow of qualified, educated, experienced people from here to Russia because the salaries are higher and the packages may be better, and an inflow of less-qualified and less-educated people from other countries for whom the Kazakhstani labor market is attractive. There is an inflow of expatriates coming from Russia. This is a concern for our labor market—the rising outflow of qualified people to Russia and in inflow of less-qualified people from other countries. To improve this situation, first of all, our education system needs improvement. We still bring a lot of foreign labor in Kazakhstan, which is good because companies that invest in Kazakhstan want to bring their employees and this creates a diverse, cosmopolitan culture. However, from a government perspective, with the Labor Ministry complaining about the high unemployment rate, and the education system needs attention. If I was the Minister of Labor, I would work with the Minister of Education and review statistics over the last fifteen or twenty years and show for which jobs work permits are mostly required over the years, what is the real demand of the Employers.</p><p><strong>DM</strong> We expected there to be more executives coming from Russia to Kazakhstan. In reality, all of the projects that I have done here have had access to the Russian market for the placement of executives, especially those coming from Moscow, have not had a very good reception. I think the reason behind that is because majority of Russian executives view Kazakhstan as being too peripheral a market, and they do not look at it as an opportunity to build a network if they move to Kazakhstan. So they are not willing to relocate freely. We were much more effective in bringing in executives from Eastern Europe, such as Poland or the Czech Republic. This is still very much the case, but it may change because of the ruble's instability and the perception that Kazakhstan will be a more interesting market for Russian executives.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How you would evaluate your business performance in 2014?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VLADIMIR YATCHENKO</strong> Last year was quite interesting. We grew and we met our budget figures. We did it mainly because of the expansion of our market, providing best service and of course attracting new customers. The combination of these factors helped us to achieve our targets. We started the year quite well. Though there was a slowdown in May, we felt a new wave of improvement, and our business started to grow again. The period between May and October was characterized by a very good performance. Yet starting from November, we felt a slowdown. As last year we were focused on the Caspian area, now we have slightly expanded our facility there. We are working on a contract for a facility that will be one of the biggest in the area. We also focused on our operations in Almaty. Last year, we relocated the headquarters there. The new office is almost 300 sqm larger than the previous one. We also increased the number of employees there, and are focusing on Astana and Almaty.</p><h4>What relationships does the company develop with other international companies in order to improve the quality of service?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>BAGDAT MUSSIN</strong> We study the work of other countries in transformation, and employconsultants that successfully transform other markets. As an example of perfect logistics we like to look up to Post NL in the Netherlands. In financial services, Italy is a good example. Australia is a great example of using a branch network for public and social services. Unlike us, Australia does not have transit potential, but its post offices provide a wide variety of services, both governmental and non-governmental. Different countries have different experience with their postal services, and right now we need some improvements, because many of our processes are not client-oriented. The Netherlands has one of the best postal administrations, which turned the post office into a full logistics operator. The number of deliveries per person there is 130 million per 16 million citizens. We are currently transporting six million per 16 million. We also need to use all our transit potential and organize delivery services between different countries.</p><h4>What kind of logistics services are the most in demand in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VY</strong> The majority of our services deal with express documents and parcels. We can cover the majority of cities in Kazakhstan in only one day. Moreover, between a few cities like Astana, Almaty, and Karagandy we provide same-day delivery.</p><h4>To what extent do you start competing with such logistic giants as DHL or FedEx?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BM</strong> According to the Universal Postal Union, postal deliveries on waybill are transported by postal operators, in this particular case Kazpost acts as such a transit delivery service. DHL and FedEx do not have transit operational relations, and we are using this advantage of ours to enter into competition with other global delivery services. In our own country the postal service market is liberalized but there is only one assigned delivery operator, Kazpost.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2015?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VY</strong> Our priority is to remain a market leader and provide the best quality service. We want to be a fast and reliable partner for our customers. We are working with many customers, in different business segments and we will keep concentrating on the highest level of quality and continue to grow our e-commerce tools.</p><p><span></span><strong>BM</strong> We would like to create a network of post machines; automated post stations to receive and send  postal items. We have already set up 18 post machines around the country, and this year we are planning to set up 100 more. We are sure that this service will be yet another way of stimulating the e-commerce market. We are also trying to unite the traditional postal service with internet services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Kazakhstan's green energy potential?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ZHOMART MOMINBAYEV</strong> According to the experts, the potential of the green power industry in Kazakhstan exceeds 1 trillion KWh a year. Of this, the wind power capacity is estimated to be 920 billion KWh a year. This figure was highlighted by the adviser of the UNDP/GEF project for energy efficiency, Gennadiy Doroshin, at the International Green Bridge 2013 conference. This figure is also 10 times more than the annual consumption in the entire country.</p><p><strong>VYACHESLAV SOVETSKIY</strong> Renewable energy and solar energy in particular cannot be developed in Kazakhstan without government support. The tariffs for traditional energy are increasing, while those for renewable energy are in decline. This will be the case for the foreseeable future. The legislation is in place. Recent amendments are encouraging business activity in this area. There is a specific index prescribed by law: by 2020 renewables must account for 3%, and this is a challenging goal. Currently, the rate is less than 1%. But this number will keep increasing because we are opening new capacities, and we will keep opening them in the course of coming years. The average number of peak sun-hours per year is 1,300. In southern Kazakhstan, the number of peak sun-hours reaches 1,600-1,800 hours per year compared to an average of about 1,000 in Europe. The potential is huge. Given that there are some regions like Zhambolsk that rely heavily on imported power, solar energy could reduce this burden and accelerate the development of SMEs. Specifically, agriculture can benefit greatly from solar power.</p><h4>What is the importance of establishing partnerships and JVs with local companies and international players?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ZM</strong> Our intention is to promote the Samruk Energy brand in the international arena through collaboration with the global market leaders in developing renewable projects outside Kazakhstan. Recently, we have been discussing partnership opportunities with a well-known French company in the wind and solar segment, and we have signed a MoU. This is a great opportunity to promote Samruk Energy internationally. We also have an innovation research team within Samruk that works on developing high-tech, energy-efficient solutions. We are designing a driver which will enable LED systems to work longer in the extreme weather conditions. R&amp;D plays a pivotal role in our activity.</p><h4>How are you promoting renewables throughout the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VS </strong>We have an MoU with Nazarbayev University, which runs a research center on renewables. Obviously, we work very closely with its staff and they visit our power plants. In the foreseeable future Nazarbayev University is planning to launch a 2 MW solar power plant. Our company is interested in a variety of topics, and recently held an energy storage exhibition. Astana Solar is ready to work with various businesses regarding inverters and other components for solar power plants. We also work with important international brands such as the Solar Engineering and Manufacturing Association (SEMA) in terms of knowledge transfer. On September 1st—traditionally the beginning  of the school year—we held a class at a high school talking about renewable energy. This is actually the most effective way to promote renewables. We participate in numerous festivals and workshops and international exhibitions. Astana Solar has several bulk buyers, but we prefer individual buyers who purchase 1-5 kW units because it results in a synergistic effect. For example, some groups, such as hunters, fishermen, and farmers need mobile power plants. Another viable application is historic buildings and sites situated in remote areas. As for the Expo, President Nazarbayev emphasized that the Expo will be held not only in Astana, but in other parts of  Kazakhstan. That means developing city infrastructure, and implementing energy saving technologies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>ETSUO HASHINO</strong> It is not easy to pick just one factor for the automotive industry to come to Kazakhstan; however, in the case of Toyota, we simply produce a car for which demand exists. We carefully observe demand not just in the short term, but also in the long term. This is how we decide to begin production and sales in a specific country.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>CLAUDE COESLIER</strong> The country is well suited for car production. Kazakhstan is far from Europe, customs fees play a major role, and in order to be competitive in terms of price, establishing the local production of our vehicles was the only way to maintain our competitive advantage. This edge allows us to sell cars like the Peugeot 301 with a price tag of $15,000 and it is our best seller in Kazakhstan. Without it, it would have been harder to penetrate the market.</p><h4>What challenges exist in boosting capacities and sales sector wide?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> It is difficult to measure the size of the market under the volatile market situation like now. In 2014 we revised our market forecast several times. The latest forecast was less than 160,000 units, which is slightly less than the previous year. Usually, toward the end of the year, sales in Kazakhstan increase; however, this year was totally different. After the devaluation in February, there was a small peak in March and April because every car maker tried to sell their stock at a discount using the old exchange rate. But from May 2014, there were seven consecutive months when the market was lower than the year before. Therefore, it is a very tough situation for us.</p><p><span></span><strong>CC</strong> The current situation is challenging, mainly due to the high number of cars still imported from Russia. In light of the devaluation of the tenge, the performance of the sector in 2014 mirrored that of 2013—about 160,000 cars. For 2015 we anticipate about 195,000, but the January numbers are already down by 30% over 2014 and 40% down on 2013. We may have to revise our expectations. This is a consequence of the exchange rate between the ruble and the tenge. However, in the longer term, we anticipate the market rising to 300,000 units by 2020.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals?</h4><p><span></span><strong>EH</strong> The most important goal for us is to meet customers' expectations. This is also one of the important mindsets of Toyota—always thinking about customers. We try to meet the customers' expectations and demands and that is the basis of our business attitude. Looking at the oil price reduction, the Russian ruble's depreciation, and the devaluation of the local currency, I think 2015 will be again tough for us. The figures are not easy to guess; however, I always keep customer satisfaction philosophy in my mind when I am doing business.</p><p><span></span><strong>CC</strong> The main priority is our network, because it is not possible to reach our target of 2,000 with just four dealers. The first car will be produced by the middle of 2016, which means that 2015 is crucial, and we must finalize the design of the factory and find the suppliers. And after that, we must reach the sales target. We cannot do that without having a solid network of dealers, as well as the highest quality of both service and people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current situation in Kazakhstan, especially in Almaty for architectural and design firms?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ROLANDAS KLIUCINSKAS</strong> The local environment is dynamic, and the field is still growing. The quality of the buildings here in Kazakhstan differ significantly from the West, and a lot has to be done to elevate the local standards in terms of quality. The issue is that architects are not involved in professional and high-quality projects. This is the mission of Almaty Vilnius Architects: we are here to bring innovative standards and solutions <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>ALGIRDAS URBONAS</strong> When you look at medium-scale projects in this region, the difference between our projects, and the rest becomes apparent. Local firms are focusing on the utilization of the building—at the expense of the details. Almaty Vilnius Architects are introducing a new approach; we are focusing on the whole project and paying attention to the details, with a professional approach, and doing extensive consultation as well. Local companies are not able to handle the technical requirements. Moreover we use innovative and international IT solutions for designing our projects.</p><h4>Can you describe the company's approach to the projects?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AU</strong> Our activity is characterized by several phases starting with research, which is a fundamental premise for our work. This means starting out by gauging the viability of a project. The second pillar is taking a holistic approach. We identify all the possible challenges and obstacles that we will face during the implementation of the project, from the beginning to the end. Our target is the real object, always. A real object exists in more ways than its architectural manifestation; it has to serve its intended purpose. We work both on the architectural project and on the interior design. A holistic approach to the project is the distinctive signature of Almaty Vilnius Architects. The dialogue with the clients is another crucial component—we ensure a clear and effective communication between our team and the client.</p><h4>Who are your clients in the local market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RK</strong> If a potential client wants to make a "box" with something in it, we send him or her elsewhere. This is not our type of client. Not every client is in a position to make the level of investment we require. The projects we take on determine our status in the market and our level of professionalism. While we may not yet be "archi-stars," we still create a quality product, which takes time. This is very important.</p><p><span></span><strong>AU</strong> We see importance of value through demonstration. People may say that our projects are expensive, but well-planned projects actually save money during construction. The workers and builders won't waste their time. They will know what they have to do because they have a detailed project with specific and technical details. The alternative approach requires guesswork, due to incomplete planning which creates problems.</p><p><span></span><strong>RK</strong> We do work both for companies and for private individuals. Almaty Vilnius Architects is currently working on a residential complex, and on two private villas. These projects are characterized by innovative spatial solutions, and from an architectural point of view these projects are really complex and challenging. We work a lot with restaurants, which present a big challenge. Customers patronize restaurants for more than their food. The hunger ends after five minutes, but the environment transcends the entire dining experience. The challenge is to make people stay for two hours, which is how the restaurant makes money. Creating the right ambience is a complicated interplay of architecture and interior design.</p>]]></richbody0content>
