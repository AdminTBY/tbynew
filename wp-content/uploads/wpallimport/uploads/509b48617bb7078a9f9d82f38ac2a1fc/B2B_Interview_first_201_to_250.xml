With the change in government, we have seen regulations change too. Since then those licenses have been revoked until the new regulation is decided, however, Olga Sánchez Cordero, the Minister of Interior, has submitted legislation to legalize the possession, public use, growth, and sale of the plant in an attempt to change the country's panorama.

Also, it would decrease the burden on the justice system, produce low-cost medicine for the health sector, and enable Mexico to participate in a multibillion-dollar global industry. Already, due to a number of factors, Mexico is the number-one producer of cannabis in the world. The country has one of the best natural conditions to grow this plant. The objective is to legalize all plants, but not derived products that can be very harmful for health such as cocaine, as these are made with chemicals that have the potential to kill people. However, by legalizing the plants, we allow scientists to properly research the benefits of them. A program to start teaching growers how to cultivate the plant organically should be implemented as they are currently being grown with pesticides and toxic chemicals. Cannabisalud is currently presenting programs that can be of benefit to both the government and the related communities as a way to help them better understand the situation.</p><h4>What are the main gaps that need further improvement?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RC</strong> First, the government appears to be more concerned with selling the product than with educating the public on how to consume such products. There is little-to-no medical research in Mexico about the plant and its effects. That is why we believe pioneering such investigations are necessary. At present, there are talks about medical cannabis as well as recreational use and cultivation. Cannabis is highly stigmatized in México, and we need to help the government with such large-scale changes. We on our part will try to help push this cultural change by funding research that validates the plant as a medical alternative, educating the public with accurate information, and once the laws allow, providing a safe space to purchase the product.</p><h4>What role will Mexico have in the global cannabis market once it is fully legalized in the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LB</strong> Mexico will serve as the biggest plant producer and product manufacturer in the global cannabis market, as it does in the automotive and aerospace industries. The country is not a large consumer in comparison to countries like the US, which means Mexico has more potential to be the number-one exporter of regulated cannabis and derived products. Notably, US scientists have invented a machine that uses tons of raw materials like the stalks and leaves of a plant seamlessly separates it into different materials such as fiber, lignin, and cellulose, which can be used to make paper, plastic, textiles, fuel, and construction materials. Such technology in Mexico and Colombia would thrive thanks to the thousands of tons of plant material available.</p><h4>What product line will you be releasing?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RC</strong> Our portfolio will mostly be cannabis-derived products.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why do you believe Mexico is one of the most profitable areas in the world to invest in luxury tourism?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BORJA ESCALADA</strong> Mexico is one of the few countries that offers many opportunities to develop profitable and powerful tourism projects. Its location next to the US and Canada is a great advantage as well. Asian visitors are also becoming increasingly interested in visiting Mexico thanks to its climate and scenery. The beaches and the coast are well developed, and the culture is friendly, welcoming, and service oriented. Labor costs are reasonable, which means you have visitors that are willing to pay more for the extra services that we are providing them.</p><h4>Why did you decide to focus on luxury tourism?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DIEGO LARESGOITI </strong>We identified an untapped opportunity in the Mexican Stock Exchange for luxury tourism; this segment represents a large part of GDP but it still wasn't represented in Bolsa. Mexico's tourism industry is highly competitive mainly due to its proximity to the US and outstanding service and infrastructure. Another important factor is connectivity: for example, Mexico's Cancún Airport handles around 25 million passengers yearly and is expanding to meet a capacity of 40 million. We are also optimistic about the Puerto Vallarta region, as the federal government is investing USD500 million in a highway to connect Guadalajara to the Puerto Vallarta region. This will reduce travel time from four to two hours. The highway is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.</p><h4>What have been the main advancements of your developing projects?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BE</strong> Recently, we bought Mayakoba, where we have important investments lined up, such as the new Rosewood and One&amp;Only developments. We have already completed the beach recovery, where we invested USD12 million and are now investing an additional USD17 million. We are expanding Banyan Tree with a new area for events. Also, we are working on beachfront rooms with an investment of around USD50 million; these will be opened by end-2020. Moving forward, we will be investing more than USD85 million in Mayakoba. On the Pacific coast, we are developing Mandarina, a 265-ha development. We are also building the One&amp;Only hotel, which should open in 2Q2020. We are in the design process of the Rosewood Mandarina, a hotel with 90 to 120 rooms. A number of amenities, including an equestrian center, a polo center, and a beach club for residential space, will open by the end of 2019. In total, we are investing USD500 million in Mayakoba and Mandarina alone.</p><h4>What is the key differentiator to your market offering?</h4><p><strong>DL</strong> There are several factors that in my opinion differentiate us from other investment alternatives. The first one is our team, which has a proven track record in hotels, financing, construction, and development. Another differentiator is our portfolio, which we consider as unique because of assets such as the Four Seasons and Rosewood Mayakoba, among others. Another differentiator is the sector we focus on; Mexico is one of the most profitable parts of the world to develop luxury hotels. We are confident in the luxury tourism segment as we generate USD and have strong barriers of entry. Each area has its selection of top brands and hotels, and in places like Punta Mita or Cancún, it would be difficult to create a new brand and compete. RLH owns the real estate and has long-term contracts with operators. RLH also mitigates risks by only investing in projects that are on their last mile of development. We do not take any development risks, but we do assume construction risks. A project such as Mandarina, around 45 minutes from Puerto Vallarta Airport, is unique and difficult to create. It is difficult to find such locations, which is another barrier of entry, and precisely why One&amp;Only and Rosewood want to enter Mandarina. </p><h4>How does the recent purchase of Villa Magna in Spain align with your international expansion plans?</h4><p><span></span><strong>BE</strong> As a Mexican company, we need to continue growing in Mexico, but also internationally in order to balance and diversify our portfolio. This was a part of the strategy when we decided to purchase Villa Magna. Before purchasing Villa Magna, we analyzed at least 20 opportunities in Spain, Portugal, and other countries. Villa Magna was the perfect match with our portfolio, as it is one of the best city hotels in Madrid with tremendous potential for rebranding. Notably, it was designed by a Mexican and 17% of the room nights are with Mexican customers. It is the most Mexican hotel in Europe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What sets you apart in the market?<br></strong><strong>JUAN PABLO CAMPOS </strong>We are a relevant exporter of specialty coffee in Colombia focused on trading certified coffees. By "certified" I mean organic-, Fair Trade-, and Rainforest Alliance-certified. Those are the three main certificates that we trade with our partners. What is relevant is that we have a transparent mechanism through this certification of transferring price premiums to producers. Each of these certifications involves a premium. If one is organic certified, they receive a specific premium for that certification. The same is true for Fair Trade or Rainforest Alliance certifications. That is how we add to the income of our producers. We pay the base price as any other exporter, and then we attach the certificate premiums. This provides the producer extra income and makes his work profitable and sustainable.</p><p><strong>CARLOS DE VALDENEBRO </strong>We have a model in which final farmer payments are solely based on the quality delivered to our warehouses, and we are confident to say that we pay far higher prices than anyone else. We pay the most and demand the highest quality from our farmer partners, which allows us to export the best and highest priced coffee coming out of Colombia. As a quality-focused business model, this means that we are able to pay high quality premiums to the farmers as we educate them in how to process their coffee differently, while we support and encourage them to produce only top-quality coffee. As we demand more, we also pay more. For example, for our lowest-quality coffee, a farmer receives a 20-25% premium over commercial coffee, while our top-quality coffee can easily pay a premium of 300-400%. We create change and positive development in coffee growing communities by focusing on our five operating pillars of promoting cup quality, improving farm management, increasing productivity and efficiency, sustainable practices, and community development. For example, we have a division that covers all our educational efforts called PECA. In Colombia, we have over 16 agronomists trying to help educate farmers on best practices for constantly producing the highest quality as we search for new areas and relationships. Producing high-end quality is not rocket science, but it does need a different mindset that only farmers who are willing to go 'the extra mile' have. The best coffee requires more work, and we only work with the best farmers.</p><p><strong>How are you working to enhance your position as a market leader?<br></strong><strong>JPC</strong> The global coffee market is undergoing a dynamic and aggressive consolidation process similar to what happened in the beer market. Actually, the same actors that participated in the global consolidation of beer have made their way into the coffee market to consolidate premium roasted coffee brands. Obviously younger generations and coffee consumers are very interested in sustainability, as well as environmental and social issues within the coffee supply chain. There is also a huge global demand for what we call voluntary sustainability standards (VSS). So these companies are keen on having voluntary sustainability standards, such as organic, Rainforest, or Fair Trade. As such, a business can voluntarily adopt specific standards, as consumers demand such certifications. </p><p><strong>CV</strong> We have replicated the Colombian model in eight different countries across Latin America. We educate and train small and medium-sized farmers to develop the highest quality. As of 2018, we exported coffee to almost 30 countries worldwide and have close to 300 different customers. All of our customers are coffee roasters that are committed to quality and long-term relationships. That said, the US is by far the largest market, followed closely by the UK and Australia. Japan is also seeing huge growth rates, as is Asia in general. We also sell to some companies in Colombia, a local market that is slowly developing in really interesting ways. We have local roasters in almost every country that we operate in, something that did not exist even five years ago. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We have a huge fund to grow from, but nevertheless we are continuously adapting the products once more to the market needs, while our global R&amp;D functions and local R&amp;D activities also increase innovation. Being the leader in the global segment of our industry, and especially with the acquisition of USG in 2019, we have a huge portfolio of products that goes far beyond the actual offer here in Colombia. We have a huge fund to grow from, but nevertheless we are continuously adapting the products once more to the market needs, while our global R&amp;D functions and local R&amp;D activities also increase innovation.</p><p><strong>JUANITA B</strong><strong>Á</strong><strong>EZ ANZOLA</strong> In 2018, Metecno had its biggest increase in sales over recent years, so in 2019, our commitment will be to social causes. We plan to do housing and school projects because there is definitely a need here. We need to build classrooms where children receive the conditions they are supposed to. We need to collaborate with the country and the government because they are not able to do everything they need to. Metecno will always focus more on the commercial and industrial sectors, though it is also extremely important to contribute to social development in the country. We are currently developing a housing project to ensure rural houses have the right materials to create a comfortable living environment, such as thermal and acoustic insulation panels to protect against extreme weather and noise. We will also continue with our industrial and commercial projects, such as shopping centers. People truly appreciate our building materials because they can see the difference compared to the products they currently receive. However, it has been difficult to get the government's cooperation. When we get to the last stage of getting these projects approved, there are many restrictions, and it has been extremely difficult for us. However, we are working with the right people in the government who understand that the country needs this.</p><p><strong>How do you raise awareness of your products?<br></strong><strong>TB</strong> We have established a partner program here as we have in many other markets. The goal of this is the improvement of quality; the quality of service and product, and the relationship not just between our clients and us, but between our clients and theirs. The companies can gain points for their presentation of our product to their customers. Therefore, the program aims for quality of relationship and less on quantity, price and commodities in our market. When companies team up with us, the added value they get is an increased level of service, especially in terms of logistics, which is important in this market, in addition to support on project specification. They also get access to our network of architects, construction companies, and installers.</p><p><strong>JBA</strong> Metecno has been in Colombia since 1999, though we have mostly been working in larger cities. Over the years, people have gotten to know about our insulated building panels, which are new in Colombia. There are only two companies in the country that produce such panels. We have been educating the market so more people understand the real benefits of these products and how to use them correctly. Sometimes it is easier when dealing with multinationals from outside Colombia because they already know the technology. Today, many construction projects in Colombia's main cities use insulated panels, though we have to introduce them into projects in smaller cities where they may not have thought to use this product before. Because of our experience around the world, we know these products are for everyone, are flexible, and everyone can benefit from using them in big or small building projects, no matter where they are located.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have your operations been going as of late?<br></strong><strong>ALAIN EICHMANN</strong> DSV is a multinational Danish company that has been operating in Colombia for five years. Since its establishment, the company has grown quickly; however, since 2018 was an electoral year, business was slow, and we have not grown as expected. Still, we expect the economy to pick up in the coming year. So far, we have gone into Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, and Cartagena, though we also send sales people to other small cities. In this way, we cover the entire country. Indeed, the company's Colombia operations are the fourth largest in Latin America after Mexico, Brazil, and Chile, where we have been present for 10 years. We also have smaller operations in Peru, Costa Rica, Panama, Argentina, and Uruguay. </p><p><strong>MIGUEL FLOREZ </strong>Aviomar has an extremely long history in the logistics trade to and from Colombia, having been in the market for 60 years. The company was founded by Felice Snider, a Swiss national and authority on the international trade market. Today, we have two business lines: the moving side, which is all about relocation and mobility, and cargo projects and freight forwarding. 2017 was a fair year; we had great results compared to 2018, which was slightly slow due to the elections and Colombia's troubles in the regional market. Our customers are waiting to see how the government develops its policies to take action and encourage people to invest in the country.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on your portfolio of customers in Colombia? <br></strong><strong>AE </strong>First are the large multinationals, which we call global accounts; there you have all kinds of industries including automotive, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, and fast-moving consumer goods. Second, we have key local customers in our portfolio. This includes clients in a variety of sectors, including spare parts, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastic goods, and food, among others. What helps us is a solid foundation of good technology that makes operations easier and safer. This is the biggest difference when comparing DSV to its competitors. In general, all companies like DSV integrate logistics from door to door, and a sole player cannot do much to overcome logistics and infrastructure challenges in Colombia. Indeed, we have a worldwide integrated system that helps us keep the integrity of the data safe. At the same time, that helps us to be faster when it comes to giving answers to customers or providing access to information. Most importantly, it gives us full visibility of the supply chain.</p><p><strong>MF</strong> We work a great deal with multinational companies, which are our target market and niche. Our door-to-door mobility and relocation services ensure we provide 100% excellence and commitment to our clients. When someone is being relocated to a different country for a company, they have to be ready to perform their job as soon as possible without facing problems such as trying to find a home, dealing with customs, looking for schools, and so forth. Our major goal is to make the move a smooth process for expatriates. Indeed, many clients seek one player to provide a complete service. When relocating, one does not want to have to deal with various parties. Moving is one of the most stressful processes for a person because they need to set up new roots for themselves and their families. We want to make it easy for them by having one person deal with the entire process for them. Our philosophy is that we provide a real door-to-door service that removes any problems.<span></span><br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the vision behind the opening of CVSKL in 2017?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TAN SRI DR. YAHYA AWANG</strong> The country needed a heart center where we could service not only the people of Malaysia, but also those in the surrounding region. The opportunity came when an investor wanted to open a private hospital with heart surgery facilities in partnership with doctors. CVSKL opened in 2017 to focus on heart and vascular diseases. I was fortunate, thanks to my long sojourn in the healthcare industry, to fulfill my aim of bringing many of the leading clinicians under one roof, providing the necessary service and contributing to the national economy. Gathering the leading cardiologists and cardiac surgeons in the country has arguably made us one of the leading heart hospitals in this region.</p><h4>How do you assess IJN's contribution to the development of human capital in Malaysia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DATO' SERI DR. MOHD AZHARI YAKUB</strong> We have been operating for 26 years and have become the nexus of excellence in medical healthcare, especially in cardiac services, not only in Malaysia but also the region. Cardiology departments in medical centers in Penang, Malacca, and Kuala Lumpur receive many foreigners and are run by the people who we trained. We have trained more than 180 foreign doctors from Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Japan, and we are beginning to receive doctors from the Middle East and the UK. Those who come to work with us face a steep learning curve. It is normal for us to see 15 heart operations in one day; only a handful of centers in Europe have that kind of volume.</p><h4>What are the most important trends and developments transforming the healthcare sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>YA</strong> One important trend in healthcare is digitalization and IT, which has improved tremendously over the past 10 years. We are in the progress of completing the implementation of electronic medical records (EMR) in our hospital. It will take a while for doctors to get used to it, though this will provide the impetus for us to grow further—not only in cost, but also technological advancement. Regarding cardiac care, there have been important innovations and developments, such as surgery for a beating heart, which is practical for elderly patients. We also have newer methods in terms of repairing and putting valves. Valve technology has improved in terms of the hemodynamic functions of the valve itself.</p><p><span></span><strong>MAY</strong> IJN is embarking on a transformation in healthcare technology and will be fully electronic by next year. We are investing heavily in healthcare technology with electronic medical records (EMR) and hospital information systems. IJN is now moving to the next stage. Our ambition is to be able to do analytics on our patients, using the information from our call center and social media to understand our patients' thoughts and complaints. It is no longer about medical technology but how we can leverage big data using patient analytic research. The EMR hospital information system allows us to digitalize our processes as much as possible so that we can have full data analytics covering clinical care, research, hospital finances, and our patient needs and services.</p><h4>What are the most important growth catalysts for medical tourism in Malaysia?</h4><p><span></span><strong>YA</strong> We need more specialized hospitals like CVSKL. I would welcome a specialized oncology hospital or one catering to diabetic patients. We could also have orthopedic centers, and all these would contribute toward the growth of medical tourism. There are tax incentives available if we receive foreign patients beyond 5% of our workload, and we are already at around 10%. The main source market for international patients coming to CVSKL is Indonesia, and we have also started to receive patients from Bangladesh and China. Together with our partners TE Healthcare and TPG, we hope to form and build established centers of excellence in many capital cities throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p><span></span><strong>MAY</strong> Malaysia is naturally suited for medical tourism because of its geographical location and multinational and multicultural society. We have highly skilled medical personnel, so we need exposure to send the right message of having a flagship medical care service. The government has identified cardiology as one of the key specialties, and we are well suited to be the flagship of cardiology care since we are recognized among our peers in this region. It is about translating that to make sure the Asia Pacific region knows this. We are ready and will work closely with the government to translate the vision of IJN and Malaysia as a medical destination. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What kinds of complexities have you faced in adjusting to the market? <br></strong><strong>JOSÉ FALCATO</strong> We arrived in 2013 when the government started to talk about the mandatory implementation of the electronic invoice in Colombia. We wanted to be able to participate in the pilot schemes and work together with the local authorities on the creation of these regulations. In 2018, major taxpayers had to submit their electronic invoices by early December. So far, the company is doing well in terms of the goals set for 2018. Our goal was to triple 2017 numbers, something we were more than on pace to do midway through the year. As for our broader success, it is imperative that a company always adapts to the culture of the market in which it operates. The major problem in Colombia was the lack of workforce working in the IT sector. Therefore, the engagement and retention of employees is a great challenge. On the other hand, it is a dynamic market where people want to improve processes, achieve goals, and learn. </p><p><strong>PEDRO OTOYA </strong>The complex process of changing to the electronic invoicing system has taken longer than estimated, and the delays have been hard for every technology provider because we have been substantially investing in resources while not reaching productiveness; however, we have learned from this experience and acquired valuable knowledge. The closing of 2018 will be extremely important because the majority of large taxpayers will force other companies to adopt this technology. We expect to grow to much better levels the following next years, and we believe we can increase the number of clients from 1,500 to up to 50,000 if the law keeps promoting the obligatory shift to electronic invoicing. The challenge of electronic invoicing is not only regarding its implementation in SMEs but also in larger ones. Our challenge is to offer to hundreds of users a quality service and make them understand that this technology will make them acquire new benefits and contribute not only to solidify their country's competitiveness, but their own. Most importantly, the government tax authority, DIAN, which oversees the sector, has been set up and has begun to adjust its team and infrastructure to process and validate millions of electronic documents in real time, meet taxpayers' needs, and work hand in hand with technological providers. </p><p><strong>What is unique about the Colombian market?<br></strong><strong>JF</strong> Saphety has four product lines, among them Saphety Sync, which is the barcode catalog with a single customer per country; Saphety DOC, which involves electronic invoices and document sharing; Saphety Electronic Bill Presentment, which is for corporate clients in the telecommunications sector; and electronic invoicing. For example, regarding electronic invoicing, Colombia is the growth avenue, as it is a developing market with four times the number of potential clients of our head office, so we are very optimistic.</p><p><strong>PO</strong> From the government's perspective, the country is in the process of modernization and is acquiring the ability to use cutting-edge technology such as big data and artificial intelligence. Electronic invoicing will give access to real-time information of all billings in Colombia, enabling the government to have effective control over those who pay taxes or not. Consequently, the country will increase its tax collections and have more resources to invest in important areas such as education and modernization. In addition, invoice issuing will be more efficient for the companies, while the process of buying and receiving electronic documents will also be automated. To sum up, it is a win-win situation, where there will be efficiency benefits for companies and collection and control ones for the government. This last factor will allow Colombia to grow in a better way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[emeralds]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are your current plans and projects in Colombia?<br></strong><strong>KENNETH NIALL YOUNG</strong> Over the past five years, we have been looking at prospects and undertaking exploration. We are also coming to terms with the geology and working to understand the controls on emerald mineralization and the development of emerald deposits in Colombia. We are primarily an exploration and mining company, though one of our shareholders is a diamantaire and major jewelry manufacturer. The company's objective is to explore and ultimately mine minerals. The company has extensive expertise in exploration, mining and sales and marketing of colored gems. Today, we are focused on the top three colored stones: emeralds, rubies, and sapphires. We are only looking for the best, and the best emeralds in the world are found in Colombia.</p><p><strong>CHRIS HARRIS </strong>Hexa Resources is an integrated emerald and colored stone business. It is different from many other businesses in this space in that we look to mine, buy, cut, and sell emeralds globally. We are in Colombia because it is the premium emerald location in the world. For 500 years, the emeralds from Colombia have been the best in the world. I want to build a suite of premium stones, which is why we are in Colombia. Our intention is to start with small acquisitions, build relationships with the right people, and then move into production. We want to build a sensible business that looks after its workers and benefits the community. This is extremely important for the company.</p><p><strong>What is your approach to social responsibility and ethical mining?<br></strong><strong>KNY</strong> We seek to set up emerald mining here in a more commercial and sustainable way. At the minute, it is common for mining licenses to be held by 13-14 shareholders, which is difficult to deal with. Mines often work on a production-sharing basis, where the shareholders will split production, which is not the optimal way to do it. The contractors work on a production-sharing basis, and there is no incentive for them to put in a great deal of capital into the mine when they could be replaced at any time. We would like to develop sustainable operations with long-term plans so that people can have the assurance of ongoing employment. That will attract additional investment and much more stability. From a business perspective, we look to develop mines that are larger than they currently are, well planned, well maintained, well-funded and that will run for a long period of time.</p><p><strong>CH</strong> Our approach is extremely informed by the fact that two core members of our team, including myself, worked at BHP Billiton for a decade. Social responsibility is a key aspect of how we approach the business. When we look at an area, we look at how we can help the community. We will invest more than the tax required into the community. We are interested in doing things that genuinely help the community rather than lip-service investments. We want get involved in investments like renewing brick factories and helping build businesses that bring more work to the community. We are interested in investing in things that can develop and build communities, so they are truly transformed. Due to the emphasis on mining in the communities we work, this could also include training people in mining and geology techniques. It could also include bringing in new agricultural skills.</p><p><strong>What role do you expect the Colombian operations to play in your overall portfolio?<br></strong><strong>KNY</strong> We expect it to play a major part, certainly 50-60% of the portfolio, ultimately. Our goal is simple: to undertake grassroots exploration in areas where emeralds can be found and to discover new mines. Since 2010 we have been working to identify target areas and have undertaken huge data surveys and extensive analysis through remote sensing satellite work. We have had geologists on the ground for the last five to six years. We have done a great deal of preparation to get going here.</p><p><strong>What potential does the colored gems market have to produce value for the Colombian economy?<br></strong><strong>CH</strong> This is a truly exciting market. The wholesale cut colored gemstones market is a USD8-billion market. Emeralds represent around USD2-2.5 billion of that market, making them a significant market. However, there are few major firms in the space. There are only about USD30 million worth of market cap in terms of the companies that serve this market. This is a huge opportunity. As a young company, we want to build a saleable business and develop a leading, responsible brand in the industry. We must market the stones right through to the end user. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2018, Philips Lighting changed its worldwide name to Signify. What does that mean for your operations in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PEDRO MARTIN</strong> The main reason we changed the name is because lighting business has undergone a major shift. Traditional light bulbs are a consumable commodity that you have to replace every six to 12 months. On the other hand, today, a good quality light-emitting diode (LED) is a 10-year infrastructural decision. The second aspect is connectivity, where for example we have the IoT now, which means we can do many things with LED technology. Those two major changes required us to reinvent the company and refocus it to a new market. So, we changed the name to Signify, which is now listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Signify is an independently listed company, and our name change reflects the reinvention we went through to reflect the present market reality.</p><h4>What role does the company intend to have in the international glass market and what kind of projects does it collaborate on?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MIGUEL MILLET </strong>We are investing heavily in a new facility to boost our global presence. We already have a nationwide and international presence, and are looking forward to increase our market share. We undertake different projects, from large residential projects to high-end structures. The difference between producing for the low-end and high-end segments is that while the low-end segment involves a large volume of standard glass with no specific requirements, the high-end segment requires higher-quality glass and specific requirements such as aesthetics and insulation properties to address sunlight and external noise. Due to our experience and capacity, we are able to focus on high-end projects. We are currently working on projects all over Mexico. We also work on projects in the US and Central America.</p><h4>Since 2016, over 50% of lighting sales from Signify worldwide were LED-based. How does the Mexican market compare to these global figures?</h4><p><strong>PM</strong> Bearing in mind that Mexico is a particularly contrasted market, we are still growing our LED sales. For example, in Mexico we have around 220 million points of light in households, 15% of which are still incandescent lights, which are inefficient and expensive. So, Mexico still offers a major opportunity. A significant chunk of our local business, more than 50%, is LED, and we are trying to move the market to LED because of its benefits. Notably, the situation is changing as the use of incandescent bulbs and halogen lamps is banned as of 2019, which means florescent and LEDs are the only two kinds of lights permitted in Mexico.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the demand for construction over the next couple of years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MM</strong> Based on real state insight, I foresee an excellent future. With the global population rising, the demand for housing will fuel construction for years to come. More number of tourists continue to flock to Cancún, Los Cabos, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, the Caribbean, and the US, which means more hotels are being built. Millet Glass Industry was a small local business that grew out because of the tourism sector, supplying glass to hotels in Cancún. These projects made us well-known in Mexico's hotel market.</p><h4>How much infrastructure is needed to fully implement smart lighting projects? Where does the local market currently stand in terms of IoT lighting integration?</h4><p><span></span><strong>PM </strong>The infrastructure and connectivity are ready; 80% of the 65 million cellphone users in Mexico have a smartphone. What we need are products that utilize that connectivity. Alexa and Google Home have entered the Mexican market recently and Signify is fully integrated with these voice assistant systems. This means the era of interconnected lighting and other features is here. Notably, we have an ecosystem of third-party developers, called Friends of Hue, developing apps that work with our connected lighting system. One example concerns video gamers, where Hue lighting synchronizes with the action happening on your screen to create a more immersive experience. Another good example of this smart technology is being used in the University of Dubai. The classroom lighting is all connected to the students' smartphone apps and can detect how many people are in the room and adjust the air conditioning accordingly.</p><h4>How much will you be producing at your new plant?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MM</strong> The production capacity will be 4,500 tons a month whereby we will be almost tripling our actual production. We are one of the biggest players in Mexico, and with the new factory we will become one of the largest glass companies in Latin America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>GEORGE MILLER-RAMOS</strong> Traditionally, Gensler opens offices following our clients. Most clients that take us to a new country are corporate clients who want to open corporate offices. The majority of our portfolio to date has been in the corporate interiors realm. We are now finishing a 30,000sqm project for AT&amp;T. We are also finishing the second phase of a large financial institution. The second phase is over 15,000sqm. We worked on a project with Facebook for two years, and soon we will start a project for Twitter. We also have a client in the medical industry. We are pursuing opportunities with other tech companies. We believe another strong sector is tech and fintech. Now that we have established here, we are branching out. We are starting a large hospitality project in Cabo in collaboration with our office in Los Angeles. We are actively pursuing other hospitality opportunities here. We have a strong team and continue to attract talent. Gensler operates in three sectors: work, lifestyle, and community. We also have a few master plans on the table currently in Monterrey and Hermosillo. We are operating in those three sectors now within five years of being here.</p><p><span></span><strong>RICARDO COMBALUZIER</strong> We are currently developing a building for the Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE) in Mérida, a development in Sisal, Yucatán, which is a mixture of housing and tourism complex with a note similar to Airbnb and with the concept of glamping. We are developing housing. We have two boutique hotel projects, one in Matanchén, Nayarit and the other one in Tequisquiapan, Querétaro. We have played our part, and while the business model is complicated, we have had numerous achievements, which won us recognition in local architecture biennials. The National Biennial of Architecture was the project of the year for the Expansion group; however, projects would benefit from more public sector compliance and making sure that these institutions do not abandon projects undertaken.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the Mexican real estate industry and what your company brings to it? </h4><p><span></span><strong>GMR</strong> Gensler has been around for a while. I do not see it as just another architecture firm. I have little interest in that. There are hundreds of people that know the market better than I do. What I want to do here is something more aligned with a think tank, or something that brings in people from fields other than architecture to shape the way we think. I am interested in bringing in new ways of thinking to how we approach projects. We have teams that do consulting, and they tend to bring more of an anthropology background, understanding human behavior. We attract people from programming and digital design. We have graphic designers and landscape architects. This is what makes us different from conventional firms. We hope this will attract the best talent in the country to come work with us.</p><p><span></span><strong>R</strong><strong>C</strong> Architecture, by definition, must be sustainable. As a trend, that concept has served to raise awareness, but sometimes certifications are only based on the technology used to achieve this sustainability. However, for the above to work, there must be good design. The building must be correctly oriented to take maximum advantage of the sun's energy and make more efficient the use of energy overall. The design must understand the environment, connect with the city and meet the needs of the user.  The previous municipal administration in Mérida has already begun to take steps to address the problem. Much more can be done but it is the first step, and now there are areas where development is limited due to private properties. It is necessary to do efficient governance even if there are political costs. No politician wants to assume the political cost when there are many resources and interests of powerful people who can remove support to the projects. We want to encourage investment in consolidated areas where there are already services present. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the real estate market reacting to the geopolitical volatility impacting Mexico? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JAVIER LOMELÍN </strong>Most of the decision makers in the real estate market are in a wait-and-see mode. They are most attentive to the regulatory change in the free trade agreement between the US, Canada, and Mexico. We expect these changes to be positive. Once established, the market will recover, especially in industrial manufacturing and specially the automotive sector. The industry is also expecting changes in local regulations, including Mexico City. Major projects of over 10,000sqm are on hold as developers await the new rules to be applied to the city, to see what it means for their projects before advancing. </p><h4>How well are construction projects in the country adapting to the rising demand for international standards?</h4><p><strong>VICTOR LACHICA</strong> The growing level of quality in the country is clear, especially when comparing older buildings to newer ones. Mexican developers have been able to attract international investors and players that are substantially improving the quality of projects in place. For example, Mexico began LEED certification for projects seven years ago, and today, there are more than 180 projects under scrutiny for LEED certification. Mexico is moving in the right direction when it comes to the type of projects and the quality of spaces it is developing. LEED certification is becoming widespread not only in commercial buildings but also industrial, hospitality, retail, and housing. </p><h4>What kind of advice would you offer to investors considering Mexican real estate? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JL </strong>Companies need to make sure that they are specialized in the areas they are entering, or developing in. They also have to be familiar with the conditions of each neighborhood; being able to read the market's behavior and grasp the trends. They have to try to forecast what will happen by the time the project is ready for the market. We find industrial real estate to be among the healthiest segments as it has a low vacancy rate. Many of these projects are built to suit, which is an advantage in allowing developers to build industrial plants and warehouses in months, rather than years. Another opportunity can be found in distribution and logistics centers due to changes the retail segment is undergoing. E-commerce is creating more demand for distribution centers and warehouses of different sizes, locations, and capabilities. Companies are under pressure to be as close to the market as possible, bringing good opportunities for developers. However, there are still opportunities in real estate for office developments as many companies are looking to expand, consolidate and get savings on rents. There are international companies arriving continuously. Having said this and taking into consideration the cycle of the market today, industrial real estate is the best bet.</p><p><span></span><strong>VL</strong> We are helping companies become more efficient in their use of space, be it offices, industrial spaces, or retail. Previously, offices accounted for 15-20sqm per person, but now, private offices are smaller with more open space and amenities for everyone. We were able to implement these new practices into our office renovation, reducing the 14sqm of space used per person to 10sqm. When it comes to industrial spaces, warehouses have become an incredible example of how automatization tremendously helps companies utilize their space efficiently. While there are still many businesses that need the showroom space, there is a trend of seeing less product space in retail as more clients prefer e-commerce. Everything is changing, and we are helping our clients to adapt to the new way of managing life, work, and shopping. The new generation is looking to live as near as possible to the places they access, and Mexico is trying hard to move forward with such new trends. Clients are becoming more global and they want to work with companies that can assure the same quality, practices, and ethics around the world. Therefore, we are working on our abilities to meet these needs consistently throughout sectors by reinforcing our local capabilities of market research, property and facility management, project management, brokerage, and advisory services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about what your company expects for 2019? </h4><p><span></span><strong>RENÉ MARTÍNEZ</strong> There will be 23 developments during 2019. 17 will start in the first half of the year. To date, we have already started operations in five of them. We will start six developments in the second semester. There will be new projects in all the states where we have a presence. 13 will address the residential segment, seven to middle-income housing, and three will focus on the segment of affordable entry level homes, aimed at the population that does not need a subsidy to acquire a home. Our products are categorized according to the price range, AEL, or houses with a price under MXN300,000 (USD15,954); middle-income housing, from MXN301,000 to MXN850,000 (USD45,210) and residential, up to MXN850,000.</p><p><span></span><strong>LEONARDO ARANA</strong> 2019 for BIM brings many challenges, though we have a great deal of enthusiasm and are extremely positive in terms of our plans. We are aligned with the new government strategy in terms of the housing industry and the developers' business as well. The implementation process has been extremely smooth. The people in the sector as well as the constructors and developers are in line with the new strategy and new government because they have been defining different ways of constructing better housing and better houses for Mexicans, which is great. Basically, they have been trying to align all the different participants in the market, government, and different sectors, specifically in our case financial institutions to truly focus on a better quality of life for Mexicans.</p><h4>How does demand for housing, and housing prices, affect your business? </h4><p><span></span><strong>RM</strong> The demand for housing is linked to the creation of jobs and formality. To have access to INFONAVIT, you need to have a formal job. In October 2018, INFONAVIT registered a demand from 6.2 million beneficiaries who can access a loan. This increased by 4.5%, according to the figure reported in October 2017. This is derived from 800,000 jobs created during 2017, according to information from the IMSS. These people comply with the requirements of INFONAVIT, and they have resulted in potential claimants for a home. Furthermore, the housing sector is an important part of the economy of the country. According to INEGI, the sector generated 6% of GDP in 2017 and more than 2.4 million jobs. A similar indicator is expected for 2018. We have a presence in the states where INFONAVIT distributes more than 53% of the credits it grants per year for new housing. This is a sign of the dynamism in real estate. Quintana Roo has had a strong dynamism in recent years, derived from the tourism sector and the consequential creation of jobs. However, the dynamism continues in all the states where we operate.</p><p><strong>LA</strong> The bank's history goes back 10 years or more, and we have been active in financing low-income houses. We have been keen to adapt ourselves to the changes in the environment in terms of not only the economic environment but also the government strategy in terms of the housing business. Over time and in the last few years, most of the financing has shifted a little bit toward medium-income housing, though we never left the low-income housing business. Right now, almost 49% of our total income goes to low-income housing, so we know the business well in terms of financing such housing. We have been in close contact with the government, advising it that this area requires a reorientation in terms of what developers did over the last four or five years. They have to be more efficient, and there has to be fewer steps in the construction process so that the final user will have a better house and a green house, which we are in favor of. We finance green projects throughout the country, and as in the near future we do not see subsidies as we used to receive from the government, it all depends on the ability and the possibility of developers receiving financing and building houses in a more efficient way. Over time, the cities have been growing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What kind of opportunities and challenges are available in Mexico in real estate?</h4><p><strong>JOANNA FRAZIER </strong>The biggest opportunity lies in the sheer scale of Mexico, and multifamily developments are very much a scale-based business. Second, Mexico has the demographic and socioeconomic trends we look for in a new market: large middle and high-income sector, big corporations with big labor forces, and demographic trends such as people getting married and having kids later. Third, there is a huge mismatch between supply and demand in terms of people who actively rent and housing that exists that is designed for renters, not buyers. Around a third of the population currently rents their accommodation, yet of purpose-built rental buildings in all of Mexico City there are five or so operating now that come to mind. In Chicago, I can see that many on one street. We are not creating a new market as demand for rental housing already exists. The issue is that housing is designed for people who purchase, and not for people who rent. We believe there is a huge opportunity to close these gaps between supply and demand. </p><p><strong>YURI ZAGORIN </strong>We are looking at unprecedented circumstances that the market has never seen before. I had a meeting with the chamber of commerce, and other developers feel that there is no communication with the government agencies, which have become tremendously bureaucratic. Developers in Mexico have a terrible reputation, due to property monopolies and some call us a 'real estate cartel.' In addition, we are perceived as a sector with a high level of corruption. We are damaged as well by disloyal practices. We also work with a not-for-profit called Mejor Ciudad that is dedicated to building a better city. It sponsored a report from Mexicanos Contra la Corrupción, Mexicans concerning corruption in real estate. There is a distinction between extortion and corruption.</p><h4>What kind of advantages does your firm offer in Mexican real estate?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JF</strong> Our current developments target young professionals, roommates, executives, companies, and dual-income-no-kids couples (DINKs) or couples with a small child. We target A and B socioeconomic groups given the average rents in our projects, since to qualify you need to meet certain income and credit requirements. However, the fact that we build smaller units means that people who could not afford to rent a three-bedroom apartment in a new, amenitized building, may be able to live with us at a lower price point if they live in our studio apartment. We want to have product that meets people's needs through their lifecycles so they can grow with Greystar. They can start in our studio when they move out of their parents' house, graduate to our one bedroom with their first promotion, then into our two bedroom when they become a dual-income-no-kids couple. We also believe there is a huge opportunity in all income segments to create a better rental experience for everyone and while Greystar made the decision to start with that type of product, over time we will likely diversify to various target markets and types of buildings. </p><p><span></span><strong>YZ</strong> I am an architect. I went to school to the US. In the US, I came to understand the importance of real estate development in the shaping of architectural culture. I have always been attracted by both. I have been trying to cover this gap, not because it is what I do but there is a lot to gain from understanding both practices. Our firm is very selective and deals only with a small number of clients. I am not a traditional developer as we do everything in-house. We put the business together, the design and take care of the permits. We do the construction ourselves and do not hire external teams (except for very specialized teams). We do the work ourselves. We also operate some of the buildings. In a way, we are boutique, and we are changing our operating models for longer-term projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How is your company contributing to clean energy in Colombia? <br></strong><strong>WALFREDO LINHARES</strong> We produce ethanol that is used as a fuel and additive for gasoline. This same ethanol can be used in solvents and paintings. With minor investments, the plant can also produce ethanol for liquors. The ethanol has different grades, such as fuel grade, industrial grade, and potable beverage grade. We also use bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane, as a fuel for biomass boilers, which produce steam. Today, we have 43MW in capacity, enough to supply the entire city of Puerto Lopez and its vicinity. In terms of expansion, we have the benefit to be in the backyard of agricultural areas. We do not have any constraints in terms of land availability or water availability to grow our production. Today, the company has the capacity to grow up to 30% with minor investments. </p><p><strong>YULIETH PORRAS OSORIO</strong> In the Colombian market, there are two types of users; the regulated users, which are the residential and commercial users with low consumption, and the non-regulated ones, which are those that have  high energy consumption, usually industries and large stores. The non-regulated users compete freely in the market to choose their supplier.The regulated users of Pereira municipality are served by other energy marketers and not by the company. At present, we cover 80 of more than 93 unregulated users in the city, and another 30 outside the city; we have also started looking for users in other regions of the country. In the future, the business will be less about supplying and selling energy and more about selling energy solutions, such as solar photovoltaic systems. This way we will also be able to inject energy into the grid. One of the best ways to measure the growth of a country is through the happiness level of its citizens. With this idea in mind, we invented what we call the balance of business organization and energy, which is the summary of our strategic plan where the first indicator that is measured is the index of customer satisfaction. The other is the level of satisfaction of our employees. Moving forward, we have to get involved in regulatory issues, working with the municipal administration and the national government. We want to go beyond economic targets and make sure that our users are happy and that Pereira is a technologically advanced, and sustainable city.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for the future?<br></strong><strong>WL</strong> Technological innovation is intense in the agriculture sector. You can innovate on the sugarcane, for instance. That requires a lot of investment, but you can grow sugarcane that is suited to hot summers, wet winters, and the soil and the diseases you can have in the region. Innovation also comes from harvesting technology. Our planting and harvesting processes are 100% mechanized. We are the only company in Colombia that has mechanized 100% of its operation. We do not use manual labor to plant and harvest. It is the use of technology that is a breakthrough in the country. We can use GPS to drive the equipment, so we know exactly where each sugarcane is planted. We see the use of AI in the future, and we can already collect data from the fields as well. I see the future of this business being driven more and more by technology and innovation. </p><p><strong>YPO </strong>We have been invited to different forums through the associations, both local and national, we have been linked with over the past four years. We are also selling the idea to all the different industries in Pereira, showing our projects and environment-friendly vehicles. Building a solar farm in Colombia four years ago was not financially viable but new regulations have made it possible. For example, tax benefits have reduced a solar farm's cost per kilowatt to between COP180-190 (USD0.056-0.06), meaning solar energy can compete with hydroelectric energy. Undoubtedly, the future lies in the generation of alternative energies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Pereira has seen 8% YoY growth in the number of new business created. How have these figures been achieved?<br></strong><strong>JUAN PABLO GALLO</strong> In 2018, Pereira was one of the two cities in Colombia with the lowest unemployment rates. Pereira also has the lowest level of extreme poverty in terms of Colombia cities and the highest position on the GINI index. We are the most egalitarian city in Colombia, which we are extremely pleased with. There is no a single factor behind our success. Our citizens believe in us and make their tax payments in a timely fashion. That has been an important factor, giving us more resources to increase public spending. </p><p><strong>JORGE IVÁN RAMÍREZ</strong> We work hard to move companies out of the informal sector. We have an alliance with the mayor of Pereira, and in 2018 we visited 20,000 businesses to ensure they are registered and are in compliance with all the regulations. In 2010, around 19% of companies in the city were informal, and as of early 2019 it is 7%. Those are extremely low figures compared to other cities. Additionally, we have a strong entrepreneurship program. </p><p><strong>How does the city work with the private sector to foster growth?<br></strong><strong>JPG</strong> We have been able to do that due to the high levels of confidence we have been able to inspire. We are building public works, though at extremely high transparency levels. In 2018, Fundacion Corona ranked Colombia as the most transparent city in terms of perception. The Antioquia office of the Colombian Chamber of Infrastructure named Pereira the best city in terms of contractual practices. </p><p><strong>The success rate of companies in Pereira is extremely high. What factors contribute to that?<br></strong><strong>JIR</strong> Today, Pereira is the easiest city in Colombia to start a business in. A key factor is that in Pereira, it is easy to reach out to public sector high-ranking officials, which is beneficial to business leaders. Second, Pereira has the most universities in the coffee region. We have grown significantly in terms of educating the people from Risaralda to produce a highly skilled labor force.</p><p><strong>JPG</strong> We are in the process of developing new infrastructure in order to be more competitive in the tourism area. We have excellent highways and are well linked to cities like Armenia and Manizales. We are also building a new terminal at the airport, as well as extending the runway and updating the control tower. The airport has direct flights to Miami, New York, and Panama. More than 75% of the visitors to the region pass through our airport. We are one of the best places for bird watching in the entire planet, which, in addition to our unique coffee growing landscape, makes Pereira one of the most important areas for the Colombian tourism industry.</p><p><strong>How does the chamber work with other sectors to promote the city?<br></strong><strong>JIR</strong> It has been a constant learning process. Crises allow cities to reinvent themselves. Pereira had a crisis after an earthquake hit the coffee region, and we went through a second recession in 2008. The turning point was 2009, when the government realized it was time to diversify from coffee. Pereira realized it could be a logistics hub not just within Colombia, but also for overseas exports. That was when Invest in Pereira was born as a private-public agency that promotes the city worldwide. </p><p><strong>What impact will your projects in 2019 have on the lives of the people of Pereira?<br></strong><strong>JPG </strong>Because our projects will have an impact on public spending, they will positively affect employment. The cable car project, meanwhile, will allow people living in the outskirts to benefit from the advantages in the city center. This will allow people from Pereira to commute faster and spend less money traveling around the city.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of fostering a culture of entrepreneurship, and how can fairs like yours help?<br></strong><strong>JIR</strong> The fair is 15 years old, and we have undergone a learning process that is reflected in the low levels of unemployment in the city today, for example. Pereira has the second-lowest unemployment rate in Colombia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities do you see in the Mexican market? </h4><p><span></span><strong>NARCÍS DE CARRERAS </strong>Today, we have almost two million customers, and there is great potential because of the low penetration of natural gas in homes and businesses here, below 10%. At this moment, we have more than 2GW of power in combined cycles, gas, and with a key client, the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). There is also a third-party access (TPA) scheme that works extremely well to generate competitive and efficient electricity for CFE. Additionally, we have a wind farm of 234MW in Oaxaca that we developed independently for private sales. Mexico is one of the most important growth countries and represents 12% of the group's global operations. When it comes to forecasting the market, it should be said that industrial and gas generation demand is growing steadily in Mexico every year. In addition, the areas where we distribute gas have GDP growth above the country average, including Monterrey, Nuevo León, Saltillo, and Bají­o. In these areas, annual GDP growth is 6-8%. The energy demand corresponds to the growth of GDP, and we foresee a sustained growth in gas and electricity demand. Indeed, electricity demand here is growing by 4.4% YoY, a rate that few other countries can match. </p><p><span></span><strong>CAIO ZAPATA</strong> Gas is much cheaper in Mexico, especially since we can offer it at a 30-40% lower cost than other fuels. For most companies, fuel can represent 40% of their total operating costs, which means a 30-40% price reduction can turn a losing company into a profitable one. Most of our work has been substituting other fuels and making it easy to calculate the savings they are getting. The biggest issue is that Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) is a concept not many people have heard of, but we are working to position what LNG is, how it works, and its benefits. Most of our work has been in educating customers, since there are certain safety measures they also need to know about. As a whole, the biggest opportunity we have seen in Mexico is the lack of infrastructure, which has a limited natural gas pipeline distribution network. For example, Texas has more than double the pipeline length of Mexico. Our business is to deliver natural gas where there are no pipelines, and right now, some cities and remote areas in Mexico either do not have access to natural gas or supply is insufficient. </p><h4>What strategies are you using to grow your network in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>NC</strong> The gas business is extremely different from electricity, which electrifies cities with a 100% coverage objective. In gas distribution, there are areas without sustainable profitability for network development. As such, we are growing in the cities where we already have operations, particularly in Mexico City, where the penetration of natural gas to homes and businesses is below 20%. We want to open new ways of consuming natural gas such as natural gas for cars, which is extremely competitive in terms of pricing in this country. In other cities, as long as it is profitable to pull the industrial, commercial, or domestic network, we will do it. The south is interesting, and we began betting on it even before the new government. We have already requested permits for gas distribution in different states of the south. The problem is that at the moment, there is not much gas, and until an infrastructure of gas pipelines for American gas is built, the south will have a shortage of gas—especially since consumption there is dedicated to the generation of electricity. </p><p><span></span><strong>CZ</strong> We would like to have more of a presence in the industrial sector and expand into the pipeline and infrastructure sectors. We have also been working with multinational companies, which often care more about environmental regulations than local ones. Natural gas is better for the environment than any other hydrocarbon. Internationally, on the other hand, we are trying to deepen our US presence and cover the same sectors we cover in Mexico. In Mexico, there are several states that we do not serve, and our intention is to reach them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your initial goals for the institute?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ADRIEN CAUDRON</strong> Our ultimate goal is to become a major player in the energy industry in Mexico. We are a new offering here and are looking to reach out and increase our exposure. This is why we are present in major industry tradeshows such as CMP. ITPE is a fresh and innovative company, and we are one of the few institutes in Mexico with such an offering: university, training, R&amp;D, and consulting. ITPE was born as a university four years ago, after which we added a division for professional training and a center for research and investigation. Our group also owns a service company called Rise Energy. Our main customers and partners are national institutions such as PEMEX, IMP, UNAM, IPN, ASEA, and the National Hydrocarbon Commission. We are also increasing our footprint with local and international companies present in Mexico. </p><h4>What are ITPE's current strategies for growing its international presence?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AC</strong> Our first focus is Mexico and providing education, research, and professional training to create innovative and highly skilled energy professionals here. We also have strong international alliances, such as the ones with Texas A&amp;M University, Aberdeen University, and the French Institute of Petroleum, each of whom we are working with on joint education programs. We are also working on exchange programs with other countries in Latin America, such as Colombia. We cannot be everywhere at once, but we are definitely already thinking where we want to be over the next five years, and our main focus is to develop the innovation and best practices in Mexico in other countries. We want to provide technology and methodology transfers, which we are doing through ITPE and Rise Energy.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the creation of ITPE's Rise Energy, and where do you hope to see this component of the institute in five years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>José Ramón Silv</strong><strong>a</strong> Arizabalo Rise is a young company, but we are focused on disruptive technologies. We are revolutionizing the software being used in Mexico, particularly related to geoscience. What we are doing is distinct from other companies here. We will cater to the new players entering the market as a result. In the big picture, Rise is one of the four main pillars of ITPE. The medium-long term vision for Rise is to make the company the geoscience leader in Mexico and Latin America. We are researching and developing new technologies, including some projects with PEMEX. This has been a total success thus far. We only have a few more steps before taking it fully into the market. Our plan is to introduce our technologies to increase productivity and focus on new companies in the market.</p><p><span></span><strong>AC</strong> We have a synergy between Rise Energy and the other offerings of the institute. For example, some students at ITPE are helping on consulting projects, while we have professors from the academic side that will be part of the research and development of the company. It is a fresh and different approach to education and solving problems in the sector.</p><h4>2019 will be five years since the energy reforms were passed. What is your assessment of their implementation and success?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AC </strong>We have only seen the beginning of the energy reform, which in the long-term will be very positive for Mexico. There was some bad timing with the oil downturn, but it was completely necessary to open up the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates you from other companies that offer similar services? </h4><p><span></span><strong>OSCAR SCOLARI </strong>We are a company that started offering engineering solutions several years ago and eventually shifted to the representation of products and services. We service not only the oil and gas industry but the energy industry as well and have been a player in the oil and gas industry for over 40 years. These past five years have been a challenge, however; as the market started to change, the players also started to change, and the market became more sophisticated, pushing us to constantly expand the services we offer. A number of our clients wanted us to not only do the engineering but also integrate, install, and start their operations. For this reason, we also manufacture capital goods and products, and can handle the installation and fabrication of site construction. When it comes to downstream projects, we are active in petrochemical refineries, including its maintenance and the distribution of products. We are also proud of having been part of the first "Made in Mexico" pipeline for LPG that starts in Poza Rica and goes all the way to Tula. It is a private investment that was designed and built by Mexican companies, and Rengen Energy Solutions was part of the consortium that built the pipeline. </p><p><strong>JAMES BUIS</strong> We have a unique way of doing business because we have many clients around the world. We have already dealt with a number of companies that are now entering Mexico. It is all about getting to know the customer and his or her problems, interests, and goals. We are going to ensure that we match the right people and teams with the right projects, because our end goal is to help clients achieve their goals. Our main role in the industry comes after production, when chemicals are needed. We are trying to get them to focus on efficiency and evaluating potential issues. Notably, Nalco Champion emphasizes prediction and prevention, helping its clients predict incoming issues before they occur. We specialize in ensuring that production advances smoothly without any interruption. Equally important, Nalco Champions can predict potential savings in terms of CAPEX and can even suggest equipment and sampling points to monitor certain issues. It may seem easy and simple, but we have a team of engineers dedicated to these projects.</p><h4>Are you pursuing new strategies under the current administration? </h4><p><span></span><strong>OS</strong> Mexico is a country with the ninth largest oil reserves in the world, but we are becoming more and more dependent on foreign products and oil; this must change. I see the future of the oil industry, specifically downstream and refining, as having a huge increase in investment in the six existing refineries. These are lacking resources not for their modernization or capacity expansion, but also their maintenance. It is necessary to have backup capital. Mexico has the capacity to refine 1.4 million bpd, but only 40% of that is being used at present. The infrastructure is not only outdated but has not been maintained, so there is an urgent need to focus on maintenance. The president said Mexico will construct a new refinery. And indeed, we are more than ready, through associations and agreements with international companies and the experience of Mexican companies, to fully participate in new projects. When it comes to the production of gas, the Director General of PEMEX has stated that a major exploration effort is underway. Gas production in Mexico has steadily gone down because it was previously associated with oil production. However, there are many efforts to increase dry gas production at present, and gas fields in the north along the state of Tabasco and Campeche are extremely active. There is a lot of optimism in terms of finding new fields that can produce the natural gas the country needs in order to sustain the growth we are now experiencing. </p><p><span></span><strong>JB</strong> A number of people were afraid of AMLO coming in, but while the new administration is different than the previous one and proposing some challenging ideas, I see it as more of a challenge and opportunity. They have a chance to fulfill the potential of the reform and make it productive for all players. The landscape is going to change, and Mexico is going to face projects with more challenging technical production; indeed, PEMEX has been able to do this singlehandedly for many years. Mexico is so abundant in resources that a single company or entity cannot invest fast enough. Therefore, the opening of the market is an opportunity for PEMEX to specialize on its strengths instead of getting involved in every project. The old strategy was costing PEMEX billions, but now it can let other companies do certain tasks. This will allow Mexican talent to develop at its full potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main projects you have developed in Mexico? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JUAN IGNACIO DÍAZ</strong> Siemens has been present in Mexico for 125 years and has built remarkable projects that contributed to the development of the country. Some of the most iconic ones were the installation of the entire electric lighting system in Mexico City in 1897, the country's then-largest hydroelectric plant on the Necaxa River in 1903, and the electrification and expansion of the railway line connecting the city of Pachuca with silver mines in 1914. More recent projects developed by Siemens include a contract for the extension of Metro Line 2 in Monterrey in 2005, two contracts for the turnkey construction of the combined cycle power plants La Caridad I and II in Sonora State in 2011, the automation and electrical infrastructure solutions for one of the world's five biggest mines, and the inauguration of the "Ingenuity Lab," a PLM Training Center at the Technological University of Queretaro, which was equipped with Industry 4.0 in 2017. </p><p><span></span><strong>ANUAR BARAKE</strong> Mexico is essential for Emerson for several reasons. First, the company has been here for more than 60 years, and everything we do in Mexico is with a long-term perspective. Mexico is an important manufacturing hub for the company; we have 19 factories where we manufacture all our technologies and have over 13,000 employees. Second, Mexico is one of our top 10 countries from a sales perspective. We can successfully meet the needs of the market, not only in Mexico City but throughout the country. We have local infrastructure and capabilities to serve the different industrial clusters throughout the country. Emerson has seven offices and three service centers, and we strive to provide excellent coverage for our customers to ensure we become their trusted advisor. Emerson had five business platforms, though our CEO and executive team decided to redefine and focus Emerson's portfolio into two core areas: automation solutions and commercial and residential solutions automation. In terms of automation solutions, we have a strong platform with an expanded offering. Two examples of the recent acquisition are Pentair and Paradigm; Paradigm provides software for the characterization of oil fields, namely analyzing fields from a geophysical point of view. Pentair Valves &amp; Control established Emerson presence globally in control, isolation, pressure relief valves, and actuation.</p><h4>What can you tell us about how Mexico's regulatory environment has affected your operations?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JID </strong>The actual government has some visible priorities, compliance and fighting corruption being the top on their list. We are actively contributing in its field, making sure that clean business is our business and that this is only true for the entire value chain, from providers to customers, including best practice sharing with other companies through collective actions. The positive effect of these measures can make the country more open, competitive, fair, and equal to all. Other opportunities in which we can really make an impact are in digitalization. Mexico is very industrialized, and we can help most industries in their transition to becoming digitalized. We have the technology and right people to help our customers become more productive, faster, and more flexible in their go-to-market efforts. The same is true for electrification; we can provide clean and stable energy solutions from generation to consumption</p><p><span></span><strong>AB</strong> As a result of Mexico's energy reforms, we have seen a wave of investment in terminals and production platforms by international oil companies that has resulted in an expansion of our addressable market. With the new government's efforts to strengthen Pemex and CFE, we see that wave continuing to grow. In downstream, the government wants to reduce imports, and we will see not only the construction of the new refinery, but also investment due to the overhaul of the six refineries. That is Emerson's sweet spot because it has expertise not just in Mexico, but globally. We have the products, technology, and know-how. Our main mission is to help our customers reach the top quartile, namely operating in the top 25 percentile. This terminology is typically used in refining, upstream, and mining because in these industries, you want to operate at efficiency rates of 90-95% to achieve the required returns on investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been your sales strategy of late? </h4><p><strong>MICHEL KAIM</strong> The company has had to adapt its strategy to the needs of the market, as some products that see great demand in other countries do not do as well in Mexico. Hyundai in Mexico not only offers products, but also a whole portfolio of solutions for our customers. We have services such as Hyundai Finance, which offers credit to customers who need it, and more traditional credit services. With Hyundai Protect, we also encompass insurance services, which include protection against getting fired, for example. Through these solutions, our customers can be assured that their cars will be taken care of. We are present in almost every country in the world and have been investing in Mexico for a long time; however, the motor group did not enter Mexico until a few years ago. We were able to enter the country as a result of a treaty between Mexico and South Korea. While it has not been signed yet, it will be finalized in the coming years. The company has grown 10% in demand in Mexico from 2017, and our results are 18% above industry standards.</p><p><strong>MAYRA GONZÁLEZ</strong> In recent months, the industry has registered an adjustment in volume. However, Nissan has continued to maintain its leadership of the Mexican auto industry for almost 10 consecutive years, overcoming the challenges that the industry, economy, and market present. We ended the fiscal year of 2018 with five core models, namely the Versa, Sentra, March, Kicks, and NP300, all number one in their respective segments. We have models like NP300 and March that are absolute leaders, with over 40% and 60% of market share. As a brand, we will continue to focus our efforts on offering a strong product line up and attractive financing plans, ever conscious of total customer satisfaction. For 2019, we will see a significant renewal of our portfolio with strategic launches like the new 2019 Nissan Altima, now completely redesigned with more aggressive and sporty styling, not to mention the new generation Nissan Versa, the best-selling vehicle in Mexico. These upcoming launches are critical for our product strategy. The goal of Nissan Mexico is to maintain our business objectives through an optimum dealership network, as well as a significant manufacturing operation, a revamped aftersales experience, and the support of the leading financial arm in the country.</p><h4>How does the Mexican market differ from elsewhere? </h4><p><span></span><strong>MK </strong>The Mexican preference for cars is different than those of Americans and Japanese, among others. Our brand offers a wide portfolio of products, and we choose to distribute cars that have a better fit in Mexico. Segments A and B make up almost 50% of our sales. In Segment A, the i10 represents 20% of sales in this market. The car has been in the country for a while, as it used to be distributed by another company such as Atos for almost 10 years. We now sell it under Hyundai with our own warranty that is the longest bumper-to-bumper in the industry. We also have a hatchback and a sedan in Segment B, the largest segment in the industry. We cover almost 30% of the Mexican market and launched the Accent hatchback and sedan in 2016. It is our best-selling vehicle and the best product one can purchase in this segment. In the future, we will focus more on our SUV products and have already started to promote Creta. Mexicans can also customize their cars in five different ways, from basic to highly equipped cars with air conditioning and Bluetooth. We are keen to increase our presence in hybrid cars as well as SUVs and foresee alternative fuels taking over the market in the future, though for now demand for hybrid cars is likely to increase.</p><p><strong>MG</strong> Nissan knows that electric vehicle technology will continue to grow over the coming years, and Mexico is no exception. The Mexican electric vehicle market and recharging infrastructure continue to grow, which represents an essential opportunity for Nissan. To position a more significant number of electric vehicles, in addition to having a society more committed to the environment and sustainable mobility, incentives are determinants, including an adequate recharging infrastructure and a more favorable regulatory framework. In this sense, Nissan Mexico continues to work closely with government institutions and the private sector to continue strengthening the infrastructure. Customers in Mexico and the world over are also increasingly looking for sustainable mobility options. There is no doubt that there is still much to be done, both by institutions and companies, and Nissan is on track to do so. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you decide to enter the Mexican energy market?</h4><p><strong>ENRIQUE RIQUELME</strong> We entered Mexico between 2013 and 2014 because of the energy reform, when Cox Energy saw that the country was heading in the right direction in terms of regulation. In Mexico, solar radiation is incredible and adequate for long-term operations. Importantly, the tenders were and are in dollars, which helped concretize the viability of our project along with the natural resources of the country that keep the cost of our operations down. The company already has projects in several places, but the main ones are in Zacatecas, Sonora, Hermosillo, Veracruz, State of Mexico, and Campeche. In Mexico, we have a power purchase agreement (PPA) with CFE and other private groups. At present, we are building several projects; the 2.5GW we can install in Mexico will take approximately four years. We studied the Central American market for additional opportunities, but we found that it needed to mature. However, Chile has proven to be an interesting market as well with a stable regulatory framework. </p><p><strong>ANGÉLICA SOTO REAZA </strong>This decision was mainly due to the country's resources and the opportunities it offers. Mexico has high levels of industrial activity and a privileged geographic position; its industrial and economic levels also bring an important growth projection where we see a great deal to exploit. On the other hand, the transmission network has more to improve. Other motivating factors are Mexico's economic growth and the energy reform, which was well conducted, even with the government transition. In addition, we see a great opportunity in terms of the end user in terms of energy delivery, reliability, and prices. In general terms, the energy reform ensures that users have better energy and prices, but require competition, and there is nothing better than a competitive market.</p><h4>What are your star projects in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ER </strong>One is a small project in Sonora. This location has an abundance of solar resources and was the first project I bought in Mexico without a PPA. There is another project in the State of Mexico that has less radiation but is still attractive as it has the potential to expand. We are also building a project of 118MW in Veracruz and are going to start construction on different medium-sized projects in Sonora and Campeche. The energy and business model in Mexico includes public tenders mainly from CFE and tenders with private companies with a proven long-term focus. We are in the entire value chain here; we develop the parks and invest. Although we do not build, we subcontract that part and operate the plants throughout their life period. Apart from the large-scale generation, we have another business niche for Mexico: we carry the representation of our plants and those of others in the market. Another of our segments is distributed generation with net metering with large industries. Similarly, the company is in the niche market of electricity generation that has nothing to do with public or private PPAs, but with the sale of energy in the SPOT market. We will develop small- and medium-sized projects to generate spot market energy. </p><h4>What sets Mexico apart as a market? </h4><p><span></span><strong>ASR</strong> There are two significant differences between Mexico and Spain. In the latter, there is only one network, which means a unique price and a single node, which makes it easier and liquid. The price connection between Portugal and Spain makes markets more liquid, competitive, robust, and reliable. In Germany, on the other hand, there is a market coupling to an integrated European electricity market, which is expected to increase liquidity, efficiency, and social welfare. A significant challenge for all the companies that come here is adapting to the electrical market where there are different nodes. It is a system similar to the US one, which results in complexities; however, we can apply our experience from European markets to Mexico once there is greater maturity in the regulations, participants, users, and so on. For the market to flow, grow, and work as it should, there must be a great deal of participation and incentives for all market participants to do things right. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities have you identified in the Mexican market? </h4><p><span></span><strong>ENRIQUE ALBA</strong> Iberdrola has a presence in five countries: Spain, Portugal, the UK, the US, Mexico, and Brazil, though we are also in other countries, albeit with a smaller presence. Our business is divided into three segments worldwide: the network business, which includes everything related to transmission and distribution; the renewable business, a development activity; and construction and the operation of renewable assets, whose generation and commercialization aspects must not be forgotten. In Mexico, we are investing large amounts of capital; for example, our most recent combined cycle here will exceed 60% efficiency. We have two plants on the same site. One came into operation in December 2018, while another sister station will go into operation in August 2019. Currently, the business of generation and commercialization is large. We have a renewable business that is significantly growing. Therefore, our commitment to Mexico is in generation. We are focusing our investments on this, in gas, wind, and photovoltaic. Of the five major countries in which we have a presence, Mexico produced the most energy in 2018, given our investments here.  </p><p><span></span><strong>TANIA ORTIZ</strong> IEnova is an energy infrastructure company that has been in Mexico for over 20 years. What we have accomplished throughout this time is to identifying opportunities to develop infrastructure to supply more efficient energy to Mexico's industries and homes. We have moved from one business segment to another within the energy sector as the opportunities have opened up. We started out in the gas distribution business before moving to the natural gas pipeline business, power generation, both conventional and renewable, and now refined products infrastructure. Over the past few years, we were active in a comprehensive effort to develop Mexico's natural gas infrastructure to provide access to cheap and abundant North American gas production to mainly supply CFE's gas fired generation, but also to provide affordable and efficient fuel to thousands of industries. Additionally, renewable energy has become not only attractive from an environmental standpoint, but also from a cost standpoint. IEnova is active on the renewable front, particularly in providing power to CFE and industrial or large commercial off-takers that want to take advantage of this new opportunity. We are also active in the refined products infrastructure space. This is because Mexico requires infrastructure to guarantee sufficient supplies of these products. The country needs to increase its minimum inventories of refined products in order to guarantee its energy security. </p><h4>What major projects are you working on?</h4><p><strong>EA</strong> In 2019, we expect to produce 60TWh, which is approximately 20% of the country's demand. Of those 60TWh, we sell about 15TWh to industrial customers and the other 45TWh to the Federal Electricity Commission. Within the segment of industrial customers, we are diversified. We have customers such as Pepsico, Nestlé, Bonafont, and Danone. Within the telecommunications sector, we have Telmex. We also have Inbursa, a bank. Within the automotive sector we have Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Toyota, and Honda, and within the steel sector, we have Ternium, Alfa, and Vitro. There are many companies that have contacted us for their energy needs. Other big clients include Kimberly Clark Mexico and Kuo, and we just signed a contract with Elementia. We can say that the big multinational and Mexican companies are betting on Iberdrola because we are the only company that can provide customized solutions for them.</p><p><span></span><strong>TO</strong> Our Costa Azul project is still under development. This is an LNG import and regasification facility that began operations in 2008. At the time, Mexico and North America needed to import natural gas from other regions. But with the shale revolution, North America became a net exporter of natural gas. We are developing a project which will allow us to supply LNG to isolated markets in Mexico that do not have access to natural gas via pipelines, such as Baja California Sur, as well as other important international markets. We have been working on this project for over three years now. First, we closely reviewed the existing regulations in Mexico and the US to make sure the project was viable, since we will be bringing gas from the US to Baja California to be liquefied and taken to market. Then, we worked on permitting the facility and evaluating the project's technical and commercial viability. So far we have executed preliminary commercial agreements with three important customers—Total, Mitsui, and Tokyo Gas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities in the market drove you to start the company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ÁNGEL SAHAGíšN</strong> We created albo because we wanted to change the way people handled their finances. One in two people in Mexico is not satisfied with their current bank. Dealing with finances can be expensive, inefficient, or overwhelming. We saw an opportunity to improve the way people manage their money. Through technology, we can improve everyone's financial lives. Every day, we open thousands of accounts because albo replaces one's traditional bank account. We offer a debit Mastercard that can receive salaries and transfers. The account can be opened online in three minutes. We want to launch new financial products in the future, like savings, credit, and personal loans. We started two years ago and are on new products as we speak. Our goal is to change the way people do banking.</p><p><span></span><strong>RICARDO SUÁREZ</strong> We founded WEEX to be a digital services hub. Of the industries we inquired into, telecommunications was full of opportunities. Around three or four years ago, the Mexican market was 85% prepaid, and people were limited in terms of mobile access to data, which is why we decided to get into the industry. We decided to start the MDNO, a model that is about segmentation and very specific differentiated value proposition. We were close with our target, which is how we came to the value proposition we have today. If you have any of the traditional operators, they decide how that service is divided. Now we give them each a menu of options; therefore, each user can create their own bundles based on their lifestyle and disposable income. In terms of MDNOs, we are the most differentiated in the market with a specific value proposition. That value proposition has been disruptive in the market, and moving forward we are working on new offerings and the evolution of what we have right now.</p><h4>What differentiates you from other similar companies?</h4><p><strong>ÁS</strong> We want to create a product that gives everyone access to better rates and better credit without hidden fees. We want to make the process more transparent and efficient through mobile phones. We also focus on providing a great customer experience, which is why we have 24/7 customer support. There are more than 120 million people here, and only 40% of that has a bank account. albo has solved this need by allowing everyone to open an account for free from their mobiles. We have more than 60,000 customers per month using our product, and we are growing 20% month on month, so we are extremely excited. The market needs something like albo, where people can manage their money effortlessly without hidden fees.</p><p><strong>RS</strong> We have the wallet that has the most traction in the market because it is more complete, and we have debit and credit cards. We also have peer-to-peer payments. Customers can buy cinema tickets and many other things. We have one of the largest networks of venues where users can top up. At the moment, it is more complete, and we are working on more functionality features.</p><h4>What changes does the regulatory framework for fintech companies in Mexico need?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ÁS</strong> The government understands that one needs to invest in technology to create business models and financial products to access the millions of people that are currently satisfied by the current model. However, the bureaucracy is also painful in some aspects. Generally, the fintech laws are great news for everyone. It is great that the government is pushing initiatives such as CoDi, the digital payment platform. There will be many new competitors and foreign investors looking at the Mexican market. I am pleased and excited for the future of Mexico in the fintech sector.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for 2019?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RS</strong> For mobile we are working on a new offering, and the telecom space is being commoditized. If companies do not start looking to other services to differentiate their offerings, it will be tough. This launch will be differentiated for the market on the telecom side. On the financial side, we are looking at new features and functionalities that will be important for our users. We have a product road map we are working on, and in terms of fintech we have a high growth expectation and goals. In terms of mobile it will not be that high, but we will continue to grow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your success in Monterrey served as grounds to establish a presence in other major Mexican cities?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ERNESTO LÓPEZ CLARIOND</strong> Bancrea was born out of the internal concept of warm banking. This means that we look for our clients to feel unique. This has worked well in Monterrey because we have grown significantly in that state and become part of the community. Our rapid responses, credit instrumentation, and customer service helped us effectively penetrate the Monterrey market. Currently, Bancrea's assets are located in Monterrey, San Luis Potosí­, and León. Our growth has occurred because in Mexico there remains considerable growth potential in banking. We plan to open offices in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Querétaro, and Saltillo in 2019, while the strategic plan for 2023 also contemplates Chihuahua. In 2019, we received an A- rating from one of the three rating agencies, which is a great qualification for a five-year-old bank.</p><h4>Why did MUFG decide to be the first locally incorporated Asian bank in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JORGE DEL CASTILLO MUFG</strong> established a representative office in Mexico in 1958, one of the first international banks to do so. Known as Bank of Tokyo at that time, we joined with the Export-Import Bank of Japan to aid in the development of Japanese industry entering Mexico. Along with a handful of others, MUFG was among the first Asian banks to create a beachhead in Mexico. After the financial crisis in 2008, Japanese banks, including MUFG, emerged financially sound, with a large amount of liquidity. We were able to make a sizable investment in Morgan Stanley—USD9 billion in exchange for a 23% stake in the company that was then converted into common stock. Following that, MUFG continued to invest in the Americas, first in the US, then in Latin America. In 2011, Mexico received a capital injection of USD200 million from our home office in Tokyo, enabling us to expand our business.</p><h4>What segments are better positioned to grow your client portfolio?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ELC </strong>Our business call is the entrepreneur, and we focus on the services they need. While we do not offer credit cards to our clients, for example, we lease resources for them. Bancrea clients have access to other services such as tax payment and payment of services and social security. Bancrea's focus is on medium-to-large companies. Our clients are neither small SMEs nor huge corporations. Our sector is broad and has many projects. The success of our clients is our success, and our job is to help them achieve. Our assets currently stand at MXN13 billion, and the target for the 2023 horizon is to reach MXN30 billion.</p><h4>What differentiates you from other banks in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JDC</strong> Given that few other banks can match MUFG's worldwide reach, what differentiates us from other financial institutions is our global footprint and our client-centric culture. We are one of the three largest Asia-based banks and the biggest in Japan. This positions us perfectly to be the Asian bank of choice for corporate Mexico. Further, as the world's fifth-largest bank with total assets of USD2.7 trillion and a presence in more than 50 countries, MUFG's scale provides our clients with the ability to leverage opportunities from anywhere around the world.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ELC</strong> Bancrea will post extraordinary performance in 2019 and 2020, as there are many opportunities in the sector. The country needs investment, and investment cannot be made solely with capital. Additionally, Mexico has a new administration, and I agree with current plans to develop the southeast region and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Development can be achieved with the support of the government and entrepreneurs, with banks playing a key role in financing projects nationwide.</p><p><span></span><strong>JDC</strong> With exposure of around USD5 billion, Mexico represents MUFG's largest operation in Latin America, behind Brazil. A key part of our strategy is to be more efficient, productive, and profitable. Management is keen on supporting us, and there is room for us to keep growing here and win new customers. We pride ourselves on being a relationship bank—the customer always comes first. We continue to find ways to build our brand in Mexico as we seek to expand our market share. While some of our larger global banking peers are double our size here, we have the ability to compete effectively against any of them in this vibrant market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Consejo Nuevo León is an advisory council to the government of the state of Nuevo León. How does the council work to serve this purpose?</h4><p><strong>JESíšS VIEJO </strong>The Nuevo León Council's main purpose is to focus on the long-term development of the state. In accordance with the state's Strategic Planning Law, and the Strategic Plan itself, the council serves this purpose through three central responsibilities: designing and revising the plan, monitoring its implementation, and evaluating the progress towards its goals. In this context, as an advisory and consultative body comprised by leaders from the public, private, and academic sectors, the council has become a major platform for inter-institutional dialogue and collaboration. This has allowed the council to combine efforts and provide knowledge and expertise on key matters for Nuevo León's long-term development. Moreover, the council helps ensure strategic projects for the state are continued despite administration changes.</p><h4>What factors helped San Pedro Garza Garcí­a acquire such a significant economic weight despite being a relatively small municipality?</h4><p><strong>MIGUEL TREVIí‘O</strong> San Pedro is an extremely attractive municipality to live in. Its economic activity started in the 1990s, when directors and managers of the largest companies in the region decided to move to this area of Monterrey's metropolitan area. As they were moving, they started developing the business environment, which provided a different face to the municipality. Districts of a more corporate type and mixed-use developments were added. Today, the area of Valle Oriente is an energetic business hub where decisions that affect the state of Nuevo León and the whole of Mexico are taken. That district is also undergoing an expansion, with new green zones and mixed-used developments coming up in the coming years.</p><h4>How do you work to translate the economic performance of Nuevo León into social welfare?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JV</strong> Nuevo León has long been a national landmark in terms of economic development. In the first months of 2019, Nuevo León recorded an unemployment rate of 3.3 %, the lowest in 14 years, and a 14.5 % increase in FDI, which accounts for 12% of the country's FDI. Nevertheless, despite the state's economic success, much remains to be done in order to build a more equal society. In this regard, Nuevo León Council has mobilized projects that aim to reduce the socioeconomic disparity in the state. For instance, Hambre Cero Nuevo León, a shared effort among the state government, civil organizations and private sector, seeks to eradicate food poverty through food waste reduction and processing strategies. The council has also assisted Alianza Neo México, an initiative in which public and private organizations, as well as academic institutions, cooperate to foster youth employment in the state. Nuevo León Council must continue to place socioeconomic equality as an essential element in the state's long-term ambition.</p><h4>How have you worked to create a more livable place?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MT</strong> We are fully aware that our city will retain its attractiveness so long as we can ensure security conditions far above the Mexican average and comparable with international ones. In addition, we are working on other aspects that will have a positive impact on people's lives in the municipality. We are also taking steps such as keeping streets clean, enhancing green areas, and fighting pollution in order to make San Pedro Garza Garcí­a one of the best places to live in Mexico, if not the best. There are aspects that we control as the government of the city, such as taking excellent care of our green areas and monitoring pollution levels. However, there are factors that we cannot control, such as air pollution that originates outside the city. In this regard, we have been promoting policies that allow us to have better coordination and synergies with the state administration and other municipalities in order to tackle pollution more effectively. We are also working together to improve the transport system in the region as a means to reduce the number of polluting vehicles. We are also looking into the relocation of some industries further from metropolitan areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the reasons behind Nuevo León's success in attracting foreign investment?</h4><p><strong>DR. JAIME PARADA ÁVILA</strong> Monterrey, the capital of Nuevo León, has an important set of educational institutions. In total, there are about 200,000 students enrolled in higher education. Of this, 20,000 are graduate students. People come to Monterrey to invest and do business because we have a factory of human talent needed not only at the level of operators and technicians but also management. Notably, the city has more than 100 research centers that make up a platform with more than 5,000 scientists and technologists. Nuevo León invests more than 0.7% of its GDP, above the national average of 0.4%, on R&amp;D. 3,000 scientists and technicians are working at the Research and Technology Innovation Park. For the last 10 years, we have given ourselves the task of delivering strategic clusters in the main economic sectors. We have 13 clusters, including automotive, aeronautical, agricultural, IT and software, medical services, biotechnology, nanotechnology, tourism, and energy. There is collaboration between the government, the academy, and companies that facilitates the rapid implementation of public policies and has been key to the success of Nuevo León. The state has reached a high level of GDP per capita by investing in goods and services that require human talent and scientific-technological knowledge. To achieve future goals, we need to move toward a knowledge economy. This is the profound reason for the strategic importance of knowledge, research, and innovation.</p><p><strong>DR. MANUEL MONTOYA ORTEGA</strong> The Automotive Cluster of Nuevo León was established in 2007 by a group of 11 stakeholders including Vitro, Nemak, and Metalsa; international players such as Ternium and Navistar; and the government of Nuevo León. Academia also joined the cluster with the incorporation of universities such as the Tec de Monterrey and the State University of Nuevo León. Today, there are over 100 companies and institutions, from both Mexico and abroad. The automotive industry in Nuevo León has become increasingly important, and today 20% of the manufacturing GDP in Nuevo León is automotive. It creates almost 90,000 jobs, and over the past five years has increased in importance. We are extremely strong in material-providing tier-one companies, but we did not have much actual car manufacturing in the region. Kia Motors came in to fill that gap. Today, Kia is the fifth brand in Mexico, impressive given that before 2014 it had not sold a single car in Mexico. In Mexico, in general, the automotive industry consists of foreign firms. We only have one Mexican original equipment manufacturer (OEM), and 95% of the tier-ones comprise international companies. We only have a dozen Mexican tier-one companies, and most are based in Nuevo León. Of the 12 companies present in the country, eight are based here. Nuevo León is not a state of cheap labor, but rather, one of skilled technicians and engineers. We have excellent universities in Nuevo León that attract talent from all over the country. This is an opportunity that Nuevo León has managed to capture, and that companies are taking advantage of.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook regarding R&amp;D investment in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JPÁ </strong>We want investment in science, technology, and innovation to reach 1%. We also want to increase local manufacturing. At present, only 30-40% of Mexico's exports are produced locally. Also, the level of integration does not reach 5%. We must promote local integration. For example, under the new free trade agreement, the US has insisted on increasing the level of regional integration from 60% to 75% as well as salaries so that investments arrive not only for low-cost employment. Nuevo León is a different case because companies invest here because of the quality of local talent.</p><h4>To what extent can localization of the automotive industry be increased in Nuevo León? </h4><p><strong>MMO</strong> This is challenging, but the new agreement between Mexico, the US, and Canada may help us to increase our local content. Also, the NAFTA content will be higher in the case of OEMs. The tier ones have to accomplish NAFTA content, and their core parts must be 100% produced in North America, which forces those players, mainly Asian and European firms in Mexico, to find local content providers. NAFTA was greatly successful in helping us produce 4 million cars per year in Mexico. Nuevo León produces 9% of the country's output, but more importantly the light vehicles industry is a parts-based one, and in 2018 we generated USD85 billion in country with 10% derived from Nuevo León. The challenge is that Mexican content remains low, at just 15%. For Nuevo León, which is more integrated, and we are talking about 30%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your firm get to where it is today?</h4><p><strong>TAREQ ANSARI</strong> From its start in 2004, First has stood out as a very different kind of investment firm. First was founded on a simple idea—making a difference in the lives of each and every member of the community we reach by putting clients' needs and interest first. At First, we are guided by our culture and a set of principles that ensure we never forget what we stand for—to help more and more people invest in their financial well-being. First is registered and licensed by the Jordan Securities Commission to present financial services to clients, mainly in asset management and financial advisory.</p><p><strong>MOATAZ MARAQA</strong> ABC Investments is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank ABC Jordan and is a one-stop-shop brokerage firm. Through our company, clients can trade investment products across all markets, local, regional and international, a uniquely different proposition from many other companies in Jordan, who solely focus on the local market. Our services are also spread across all asset classes, giving our clients the privilege of trading in stocks, bonds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFS) and derivative products (futures and options). Being a one-stop-shop brokerage firm differentiates us from our competitors and offers our clients a fully-rounded service in one place.</p><h4>What makes your company stand out from others?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TA</strong> We help our partners achieve their investment goals and provide customized, objective advice. Our clients can depend on our investment management expertise to build a plan that helps them achieve and strengthen their financial security. We recognize the importance of our partners entrusting us with their investments. Our partnership is commitment to long-term relationship principles of perfection, follow-up, and patience and we insist on continuous provision of our advice and services in an honest, transparent, and professional manner. As for institutional clients, First has the know-how and funds needed to help institutions in IPO's. In 2018, we were one of the sub book runners for Jerash Holdings (JRSH), the first Jordanian company listed on Nasdaq, which paves the way for many other companies to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p><strong>MM</strong> Customer satisfaction is key. In fact, client centricity is a core value for our parent company, the Bank ABC Group. Offering services across all markets and asset classes is a prelude to satisfaction. An additional focal point is proper communication. We offer our clients multiple communication avenues, from our large customer service team that responds to queries and resolves issues, to our online trading and e-services platform, which gives our clients live and up-to-date access to their account details, trade transactions, and statements of account. On top of this, our communication with clients is proactive in that we constantly keep them abreast of all market developments, emerging trends, and changes in regulations, thereby constantly asserting that our interests reside in satisfying and meeting our clients' needs.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges for Jordan's economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TA</strong> Today, the Jordanian economy faces a set of difficult challenges resulting from successive crises as well as international and regional conditions. Jordan's security and stability are the highest in the region, which can be utilized to expand opportunities and improve investments. I see huge opportunities here with the attractive climate, high caliber of expertise, domestic political stability, and Jordan's relations with other nations. We are also open to investing in the GCC if the opportunity arises. We see the situation changing and expect it to improve. We already have the infrastructure as well as the recognition of being a safe haven.</p><p><strong>MM</strong> The level of uncertainty in Jordan is high and stems from the instabilities in surrounding countries, rendering it difficult to predict how things will move forward. For example, thousands of Jordanians work in the Gulf, and in 2016, their remittances reached around JOD2.6 billion, higher than foreign aid and FDI. Therefore, stability in the region is crucial to our economy. Fortunately, the opposite holds true, and recoveries generally happen suddenly. As such, we are well set to capitalize on these events, which would strengthen our economy and solidify our standing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the benefits of mobile payments, and how are these systems integrated into the financial ecosystem?</h4><p><strong>DR. MAHA BAHOU</strong> The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) owns 45% shares of JoPACC, and all banks operating in the Kingdom own the remaining 55%. This gives JoPACC a distinguished position in the market to develop and innovate digital retail and micro payments through different projects that support and ensure efficient and cost-effective implementation in alignment with all stakeholders' goals and lines of business. Currently, JoMoPay is managed and operated by the CBJ providing support during working hours. But JoMoPay is a 24/7 instant payment system, which requires round-the-clock support service. In order to provide the needed support, JoPACC is working to host JoMoPay on a cloud platform to be managed and operated by JoPACC's team, providing the market with a 24/7 service support using top-notch, high-performance technologies that provide high availability with close to zero downtime.</p><p><strong>AMJAD AL SADEQ</strong> Network International Jordan (formerly Emerging Markets Payments) was established by five banks in 1991 with a small amount of paid-up capital. In 1999, the company began trying to take the country to the next level of electronic payments. Visa International also showed interest in the company and became a shareholder.  The company started to really push electronic payments and began transforming the banks' white cards into branded cards. The journey continued, and between 1999 and 2011 the company grew in terms of its service offerings to the financial service providers and retailers in the country. As a result, we gained the attention of a private equity company in the UK called Actis, which had a fund of nearly USD7 billion and was instrumental in beginning the creation of the Emerging Markets Payment (EMP) Group. The journey of EMP Group continued until March 2016, when Network International acquired it. After the acquisition, Network International became the largest payment processor in Africa and the Middle East, with more than 220 financial institutions and over 65,000 merchant retailers being served by the group. The value of Network International and what it has delivered to the former EMP Group after the acquisition is huge. Together, we have established a vision for bringing electronic payments to Africa and the Middle East. </p><h4>How can mobile payment firms and the central bank better serve customers in a digital financial services (DFS) ecosystem?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MB</strong> Globally, DFS are developed to ease people's lives through providing wide distribution channels, use cases, and interoperability. DFS in Jordan specifically have different gaps that are currently being addressed by all market players. These gaps start with the agents' network and its associated high costs; moreover, the merchants' acceptance and interoperability remain barriers to increasing the usage and adoption. JoPACC has initiated a unified agent interface (UAI) for all PSPs to move toward white label agents, in addition to working and following up with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor's initiative to implement rules for JoMoPay to enable an interoperable schema between all providers. Additionally, lack of trust remains an issue wherein people still believe that cash should be the dominant tool within their financial transactions. Thus, creating intensive awareness campaigns and financial literacy sessions together with all of market players is an important matter, as this issue affects all providers with the same intensity and severity. Creating use cases, including but not limited to merchant payments, bill payments, loan disbursement, and installment, need to be seriously addressed by all providers. </p><p><strong>AS</strong> Network International is highly supportive in terms of hosting, managing, and developing channels to enable the necessary payment services. We are supporting the CBJ-backed electronic payment platform in an attempt to maximize the number of transactions. We have, for example, enabled connectivity for practically every bank in Jordan so they can transact on the platform. The main operators of the platform try to utilize kiosk outlets to help individuals develop a familiarity with digital payment platforms because cash is still the most popular payment form in the country. We have also started offering services through the point-of-sale (POS) terminals at our merchant locations. We have equipped large retailers with the necessary POS systems to support the platform and make it easier for clients and citizens. Furthermore, we have started to work with various consumer markets as well, because many people visit these outlets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your position in the market?</h4><p><strong>MUSA SHIHADEH</strong> When we started our business in 1979, we were the first Islamic bank in Jordan; others did not enter the market until several years later. We were the sole Islamic player in the banking sector, and we had our own law. In 2000, a law for the banking sector was issued as a whole, including a chapter for Islamic banking, and the law for JIB was cancelled. As the pioneer of Islamic banking, we handle 55% of Islamic transactions in the country. In terms of the entire banking sector, including Islamic and conventional, we are third in terms of deposits and investments, with only Housing Bank and Arab Bank ahead of us. Our compliance with sharia does not restrict our services to only Muslims; it is Islamic banking, yet we apply it as ethical business and service everyone who accepts our work. We service our customers through our branches, ATMs, and internet and telephone banking, with around 1 million accounts in the country and 95% Jordanian customers. Our business is focused on retail with small businessmen and individuals. Through this retail business, we finance almost 170,000 customers, ensuring that our customers are front and center. Their needs are changing, especially in terms of technology and digital services. </p><p><strong>IYAD ASALI </strong>We continued with our growth in terms of all the items on our balance sheet, which has been the case for five years. It has been a challenging year as we continue to experience the impact of the influx of refugees. Nevertheless, this did not hinder us from continuing to grow. We focused on sectors that could add value to the economy, such as SMEs and clean energy, in collaboration with the Central Bank, which has done a great job in making such products available for Islamic banks. We placed particular emphasis on SMEs, and we have many products that provide subsidized financing to those sectors covered by funds that come from international organizations such as the World Bank and Arab Fund. It is then made available to us in a way that is sharia compliant. As a bank, we have been a financier for many projects that contribute to sectors and industries that consume large amounts of energy, so clean energy growth has significant impacts on many projects we finance.</p><h4>What is the status of Islamic banking in Jordan?</h4><p><strong>MS</strong> We currently have almost 105 branches and offices in addition to serving our customers through almost 232 ATMs all over the country. Islamic banking in the country now accounts for 16.9% of banking in Jordan, and Jordan Islamic Bank's share is 9.5% of the total assets of the 24 banks in the country. In terms of the total number of deposits, Islamic banking holds 20% of the total banking, and our share is 12.5% of the sector as a whole. Islamic investments represent 24.5% of all investments and lending of conventional and Islamic banking, of which our share is almost 13.6%. We are open to any individual, regardless of religion, and we have deposits and investors from both sides, as we should be able to service people all over the world. This is the true application of sharia.</p><p><span></span><strong>IA</strong> There is a tendency for people to prefer Islamic banks, particularly in the southern areas outside Amman, since their penetration there is much higher than conventional banks. Often, they prefer to deal with us because they will get the same, if not better, services with our sharia-compliant products. We have seen enormous growth in the number of accounts, reaching nearly five-fold growth in the last seven years. In addition, we have many retail products that are based on "qard al-hasan," or interest-free loans. This has increased financial inclusion because people come to the bank for such interest-free products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges for Jordan when it comes to renewable energy?</h4><p><strong>HANNA ZAGHLOUL</strong> Today, Jordan produces more than what it can consume in terms of electricity. However, this gives it an opportunity to seek creative solutions, and one of those is to connect with neighboring countries to enhance regional electricity trade, while at the same time helping Jordan stabilize its own energy grid from renewable energy intermittency. The energy market is changing; the dependence on conventional energy markets is falling. Today, consumers are simultaneously producers, becoming part of the business model, though the legal framework in Jordan has not developed the legislation to allow people to sell electricity unless they sell directly to NEPCO. Over time, this will change. Electric cars will play a pivotal role in the near future, as storage devices and other technologies that will redefine the electricity grid become more commonplace. </p><h4>How does Hanania Energy, and Jordan more broadly, export its expertise in solar energy?</h4><p><strong>GEORGE HANANIA</strong> Neighboring countries are learning how to issue new laws as we have done; Jordan is a successful case study. Hanania energy is the exclusive agent for US-based solar swimming pool heating systems in the Middle East and Gulf, and there are still many opportunities for exporting. At present, the company is signing an agreement with Saudi Arabia for solar power. In 2015, we contracted with the Jordan River Foundation for 5,000 solar water heaters across 70 communities in Jordan. We work with many other institutes, including the Norwegian Refugee Council, USAID, the EU, the World Bank, and other international NGOs. Notably, we have a large project for PV for schools in the US through Mercy Corps.</p><h4>How do you envision renewables expanding in Jordan?</h4><p><strong>HZ </strong>Kawar Energy anticipated the increase of electricity production from renewables four years ago and started to introduce and implement small energy storage solutions, off-grid, on grid, and hybrid solutions. We see a rapid change in the electricity market within two to three years, with storage and the smart grid coming into focus. Appliances will also become smarter, knowing when to consume energy and when not to. We strive to become educators in terms of communicating, sharing knowledge, and spreading information to our stakeholders, while also lobbying with them to enhance our legal framework to accommodate and support upcoming electricity market advances, helping Jordan to become a model for the region by exporting knowledge, experience, and know-how. </p><p><span></span><strong>GH</strong> Solar heaters can be used in factories, industrial plants, hotels, homes, and many different buildings. When we install solar water heaters, the payback comes within months, but the lifespan is over 30 years. Households previously paid JOD40 per month in electricity. After installing solar systems, they pay a maximum of JOD15. We have larger systems that target middle- to high-income households. Not many companies work with PV because it requires special certification. The Commission for Mineral Resources and Energy Association is giving certifications in different categories based on the size of project, and there is good coordination between all stakeholders.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2019?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HZ </strong>The outlook is sunny. We are just at the start of solar energy, which will further grow. The electricity system comprises three main elements: fuel source, generation plant, and distribution grid. However, when considering solar in this formula, the cost of the fuel source is zero. In five to seven years, when energy storage becomes more affordable, consumers will be able to produce and store their own energy and consume when they need it with minimal losses. We have started to witness this today, indicating that the entire electricity model is changing. </p><p><span></span><strong>GH</strong> The private sector is already working with the government, and the situation is stable. Though the economic situation in Jordan is tough, Hanania Energy is receiving funds. For example, we received a Japanese grant recently for civil works on new roads. More specifically, we received grants from the US, the EU, Japan, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the GCC countries. Hanania is a well-established name, and we hope to see a continuation of our name and reputation. Moreover, we want to see improvements in neighboring countries so that we can expand further. We are now busy in Jordan, and in terms of expansion we are eyeing the Iraqi market in the near future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main achievements and impact on the local economy since your establishment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>IMAD BUKHARI </strong>Since the onset, we have sought differentiation in every aspect of our business. Our vision is "to be the preferred shopping destination and the most differentiated locally and regionally." We have lived up to our mission, vision, and values and continue to seek the differentiation that sets us apart from other retailers. This differentiation came from our vision based on exposure to various cultures, travels, and passion for retail. We were the first to introduce experiential retail in our markets, and we still lead in this category. We offer our customers a consistently high service level, premium products with an emphasis on health and value aspects, and freshness and newness in everything we do. We have augmented this experience continuously by introducing new products and services and new brands, Hamleys Toy Shop and Readers Book Stores in 2008, and in fashion, M&amp;CO, Soya Concept, B-Young, and Blend in 2016 and our e-commerce site cozmo.jo in 2018.</p><p><strong>BASEM MALHAS</strong> We operate in the retail, tourism, hospitality, automotive, and banking sectors. Our contribution to the economy is largely from the automotive side. We are one of the highest-duty-bracket markets in automotive in the region, with around 80-100% special duty tax on luxury vehicles. Given the premium product that we sell and the tax bracket it falls under, our group generates a healthy revenue stream in terms of duties and VAT. On the hospitality side, the Four Seasons has been positively impacting the economy through employment, creating job opportunities and investing in human resources. We successfully sent Jordanians to assume senior Four Seasons management positions around the world. The Kingdom has a robust, healthy and mature financial system that is complemented by excellent oversight by the Central Bank of Jordan. Jordan is a very safe country in an extremely challenging region. Jordan also boasts an effective inclusive legal system and framework that protects local and foreign direct investors.</p><h4>What developments can we look forward to in 2019?</h4><p><strong>IB</strong> With the Hamleys brand in particular, we have the franchise for the Levant, and Egypt was our first step outside Jordan. We have three stores and one more coming in 2019. We are currently looking at three countries: Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. Lebanon will likely come first, and we will be there in the coming few years. In the last few years, we restructured the company, which has proven to be positive, in that we are leaner and stronger. We have a deep understanding of our customers and are aware of the change of behavior taking place. We are best equipped to maintain our position as the preferred shopping destination, expanding our market base and fostering greater loyalty. We have also been expanding all our brands in Jordan. We started with one supermarket and a fashion store to now having five supermarkets, two large fashion stores, five Hamleys stores, and two Readers in Jordan.</p><p><span></span><strong>BM</strong> We are working to set up an academy at the facility that will work closely with Al Hussein Technical University (HTU). The idea, in a nutshell, is to receive 12 students from the university. We will have a master trainer come out from the UK. We have identified a Jordanian to work under the master trainer and become a master trainer himself. We have an area of around 1,200sqm that we are working on repurposing into a proper academy environment. The first students will come from HTU, which has a "plug-in, plug-out" model, and students in years two and three will be able to use this experiential learning opportunity to count toward their degrees. They start a two-year course and after two years they graduate with a level-two Jaguar-Land Rover certificate. For other students, we will hold an open day for the dealers in the region. We are working hard on this and will have the capacity to go up to 48 students in three to four years. If this process is successful, we will receive financial assistance and support from JLR and regional importers. Additionally, I seek to break the gender barrier and am actively recruiting women. We will employ the very first female graduate, which will be the first step in many in breaking down the social barriers that keep women out of these professions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your investment outlook?</h4><p><strong>KHOLOUD SAQQAF </strong>SSIF has been able to grow its portfolio from USD2.6 billion to USD14.5 billion since 2003, becoming by far the largest investment fund in Jordan and among the biggest in the region. A total of 55% of this growth came from contribution of pensioners, and 45% are attributed to investment revenue. Our investment pool is well diversified and our investments allocations include government bonds, equity, and real estate, and to a limited lesser extent, loans. SSIF sought to tap the untapped market by being a long-term investor, differentiating itself from the private sector. We are among the first to directly invest into local tourism by owning a chain of four- and five-star hotels. The private sector has followed our lead. We also pioneered renewable energy investments by investing into smaller energy subsidiaries, thus creating a stream of passive income. Due to the economic slowdown, we are currently keen to focus on infrastructure investments. SSIF has established two development zones in the north, Irbid, and in the north east, Mafraq, in order to balance out the geographical growth in the entire geography of Jordan and not to limit it to the capital, Amman. Around 98% of our investments are in Jordan, which creates a challenge as we are affected by the economic slowdown. In 2018, SSIF established a fully owned financial leasing company to finance major local infrastructure projects.</p><p><strong>OMAR ALWIR </strong>The initial commitment of shareholders to the Saudi Jordanian Investment Fund is USD3 billion, to be invested according to our approved investment strategy and in compliance with the Jordan Investment Fund Law number 16 for 2016. Uniquely for a company of our size, there is no specific investment period. The shareholders are committed to investing in Jordan and deploying capital according to clear criteria. Our goals are to make commercial returns, make a sustainable impact in what we do and that provides new capital and an impetus for growth for the economy, and make sure everything we do is in line with the outlook of the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), our main shareholder, and, by association, Vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia. As far as they are concerned, we are looking at projects as quickly as possible that tick those three boxes and are in line with our main objective of investing in infrastructure and in key sectors of economic activity in Jordan.</p><h4>How else is SSIF looking to advance knowledge exchange?</h4><p><strong>KS</strong> Our financial investment experience has accumulated over the last 15 years, and it is largely focused on the Jordanian economy. Since we are a success story for the economy, we can always benefit from knowledge transfer. Currently, we are trying to further build relationships with other countries and exchange ideas. We have learned a great deal from past experiences; for example, 10 years ago 63% of our portfolio was in the stock market, which was negatively influenced by the 2008 financial crisis. We learned not to diversify the portfolio, but rather keep part of it liquid. Another relevant example is jointly working with the government to design a 15-year treasury bond with a high return, which was mutually beneficial to SSIF and the government of Jordan. All these shared benefits come due to our extensive experience. Furthermore, we can easily partner with the private sector since we are a semi-government institution.</p><h4>How are SJIF and its partners involved in supporting the SME ecosystem in Jordan?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OA</strong> There are a number of new initiatives to support SMEs in Jordan, both on the equity and debt side. The impetus for most of these initiatives has been the Central Bank of Jordan and the leadership of the governor has been instrumental in the establishment of such initiatives. Two of these initiatives, the USD180-million SME Investment Fund, funded by many Jordanian banks, and the USD98-million Innovative Startups and SMEs Fund (ISSF), established by the Central Bank and the World Bank, are making significant contributions to bolstering growth, job creation, and innovation. I am heartened by these initiatives and think there is more than can be done still. This is a key reason that we are looking at supporting the technology ecosystem, a key driver of economic growth, through investing in both early-, as well as late-stage companies. We have fantastic people with great ideas and companies coming up in Jordan, and we want to support them. There are also companies that have been around for 10-15 years that are making money but have hit a brick wall and need to go to the next level, with the ultimate goal of being involved in the success of the next big technology champion. We want to participate in those processes and believe the sector is well primed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your organization affect the financial services industry in Jordan? </h4><p><span></span><strong>DR. JAWAD ANANI</strong> In the medium to long term, the stock market is the mirror for the economic situation in a country. It reflects the overall standing of economic performance and indicators as well as the changes. However, in the short term, the stock market has its own dynamics, where players within the market decide the day-to-day fluctuations. In Jordan, we had certain boom years on the ASE, and we were hopeful we could expand it both horizontally and vertically. Unfortunately, after 2008, there was a huge drop in size and the share price index, and a number of companies also relocated elsewhere. This led to the demotion of the ASE from an emerging to a frontier market. This alienated large pension funds and institutional investors that only invest in emerging markets and above. ASE is working hard to regain that emerging market status, so we can attract more investors. There are great opportunities because funding is tight in Jordan, so most people do not run their portfolios on stocks. They opt for government bonds and securities, which provide a great income that is tax free. There are excellent opportunities for profit in the industry, banking, and finance sectors here.</p><p><span></span><strong>DR. IBRAHIM SAIF</strong>  The mandate of JSF is to engage the private sector more in public debate to achieve a common course for the country, uniting the efforts of the private and public sectors and any additional stakeholders we can identify. Since its inception, JSF has sought to promote evidence-based policymaking and well-informed debate at the societal level and identify opportunities that can attract private investment. Whenever there is new legislation, regulations, or bylaws from the government, we are engaged. JSF has a duty to inform the public and the government about these disruptive changes taking place globally and influence new policies and legislations. When something positive is happening, JSF also needs to amplify that. We need to celebrate successes and not only be critical and focused on negative issues.</p><h4>What do you think about new tax regime?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JA</strong> I was vocal about my opposition to the proposal. My dissent did the trick, and we ended up adding an extra fee that both investors and brokers were satisfied with. It was not the ideal solution, but it was the next best one. In terms of the tax reforms overall, income tax law has been heavily debated in Jordan and has incited considerable emotion. There was no need for the government to increase tax rates. It could have thoroughly looked at the margins and the income groups and adjusted the rates to make it a more progressive tax system. It could have also tightened its grip on tax evaders by closing the loopholes, essentially increasing revenues without actually increasing tax rates. Now is not the time to increase rates; it is more important to enact reforms that enhance the government's ability to collect taxes.</p><p><span></span><strong>IS</strong> The new reform will significantly enhance the government's revenue and help it balance the budget, which is an important pillar of the country's macroeconomic stability. Conversely, many say this is an additional burden on the private sector that needs to be removed. We will see the full impact of the new income tax law by the end of 2019. As an economist, I see why it is important to have this reform, though we have to ensure our tax institutions have the proper capacity to treat everyone equally before the law.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future? </h4><p><span></span><strong>JA </strong>Moving forward, Jordan must realize that its traditional and long-term beneficial relations with the Gulf states are changing. The Gulf has its own challenges to worry about as it moves out of being a rentier state and into being a region of productive state. </p><p><span></span><strong>IS</strong> 2019 will not be an easy year; however, we see positive signs in terms of export growth, particularly in the Iraqi and Syrian markets, and identify some opportunities where we can attract more and new private investment, be it in energy, water, or infrastructure. The situation is tough, but not gloomy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main accomplishments and challenges for FHC?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ROXANN LINTON </strong>FHC has spent a century in Jamaica underpinned by the idea of people helping people, so while it is a financial institution, there is a difference in our approach. We are a community bank. Within that context, FHC is one of the largest credit unions with an open bond; we serve a broad section of the Jamaican population. We are building out an improved culture of accountability and working to improve efficiency. We are implementing measures to ensure our key support functions operate as efficiently as possible.</p><h4>What were the main highlights for JCCUL in 2018?</h4><p><strong>WINSTON FLETCHER </strong>In 2018, we held our annual general meeting (AGM) and convention. We also had a major business decision that required AGM's approval, fully endorsed by the membership. We have been developing an intra-credit union program, designed to provide access to members across the movement from different locations; this will be implemented by mid-2019 and will allow members to get their salaries paid directly to their credit unions. We continue to grow our loans and savings portfolio, despite market competitiveness, and our NPLs are at a relatively low level of about 5%. Moreover, in 4Q2018, we embarked on a major transformation project toward a 2025 vision. We are preparing for new regulations as we are now governed by World Council of Credit Unions standards.</p><h4>How can you maximize awareness of the products and services provided?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RL </strong>We had to reexamine our organizational structure, as it relates to marketing and, while we focus on the traditional models of marketing, we have just embarked on a larger push on the digital approach, using social media for marketing activities to raise interest and so on.</p><h4>Do you have any strategic partnerships as part of your transformation?</h4><p><strong>WF</strong> We are looking at how we can collaborate more meaningfully between credit unions. The interconnectivity project is one example. Our dream one day is for the movement that now comprises 26 credit unions to share one back office. We are in the process of gaining membership to the International Cooperative Alliance, a global body that oversees cooperatives. This will provide us with significant leverage.</p><h4>How is FHC committed to implementing several growth strategies?</h4><p><strong>RL</strong> For a network of 11 branches, we have seen over 10% growth in our assets in the last year and a half, and our loan disbursements have almost doubled on a monthly basis. We find that our "Member at the Centre" approach is a key success factor in driving our growth.</p><h4>Can you describe JCCUL's commitment to the social development of Jamaica?</h4><p><span></span><strong>WF</strong> We are integrated with our communities. For example, we have a program called CODEFCO that is focused on early childhood education. We tend to focus on education, going all the way up to tertiary, because we believe that education goes a long way towards social advancement.</p><h4>What is FHC doing to improve financial inclusion in Jamaica?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RL</strong> We are currently right on the cusp of doing an upgrade to our core banking system that will position us more on the digital side. We currently have an online banking platform, though we can work more on that front. As we move along, greater investments will be made to advance on that trajectory.</p><h4>What is the importance of smaller investors for your company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>WF</strong> Small investors are the origin of our existence. Most of our members are variants of the small investors who borrow when they need to, and the credit union is their bank. At present, we are seeking to develop a more structured approach to include MSMEs into our business model in an effective way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main highlights in 2018?</h4><p><strong>STEVEN WHITTINGHAM </strong>We started GK Capital with a focused approach and mission to facilitate transformational transactions. Simply put, we wanted to help our clients execute transactions that make their businesses much better, whether it is raising debt or equity, M&amp;A activities, and asset management services that help them build their portfolios. 2018 is the year where we hit the nail on the head for all of the targets we had set for our organization. One of the highlights for 2018 was a highly successful IPO for Indies Pharmaceuticals. We also raised debt instruments for large and small corporate clients in 2018 and signed mandates for IPOs in the coming years. It is important to mention that in a relatively short period of time, we have managed to build a portfolio of over JMD10 billion. In terms of our brokerage business, while we are a small brokerage house, we have focused on facilitating the sale of large blocks of publicly traded companies in the local market and have a great platform for the brokerage of US equities.</p><p><strong>GARY PEART</strong> The year 2018 was a great one; Jamaica has been on track to record growth, and Mayberry registered profits for the third consecutive year. In 2018, we listed our subsidiary, a standalone limited liability company, Mayberry Jamaican Equities (MJE). It holds all our long-term investments as we disposed of all investments that were not publicly listed equities. We were pleased with the results of the listing, which led to the biggest movement in our profits for 2018. MJE is the only company of its kind in Jamaica. We encourage people to buy into it to access the benefits of the pre-arranged portfolio. Our company's growth also benefitted from a strong performance of the local stock market. The Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE), of which I am Deputy Chairman, was again rated among the best-performing stock markets in the world in 2018. As a stockbroker, we have a seat on the board of the JSE, and we also buy and sell shares.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p><strong>SW </strong>We believe we have a really attractive value proposition. First, we are a subsidiary of GraceKennedy and that means a lot to our clients. GraceKennedy is built on a framework of honesty, integrity, and trust. Whether justified or not, in the local financial services market, there is a perception that some financial houses are aggressive and may not always act in the best interests of their clients; GK Capital does not have this issue, we are completely focused on the success of our clients. For example, we do not sell a security to our clients that we are not prepared to put on our balance sheet. Our real differentiator is our team. We are relatively small in size, but our performance shows we have the best team in the industry.</p><p><span></span><strong>GP </strong>Initially, Mayberry was a stockbroker, expanding over time into a full-service financial services business. We offer services in trading (fixed income, equities, and currency), asset management (pensions, management portfolios, and CI mutual funds) and investment banking (mergers and acquisitions, advisory, IPOs, divestitures, and debt raises). Mayberry is one of the leading broker-dealers in the local marketplace as a standalone, fully Jamaican entity. Our biggest asset is our relationship building and management, which has, often times, resulted in many transactions. Over the last five years, we have led the highest number of listings on the JSE among brokers. We are also one of the leading bond issuers in the country. We pride ourselves on our marketing: we focus on direct marketing and digital media, while we have pulled back from traditional electronic and print media.</p><h4>What are your investments in the energy sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SW</strong> Our activity in the sector began when we represented Jamaican Energy Partners in 2014. Up until our recent transaction with JPS, we had completed one of the largest energy financings in the local market by a securities dealer. We also facilitated the sale of private equity in a 37-MW solar energy plant in Westmoreland. We are actively in the process of finalizing the 7-MW power plant that is being constructed for the University of the West Indies Mona Campus.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your digitalization efforts?</h4><p><span></span><strong>GP</strong> Our app is one of our proudest achievements: it is the first app in Jamaica to allow stock trading. The biggest benefit we have seen is the reduction in the time it takes customers to access statement balances. We are looking to be fully digitalized as an organization within the next two years. Importantly, digitalization allows smaller businesses to compete with larger competitors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us more about the water-filtering concept that you have developed, and how it is applied in Saudi Arabia? </h4><p>KASCHEK: CERAFILTEC is essentially the most advanced filtration solution as a pre-treatment to reverse osmosis (RO). This is particularly important in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where seawater and groundwater sources have to be treated by RO.  The latter is currently our focus. The groundwater sources in KSA contain brackish water, which is water with too much salt for consumable standards and therefore must be treated via RO. The other impurities that must be removed are iron and manganese. Those must be removed BEFORE  the water enters the desalination process. Because un-purified water with particles destroy reverse osmosis membranes, it is imperative that the feed water for the RO has a high quality which. In the past, sand filters were used as a pre-treatment solution, but those do not reach the acceptable results. And unfortunately, commonly used polymeric membranes often do not withstand the heat of deep groundwater in KSA, which can sometimes reach 60 degrees Celsius. If you want to solve this problem for the RO, you must have an ultrafiltration that withstands these high temperatures and produces high-quality water. Exactly this is what the CERAFILTEC solution is doing: Producing highest water quality at large quantities with up to 99 degrees Celsius at very low OPEX. Originally, we brought this technology to KSA in 2010 at which point we further learned that the water also contains radium isotopes. We therefore developed a process that allows us to very efficiently reduce up to 98% of the radium with our technology and process know-how.</p><h4>What are the other applications of this ceramic membrane solution? Can it be used for seawater desalination?</h4><p>KASCHEK: Yes, and very successfully. While the ceramic flat sheet membrane is already commonly used in Saudi Arabia for almost 10 years, it is mainly known for its use in groundwater projects. However, CERAFILTEC has just as many advantages in seawater applications. Another problem that sand filters and polymeric filters often struggle with as a pre-treatment to RO is the removal of biological content and material in seawater applications. The CERAFILTEC system has proven itself very useful to solve those issues, specifically due to the corrosion free and robust material characteristics which is needed in seawater. The high-water quality, with a very low Silt Density Index (SDI) is then further increasing the recovery of the RO; and the Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP), which are classified to be the main reason for RO fouling, are removed (up to 99%) by our technology.  The CERAFILTEC system further allows for a much more compact water treatment plant footprint which saves building space and real estate space for further expansion. Such space savings is usually around 80% over sand filters. Another exciting application for us is the filtering of brine water. Brine water is the leftover waste water from reverse osmosis which is extremely salty and often discharged into large ponds for evaporation. We can to turn this water into drinking water, too! It is a pity. This is precious water currently just being wasted. The same holds true for treated sewage effluent (TSE) which is water that runs through a waste water treatment plant and comes out relatively clean, but not to a level which is consumable or healthy. With CERAFILTEC, we can efficiently remove all bacteria and suspended solids from such TSE to turn it into useable water for agriculture, irrigation, and industrial applications. In fact, treating TSE water is a much more economical solution than generating new usable water from seawater where the required energy to remove the salt via reverse osmosis vastly exceeds the energy used to purify the TSE water with our solution. In addition, purifying TSE water also avoids generating high salt content brine which has a long-term impact on the broader ecosystem. </p><p>AL-SHARMAN: The MENA region is known to be the most water scarce region in the world. This problem is attempted to be solved with large desalination treatment plants, as the main source of water in the Arabian world which inherently impacts the ecosystem. Our solution compensates for some of these ramifications as it substantially reduces the total waste of water in the water treatment process. Other focus areas of our solution where we have similarly strong advantages include DAM water, TSE water for reuse, and industrial applications. However, given the unique and extremely resistant properties of our solution, we can operate in all water environments.</p><h4>Is Saudi Arabia like a research ground for your product?</h4><p>KASCHEK: We discovered something very special in Saudi that will have a massive impact on the global filtration industry over the next decade: The discovery of high-flux applications for ceramic membranes. You must know, originally, we developed the ceramic flat sheet membrane in 1993 for sewage treatment plants. In such processes, the membrane bioreactor treats the bacteria as good bacteria eat the bad bacteria and leave sludge and clean water. In the conventional system, you use sedimentation where the overflow is "relatively" clean water. Normally, this tank is up to four times larger than using biological treatment. So, we put the membrane directly into the biomass to pull out the clean water without using a big sedimentation tank. When this process was developed, the rate of flow, or "flux," through the ceramic membrane was about three to four times higher than that of polymeric membranes, but also more expensive. When we then came to Saudi Arabia we were asked to treat the groundwater and were quite impressed to discover that the ceramic membrane produces a flux of 10 to 15 times higher than polymer membranes. This clearly elevates the ceramic membrane on the techno-commercial evaluation over the polymeric membrane; especially in groundwater. I see this as a break through discovery that inherently will change the future of water filtration on a global scale.</p><h4>How do you envision growing your customer base and application of the system in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>AL-SHARMAN: Ceramic membranes are already well established for groundwater applications in Saudi Arabia, thanks to Dr. Kaschek team over the past decade. In fact, I would argue Saudi Arabia is leading the ceramic filtration industry for this application. What makes the CERAFILTEC solution special is the very high flux; twice as high as that of other ceramic solutions. With double the flux, the clients have substantial CAPEX and OPEX savings, and can increase the plant capacity without expanding the facility. Further, our solution is made from glass fiber reinforced Noryl from Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC). This material allows us to treat water up to 99 degrees Celsius and enabled us to create a mighty modular and easy to install system, without any bulky parts and without any metal parts.</p><h4>Do you have any localization of production in mind?</h4><p>AL-SHARMAN: Most definitely. Localization is one of our priorities to serve the MENA region from Saudi Arabia and following the Saudi vision 2030. Over the past decade Saudi Arabia has been one of our key focus areas. Our German engineering team and management team is visiting KSA frequently and investing into this country. Our plan is to bring production capabilities and technology and R&amp;D capabilities to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and we are quite excited to be part of the change in Saudi.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does your company do? </h4><p><span></span><strong>ALI ABBAS </strong>We develop mainly two different types of applications, and these are B2C and B2B applications. Given the high demand in consumer mobile apps, most of our projects are B2C apps. Most of these apps are e-commerce platforms, while what differentiates between each app is the nature of the product or service. Some applications require minimal interference from humans in terms of managing the app or approving orders or requests. Some applications require staff to monitor the activity and operations, and without any kind of human interaction the app would stop functioning. With B2B or in-house use business applications, our work depends on the field the company is operating in, such as marketing, sales, manufacturing, retail, or others. These kinds of applications usually improve the efficiency of an organization by providing customized reports, task management, automation, and process change. When it comes to mobile apps, part of improving efficiency is serving users in a better way in terms of user-experience. Have a look at famous apps such as Twitter or Snapchat. Part of their success is how easy it is to perform the main thing in the app; tweeting or sending a snap. It takes on average two to three taps to do what the app is supposed to do. This results in more usage by users. We try to minimize the taps needed on every application. Applications can do many things, but their main objective should be simple to perform. There are best practices in terms of user experience, design, and development that need to be followed to come out with a good app. You may have a good design, but if your app is difficult to use and does not follow standards users are already used to, it may not be successful. We need to understand what clients want.  We have to understand their target audience and their field. Then, we can use industry best practices to get their app out there. When we build an application, we need to think as a user in order to successfully create an app. </p><p><span></span><strong>ABDUR-RAHMAN EL-SAYED NABD</strong>, our personalized Arabic Newsreader, has over 20 million users across the globe and this has changed the way Arabic news is being consumed completely. In terms of production and what is happening in the industry, we are witnessing what is known as automated journalism or augmented journalism, whereby machines and algorithms fetch new stories, run their own fact checking, and essentially produce news stories without any human involvement. News distribution is also changing considerably with the advancement of platforms. Take NABD for example: it can instantaneously connect any publisher to 20 million readers. What is also interesting about distribution is that the platforms are also facing a major issue: fake news distribution. We implement artificial intelligence to ensure that no incorrect content is posted and no fake engagement such as fake followers are recorded. </p><h4><span></span>How do you customize your product?</h4><p><strong>AA </strong>One issue we face when building applications is user interface design. Some applications are designed with very rich graphics. When speeds get higher, we can build our applications in a way where loading times are much faster. When 5G is launched, people will interact more with their mobile phones. That's our business. This opens up more opportunities for us to work with new clients and more projects to work on. We can enhance the services we provide with 5G. </p><p><strong>ARES </strong>In recent times, we have been noticing that there is a major demand for performance-based advertising, meaning an advertiser only pays when they get measurable results. A measurable result can be a website visit or when the user fills a form and clicks on submit or simply clicks an ad. Advertisers are becoming tech savvy and they are willing to invest major budgets as long as they get tangible results. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the market for dentistry like in Kuwait? </h4><p><span></span><strong>DR. SALAH ALMETHIN</strong> Until 10 years ago, Kuwait only had between 10 and 20 specialized private dental centers. Now there are at least 300. This is due to the dentists working in this sector and the new insurance system. Before, dentistry was a service mainly provided by the government, but now the government has given Kuwaitis the opportunity to choose between public and private dentists by providing them with health insurance. For example, retired people are covered by AFIA Insurance, which gives them the option to use a government clinic or go to any private dental clinic for treatment. This has led to improvements in dental clinics and also increased the number of patients being treated. Today, some ministries and companies are also providing private insurance for their employees. For example, the Foreign Ministry and Kuwait Oil Company both provide their employees with full health insurance coverage for both medical and dental treatment. This trend has led to an increase in the number of dental clinics, which has become a highly competitive sector. Dentists have to be highly educated, specialized, and have the latest equipment. If you look at the changes that have happened in our sector over the last 10 years, there are many great opportunities to invest in now. In the future, the government may add another category of people covered for private dental treatment under the government health insurance scheme.</p><h4>What are the major differences between the private clinics and public hospitals?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DR. HOSSAM ASHOUR</strong> In terms of quality there is not much difference. The government has a special interest in providing Kuwaitis with good education. There are scholarships to study in well-known universities for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. These recipients then work in the government sector. Once they have been practicing for several years, they can then work in a private clinic or a public hospital. The government has six specialized centers in each area which deals with the majority of the population. This leads to an issue regarding waiting lists and making appointments. This is one of the main reasons why people prefer using private services.</p><h4>What do dental patients in Kuwait want?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SA </strong>In the dentistry sector, the biggest issue is the patient's fear of pain. Now there are new techniques being introduced that create a painless experience for patients. For example, there have been a lot of improvements in the type of injections given. We have needleless, pressure injections now, which is a good start. We can use nitrous oxide to help a patient relax. If you can give a patient, particularly a child, a good first experience they will have more confidence about going to the dentist again. When it comes to the actual treatment, rather than drills we use lasers so there is no touching, vibration, noise, or pain for the patient. Lasers are also used to remove gum tissue and seal wounds. There is no bleeding and therefore no need for stitches. </p><p><strong>HA</strong> Mainly people are interested in getting cosmetic dentistry needs. First, we advise patients of possible dental problems and concerns, including cavities or bleeding gums. We want to make sure the patient has a healthy mouth before we start working on their cosmetic needs. Patient interest in cosmetic dentistry offers us the opportunity to determine more serious issues that may need correcting. Otherwise, we only receive patients when they experience pain. In the past, there were government campaigns encouraging people to take care of their teeth and regularly visit dentists. Hopefully, insurance companies and the government will start doing this outreach again. It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health to make patients aware of dental care.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Doka's business strategy in Kuwait and what makes it a strategic market?</h4><p><strong>GERALD HOERMANN</strong>  Doka Kuwait was established in 1977, making it one of the company's first branches outside of Europe and a testament to the perceived potential of the Kuwaiti market. Over 40 years later, Kuwait continues to be a stable and sustainable market with excellent growth prospects in the industrial and oil and gas sectors, thanks to the government's commitment to enforcing quality and safety standards. Our strategy is to continue to provide our usual high levels of service in conjunction with our latest innovative products and systems to support Kuwait's ongoing infrastructure development.</p><h4>In light of PERI's 50th anniversary, what is your new international strategy and vision?</h4><p><strong>JOSEF PALME</strong> In 2018, our management introduced a new strategy that extends to 2025. The aim is to grow our production and develop new factories that will work on specific products. In addition, we have started to implement new products for regions where the demand for sophisticated and high-end products is low. We are adapting our product portfolio to better address the needs of these mid-market regions. Kuwait has demand for both high-end and mid-market products, and we have a 25% domestic market share. Our main focus is to supply formwork material, plywood, and components for projects safely and efficiently. Our clients can always rely on us, which is how we have established long-lasting relationships.  </p><h4>What is being done to increase the safety and efficiency of your products and solutions?</h4><p><strong>GH</strong> We have extended our service offering to play a more intrinsic role throughout the project lifecycle. We are renowned for consistently providing quality service. Due to our detailed planning and execution, clients are able to maximize their ROI. This means we have a high percentage of repeat clients, which essential to succeed in Kuwait's construction market. Having been in the country for 42 years, our experience means we are both familiar with local protocols and most importantly, trusted by the wider industry. In our extended service offering, we provide guidance regarding how to use our materials to their full potential to maximize ROI.</p><p><strong>JP</strong> All our products meet European safety standards. We have also developed products that exclusively address safety considerations. This includes safety anchors for installing climbing formwork or for single-sided wall formwork and other products for residential programs like safety barriers. We are dedicated to protecting peoples' lives on the job site. We want to open clients' eyes to the absolute necessity of safety systems and procedures, and we support clients as they pursue these objectives. Equally important, we are keen to support the environment through environmentally friendly sourcing and production. We use production waste to heat our premises and the surrounding neighborhood. We reuse the byproducts and the waste materials we create to reduce our environmental footprint as much as possible. In fact, our directors have a strong environmental focus, which is not typical in today's environment.</p><h4>How does Doka differentiate itself from its European competitors?</h4><p><strong>GH </strong>We recently introduced a formwork pre-assembly service that requires less manpower, saves time, and ensures the quality of the material and execution of concrete works. This new service has further strengthened our position in the market. Doka's most important differentiator is its commitment to innovation. A great example is Concremote, a remote sensor device that monitors the real-time development of concrete strength. The sensors are placed in the concrete with local SIM cards that send the live data to our servers in Europe. Not only does it save valuable time, it also ensures the quality and integrity of the concrete. Concremote is just one of the innovative products that will change the construction game, and we are excited to be able to offer it to the Kuwaiti market.</p><h4>What role does technological innovation play in your construction?</h4><p><strong>JP </strong>Technological innovation is a vital part of our 2025 strategy. PERI spends approximately 5-10% of its revenues on R&amp;D. We are looking at technological standards in different global markets as we want to ensure we have the right product for every region. We have a trade show coming up in Germany that will serve as a forum to launch our latest innovations. We use customer feedback when working on new innovations. Three years ago, we introduced a light and strong polyethylene formwork after hearing feedback from our customers and have since applied this system worldwide. In 2019, we have new products coming to the market, with a particular focus on new innovations in the mid-market range. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main factors that differentiate Schneider Electric?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAGED EL SEROUGY</strong> As the global leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, Schneider Electric is supporting Kuwait as a key market in the Arabian Gulf. Our Kuwait business has grown rapidly over the past two to three years, and is set to accelerate as we support the nationwide digital transformation goals. Our key differentiator is the EcoStruxure architecture, which is optimized for the Internet of Things. EcoStruxure integrates three layers: the bottom layer of connected products, the middle layer of edge control, and the top layer of apps, analytics, and services. Organizations that use EcoStruxure can deliver enhanced value in terms of safety, reliability, efficiency, sustainability, and connectivity. Our research and development are enhancing the ease of deployment and running large networks of sensors, and the scalability and security of the infrastructure needed to harness the big data analytics coming from these networks.</p><h4>What main projects will Egis focus on in 2019?</h4><p><strong>CHRISTIAN LAUGIER </strong>Egis is working on certain major, iconic projects in various sectors. Our ongoing road projects (Al Ghousa and Al Bidda) are the major infrastructure improvements delivered for the Ministry of Public Works. In the rail sector, Egis is looking at the Kuwaiti component of the GCC railway and city urban rail. Regarding the water, environment, and energy sectors, Egis is working on several challenging projects announced under a PPP scheme, such as the Kabd solid waste-to-energy project, Umm al-Hayman STP, and others. Our team is involved in environmental projects such as the rehabilitation of three landfills for Kuwait City. In the urban sector, we are capitalizing on strong local presence and Egis' capabilities as a leading international engineering firm. Healthcare facilities, institutional and educational buildings, as well as new city expansions are of great interest to us. Egis' expertise benefits from cross-market and cross-domain projects, innovative and long-term solutions, as well as supporting financing schemes that cater to national requirements.</p><h4>What steps are being taken by Schneider Electric to become greener?</h4><p><strong>MES </strong>Kuwait faces three key mega-trends: urbanization, industrialization, and digitization. The new crop of executives fully understands the importance of digital infrastructure in enabling energy efficiency and business competitiveness. For example, with 75% of a building's life cycle costs in maintenance and operations, building owners and facilities management companies need to be proactive in their maintenance. Assets advisors, which is part of our digital energy solutions, can provide the deep analytics and insights to optimize costs. Smart grids can help electricity producers and distributors to enhance the efficiency of their assets. In the industrial sector, manufacturers and factories can improve the efficiency of electric motor systems.</p><h4>What is Egis' approach to the tender for the international airport project?</h4><p><strong>CL</strong> Egis has been invited by the Ministry of Public Works to bid for the Project Management of International Airport's Terminal 2, along with its airside and landside infrastructure. We consider this as an opportunity to become a strategic partner of the ministry for its infrastructure projects. We aim to become a preferred consultant and a partner for the Kuwait Directorate General of Civil Aviation by providing various consultancy, engineering, and project management services. Egis offers consultancy services in the air traffic management sector, reinforcing the safety of the air transportation sector and optimizing the country's airspace. An extensive experience in airport infrastructure projects, as both investor and operator of 17 airports globally, would be beneficial to the Kuwaiti government when seeking innovative financing options with long-term solutions.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><strong>MES </strong>2019 is set to be a springboard for Kuwait Vision 2035's nationwide digital transformation. The government continues to drive energy efficiency initiatives from the top-down, and the private sector continues to drive innovative initiatives. In Kuwait, we are exchanging best practices with global smart cities such as Naya Raipur, Istanbul, and Berlin. We will also continue to expand and enhance the training for our Kuwait channel partner program. We are also planning to continue our partnership with INJAZ AL-Arab to foster a spirit of mentorship, passion, and service among business leaders in the Arab world and enhance our training for youth in partnership with educational institutions.</p><p><strong>CL</strong> As the region moves toward PPP projects, we have organized ourselves in preparation for the next regional challenges. Egis has the experience and international capabilities to undertake such projects and support local clients. The model, delivery process, and resources will vary from more traditional projects, bringing innovative solutions, high efficiency, and long-term sustainability. I am confident 2019 will prove to be highly successful, and we will take a lead position across a range of projects, despite the challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current progress of the local renewable energy sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HAMaD R. ALRADHAN </strong>In recent years, Kuwait has been implementing several renewable energy technologies, solar being the most significant one. Different pilot projects have demonstrated the reliability and effectiveness of this power source in Kuwait, and we now are at a stage where large projects are essential to achieve the country's renewable energy targets. The Shagaya renewable energy park was developed by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) in order to host a mix of technologies at utility scale. The park is expected to host more than 4GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Life Energy has played an important role in deploying many of the renewable energy projects in the past eight years. We have done more than 250 PV installations since our establishment and will continue to take an active role in the coming years to come.</p><p><strong>DARIUSZ K. KOLASINSKI</strong> Energy efficiency is not much of a priority in Kuwait, and the country is only starting to take this issue seriously. Subsidies are given for electricity and water, so people lack substantial motivation for change. By establishing low-energy pilot projects, the government is showing the new generation of Kuwaitis that energy efficiency is a real tangible possibility. Instead of offering land and finance to build houses, the government can offer low-energy villas based on the model that we are now presenting. We are one of the participants in this project, and others are from industries such as energy-efficient building materials, LED lighting, home energy management systems, and modern air conditioning equipment. Given the cheap pricing of electricity compared to other countries, the private sector is not yet motivated to take action. As such, we can see that the government is leading the move toward the implementation of renewable energy sources, with the private sector waiting in the hope that it will possibly receive some form of subsidies.</p><h4>How do you collaborate with existing buildings and infrastructure to limit energy consumption?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HRA</strong> Our company provides solutions to support the optimization of energy use in new and existing buildings. In Kuwait, the major part of the energy consumption is cooling, which reaches more than 80% of total peak demand in the residential sector. Efficient air conditioning systems while improving insulation will significantly reduce energy consumption. Lack of public awareness in energy conversation is a problem in Kuwait, and unfortunately, from a regulatory perspective, the building code does not promote the construction of efficient buildings. On the other hand, we have seen improvements where renewables are considered. For example, Kuwait's new airport is being built in an energy-efficient manner by implementing solar energy generation and using specific materials to help reduce energy wastage. The oil sector has been doing this for a while and cares about waste management and recycling and is now introducing renewables in several locations, including their operations. As an EPC contractor, we orientate our clients toward the right consultation depending on the needs. We can also help by offering our engineered solutions to apply the latest technology to support organizations and individuals in their green initiatives and interest in renewables.</p><h4>What is your overall outlook on Kuwait's green potential?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DKK</strong> I was positively surprised after being invited to a presentation delivered by the Kuwait Green Building Council, which is a new initiative. The level of education delivered by this council and the sophistication of the message was impressive. Energy efficiency is a significant problem in this consumerist society that has a lot of waste and uneconomical consumption of resources. A number of Kuwaitis attended the event and got motivated by the message; these kinds of events and this type of education are crucial. At this stage, these initiatives are still in the developmental phase and not always backed by the government, however, universities and Kuwaitis who have returned after studying abroad are showing the majority of the enthusiasm. This is also in compliance with the Public Authority for Housing Welfare's programs. I am optimistic, which is why we are a part of the EU-GCC Clean Technology network, which started its activities last year in collaboration with Kuwait Society of Engineers. Such initiatives have educational merits and the ability to direct us toward the practical approaches to make decisive and influential decisions for a greener Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has your business model changed since the Baker Hughes-GE merger?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SOUFIANE KANOUN</strong> As a result of the merger, we are now the sole full stream service company in the world, which allows us to offer equipment, services and digital tools to the oil and gas sector. We touch all aspects of the supply chain, from upstream to downstream, which best serves our clients. The company today is even better positioned to enhance our partnerships with KPC and its subsidiaries, as well as with local players. We have a 50-year presence in Kuwait and have focused considerably on growth as well as solving our customers' challenges. We are also strong in terms of our service capabilities and constantly pursue innovative solutions that add value to our clients. We pay increasing attention to the reservoir to improve analysis and maximize production. Ultimately, our full-stream integrated approach is empowered by leveraging our technologies and partnerships with key engineering companies.</p><h4>How is MEOFS adjusting its structure and activity to fit new trends?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MOHAMMAD J. ALFAWAZ</strong> Since the Emir of Kuwait issued a decree aiming for 15% of our energy mix to be from renewables, MEOFS has dedicated much of its effort to this end. In 2015, we created a renewable energy department that targets medium- and large-sized projects. We are currently working on the Dibdibah project with KNPC and on a solar steam generation plant for heavy oil extraction. We cover both upstream and downstream. About 70% of our business is upstream related, while the remainder is downstream.</p><h4>To what extent can technologies reduce cost per barrel?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SK</strong> We have several technologies that help our customers optimize the drilling operations and enhance production, resulting in lower costs per barrel. We also provide digital solutions and predictive analytics to optimize the operations, predict failures, and reduce downtime. This leads to better efficiency and productivity and results in the reduction of cost per barrel. Furthermore, digitalization is about simplifying the process, and digital technology is unleashing new levels of performance by channeling the power of data. If properly collected, data enables more accurate decision-making concerning the plant and equipment and the anticipation of errors.</p><p><strong>MJA</strong> In terms of technology, we always find it better to partner with international, reputable companies that hold IP rights for certain technologies. We work with advanced technologies, emerging technologies, and disruptive technologies that are revolutionizing the industry. Unfortunately, the oil and gas sector is a late technology adopter. However, we have been able to identify certain technologies and bring them to Kuwait. We pioneered a number of technologies in Kuwait to help with reservoir characterization and production enhancement, as well as deploying technologies to reduce down-time on assets needing maintenance by applying new techniques. In all cases, its is a matter of creating value and increasing efficiency.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><strong>SK</strong> We see more projects coming into play, which mean 2019 and 2020 will prove positive for the entire market. The industry has learned a lot during the down cycle and is now producing more intelligently by increasing cost-efficiency. For this reason, Kuwait is showing great interest in our fully integrated solutions. We expect strong levels of investment by KPC, most likely over USD100 billion in fulfilling its vision.</p><p><span></span><strong>MJA</strong> The forecast for MEOFS should be in line with the growth in the economy and the oil sector; this is what we endeavor to achieve. We are looking forward to the growth opportunities at hand with the major projects and plans put forth in the oil sector. We are excited to deliver cutting-edge technology to assist projects and deploy the core values of MEOFS in the industry to ultimately help improve efficiency, create value, and reduce overall costs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate upon your raison d'íªtre? </h4><p><strong>HANNELORE GRAF</strong> The GBCK is a networking platform aimed at facilitating business relationships for our 180 members. It acts as a bridge between the German, Austrian, Swiss, and regional and local business communities. We have started to expand our activities from monthly business meetings with business related content to special visits to Kuwaiti business entities, and are partnering with event organizers of the most current event topics, like Euromoney, the Regional Cybersecurity Summit, and Horeca, just to name a few. This gives our sponsors greater exposure and entitles our members to special benefits. We also have our own restricted online members directory, which incorporates short bios and contact details of our members for their convenience. One of our upcoming events is 'The B6 Event," a networking event for the six business councils in Kuwait, including the British, American, Canadian, Australian, and French Business Council, accompanied by each country's respective ambassador. The Kuwaiti chair will be taken by HE Hind Al-Sabeeh, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, and the topic is "Working in Kuwait." Aside from special events like this, as well as visits to KOC display center, the Burgan oil rig, Abdaliya Nature Reserve, Doha West Power Station, National Bank of Kuwait (museum and new tower), and the Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Center, we are organizing monthly social gatherings (Stammtisch) and business meetings at the residences of the German, Austrian, and Swiss ambassadors. </p><p><strong>FRANK BELONUS</strong> ABCK was founded in 1985 and has been strongly involved in promoting American business and its products; we promote American business in Kuwait and Kuwaiti investment in the US. We also support the US Embassy Commerce Department's efforts in many areas, including imports and exports, breaking down trade barriers, and identifying current issues that need to be worked on government-to-government. We often run events within the business community where we regularly feature high-level dignitaries from the Kuwaiti and US governments, business leaders, and subject matter experts who interact with our members and provide insights into the business opportunities available in each sector. As a rule, the fact that certain sectors exhibit such fruitful growth and have potential for even more growth attracts American businesses here. These include the automobile, aerospace, defense and security, energy, oil, and gas sectors. Recently, the medical services, equipment, and management sectors have also been booming, and they are areas where we expect to see rapid growth over the coming year. Kuwait is building around eight new hospitals, and there is a huge amount of business for equipment, staffing, and management for these hospitals. The energy sector is also booming here. Investors can see Kuwait's 2035 business model and plans to build several cities, to include South Al Mutlaa, which is already under construction, and the amazing Silk City of the future. All these attract business from all over the world because investors realize this is the place to invest in, not just for the short term, but long term.</p><h4>Is Kuwait becoming more attractive for German and American businesses?</h4><p><span></span><strong>HG</strong> It is indeed. Kuwait is currently in the process of facilitating the necessary procedures that foreign entities must go through in order to do business here. To that end, the government is simplifying these processes to attract higher rates of FDI. Germany has good relations with Kuwait in important sectors such as the automotive, healthcare, and technology industries. German products in general are welcomed and renowned in Kuwait (and globally) because of their reputation for quality, efficiency, and affordability, which translates into confidence and enthusiasm needed to establish reciprocal trade.</p><p><strong>FB</strong> Undoubtedly more American businesses are coming, a trend we see most notably in the retail industry, as we are fortunate to have great Kuwaiti companies serving as agents for a multitude of American enterprises. Kuwait is unique in that statistically it must be one of the most traveled countries in the world per capita. Kuwait also has an outstanding education program, and many locals are educated outside of Kuwait, including in the US. They bring that international mentality—and their consumer preferences—home, which is evidenced in the continual growth of supermalls here. Places such as The Avenues are comparable to any of the world's major malls. Likewise, many of the Kuwaiti companies that bring American products to Kuwait do the same throughout the GCC and in some cases Europe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

But we know that the big challenge within the energy space is the availability of bankable projects rather than a perceived lack of capital. This is why we at ZKJ primarily help projects achieve bankability by adopting a well-articulated advisory and engagement strategy focused on our deep understanding of the regulatory and commercial environments to meet the expectations and standards of lenders and equity investors. Beyond advisory, we also undertake and drive capital investment and project development. Aside from the private sector, we are working with government ministries, departments, and agencies and development agencies. At the moment, we are providing support to an NNPC-owned company that is developing over 4GW of gas-fired power plant portfolio in seven locations across Nigeria.</p><p><span></span><strong>CHANTELLE ABDUL</strong> Mojec International/Mojec Meter Company is the largest meter manufacturer in West Africa. Primarily known on the continent as a market leader and innovator in metering with a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Lagos, Mojec has an installed annual production capacity of 2 million meters that produces a diverse range of products in its metering suites, including smart prepaid meters for residential and commercial clients, Prepaid Maximum Demand and grid meters for industrial clients, and the power genie platform remote monitoring system (AMI/AMR platform). Mojec remains at the forefront of innovation and metering technology and has a footprint of over 80% in the market with eight of 11 utilities as clients. Additionally, the firm provides metering solutions such as Mojec Power Genie platform, an energy management platform with a remote payment monitoring system and energy management platform, electricity vending, and billing capabilities. With a workforce of over 3,600 fulltime employees, an adhoc engineering team and nationwide installation team, and a track record of having injected over 1.2 million meters into the Nigerian market, Mojec has contributed significantly to bridging the metering gap in Nigeria.</p><h4>What growth opportunities do you see?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RW</strong> We see growth opportunities in wholesale markets where we have built our competencies, specifically in generation and power trading. While renewables are increasingly becoming part of the supply mix, we remain bullish on gas-fired plants as baseload solutions for the country and subregion. So, back to your question, we see growth in generation and trading, and we know where the constraints are for now: transmission and distribution. What's more, many investors would likely be interested in contractor financing with a distribution company, but you have to work out a system for this. In a place like Nigeria, we have too many structural imbalances that we need to figure out before we can attract significant investor interest. However, Nigeria is too big to ignore. When you look at the supply gap compared to other economies you realize the huge potential. In Egypt, for example, there is 30,000MW on the grid to support 82 million people, while Nigeria has 180 million people but just about 5,000MW on the grid. There is so much that can be done locally, especially when you consider proven gas, hydro, and solar resources. Most investors are currently observing, aware of the sheer scale of the market, and how profitable it could be. Yet, they are also considering other markets while they wait for Nigeria to get its act together.</p><p><span></span><strong>CA</strong> As a firm our expansion and growth have been primarily funded by our own private shareholder funds and from development finance institutions. Due to the nature of the industry we are in and the need for long-term financing, we have low interest rates. We have primarily focused on project finance funds from development institutions such as Bank of Industry (BOI) or special intervention funds from the CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria). Today, the metering gap in the country is slated at about 4.5 million meters by the electricity regulator. However, it is widely believed by industry stakeholders that this number would more than double or triple once full proper enumeration has been completed. At the height of privatization in 2013, the metering gap in the country was set at over 7.5 million meters with an estimated 80% of consumers unmetered. These numbers, if enumerated, would probably double or triple for Africa's largest nation and economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Frontier Oil is targeting 200 million scf of gas production. How is that progressing?</h4><p><strong>DADA THOMAS </strong>We did not achieve our target of 200 million scf of production in the last couple of years, but this was not because we have not been ready. We have the well, plant, and pipeline capacity, but the off-takers have not been able to take the volumes of gas they contracted for. That is unfortunate, because we have invested in capacity that is underutilized. Until they gear up and start to take the contractual volume, the target remains our goal, even though it is out of our control. However, we have seen improvements and saw a much higher uptake during 1Q2018. It dropped again as maintenance began, but hopefully, once the maintenance is over, we will work to push the numbers up.</p><p><strong>DIKKO ATANU </strong>With Nigeria having more gas reserves than oil on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, the key development over the past year has been the approval of the National Gas Policy (NGP) by the Federal Executive Council. The gas policy aims to be the cornerstone and governing tool for repositioning gas development in Nigeria as a critical path for industrialization via increasing gas to the power sector, gas-based industries, the use of gas as a transportation fuel, and attracting much-needed capital across the gas value chain. A key takeaway from this policy for small-scale gas operators and developers and companies seeking to take gas the last mile is the fixing of the price for domestic LNG at USD1.20/mcf. The problem that was typically faced by last mile end users seeking gas away from the pipeline grid has always been the delivered gas price being too high. For CNG and those seeking to go into LNG distribution, they typically have had to contend with willing-buyer, willing-seller negotiations for a wellhead gas price that is unfortunately too high from the onset. By the time infrastructure costs, which include liquefaction, regasification, and transportation and financing costs are factored in, the delivered price becomes too costly. Fortunately, this new policy addresses those concerns, and ensures that feedstock gas earmarked for the domestic market in the form of CNG or LNG becomes comparatively affordable and competitive to alternative fuels.</p><h4>What is the government doing to foster the industry?</h4><p><span></span><strong>DT </strong>First, government power plants are not operated as efficiently as they ought to be. According to my mantra, the government should not be running businesses. Nonetheless, we hope the power plants will eventually be fully privatized, similar to the Calabar power plant, which is back on the path of full privatization. Ibom is fully state-owned; hence, it is difficult to predict its future. Calabar makes up 60% of our offtake as the base load, and if its management fails to take the volumes, we are affected. This is due to inefficiencies rooted in the government's involvement. In total, there is 13GW of installed power in the country, but only 7GW is available for reasons such as technical problems including inadequate gas supply; some generators are offline and sometimes one power plant is repurposed to run another. When it comes to meeting supply, the solution is simple: deregulate the power and petroleum products (PMS) market like they did with diesel and leave things to market forces and competition. Equally important, governments should be welcoming new business instead of putting up barriers.</p><p><span></span><strong>DA</strong> The two policies highlighted earlier—the National Gas Policy (NGP) and the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Program (NGFCP)—are excellent first steps in developing the country's gas reserves. These policies provide both fiscal and regulatory certainty on the direction the government is heading, and allow for a project-based approach rather than a centrally planned model for domestic gas development. In addition, it allows companies like ours to start on a small scale, and link development of these gas flares to captive or embedded power plants across the country. Currently, there is a great deal of focus on off-grid solar development, and if we apply the same strategy to small-scale gas-fired IPPs with feedstock from gas flares, it works for gas as well. Essentially, decentralization of small-scale gas development should occur at least until we have gas pipelines crisscrossing the nation. Rather than having gas fields connected to centralized pipelines, gas flares can be developed in isolation, and the gas evacuated via virtual pipelines after being liquefied. LNG with its 1,000km radius can serve markets removed from the grid that currently use kerosene or diesel. In addition, with solar applications in Nigeria not having a cost-effective storage system for larger generation capacity, mini-LNG can serve as a bridge and peak-generation solution that complements off-grid solar plants when there is no sunlight. This out-of-the-box hybrid solution is commercially viable and can be guaranteed by the funding secured by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your growth strategy, and what makes Afriland Properties stand out among its peers?</h4><p><span></span>UZO OSHOGWE Though markets will continue to change due to political, economic, and technological forces, our plan is to leverage new technologies to improve product development, enhance customer relations, streamline operations, and market effectively. We currently manage several residential and commercial facilities and will deepen our market penetration in this area. To this end, we hope to kick off some of our projects in 2019. For example, we are the project directorate for Transcorp Hilton Hotel and will continue to work with it on the ongoing refurbishment of Abuja Hotel and on the proposed expansion program in Lagos and Port Harcourt. Afriland has also developed low-end products such as Afri-shops, its ultra-modern lock-up shops to help small-scale businesses achieve their goals. What separates us from the competition is our focus on quality and perfecting the act of execution; strategy without execution is a futile effort. We have a track record of excellence, and our clients trust that we will always deliver on our promises. In short, our tagline, "Execution perfected, Excellence Delivered," says it all.</p><h4>Can you give us a brief overview of your operations in Africa?</h4><p>FEMI AKINTUNDE At inception, our primary focus was facilities management, followed by a real estate development company. We have expanded into new operational areas such as electronic security and fire systems services, real estate bridge-financing, and warehousing and logistics, positioning ourselves as one of the leading complete real estate solutions company in Africa. One of the areas we are expanding into is the healthcare sector. In addition, we continue to provide FM services to residential estates, corporate offices, malls, government offices, and aviation facilities. One of the reasons public-sector employees may not be as productive as their private-sector contemporaries could be related to their work environment. That is why we have redefined our business along operational dynamics rather than geographical, enabling us to have a sharper focus on different segments and come up with the right real estate solutions to improve employee productivity, increase the lifespan of public assets, and provide strong support to government.</p><h4>What are the new realities in real estate to look out for when considering properties?</h4><p>UO All around the world, infrastructure drives urban development. It plays a vital role in stimulating urban land development and economic activities. This means accessibility and transportation, electricity/power, clean water, and so on must be top priorities. Unfortunately, this is not the case in most African cities. The government needs to pay more attention to infrastructure. People are beginning to realize the importance of a good quality of life. Where they live and work matters to them and how they commute between the two locations is key. Furthermore, certain policies need to be reviewed to meet the housing needs in Nigeria. The government understands the urgency of reducing this deficit drastically and is taking steps toward meeting these needs. Many states around the country are going into joint ventures with the private sector in a bid to bridge the housing deficiency. We are hopeful that many other states will follow.</p><h4>What trends do you observe in the Nigerian market in the segments you are in?</h4><p><span></span>FA Assets in the real estate industry in Nigeria are a proven wealth creator; however, the Nigerian real estate sector is far more difficult to operate in. For example, the Land Use/Act of 1978 vested ownership of all land in the hands of the state government. One has a right to use land for a maximum of 99 years, which makes it difficult to use land to leverage funds as a collateral, unless there is property on it. As a result, developers are unable to unlock the real estate market's potential. The second major challenge is the forfeiture law for a company with debts as it makes it difficult for banks to look at the real estate sector as a safe area for investment. Moreover, many of the land titles have not been registered, making it more difficult for investors. On the demand side, not many people can afford to buy a house. Elsewhere, one can invest in a building with a loan at 4-5% interest rate, rent it out at a yield of 10%, and make a 5% profit. But in Nigeria interest rates are about 25% and the maximum yield one gets is about 5-6%. Therefore, property in Nigeria is a liability unless one is using it for something else than renting it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do people need to know about your company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JOE</strong> Orji We started the firm together in 2015. Emmanuel and I recognized that each of our respective strengths and weaknesses complemented the other perfectly. I had worked in the real estate business for around 14 years prior to founding the company, nine of which were spent in the US and four in Nigeria. I worked primarily in commercial real estate. Emmanuel worked predominantly in consultancy and residential real estate, building hundreds of homes in Nigeria. We pooled our international knowledge to form Brookstone, a commercial real estate development company specializing in the development of a few different asset classes, including residential, retail, commercial office, real estate technology, and hospitality, the last of which is a space we are presently working on with our largest client, Landmark. </p><p><span></span><strong>ASHISH CHAUDHARY</strong> For structure, we source locally, and we have our steel factory. It is for our own projects but we also export, so it is a sister company under the group. Earlier, there were concerns regarding the quality of some raw materials, but Nigeria has been producing top-quality raw materials of late. As a result, steel imports have decreased considerably. Only for finishing, we need imports because the local market is not fully developed and cannot achieve the same quality as imported materials.</p><h4>How do you raise capital?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JO</strong> It depends. The first approach is to bring our own capital to the table, and we do this for different projects. The next approach is third-party capital, and this could be debt or equity. Frankly, we have never raised third-party debt, but that is always an option. The reason we have not is that equity is easier and, at times, cheaper, which is unique. In developed markets, equity is a lot more expensive than debt, but in Nigeria we can raise cheap equity. </p><p><span></span><strong>AC</strong> Initially, it was mostly investors that were buying for investing but due to the market and the quality of our project, we are seeing more end users who want to actually live in this space. We like this as they will be able to appreciate the efforts and quality we have put in the project. </p><h4>What does the luxury housing market look like in Nigeria?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JO </strong>The truth of the matter is that the economics of the housing market determines which projects get built. Developers will develop whatever they need to make money. Construction expenses are equally high regardless of whether you are working on a luxury or low-end project, and land prices are high regardless. This makes luxury projects, where income is substantially higher, a much better investment. </p><p><span></span><strong>AC</strong> Every market is different, and every country has different rules so they need to get used to it and manage it. We found it not too difficult because we have been in Nigeria for a long time. We found that doing business here is better in some ways and worse in others. In terms of actual legislation or regulations, it is not particularly clear how you should position yourself but it is getting better day by day. It is not a mature market in terms of luxury real estate, but some regulation needs to be introduced. </p><h4>What does the economic rebound mean for you?</h4><p><strong>EMMANUEL ATURETA</strong> During the upward period we are in now, we also must think of the housing types we should be constructing. Lagos is a city that thrives regardless of what the government does. We see a lot of young consumers who are interested in smaller units, which are not as available in the Lagos market. We are interested in looking into this segment further. As we grow, we are also interested in creating a trend toward monthly leasing agreements, which helps more people attain accommodations. </p><h4>What do customers in Nigeria want, and how can builders bring it into being?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AC </strong>The standards have been raised and what was high luxury in Nigeria is now considered medium luxury. Before, people only saw these kinds of projects abroad, but now international standards can be achieved in Nigeria. </p><p><span></span><strong>EA</strong> Affordable housing cannot be built using the same materials and technology that we are using now. However, the Nigerian market is so sensitive to new stuff that no one is going to purchase it until it is finished. This means that investment costs are high with no guarantee of recouping the money. Government partnerships would be one valuable way of getting past this issue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your major achievements in Nigeria?</h4><p><strong>LOLA KASSIM</strong> In 2014, Uber was already operating in about 140 cities across 40 countries. When we launched in Lagos, it became only the fourth city in sub-Saharan Africa. Since then, growth has been phenomenal in the sub-Saharan region, including west Africa. At present, Uber is operating in over 600 cities across more than 75 countries; specifically, in sub-Saharan Africa, Uber is present in 13 cities across six countries. Later in 2016, the company added Abuja to its Nigeria operations. Uber has made an impact in two major areas: helping to transform the way people get around and creating thousands of job opportunities. Equally important, Uber has brought safe, reliable, and affordable transportation to people in Lagos and Abuja. At present, there are around 9,000 driver partners across Nigeria, with more than 50% aged between 25 and 35. We are proud of our impact, as unemployment in this region is high, especially among youth.</p><p><span></span><strong>UCHE OKAFOR</strong> Our journey started in late 2016 and it was tough at the start because we had to bring the vision of a 19-year old Estonian and localize it to the Nigerian market. In two years, we have moved from a small brand to a USD1-billion company. What we did locally was find the balance between what passengers and drivers need. Passengers seek trips that are safe, reliable, and affordable, and drivers want to earn as much as possible. We have found one answer in our service commission. We take 15% commission off every ride, which is 10% less than what the competition takes. Another answer has been localizing our narrative and customer relations approach. We are also big on feedback. Our platform allows for a two-way feedback loop that we analyze and utilize in improving our internal process and training our driver partners. Overall, we have two priorities: fixing transportation and changing the way people move in cities where Taxify operates. Our driving force is to empower young people with jobs so they can support their families. </p><h4>What are the challenges of the Nigerian market?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LK</strong> Any company operating in the transportation space will face certain challenges in Nigeria, such as traffic congestion and less than optimal infrastructure. For tech-based companies, GPS and mapping, for example, pose particular challenges; however, this is also where we have the opportunity to improve our product and services to provide a seamless experience. Uber has been in Nigeria for four years, and growth has been amazing. What we need to focus on is the opportunities. Nigeria is full of creativity and adaptability in the face of challenges.</p><p><span></span><strong>UO</strong> The main challenge is infrastructure, as the roads are not as good as they should, which leads to congestion. In addition, mapping has been a challenge as the network infrastructure could be better. Technology relies on the app which takes GPS readings from devices, which in turn rely on the network infrastructure that unfortunately is susceptible to fluctuations. For those challenges within our control, we work every day through our driver trainings to instill good communications and customer service virtues in our driver partners and educate on best practices to deliver five-star service.</p><h4>What impact can ride-sharing companies have on Lagos' infrastructure and economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>LK</strong> Uber is a technology company that is keen to use technology to solve some of society's most urgent challenges. Lagos is a huge city and we need to seriously think about its transportation system. The beauty of our technology is in improving urban mobility to the point where people no longer feel the need to own a car. There are different ways of achieving this, such as our uberPOOL product, which means getting more people into fewer cars. This brings both fares and the number of cars on the road down. Globally we have been looking at other options such as smaller cars, motorcycles, and tricycles. We do not have these products in Nigeria, but these are the kinds of innovations we will continue to explore.</p><p><span></span><strong>UO</strong> Lagos is a congested city as the current infrastructure is inadequate. However, based on the on-demand model, one vehicle is able to service the needs of 100 people daily. This massively reduces the pressure on Lagos' existing infrastructure. We also have a far-reaching impact on job creation. In Lagos alone, we have created more than 10,000 jobs. Because of the low barrier to entry, unemployed and underemployed youth as well as people looking to augment their incomes can take advantage of the e-hailing economy to become their own bosses and provide for their families. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2018 for Lufthansa and the overall business environment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ROBIN SOHDI</strong> For Lufthansa, it was business as usual. We are still flying to three points: Port Harcourt, Lagos (then on to Malabo), and Abuja. Port Harcourt predominantly focuses on the oil and gas industry. As the seat of the federal government, the majority of the business in Abuja is either government-related or based on government contracts. All three points we fly into and out of in Nigeria also bring a portion of leisure business as well. Lagos is Nigeria's commercial hub, and Malabo, which is outside Nigeria, is related to the oil and gas sector. One thing I have learned about Nigeria is that irrespective of what happens, Nigerians travel. This is called visiting friends and relatives (VFR) traffic, and Nigeria has a huge global diaspora. There are two types of airline business that are considered to be consistent: the marine business because seafarers have to travel to join their vessel irrespective of any geopolitical scenario and the VFR business.</p><h4>Aero Contractors is the oldest carrier in Nigeria. Could you tell more about the history of the company?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CAPTAIN ADO SANUSI </strong>Aero Contractors began as a logistics company for the oil and gas sector nearly 60 years ago. Thereafter, the company transformed into an airline. There was a period, during the oil boom, when Aero Contractors was flying over 25 helicopters within the Gulf of Guinea, servicing not only the Nigerian market, but also west and central Africa. After the boom, the owners of the company decided to go into mainstream airline commercial services. They started with a fleet of 10 Boeing 737s. Unfortunately, during the devaluation of the naira, the airline encountered a major crisis in 2013. It was underperforming until the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) came in to rescue the company. We are currently in the process of stabilizing the entire company.</p><h4>How does Lufthansa maintain its competitive edge against other international airlines?</h4><p><strong>RS</strong> All the other carriers do not fly to more popular destinations because Lufthansa's network is the largest. We have an amazing product and reputation, along with a loyal passenger base. When flying from Lagos to Frankfurt, you would be lucky to see more than a handful passengers terminate their journey in Frankfurt because most of the passengers are going on to somewhere else. So, passengers are willing to fly with us because of a combination of product, fare, reliability, reputation, and brand. This is why we have some loyal Nigerian corporates as partners.</p><h4>What impact has AMCON had on Aero?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CAS </strong>AMCON's strategy was to stabilize the aviation sector. It came in to save the banks that granted loans to aviation companies and airlines. Since it realized it would not be easy for the company to repay its loans, AMCON converted the loans into 60% equity while the shareholders retained 40%. AMCON employed financial advisors to suggest ways to recapitalize the airline, brought in fresh investors, and diluted the shares that AMCON and the existing shareholders had. We expect this activity to be private-sector driven. AMCON will give the private sector and foreign investors the assurance that the government will stand behind the investment. Its intervention has gone a long way to stabilize the sector.</p><h4>What factors in Nigeria have had a negative impact on Lufthansa's operations?</h4><p><strong>RS </strong>All companies were suffering from repatriation issues during the forex crisis, but not now. All African airports are a challenge, and it is surprising how busy Lagos Airport gets. When there are three or four aircraft on the ground at once, immigration and baggage collection areas are packed. Customs clearance can take a long time, but that is the same in all airports. Nigeria is finally looking to devise an aviation maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) strategy. This will allow Nigeria to develop local skills and become a hub that services the aircraft of overseas airlines.</p><h4>How will your maintenance facility impact Nigeria's aviation sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>CAS</strong> It is a game changer. Airlines that take their aircraft out of the country for maintenance can now be accommodated locally. We recently completed the first C-Check of a 737-500, which was the first C-Check of its kind in Nigeria and western and central Africa. The main contributing factor of airlines going under in this part of the world is the lack of maintenance facilities. We sell tickets in naira but maintain aircrafts in dollars, so even when there is a devaluation, airlines cannot increase ticket costs to cover the gap. </p>]]></richbody0content>
