		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi is standalone for several reasons. First, while the common perception is that we are privately funded, this is not the case. We are a government-funded university, though the Sorbonne Abu Dhabi does have complete autonomy over the management of its degrees in accordance with UAE law. Second, while there are approximately 90 foreign universities in the country, 70 of these are American. We remain the only French university, as well as the only one that delivers a degree from Paris, not locally. We are not a branch, nor do we export the name of our university; rather, we operate the university under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education. We are proud to participate in diverse international ecosystem of UAE's education, especially when the country plays a leading role internationally not only in the sphere of business, but also diplomacy. We are now at 1,600 graduates, of whom 30% are Emiratis, but we also welcome students from around the world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>INSEAD's programs can be divided in two: degree programs, such as the MBA, and executive education. Within our degree programs we offer a full-time MBA and an executive MBA. The average age of full-time MBA students is 28 years old, and for executive MBA participants it is 39. The executive MBA program is geared toward those already at a high level of responsibility. When it comes to executive education, there are two types. We have company-specific programs, where the client is an organization and we design a customized program based on their needs. We cover the full spectrum of what an organization might need in terms of internal development. The other type of executive education consists of open enrollment programs, in which the client is not a company but an individual participant. Participants are often sponsored by their company as part of their professional development. In open-enrollment programs we impose a diverse criteria by industry type, geography, and other factors, to generate a plurality of voices in every class.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>ADSM was launched with a focus on innovation and entrepreneurship in alignment with Vision 2030. In addition to having premier education and infrastructure, another of the pillars of Vision 2030 is to have a healthy and robust private sector. Entrepreneurship is the engine that fuels the private sector, and from the outset our strategy was to come up with an educational institution that would promote and help people understand the elements of entrepreneurship and develop their skills to become better entrepreneurs. We focused firstly on graduate education because there are already many undergraduate universities and colleges in Abu Dhabi that are doing a great job. Our idea was to add value rather than compete. Thus, we launched a successful MBA program, and added a master's of science in quality and business excellence and a master's of science in leadership and organizational development. In Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE, we want not just excellent leaders, but to develop the capacity of organizations, as well as business quality and excellence.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do your role and responsibilities contribute to the preparation of the Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi 2019 and the establishment of a solid legacy of social inclusion of people of determination through sport activities? </h4><p><span></span><strong>TALAL AL HASHEMI</strong> Special Olympics UAE was founded in 1990 and is dedicated to serving athletes of determination through sports. My role involves developing and conducting a high-quality year-round program of sports training, competitions, athlete's leadership, and healthy athletes, for children and adults of determination. The Special Olympics UAE team works closely with the UAE athletes on a day-to-day basis to ensure they are getting the most out of their involvement with the program. The UAE plays a leadership role in expanding Special Olympics activity throughout the Middle East and North Africa region. Abu Dhabi hosted Special Olympics ninth MENA Games 2018, the third time it has hosted the regional Games. The 2018 edition was the most 'unified' in the history of the Special Olympics MENA, with inclusive teams featuring athletes with intellectual disabilities playing alongside athletes without intellectual disabilities in basketball, tennis, table tennis and football competitions. Through our hard work, we have ensured we have a team participating in all disciplines at the upcoming World Games. We recently recruited our first athlete who will represent the UAE in Tennis, which means the UAE is now taking part in every sports discipline. Special Olympics programming is being introduced through the nation's expanded educational and rehab facilities that allow many athletes to participate in sports and fitness activities and many other empowering programs. Once the World Games are over, Special Olympics UAE will continue its work with the thousands of people of determination it currently works with and ensure they have access to sports training, competitions, and leadership programs around the world.</p><p><span></span><strong>TALA AL RAMAHI</strong> Developing a legacy for the Games means that we work on projects, programs, research and Games-time events that will promote inclusion and empower people with intellectual disabilities. We do so through partnerships with international organizations such as Special Olympics International, and federal and local governmental institutions, in addition to NGOs and the private sector. Part of my role is working on the Community and Legacy Committee. As part of the program, we have kicked off a representative comprehensive survey of people with intellectual disabilities in eight countries in the MENA region. This piece of research will provide the first true baseline of data and insight on people with intellectual disabilities in the region. Leading up to the games, we kicked off Walk Unified and Cycle Unified, two community programs with a simple premise—to get people with and without disabilities to walk and cycle together. These programs have grown into a national movement, and hopefully will become the norm in the UAE and beyond. We will also be commissioning public art pieces to commemorate the games and celebrate the value of inclusion and to raise awareness of people with intellectual disabilities through the arts. We hope to promote inclusion through pairing a person with intellectual disabilities with an artist in order to create a public art piece. Creating change through education will play a big role in the Legacy Program. The UAE aims to engage 100,000 youth through Special Olympics. We are currently working with education organizations to incorporate content on disabilities, inclusion, and Special Olympics into school curriculums. We hope to eventually incorporate the values of Special Olympics into the school curriculum of every single public and private school in the country. The games will serve as a platform to increase understanding, tolerance, and inclusion throughout the nation and region.</p><h4><span></span>What is the strategic framework for the organization of the Special Olympics 2019, and what are the key areas of focus?</h4><p><span></span><strong>KHALFAN AL MAZROUEI</strong> The overall framework is clear and is focused on delivering a strategy and vision for the most unified Games in the history of Special Olympics. Taking place under the patronage of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE's Armed Forces, the Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi 2019 is an integral part of local, national, and regional plans to expand opportunities for people of determination in line with Abu Dhabi and the UAE's shared vision of a unified and inclusive society. A local organizing committee (LOC) has been formed to bring together talent and knowledge from within the UAE, around the region and internationally. The LOC works alongside Special Olympics International to develop and deliver a strategy as we progress towards the World Games. LOC has several key functional areas that are vital to the smooth running of the World Games, with experts working across each of these areas. Some of these areas include sport, ceremonies, community, and health, amongst others.</p><h4>What is the hardest aspect of your role in the Special Olympics?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TAH</strong> We really want to educated people on the Special Olympics value of participation as opposed to focusing on winning—this is something that is unique about Special Olympics in comparison to other Olympic games. We recognized that we may face challenges in our ambition to find athletes to compete in every Special Olympics sport, so we devised a plan to introduce athletes to sports they may not have experienced, but had affinities with their interests, for example indoor and outdoor swimming.</p><p><span></span><strong>TAR</strong> With any project of this scale, the sheer amount of work to be done is challenging but working on the games is a hugely rewarding experience. Ensuring that we are meeting our ultimate objective of creating long-term change across the region by working with entities and partners to ensure the correct policies are put in place for people of determination to be able to succeed is a huge task, but we are determined to do it.</p><p><strong>KAM</strong> The major challenges are two-fold—infrastructure and understanding. Abu Dhabi is already a major sporting destination and hosts the Abu Dhabi Formula One each year along with other world-class events, so we just need to work with the skills that are already here and adapt them to the World Games. The public's awareness and understanding about what the World Games represents has massively improved since Abu Dhabi held the IX MENA Games in March 2018. This has helped to bring both the public and private sectors together in understanding what the World Games is all about. The IX MENA Games also provided us with a 'practice run' ahead of the World Games—many lessons were learned, and we have updated our strategic plan to ensure that we do not face the same problems as the World Games.</p><h4>What are main lessons can be taken away from the experience of hosting the Special Olympics World Games Abu Dhabi 2019? </h4><p><span></span><strong>TAH</strong> Working as a Special Olympics National Director in a World Games host country is a unique opportunity—particularly with this being the first time that a World Games is hosted in the Middle East. Seeing the athletes develop as they prepare for the World Games in their home country is incredibly rewarding. We get to see first-hand not only their sports skills improve, but how their confidence improves and all areas of their life become much more positive due to Special Olympics. We also get to see their families' reaction to their development and how proud they are—Special Olympics changes the lives of so many people across the UAE. Prior to my roles with Abu Dhabi Sports Council and Special Olympics UAE, I was a goalkeeper for Al Ain Football Club, so I have a unique understanding of how much it means to all of the athletes participating in the World Games to represent their country and interact with athletes from all over the world.</p><p><span></span><strong>TAR </strong>The main lesson has to be meeting so many talented and inspiring athletes and hearing the stories of how Special Olympics has impacted their lives first-hand. I have learnt so much about the power of sport and had the opportunity to witness how it can break down boundaries and help to create a more unified nation. I've learnt that as a society, we have an obligation and national duty to provide people with disabilities with the right platform and opportunities for them to flourish and be an integral part of our nation-building process. This is what Special Olympics was about—it began as a sporting movement but has grown to become so much more because of the doors it has opened for our athletes. I am looking forward to seeing how the Legacy projects we are working on evolve over the next six months and how they will have an impact after the games.</p><p><span></span><strong>KAM</strong> The idea that Abu Dhabi should host the World Games was a government initiative. There was firm backing from the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Court as a key stakeholder in the bid for the Special Olympics—having strong government support from the host nation for a World Games is critical. The inclusion and integration of citizens and residents with special needs is a priority for the UAE leadership and is backed by legislation and comprehensive support for people with disabilities of all types, and their families. As well as working closely with government entities, outreach to local communities is key. We want to use such events to create a conversation that includes people of determination and that educates the public on not only their needs, but also how they can contribute to society. We want to build a more tolerant and inclusive society for every single person of determination in this region and around the world through all of the activity leading up to the Games as well as the actual Games. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have undertaken many landmark projects such as the Louvre, Memorial Park, and Etihad Towers. In Abu Dhabi, 67% of income is generated from non-oil activities, and a major part of this percentage comes from companies, business, and trading. If we wish to see this further improve, we have to encourage companies to grow. To this end, we merged with Terra Viva, an Italian company that is involved in artifacts and traditional methods. Its major market is the US, and it shifted here from Italy and operates within Al Hashem to reduce costs. The merger is a success as we are distributing products to more than 25 showrooms in the US; we also have businesses in the UK and Germany. We have other expansion plans in place. At present, we are quoting projects in Saudi Arabia and working on two projects in Mecca, namely the Hilton and DoubleTree. These will be landmark projects for Mecca.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The company's first factory was established with six employees in 1984. At present, we have six factories, four in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai. We are constructing another factory in the Khalifa Port Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (Kizad), but it is currently on hold because of a downward trend in Abu Dhabi's market and the company not getting the necessary approvals to run the factory in Kizad and ship to Dubai. Over the years, we have constructed many landmark buildings, including the 2,200-villa Al Falah Complex, 1,000 villas for the Emirati Housing Development, Jumeirah Beach Residence, six buildings in Downtown Burj Dubai, Dubai Mall, Abu Dhabi's Presidential Palace, and Terminal Three at Abu Dhabi Airport. Our current projects are the Midfield Terminal and all the approaches for Abu Dhabi Airport. We operate in all the Emirates and in Saudi Arabia, where we are doing quite a big project in Mecca. Moreover, we have done some work in Qatar and Kuwait and are exploring the idea of expanding into Algeria, Nigeria, India, and Iran.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The construction business goes through cycles that last five years on average. At present, we are at the end of the cycle, meaning there will an uptrend in 2019. As a specialized industrial contractor, we see the region encouraging industry and foreign industrial investment. Most of our business lies in special economic zones such as the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi and Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, as well as in other Emirates' zones such as Jebel Ali, Dubai Solar Park, and Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority. With oil prices stabilizing, we expect the overall situation to improve even more. In construction, 60-70% of our resources depend on human capacity, which is our main asset. It is important to us to manage well during downturns so that we can maximize our results during highturns. Steel is a cornerstone of our construction business, and we have developed other associated industries in the UAE, MENA, and Africa. Another important asset is technology, and we are integrating automation and enterprise resource planning, which is now essential for any company's operations.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Whilst insurance penetration is still relatively low in the UAE and Gulf region as a whole, the insurance industry is starting to be recognized in this part of the world as a key growth contributor. As both individuals and corporations become more aware of the benefits of insurance, the market will start to grow and mature in the coming years. AXA Insurance has been in the region for more than 65 years. In that time, we have built a sustainable business with strong foundations, which we and the AXA Group are very proud of. Our vision, both here and throughout the AXA Group, is to empower people to live a better life, a large ambition that requires significant dedication from our side. First and foremost, we must bring the most relevant and innovative insurance practices to this market. We are at an advantage, as we belong to the AXA Group and have at hand a wealth of resources and talent from every corner of the globe to do so, and ensure it is right for this region.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Most insurance companies did well in 2017, and part of the reason is because of the new regulations in the market. We are moving from an unregulated market to one that has excellent regulations from the Insurance Authority. In the past, insurance companies were free to invest their assets wherever they wanted to, but this has changed. Now there is a ceiling on how much we can invest in bonds, equities, properties, and so forth, both inside and outside the country. Moreover, insurance companies also have to use an actuary to price their products for all classes of underwriting every six months. This pricing, which has to be seen by the board of directors, will mean that eventually the market will be based on performance. This does not eliminate another major challenge we face, which is the fact there are more than 60 insurance companies in the market, making it saturated. Consolidation is one solution; however, raising the minimum capital requirement could be a more realistic solution to reduce the number of players. With minimum prices set, all companies now offer similar prices, and customers should distinguish between good and bad insurers based on service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The number-one issue in the insurance industry is that customers do not trust their insurers. They do not trust them to pay a claim, and they feel like it will be a hassle to get the claim paid out. Insurance companies also do not trust their customers because they are always wary of fraud. We believe blockchain will solve that. It creates authenticity and trust. Additionally, we will use smart contracts that will not be transferable, and they speak only to the specific client's needs and do not require signatures. We will not have to manually check records anymore. Everything will cost significantly less as well. That is why we want to be the first to implement this. Agents will be obsolete, and chat bots and automated call center operations will become the new norm. We make it an attractive product and pull people in without using agents. We need to sell with a combination of IT, big data, analytics, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. We believe we need data and IT specialists for the future, not financial experts. The final piece is R&amp;D. I always push people to think about innovation.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are in an extremely exciting time in terms of technology, especially as marketers. Technology allows for improvement through immediate feedback whereas before, brands had to rely on focus groups, surveys, and questionnaires to improve services. Today, artificial intelligence (AI), whether it is via chatbox or facial recognition, allows brands to assess consumers' real interests and reactions. Another major benefit brought by technology is time saving. A firm will be able to gather more data and push the line that drives greater interests, resulting in growing the top-line and reducing costs. With technology, advertisers can also better track how well their messages and campaigns reached their target audience. We can do more testing via digital platforms and other technological tools and save our clients' money on marketing. In this way, AI can turn marketers into more proactive planners and include them more in the development of a product. In Abu Dhabi, the government is keen to empower technological change in a number of industries, such as fast-moving goods, banking, real estate, and leisure. It is interesting for communication experts to follow those changes and identify new opportunities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Early 2018 saw high local demand projected at 320,000 tons of steel rebars a month by Emirates Steel, which controls the market and sets the price monthly. Emirates Steel can produce up to 180,000 tons, while the remainder will be covered by other mills and imports mainly from Oman at the moment. The key drivers of the economies of GCC countries are the oil and gas and petrochemical sectors. After a slowdown in the last few years, the government has sought to diversify its sources of income by investing in other areas. Now that the price per barrel has stabilized, ADNOC is investing in further projects, showing there is more capital to be invested in infrastructure upgrades or lighthouse projects that benefit everyone. This creates a multiplier effect, and the private sector will follow from this development, including the steel industry. The oil price in June is a positive signal, and I remain optimistic about the long run. Indeed, it takes some lead time until the effects are felt in the steel industry, as the project development phase does not need steel.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As a comprehensive university, we have research strengths in multiple areas: IT security and data analytics, environment and public health, accounting and other business fields, social sciences, and innovations in education and other fields. As we have this expertise, we look for partners who share similar specializations. We have around 250 research projects annually in these fields, and around two-thirds of these are in collaboration with international research partners. In addition, there are a number of contract research projects funded by government agencies for specific objectives. The learning outcomes of Zayed University are based on a core comprising of the skills to be learned by all and are modeled after 21st century skills. They include critical thinking, communication, and leadership skills, as well as technological awareness and knowledge of relevant IT tools. We also have student councils for clubs and training programs. Students learn though experiences; thus, the quality of the learning experience is important. Thus, we encourage students to apply their skills in classroom projects and the wider community through volunteerism and other activities outside the campus.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Emiratization is a challenge for every player in the private sector. The private sector does not offer the same benefits and privileges that the public sector does. Nonetheless, AECOM offers many apprenticeships for which we try to attract young Emiratis to apply. We actively participate in university job fairs, engaging with students from the higher colleges of technology, the UAE University, and American University of Sharjah, to name a few. We have also pushed forward with attracting talent through job fairs in the Omani market, where we have had a higher rate of success. Furthermore, despite female empowerment being on top of our agenda, we still find it difficult to attract Emirati females and incorporate them in leadership positions. This is mainly because of different cultural commitments and flexibility requirements, which we would be happy to accommodate.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Government and semi-government entities remain the focal point in the Emiratization process. The programs offered by ADNOC, ADNOC-OPCs, Etisalat, Mubadala, and many others attract most of the talented Emiratis with  several incentives including competitive salaries, trainings, and career development. It goes without saying that the private sector cannot match such offering; however, we should focus on vocational training and schools. We can create a new segment for Emiratization. The UAE's Emiratization strategy does not pose a threat to the foreign talent attraction, as the total Emirati workforce is less than 10% of the overall population in the UAE. The main challenge lies in the methodology to attract local talent and developing their skill-sets to work in the private sector while maintaining the sector's competitiveness.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Developing national talent is a mandate for all federal entities, and every year TRA invests in its employees by providing the necessary training to boost employees' skills and knowledge, resulting in a high-caliber workforce. At the same time, technology is evolving rapidly, causing more challenges in the telecom sector when it comes to looking for suitable national candidates. The UAE government is striving toward a smart government and AI, leading to a great deal of investments taking place to provide a better lifestyle in the working environments and creating high-quality infrastructure for all sectors, not only telecoms. We are proud to be part of this journey and have such experts and high-performing employees in our entity.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The UAE is ranked third in terms of the number of visitors coming to Seychelles after France and Germany. In terms of our country's GDP, tourism accounts for 26%. There has been a large amount of investment in tourism by the UAE as well; Four Seasons is an Emirati investment. Currently, there are 28 flights per week from the UAE by carriers Emirates and Etihad. There is a great deal of investment by the UAE into Seychelles. We have also benefited from grants from the UAE government to help support our military and defense, medical care in hospitals, and in schools. All of this has been a huge investment coming from this part of the world. Africa and the Middle East need to partner. It is one thing to have the business; it is another to have the logistics to distribute, export, or import the business. Those logistics are key for economic development. On the other hand, Africa brings agriculture to the table. There is a huge potential in terms of agriculture and mining. If we can concentrate on the partnerships, both continents can benefit from one another. It is a win-win situation. In addition, digitalization has happened faster in Africa than in many countries. There is always something to learn from every country, no matter their level of development.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The cooperation between the UAE and Mali recently experienced a boost that was underlined by the visit to Mali by Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the UAE. This fruitful visit resulted in the signing of a number of MoUs to strengthen bilateral relations. It has helped put in place a number of agreements, including a number of MoUs between the governments of Mali and the UAE, covering areas such as security, diplomacy, economy, trade, culture, and sports. One of these agreements was around investment protection to create favorable conditions for investment in both the countries, increase cooperation in the private sector, and stimulate growth and job creation. Furthermore, a convention aiming to prevent double taxation and tax evasion with respect to income taxes was signed. Those conventions are a means of strengthening relations between the two countries in all areas. The UAE and Mali also signed an MoU to exempt citizens from visas to visit the other country, reflecting the strength of the relationship between our two countries. Mali and the UAE have always enjoyed several regional and international common interests, as proven by the many trade exchanges between our countries.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Botswana has had bilateral dealings with the Middle East, although trade volumes could definitely be higher. If there is a market somewhere, we should penetrate it and discover the nuances, tailoring our products to the taste of the market. When I became President, I sought to continue to run an open society and environment. We have tried to educate our people, and our literary levels are high, though our skill levels remain low. When compared to the region, we are advanced on this front, though we are still not satisfied, as globally speaking our skills are lacking. This too has impacted our global trading footprint, as skills are vital for communicating with the international community at a basic and business level. In this sense, it would be beneficial to emulate the way the UAE and other countries have successfully built on their education policies to ensure skills are prioritized above all. We see trade and investment relations shifting away from Northern America and Western Europe, and Botswana is responding to that, not by excluding our previous trade partners, but by widening our portfolio. Developing countries should take advantage of the opportunities that are becoming available with a shrinking world and replicate successful policies and practices of countries like the UAE, which is actively engaging with global economic powers in the East.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We looked at a number of locations including Lebanon, Qatar, and the UAE, for our campus. Abu Dhabi had many things going for it in terms of stability, global connectivity, and a quality policymaking environment for us to engage with. The partnership with Abu Dhabi has worked well for us in many ways, allowing us to remain fully independent, which in turn allows us to make the greatest contribution we can to the country: developing a top-tier business school with a global reach based in the UAE, supporting the country's long-term strategy for sustainable economic value creation as a global hub. The Middle East has challenges; however, it will be incredibly important in the next 50 years, due to the expected economic growth and even just in terms of sheer demographics. Our presence here is consistent with our mission: business should be a force to build bridges between people and cultures and bring prosperity, employment, and stability. We are here because Abu Dhabi is a strong base for us to position a global and regional hub.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>DNOC has plans to adapt the best practices of IOCs, which is extremely positive as far as Total is concerned. We have always had great relationships with ADNOC, and the traditional split between NOCs and IOCs and their strategies is now narrowing. Therefore, it will be much easier to work toward common goals. For example, ADNOC will now look at the economic advantage of each project, which was not how it operated in the past. As an IOC, we have to look at the economics, and this means working together will become more productive as we will give more. It is opening partnerships not only upstream, but also downstream and across the petrochemicals value chain. Abu Dhabi, in a few years' time, will thus be transformed by the new ADNOC and by new relationships between the different IOCs and ADNOC. Total has been here since 1939, and we have the largest footprint in the country, with partnerships not only in oil, but also in gas, solar, and desalination. This means we can expand our partnerships in other areas as well.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The largest factors in the success of the UAE's logistic sector have been the commitment, consistency, and size of investments in ports, airports, roads, and, in the last few years, rail. Sizable expansions come every year, which demonstrates why the UAE has been ranked among the top-three most attractive markets for logistics over the past four years according to the Agility Emerging Market Logistics Index 2018. The index takes three factors into consideration, and one of them is market size, on which the UAE cannot be compared to India, China, and other emerging markets, making our ranking all the more impressive. The two other factors, market connectedness and market compatibility, are truly where the UAE shines. Transport and logistics is a key sector, and while there may be some delays, the government has signaled just how serious it is in terms of investing in this sector. We are extremely bullish about the opportunities in the market, particularly the entrance of COSCO and MSC. It will bring in larger volumes and attract more companies. Trade will significantly increase, and operators and cargo will continue to flock to the UAE.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Japanese party of the joint venture originally had a similar, 40-year-old plant that closed down because of the volatile nature of the activity. As we wanted to set up an infrastructure abroad, the choice fell on an oil-rich country in the Gulf for several reasons. The Middle East used to be crucial for the Japanese pipe industry market, although now Indian companies have a stronger position, replacing most of our customers. Second, we looked at economic and political stability, which Gulf countries are blessed with. Then, research showed that the two biggest countries for pipes demand were Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In making the final decision to set up in KIZAD, we looked at tax regimes and incentives, opting for Abu Dhabi, which almost single-handedly plays the leading role in the oil and gas industry among the other Emirates. In 2012 and 2013, KIZAD had just opened and its location is logistically viable. With the support of the Japanese government, which was keen to maintain strong ties with the second-largest exporter of oil and gas to Japan after Saudi Arabia, we established excellent relations with Senaat.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In summer, while King Salman and Prince Mohammed Bin Salman are in the western provinces of the Kingdom, the InterContinental Jeddah usually runs the operation with a high occupancy, with 2018 performing even slightly above 2017. However, in terms of the outlook for the remainder of 2018, we expect a drop from the beginning of September due to the departure of the Royal family back to Riyadh. Business in 4Q2018 will be driven mainly by corporate business, where I expect the average occupancy for Jeddah hotels to be around 60%. Around 75% of our valued guests are from GCC countries, with the others coming from around the world, mainly Europe, Asia, and North America. Guests of the InterContinental are considered luxury business travelers who have high expectations of brand standards, services, and facilities. InterContinental has decades-long experience in ensuring that its guests enjoy not only the InterContinental Jeddah, but also the almost 200 InterContinental hotels around the world in 65 different countries.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Rafa has two brands, Rafa and Rafa Home, with Rafa focusing on the premium segment of the market. Rafa Home roughly translates to a two-star hotel residence, while Rafa is four star. In Riyadh, we have seven facilities, mostly located in the north. Several of these aparthotels are located next to universities, and our target is to get the most of the travelling academic staff. Both Rafa and Rafa Homes are equipped with modern furniture and are to the latest standards. We provide both short- and long-term leases and are open to tourist travelers as we expect more to come. In September 2019, we aim to open our Dubai facilities, two towers overlooking the canal. One of the towers will be for holiday homes and the other will be a five-star hotel. In Dubai, we operate under the name Durar Properties and the tower will be called J ONE.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our hotel in recent months has witnessed positive growth in RevPar supported by occupancy driven by corporate and long stays. We are the number-one choice for corporate businesses seeking a five-star hotel and services at competitive prices. Growth will continue, and we expect a healthy and promising 4Q2018 in general due to our competitive advantage as we are the closest to Aramco. We have the biggest rooms in town. We are also the preferred choice for long-staying guests, weekenders, and leisure travelers. Our brand Crowne Plaza is a great advantage, as it can easily compete with upper-scale business categories. According to market research, I believe the area is in need of the Crowne Plaza brand, which delivers different meeting and conference facilities. True hospitality and luxury is in the emotion and at Crowne Plaza Al Khobar, we are keen to create highly energized teams that are empowered and consumed to provide our guests a memorable experience and leverage their talents to deliver an extremely outstanding result.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Dur Hospitality is one of the Kingdom's leading hospitality firms with a history spanning some 42 years. We are committed to supporting the government's ambitious tourism targets, which present exciting opportunities for the hotel industry, and are therefore expanding our portfolio of properties to cater to both the non-religious and religious tourism sectors. Our Makarem Hotels brand is rising to the vision's challenge of attracting 30 million Umrah visitors by 2030. It delivers a unique style of spiritual hospitality, fulfilling the changing needs of local and international guests. We are also renovating the Makarem Ajyad Makkah Hotel near the Holy Mosque and expanding Makarem Ajyad Makkah. Besides, we are developing properties in key destinations where domestic and international tourism is expected to boom, working in partnership with some of the world's leading hotel operators.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We started with one outlet, and our focus was on making our quality standards the highest and having quality as our main differentiator. We looked at the supply chain from the start and developed our operations, system, and cooking chain from scratch with the help of consultants. We transitioned away from traditional systems to a modern and systematic way. In the beginning, we did not expand quickly because we wanted to focus on the operations and systems, the methods of cooking, and our menu. We are true pioneers of cooking traditional food via modern methods. We built up our technique through trial and error, seeking to cook traditional food in a modern and systematic way. We apply the LEAN system for our operations, which helps cut down on preparation time and food waste. Furthermore, we have received ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 certifications and, in 2018, we will also apply for ISO 19000. As a result of applying these systems, especially the LEAN system, we can prepare orders quicker than before and have the entire chain supply set up to improve our overall operations. It was a great step in this field and we are the first to implement such a system.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We try to lead the market with a Saudi brand that we are franchising. Preferably, we would like to not own a single store but instead support the brand with stores all around the world. In 2008, we started with Steaky, a boutique steakhouse with a limited menu of high-quality food. We focus on casual dining where we provide excellent steaks at reasonable prices. In 2011, we decided to spin off with Burgy. The first store was a franchise. Following our global research, we realized that the concept of franchising and investing in the brand, without being concerned with owning the stores, could be successful. For Burgy, we put all our efforts into the recipe, history, and branding of the burgers. We started with packaging, uniforms, operational and franchise manuals, and everything related to the concept itself. Today, we have 23 stores in six cities in Saudi Arabia: Riyadh, Al Qassim, Al Kharj, Tabuk, Hail, Al Hassa, and Al Khafji. Furthermore, we opened a joint venture in Casablanca and two stores in Cairo. With Steaky, we opened a restaurant in Dubai on Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard. We have many European customers who are surprised that it is a Saudi brand. They like the way we present our food.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Since our entry into the market in 2000, Starbucks has grown rapidly and has become the market leader in coffee. We have introduced a new culture of coffee to Saudi youths. Today, we have over 140 stores in locations across the country, of which 50 are located in shopping malls, 63 are spread across the city's prime locations, 10 are exclusive drive-through outlets, five are set within hospitals, eight are in the most popular travel destinations, and four are located in well-known educational institutions. Our growth is accelerating, powered by the strong support of Alshaya International Trading and the demand from young Saudis for great coffee in a welcoming environment. For more than 40 years, Starbucks has built its business with a social conscience and proven that doing what is right makes great business sense. Fundamentally, our brand and social impact agenda are inseparable. We were one of the first major companies to introduce Café Practices, which ensures that Starbucks sources sustainably grown and processed coffee by evaluating the economic, social, and environmental impact of coffee production. We have extended this approach into our neighborhoods, stores, and partner relationships, sharing a responsibility to give back to the communities we work with.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When Western concepts started to enter the Saudi market, we saw an opportunity to create our own concept, without depending on the rules of an international chain. We wanted to operate under Western standards, with clean restaurants, a nice environment, genuine friendly service, excellent food, and quality ingredients, but with our own choices and warehouse distribution services. Casual dining was the goal initially, and there has been significant growth in that area, because families like to go out in groups and relax in such an environment. Steak House was our household name in the first years, and by 2010 we had a dozen Steak House restaurants in all major cities. Together with Piatto, we are positioned in the casual- to upper-casual dining segment. Along the way, we have also expanded in the fast/casual segment, which is a global trend in between casual dining and fast food—priced roughly 30% below casual dining and 20-25% above fast food. This trend has exposed the need for more easily accessible quality food. In this segment, we have developed Fire Grill, Piatto Express, and City Fresh Kitchen. With a young population and millennials encompassing the majority, this will be a significant market in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Saadeddin is a pastry shop for high-quality Arab pastries, from high-quality raw materials, at a reasonable price. Aside from pastries, we produce cakes, sandwiches, and chocolates, all manufactured in house by experts. Saadeddin has been in the market since 1976, and has about 135 regular outlets and 18 kiosks (Saadeddin Express) in malls. We also focus on special occasions, like the two Eids, Ramadan, Mother's Day, National Day, and help people celebrate these special days. The company is present in the majority of Saudi cities and 90% of villages, and we have home delivery in these areas. Our production facilities are in Al Kharj area, where we produce cakes and chocolate for Saadeddin and other companies. Our pastries also go to other companies, like hypermarkets, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, and certain fast food chains. Furthermore, we operate a cheese factory together with our partners where we produce Turkish and Syrian-style cheeses, which we also use in our pastries and distribute in the market. Other white cheeses, like fresh mozzarella and halloumi, are also part of our menu. For cheese, we have a few retail shops, though we focus more on B2B.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We started off in 2002 with plots of 10,000sqm, and when we expanded to 20,000sqm, we adapted to speed up our operations. Our latest project measures 500,000sqm, and we work with Dammam Airport Company and its owner General Authority of Civil Aviation. We signed a three-year deal with them and view this as our new standard: building logistic zones and hubs with all kind of facilities. With e-commerce taking off, logistics zones will be the future. Already, the Saudi Post facilities have moved away from the city centers of Riyadh and Dammam to their respective airports. This is great for us because we have a large location in the airport and we can service companies such as Amazon, Noon, and Souq.com from there. Currently, in Saudi Arabia, e-commerce represents 15% of business and is expected to reach 32% by 2020, worth more than USD22 billion. This is great for us because companies will not need shops, but rather advanced warehouses. Our current project with Dammam Airport will take two to three years. Location is important for warehousing. In Jeddah, we have been looking at King Abdullah Economic City; however, our next project will be larger, with a similar vision in Jeddah. We have a large footprint and are thus able to work in different sectors. It will be interesting for us to execute our projects and weather the challenges. We have a great reading of the economy in warehousing and believe the outlook is positive.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>GSCCO was created in 1985 to provide Saudi Arabia with first-class port operations, and over the years, the company has grown significantly, becoming part of the Gulftainer Group in 2013. One of our major achievements has been reaching a total throughput milestone of 20 million TEUs at Northern Container Terminal (NCT), and this figure is projected to pass 25 million by YE-2018. Gulftainer is the largest port operator in the region and has a long tradition of working with port authorities in the UAE, Iraq, and Kuwait; expanding into Saudi Arabia was, therefore, a logical step. Jeddah and Jubail's geographical position, at the crossroads of the world's largest trade route, is of enormous added value. Jeddah is by far the largest seaport in the Red Sea, with NCT occupying an area of 1,075,000sqm, capable of accommodating 75,000TEUs. We are extremely grateful to the government for its drive to modernize and automate. GSCCO has been asked to be part of the pilot for the Single Payment Window project, an initiative by the Port Authority in conjunction with eTabadul, the country's e-government entity. In terms of future goals, GSCCO has two years left to run on its current concession. We are excited to have presented our plans to create deeper berths to accommodate larger vessels and increase capacity in terms of cranes, lifting equipment, and supporting equipment. This is in line with our desire to make Jeddah Port and Saudi Arabia a global hub. Therefore, 2018 will be a critical year for GSCCO.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, King Abdullah Port saw an increase of 21% YoY in terms of container volume from 1.4 million TEUs to 1.69 million TEUs. We are in a fortunate position because the Saudi Arabian market is underserved. The total movement of containers was only around 14 million TEUs before we arrived, and more than 30% of that was sourced outside of Saudi Arabia due to a lack of reliable capacity. Now, the Kingdom is entering a new era through Vision 2030. The intention is to encourage more exports and drive more growth internally, along with the growing population. As the eighth fastest growing port in the world, we have momentum on our side. Our growth will not slow down; we are already at 50% growth YoY as of June 2018. The Red Sea is one of the world's main arteries in global shipping, and traffic is growing rapidly especially with the exchange between East and West. Plans are underway to construct a new cargo train that connects King Abdullah Port to the rest of the country. We are extremely pleased with the initiatives that Saudi Customs is implementing, and together we have shortened average processing time from 14 days to only 4.5 days; our goal is to reach three days. The single-window approach is the global norm, and we have to offer a modern payment method to succeed. We want to shape the future; the overall direction of the country also supports digitalization, which will be the future of the competitive landscape.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our vision is for Saudi Arabia to become a manufacturer of military and commercial aircraft. Our goals are to have two manufacturers of passenger aircraft by 2035 and to build a local supply chain. During the Dubai Air Show in 2017, nine Saudi companies signed the MoU we initiated, committing to four major programs. The first concentrates on the establishment of aircraft structure manufacturing. The equipment we purchased can manufacture composite structures for drones, fuselage, and the Boeing Dreamliner 787. All aircraft manufacturers are switching to composite because it is light, fuel efficient, and has minimal wear and corrosion. Our second project was for light transport. The consortium started with the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of National Guard, Ministry of Interior, and Aramco. We chose Antonov over Boeing, Airbus, and Lockheed Martin because knowledge transfers are limited with large corporations. The program to develop the Antonov 132 started in May 2015 with around 50 engineers from Saudi Arabia working with Antonov engineers; the rollout of the aircraft was in December 2016 and the first test flights in March 2017. The third program is regarding Black Hawk helicopters with Lockheed Martin; Saudi Arabia wants to acquire a license from the US to produce and export it to other countries. The fourth program is with Chinese companies to manufacture UAV. This will allow us to acquire knowledge from three different schools, enabling us to increase the share of local defensive manufacturing from 2% to 50%.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our collaboration with StandardAero and GDC was the result of the need to meet the scope of Vision 2030, as well as the government's need to localize maintenance, repair, and overhauls (MRO). In March 2018, a major military manufacturing exhibition took place where the Ministry of Defense explained its requirements for spare parts in order to present opportunities for local companies. Most of the agreements and contracts with foreign companies call for some percentage of manufacturing facilities to be local or include a clause that Saudis will be trained to take over in a few years. The requirements for foreign companies have been made easier, and the government is doing its best to encourage investment. We have completed several projects with Royal Saudi Land Forces, starting with the development of a portable communication tower for the academy. Then, we began getting projects for the land force aviation fleet, including the Black Hawk, Bell Helicopter, and Schweizer. We recently signed an agreement with a big company that is specialized in UAV vehicles. There are strategic and specialized uses for UAVs, including geology and civil defense. There is also mapping and systems for fighting foreign UAVs; there are plenty of UAV manufacturers, but we prefer to be selective. Equally important is to develop local talent and academic institutes are offering programs for aviation manufacturing and maintenance, as well electronics related to aviation. The government is doing its best to attract young people into the field of aviation.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our focus is on military equipment and supplies, mobile field camps, kitchens and laundries, and field equipment. We import specialized equipment for the military; unlike the civilian industry, a business needs confirmed long-term contracts to meet its commitments in the defense and security industries. Corruption is one of the issues in this particular type of import business; for example, we do not import products from certain countries due to the lack of quality. In addition to supply, we also do maintenance work and provide spare parts. In order to achieve the localization goals defined by Vision 2030, we have to make sure we have the required raw materials; we need to source the raw materials from Saudi Arabia, and this includes labor and training. We also need to find excellent foreign partners that are ready and willing to invest here. Some of our suppliers are interested in investing in Saudi Arabia but only after the local market matures. There is potential for Rawadef Trading to be advisors and marketeers for manufacturers that decide to invest here. For us, it is extremely important that we provide excellent after-sales service to maintain our solid reputation. There were 45 companies in the sector around five years ago compared to only around 12 now. Nonetheless, the future is bright because the Crown Prince supports the elimination of corruption. Any change like Vision 2030 needs time, and if we do not clean up the country, no one will want to come here and invest.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>While working for Advanced Electronics Company (AEC), I was a member of the team that executed the knowledge transfer of technologies while managing contracts. When Saudi Arabia purchased 73 F-15 aircraft and formed an agreement with AEC to manufacture some avionics in Saudi Arabia, I decided to set up Ezah; the market was worth more than SAR30 billion and needed more than 30 companies like AEC. Later, we collaborated with the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, the Saudi Arabian Royal Guard Regiment, and the Saudi Arabian National Guard, while also serving more than 300 companies such as Saudi Aramco and SEC. One of our specialties is to reverse engineer devices and fix them after they have been deemed obsolete by the manufacturer, with no spare parts on the market. We can currently produce 100-150 units per day, but our new facility will produce thousands of printed circuit cuts per day. In terms of government initiatives, Saudi Aramco's In-Kingdom Total Value Added has benefitted us immensely. We recently added the OSHAS 18001 series and the ISO 14001 environmental management standards, but companies who want to work in manufacturing or technical support require European Cockpit Association approval and Federal Aviation Administration certification. We also formed a partnership with Denmark's Scandinavian Avionics, which has certificates for more than 3,000 aircraft parts to support different avionics for several types of aircraft and ground systems. Through such steps, we are helping to achieve some of the targets of Vision 2030.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>ERAF started in 2005 as a subsidiary of a holding that was primarily involved in defense supply and training. After many years of experience, we started manufacturing as two separate companies: ERAF Maritime for the navy and other maritime organizations, and ERAF Industrial for land vehicles. New developments in the industrial space take time, and it took us between 1.5 and two years to win contracts and expand into armored and military vehicles. Our range of operations cover land, naval, and weaponry systems such as building mine protected vehicles, mobile mortar vehicles, aluminum fast interceptor boats, and supplying and installing remote weapon stations. In order to build local capacity, we partnered with a Spanish company to build mobilized warfare systems. We have diversified our capabilities to be more in line with Vision 2030 by adding local manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, we partnered with a South African company to produce naval and land-based system in the Kingdom. At 40,000sqm, our factory is the largest private-sector military industrial facility in the country, and we have additional capacity of 8,000sqm for future expansion. Saudi Arabia is not known as a manufacturer of defense technologies because of past regulations and restrictions, but we hope new rules will change that. Private firms can provide 50% of the required defense manufacturing and reaching this target is a matter of building the proper manufacturing capabilities. These areas need their own domestic supply chains if they are going to reach their full potential; integration is key.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>All our seven production facilities are in Riyadh and have a specialized product line. The major one is adhesive tape, where our market share in Saudi Arabia is more than 21%. We produce both under our own Falcon brand name and under the American Abro brand, for which we have been the sole manufacturer in the GCC for the last 25 years. The second-biggest factory is for shade nets, where our market share exceeds 36%, making us the biggest manufacturer in the GCC. We also produce glue and have a factory for glue manufacturing for wood, paper, and paint. Our plastic factory is primarily focused on construction role and stretch film. The other two large factories focus on food packaging, which produces almost 5,000 tons per year, and polyvinylchloride (PVC), which is the only factory thus far in KSA. The PVC factory is primarily for pharmaceutical use. Other applications include smart cards for mobiles, IDs, banks, and so on as well as food packaging and containers that use PVC.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, we saw the chance to add more divisions, such as aerospace, to our mold division. We can do advanced precision machinery for aircraft manufacturing and serve the commercial and defense aviation industries. We are currently building our capability, getting certificates such as AS 9100, of which we are one of the few manufacturing companies with this certificate in the Kingdom. This certification was a great step to put us ahead of others in the market. In 2016, we formed a contract with BAE Systems, and there is great potential for more collaboration with it and other global defense firms, especially now that there are localization objectives to be met. In the last three years, we have been able to build an expert team of Saudi technicians and engineers through the support of expat colleagues from Germany, Australia, the UK, and other countries. The second thing is receiving assistance from the government, which mandates that international companies localize in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a Swiss construction chemical company and partner with Sumam here. We have been producing locally in Rabigh since 2011. We started with two lines, for concrete admixtures and powder-based products, and in 2016 commissioned a third line for resin products. In order to improve supply chain and reduce freight costs, in June 2018 we opened a new production site with a line for concrete admixtures in Dammam's second Industrial City, where we also have a warehouse and offices. Besides Rabigh and Dammam, we also have warehouses and offices in Riyadh and Jeddah and sales representatives all over the Kingdom. More than half of our revenue comes from locally made products. We are proud to meet all corporate quality requirements that would not be possible without highly professional local operations and R&amp;D. We always seek to increase the quality of our products and implement new technologies. We are constantly organizing application trainings for our customers in our training centers in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When we set up the company, there were only three cable manufacturers; therefore, we thought there was a gap in the market we could fill. Unfortunately, we were not the only company that noticed the market gap. Five other companies came onboard with us, which brought the total to eight manufacturers, and there was overcapacity. To counteract that we moved into 10 other factories that deal with other electrical goods, which we built parallel to Bahra Cables. We now manufacture steel pipes, cable management system, LV/MV Panels, switchgear, pallet racking system, PVC pipes, load centers, wiring devices, transformers, busways, busbars, and much more. We were working at full capacity until about 2016, and since then we have launched an aggressive export mode. We started with 1-2% in exports, and our target for 2018 is to reach 20-22%. Within a couple of years, we want 50% of our production to be exported. We are targeting the GCC, Africa, and Asia.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Alayed entered the industrial space in the 1980s and became a market leader in manufactured hoses during the 1990s. We are among the top four companies in the region, currently producing around 14 million meters a month. We supply the GCC, the Mediterranean, North Africa, the US, and Europe. We are the first producer of polyester DTY in Saudi Arabia. We produce for both local and major international clients in the UK, Spain, and Italy. In 2018, we started working on a new project that is currently capitalized at USD120 million but will potentially rise to USD180 million. It will be the first plant of its kind in the Middle East, the fourth-largest plant in the world by capacity, and the second-largest diversified product manufacturing space. This project is a large step forward for Saudi manufacturers focused on technical fabric and will create a strong platform for such textiles, helping Alayed to become an industry leader in Saudi Arabia, the region, and world.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Nesma &amp; Partners has been in the contracting business for almost 40 years. We started as a civil and building construction company. We explored new possibilities over the years and succeeded in developing our capabilities and extending our specialties into electrical, mechanical, and the oil and gas sectors. Flexibility is a great thing about Nesma &amp; Partners. We have proven ourselves as one of the few contracting companies in the region that built its own strong foundations in business to perform various types of projects and complete across the whole spectrum of the construction industry. We developed ourselves as a trustworthy contractor in the region, working considerably with well-known repeat clients such as SABIC, Maaden, and Saudi Aramco in oil and gas projects executing refineries; gas, oil, and separation plants; and other downstream facilities. We have also developed our capacity in executing civil and building projects. Our projects in this area vary from small to mega projects, hotels, hospitals, shopping centers, and so on.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our core business remains construction and project management. We work with the main players to develop lands into projects. We have several new projects coming up, and there are some interesting projects we are working on. It takes us six to eight months between the time we start an idea until it is implemented. If all these projects go well, we will see them starting in 2019. It takes time to do the design and conduct feasibility studies. We focus on the private sector, which is in line with Vision 2030. However, in the construction and development cycle, there is not much happening in terms of privatization. Also in line with the Vision, cities such as Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina will prosper. We are doing a project next to the metro station. Once the metro is operational, this land could be extremely valuable. Once we better understand the traffic flow, then we will get sub-developers to develop a few pieces of land. There could be new hotels or other projects in the next 10-year cycle.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Bakheet started in the construction business more than 45 years ago. We were initially contractors for government projects, including the Islamic University of Medina, a project to renovate and expand Quba Mosque, and government schools. Subsequently, many competitors entered the construction business in Medina, and we looked at new opportunities. We started to sell cement mixers imported from the Netherlands and added larger equipment, such as the Schwing brand of concrete pumps from Germany. We also acquired the dealership for earth-moving equipment and excavators from the Japanese brand Kobelco. About 15 years ago we started to sell all types of road equipment for the Wirtgen Group. We have a cranes business with Link-Belt Cranes from the US. We also work with many other brands in our light equipment business. Bakheet now has nine branches in the Kingdom. Our main branches are in Jeddah, Dammam, Abha, Riyadh, and Medina. We have other smaller branches that just cover spare parts for our customers.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have a great name in the market for our niche projects. Our strength is our ability to do extremely technical, highly sophisticated, and complex buildings. We have been working at King Khalid University since 2009; we have five different contracts there that have continued one after another. We have worked on several different contracts for Aramco, including the Rabigh Petrochemical project, and a housing project in east Dammam. We also completed the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture in Dhahran and a project for Aramco at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. Saudi Arabian Baytur has a strong footprint in the Mecca area as well; we are building Jabal Omar Phase Two for 1,100-keys, five-star hotels. We are already in line for newly announced megaprojects as well. We have started to receive statements of interest and so forth for the Red Sea Project. We are working on another project in the same region as the NEOM project, and thus are already mobilized in that area.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The market has started to reshape itself with all the changes made by the government. Everything that is taking place is the foundation for going forward on the Kingdom's 2020 and 2030 visions. It is not just a vision, but a vision being put into practice. The land fee structure is something I have been calling for since 2006. This controls the value of land and puts a stop to the incredible price hikes that happen where people use land as a commodity. Land is not a commodity; it is where one develops solutions for society in terms of housing, agriculture, and administration. Hence, the regulation serves the Kingdom well. There has already been an impact. The tax ascribed according to the structure we recommended is perfect. If a plot of land does not have sewage networks, water networks, electric power generation, police services, fire brigade, or civil defense within its immediate vicinity, they are exempt 5%. So if a parcel has a neighboring parcel that is SAR1,000 per sqm and has all these services and the original parcel has none, it is likely exempt 85-90%, which is only fair. There are only 2,400 people affected under the first phase of the land fees, and phase one targets undeveloped parcels that are 10,000sqm or more, whereas in Phase II 10,000sqm of developed land will be included and is meant to start in the coming months.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The two stakeholders of Kaden have vast experience in real estate development that we can now capitalize on for our projects. Tatweer built the Al Nakhla compound, the largest and most luxurious gated community in the country, and Business Gate Complex, an office space innovative ecosystem. Also, Pan Kingdom is a large player in the cement and steel industry, in addition to infrastructure and project development. Another synergy can be found in logistics. Logistics are a complete solution including service, infrastructure, and rules and regulations. The last are provided by the government while service and infrastructure are typically provided by the private sector. We have announced our logistics park, the first project in Saudi Arabia that will provide the infrastructure and a complete solution for investors. Most of the warehouses in Saudi Arabia are small-scale, without any master development. We are changing this, and are starting with 1 million sqm as a pilot project. It will be an integrated solution: a gated community with security, property management, facility management, and warehousing. We started this project in 2014, before Vision 2030 was launched, and it will commence operations in 2018. After this, we envision expanding this concept to a sector park in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, and other cities with ports and railway connections.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Al Diyar is a family business founded 13 years ago as as an investment company. Over time, we got more involved in the real estate sector. There was a lack of well-designed, well-built projects in the Kingdom, and Jeddah is underdeveloped, especially in terms of mixed-use projects and hospitality projects. In terms of design, there was no innovation at all. We saw a great deal of potential in the market. In 2012, we formalized a six-year strategy that focused primarily on the hospitality sector, mixed-use products, and a smaller focus on certain residential segments. Since then, we delivered three projects, with two others in the pipeline to be finished in 2020. We are focused on optimizing the business right now. We have learned valuable lessons the past two years that will help us optimize the business and take it to the next level. The other important element we are focusing on is our most important asset: people. Ideas are great, but the team of the “right“ people make these ideas possible, and maintaining, developing, and attracting top players is the most important investment any owner can do for his business. We also focus on R&amp;D. Every year, we attend at least six forums, shows, and fairs focused on our industry, such as building materials, design, hospitality, energy, construction, interior design and the like. 2018 and 2019 will witness excellent opportunities, which we are seizing.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We strive for strategic projects and major megaprojects where we can use a holistic approach, avoiding competition with lesser expertise. In 2006, we started our first industrial project with Northern Region Cement (NRC), for which production started in 2008 and is now a listed company with a market value of SAR3 billion. Our second megaproject was Solb steel in Jizan, for which we invested SAR2.8 billion and is now the second-largest steel plant after SABIC's Hadeed. For logistics, we are developing logistic hubs, small projects of around SAR600 million, where we offer closed gates with secure fencing and warehousing. As e-commerce rapidly grows, we now rent 70% of our space out to large global and domestic e-commerce players. Although there is a surplus of office space, there is always demand for quality. During the boom even housing facilities were shifted to office space, though today there is a reverse trend. We choose to develop a gated community and high-end environment with select tenants, security services, hotels, and restaurants. The Riyadh Front will not be pure office space; in fact, only 17% of the area is built up, while 83% is for landscaping, parking, and other facilities. We choose quality over quality, which will ensure demand. We have learned from the Business Gate, and we are now able to replicate and improve the success in the Riyadh Front.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Our focus advanced from construction services to security services. Over time the latter grew significantly, and we now consider ourselves one of the main suppliers in this domain. This development into security solutions was natural; we identified a need within the market and then worked to fill it. There was no same level of awareness about the industry, though we thrived and prospered. Investing in the right people, and choosing and partnering with the best technology companies are what enable us to provide exceptional service and drove us to the success we have reached today. We are riding the wave of current demand and anticipating what will be required in the coming years. The new strategy of the Kingdom focuses on sustainable power, and we seek to be responsive to this new demand. We want to accommodate and enlarge this new business segment as best we can. We actually anticipated this shift, which allowed us to open a new branch of operations focused on LED lighting and solar power. It is a very dynamic industry with a great deal of room for growth and one of the most immediate areas that can impact an individual or business in terms of reducing their electrical consumption and carbon footprint. We are working hard to educate the public about the right quality and types of systems and about the cost savings and energy efficiency of technologies that have a higher front-end cost.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>SRC is one element in a more global ecosystem put in place under the umbrella of the Ministry of Housing. The whole plan of developing home ownership relies on three pillars: supply, broadening the scope of who has access to home ownership, and elements or products that make more homes affordable to more people. More has to be done to channel liquidity toward originators. Providing liquidity is where SRC comes into play. We are gaining traction because of a deal with Deutsche Gulf and Bidaya and are currently finalizing negotiations with another mortgage finance company. Our approach is to provide a global answer to what the mortgage finance companies and the banks need to do or help them originate more. We interact with the originators to expand the eligibility criteria; we promote standardization and transparency while we support the mortgage companies and banks and channel liquidity. It is nice to entice people to originate more loans and to grow the volume with a broader range of borrowers; however, at the end of the day we need also to make sure that we can bring funding to these originators, which is what SRC is all about. Our aim is to grow the Saudi market sustainably, which means we should offer more loans to a broader range of the population, with the right assessment, product, and coverage.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are subsidies in the mortgage market that push customers to go to banks or financing companies to take out mortgages instead of giving it to them directly. Ineligibility is a problem; some customers are ineligible due to low salaries or bad credit reports. Second, customers might already have financing. If they come for a mortgage, a bank may give them 60-65%; however, when they come to us, they are already in debt, with 30-40% owed. Thus, no matter what we are able to give, it does not satisfy the customer. The Real Estate Development Fund creates new products to fill this gap, though there is still a significant gap. The main problem is the price of the land; if the price of land was reduced, everyone would be able to own a house. A house today is worth around USD240,000 at the very cheapest, with the median closer to USD267,000. Since the economy took a slight hit in the past few months, feedstock and building material are now cheaper, so that is not where the problem lies. We currently have a product to meet these demands, which is called mortgage guarantee services. Normally, a customer with a monthly income below USD2,800 would be rejected by financers. Now, he would be accepted, and in case of default, the lender will be reimbursed 80%. The program mostly applies to ex-government employees, former military, and retirees, and we are still looking for a solution for the wider population.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Financing is one of the main pillars of our operations, and our partnership with SRC is a great new avenue to fund our business. Saudi Arabia currently has 420,000 beneficiaries, which requires nearly SAR300 billion in funds. This is a challenging task through the debt market, so the repackaging of financial services that SRC provides complements us in that respect. Their presence is crucial to the current ambition of increasing home ownership amongst Saudi nationals, and their innovative repackaging program of financing products will involve the private sector even more. Under the current agreement, they have provided us with USD270 million, more than half of which we have already dispersed. The idea is to further grow this relationship between Bidaya and SRC in order to ensure that we have a great understanding of financing lines for us. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) is our common shareholder, and there is complete synergy and understanding between us. The current ecosystem is evolving, and we have originators that are mortgage houses and banks. We also have end users, developers adding units, and SRC providing financing to the market. There is also SAMA and CMA, which are our regulators. And on top of everything, we have the government, including the Eskan program with 16 government entities. All those businesses will be regulated and practitioners will be professionalized, making it easier for people to own their homes.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>While the future of the industry shows bright growth prospects, the challenges and opportunities are bigger than ever before. The shortage of long-term capital is widely seen as a chronic blockage in serving the burgeoning need for housing mortgages. In this context, the setup of SRC is very timely and highly applauded as it represents a major breakthrough in creating a sustainable mortgage industry. Following the launch of SRC, industry players are taking a fresh look at their business plans and expansion goals. These funding lines will release significant capital to actively expand our mortgage originations. With cost-efficient, long-term solutions, the mortgage industry is overcoming one of our chief apprehensions about liability management, and we are planning to enhance service platforms to seize upcoming growth. AMLAK recognizes unprecedented opportunities to provide cost-efficient mortgage solutions to a wider segment of society. We have been busy over last 12 months, launching new solutions to serve both unmet and emerging needs. We launched a down payment guaranteed program, a rate-subsidized product, a mortgage-guaranteed solution, and a program sponsored by the Ministry of Housing involving completed and under-construction units. AMLAK is in an advanced stage of launching a self-construction financing program, serving the largest supply source of housing. Overall, we are widening our product portfolio, shoring up business plans, bolstering internal capabilities and re-engineering operations for both market-led and reform-driven changes to demand and supply.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>When we started in 2008, the perception was that mortgages would become an important sector, even though it only represented 1% of GDP at the time. We worked hard in 2008 to get our bylaw prior to the regulation release. However, the 2008 global financial crisis was largely sparked by mortgages, and regulators became wary of the concept. This delayed the release of the mortgage law until July 2012. The financial crisis brought liquidity back to Saudi Arabia. At the time, it was safer to invest money in Saudi real estate than to deposit in US or European banks, which led to an increase in real estate prices up until 2015. These first years were golden days for the mortgage sector, until a 30% down payment became compulsory in 2014. Add to this the introduction of a land tax, and real estate became a less appealing investment. In 2015, the mortgage sector was around SAR8 billion, compared to over SAR25 billion in 2014. The tide turned again when the minimum down payment fell to 15%. The real estate sector has the potential to lead the economy again. The government aims to build 1.5 million homes through PPPs by 2022. I hope foreign investors take the lead to introduce large-scale development. The largest developers in Saudi Arabia in the last few years still only built 1,000 units at a time. We need to widen the scope to 10,000 or 20,000 units.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>One of the main mandates of the ministry is the preservation of land and orienting urban development. This concerns regional planning and land preservation, and in our department, our main concern is the land administration. It is a comprehensive scope that includes the cadastral registration to take care of ownership. This ownership in Saudi Arabia is not physically well documented or specially linked to accurate parcel maps. It used to be only registered to the person who owns the land; however, we are now working on a huge project to link that with accurate parcel maps in order to have it physically defined to resolve the disputes related to the uncertainty of information on ownership. In addition, we are responsible for granting people land, with two types of land grants. We are authorized by the government, who always takes care of its people, to grant land to improve the quality of life, and not only for housing. In addition, we are also responsible for geospatial information gathering, utilizing satellite imagery, aerial photography, and topographic mapping to furnish the entire country, all government agencies, and the private sector with accurate and detailed geospatial information. We have been ISO certified since 2007 and follow international standards with regard to geospatial information gathering. Our ambition for Vision 2030 is to equip the country with geospatial information, and at the same time, utilize this information for all government agencies to link their work and for information to be spatially linked.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>REGA was set up in 2017 to create more market transparency, build sector capabilities, and stimulate investment. REGA is currently engaged in many activities to fulfill these objectives. We work with other local government authorities, local and international experts, and the key stakeholders in the Saudi real estate sector to develop ways to enhance the real estate market, create transparency, and build its capabilities, which will result in an attractive market for local and foreign investment. REGA's priorities at this current stage are, firstly, building several real estate indicators, creating a comprehensive land registration system, and analyzing real estate-related regulations and areas of improvement. Second, the Saudi Real Estate Institute (SREI), one of REGA's arms, focuses on developing the capabilities in the real estate sector. SREI provides different courses and certificates to those in the sector. It aims to provide people with the required knowledge and skills to increase professionalism. Third, REGA, in its all activities, targets both investors and homebuyers. Therefore, the ultimate goal for REGA is improving the real estate ecosystem. We have also worked with different local agents and experts from the World Bank to develop a set of real estate indicators, both price and non-price ones. These indicators will be used as guidelines to publish insights and reports as well as establish deep analysis and research that can benefit many stakeholders such as investors, individuals, and policymakers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are part of the Kingdom's objective to increase home ownership. We seek to first achieve 60% home ownership by 2020. We have started to make it quantifiable as a SMART target, specific and measurable relative to the situation. We came up with a target of 480,000 families that will need to purchase homes in the next three years. We have three initiatives according to our plan. The first is becoming a solution innovator. Second, we should be a financially sustainable organization to serve a large number of people; we need to create a platform that will ensure continuity in the population. We are now more focused on a model that will achieve results that are not related to oil. The third is being a market maker; we identify the risks that the market is not willing to take and motivate the industry by taking it on ourselves. In order to comply with requirements and identify the roles that we want to play, we have restructured the organization. We are currently undergoing reform and, accordingly, have identified the products and services wherein we need to work closely with the private sector, namely the banking sector. REDF has a capital of around SAR191 billion (USD50.93 billion), and we need to leverage this capital. We have around SAR21 billion (USD5.6 billion) in assets under management. We focus on investing these funds to build capabilities, organizational structure, and relationships with partners to achieve the right returns and subsidize all our loans.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>AJA Pharma is a subsidiary of Saudi Chemical Company. Our sister company is Sitco, which is the only other pharmaceutical firm out of Saudi Chemical Company's five subsidiaries. The group has been active in the pharmaceutical industry for more than 25 years. We recently decided to expand our activities through our own manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. This way we can provide contract-manufacturing services to our partners and interested foreign companies to locally manufacture their products. In addition to this, we develop our own portfolio of products. This combination is what makes our business model so hybrid, and the strategy is paying off. We have signed several agreements with different partners to locally manufacture their products. We have four production lines: solids, semi-solids, liquids, and sterile products. This means we will produce a wide variety of products ranging from tablets and capsules to creams, lotions, gels, syrups, injections, and more. We are now fully operational in three production lines, except for the injection line, which will be operational by 2019. The National Transformation Plan aims to increase the share of local pharmaceutical production from 20 to 40% by 2020. AJA Pharma is one of the enablers to realize this target. We already partner with two companies to locally manufacture their products and will soon sign with an additional two.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have been in the country since 1960, and the decision to invest was made in 2013. Pfizer applied to have a manufacturing site in King Abdullah Economic City, which we opened in January 2017. We have been in Saudi Arabia for a long time and are committed to the progress here. Pfizer envisioned this as a long-term partnership and having a manufacturing facility is important for us. The plant in Saudi Arabia is one of the few manufacturing facilities that the company has opened in the last 20 years. Saudi Arabia is the anchor of the Middle East for businesses, specifically in the pharmaceutical sector. In addition, we cannot ignore the tireless efforts of the government represented by Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority  in attracting and facilitating world-class investments in the healthcare arena. The expected growth of the market and what will happen in the coming years is based on studies and our own vision. The entire pharmaceutical business will grow between 5 and 7% in the coming years. For us, it is a different case. This is because we do many things, starting with basic primary care products and consumer products, to sophisticated biologics, vaccines, and critical health products. At Pfizer, we have the advantage of a wide range of products, which helps us diversify risk.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There has been a rapid change in the dynamics of our market. There has been a retail transformation happening around the world, and it has transformed the model. It is no longer business as usual; we have to remain agile in order to cope with the future and cater to changing customer expectations. There is also a healthcare transformation happening worldwide and in specifically in Saudi Arabia, which is part of the Vision 2030 agenda and embraced by the Ministry of Health and the government. There is a clear roadmap that involves the private sector, and it creates many rapid changes such as privatization and the government becoming more of a regulator than an operator, as well as a shift toward preventative care. All these impact our business. Throughout the world, pharmacy is considered the first line of defense when it comes to healthcare, and pharmacies all around the world are changing dramatically. There are also a significant number of changes taking place in the customer profile and the increased mobility of half of the population. The latter will improve accessibility of a large part of our customers in our stores, which means we need to be prepared to provide female customers with the best in-store shopping experience.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Gama Hospital is operated by Astoon Medical Services, which is part of the Fal Holdings Group. In 2006, Astoon Medical Services acquired Gama Hospital and updated it to make it one of the most prominent hospitals in the Eastern province. It provides a comprehensive range of outpatient and inpatient medical services. We built our business strategy based on the community needs and invested in many medical services. Gama Hospital is fully equipped with modern medical equipment and services, with highly qualified expertise in all medical specialties. Gama Hospital was the first hospital in the Eastern Province to be accredited by the Saudi Central Board of Accreditation for Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI) in 2012, and it was reaccredited twice in 2017. Raising private healthcare expenditure from 25% to 35% means new opportunities for the private healthcare sector in order to extend their investments, which in turn would lead to the sector's financial sustainability and boost economic social development in the Kingdom. By implementing the privatization strategy plan, there will be no room for the concept of conflict of interest in the Ministry of Health because there will be a transition from public sector ownership to private sector management, which means the Ministry of Health's role will be the same, from the point of supervision and regulations of the private sector.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The hospital was established in 1958 and started as a maternity and children's hospital. Over the years, it grew to become a general hospital with 140 beds. In 2017, it was acquired by NMC Healthcare, which is registered on the FTSE 100 in the UK and has already acquired five hospitals in the Kingdom. We strive to become the provider of choice in our service area. NMC Healthcare Saudi Arabia's vision is to be one of the largest healthcare service providers in the Kingdom, which will be achieved by growing and improving the quality of care. In 2017, there were improvements in services provided, and this year there are several other improvement initiatives. Although the current market situation is a challenge, it is an opportunity to expand our services and maintain our strategy of growth. Between NMC Healthcare Saudi Arabia group and its hospital facilities across the network in the Kingdom, we are exploring every opportunity of synergy to provide the clinical expertise in the offered fields of services to improve the quality and level of service. We are exploring different type of services that will help us be a part of patient treatment before and after their visits to our facility. We will strive to fulfill our part of the vision by improving and expanding our services to work hand in hand with the public sector.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Elaj Group was established in 1994 with one medical center in Jeddah, mainly catering to infertility and related fields. We started introducing other medical specialties at that center and then expanded our Elaj medical centers into Riyadh and the Eastern Province to cover the three main regions of the Kingdom. We grew further to cover all Saudi Arabia's main cities and subsequently set up medical centers in the other Gulf countries. In 1998, we went into our second business line, setting up a joint venture with Al Borg Laboratories, one of the leaders in its field in the region now. Elaj Group is currently establishing its third line of business, namely hospitals. We have five hospitals in the Western Province that we are working on upgrading and bringing into operation in 2018. Elaj Group's objective is to be a prominent healthcare holding providing for and catering to the entire healthcare spectrum. Ours is a comprehensive and integrated approach to providing healthcare services. There is a new approach now under the National Transformation Plan (NTP) and Vision 2030 to privatize the healthcare sector. We are entering a new era, and we will see extremely positive changes in the targeted sectors for privatization, which are healthcare and education. We are putting in place our infrastructure because we require the right platforms to cater to the needs of privatization.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We are a mini hospital and have operating rooms, ICUs, and clinics that can cover everything. The idea started in 2009 when I was working in a government hospital and noticed the delay for patient services. I decided to set up a one-stop medical service where patients can save time on visits by doing all their check ups in one place. We specialize in all types of tumors as well as other services. In the health sector, we will see a decline in the market until 2020. After that, I expect certain medical institutions to go out of business, which will consolidate the market. With the privatization of government hospitals, this will rejuvenate the market. Medical tourism will be our future if Saudi Arabia continues to provide the distinguished care that it does now. In the Gulf area, we are number one without a doubt. The real competitors are Jordan and Turkey. For now, we plan to lower our expenses in preparation for a contracting market, though we will never compromise on the quality of care. If one wants excellent healthcare, then it will cost them a large sum of money. We have raised this issue with the government, noting that insurance premiums here are too low; they should be a higher so that insurance companies can cover the exact expense.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We have been growing significantly for the last 10 years and have doubled our business. The number of patients grows by an average of 10% per year, and there was dramatic growth of 22% in 2017 because we introduced many new services. There is still significant demand for the private sector, though there are still great challenges. The first thing is government regulation, which is getting tough for the operation of healthcare. Restrictions have been put in place regarding the percentage of Saudi employees, and most of the time we are unable to apply for new visas for foreign workers. Getting a qualified workforce is a challenge for private hospitals. There is a shortage of qualified Saudis, as large companies and governmental hospitals attract more staff than private hospitals. In 2017, we formed large deals with major insurance companies, which reflects our overall growth of 22%. In 2018, with the new services that were not here before, including a cath lab, dialysis, and MRI, we hope to pursue our growth in service delivery to be able to target patients with more specialized needs. We also plan at the end of 2018 to start an open-heart unit. If the variables remain the same in the market, with the introduction of these new services we can maintain the same growth rate.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>One of the core focuses of our strategy is digital content, and we are the sole provider for the Ministry of Education in terms of blended content and digital content. We provide thousands of digital textbooks and learning and teaching resources consolidated in the iEN, the National Education Portal that is customized and tailored toward the new generation of learners. We want to engage current and future generations in a way that stimulates them and captures their attention. In less than two years, we have managed to reach 1 million new active users and have welcomed about 9 million visitors to the iEN portal. We provide services to users both within Saudi Arabia and across the world as part of our digital education strategy. We work in partnership with our sister company, which owns and operates the LMS, and our content is embedded in its systems. T4edu operates both as a content developer and delivery intermediary. Our content strategy is comprehensive; we develop our own content while also working with our partners to buy or collaboratively develop new content unique to the Kingdom.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>SDL is an initiative of the Ministry of Education and serves as the digital portal, offering all public universities and learning institutes the digital resources and learning materials they need. We are honored to have grown to become the largest digital library in the Middle East, currently offering more than 600 million resources in the form of magazines, journals, books, case studies, and other media. With this library of resources, we cover all specialties, ranging from primary education to the various academic disciplines. Currently, we are studying how to install SDL as the national licensing organization and broaden our scope, offering our digital resources to all educational institutes. Both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance have applauded the efforts of SDL to reduce expenses for digital resources by centralizing our portal. Overall, expenses have baeen reduced by 80%. Our mandate is two-fold, and aside from providing digital learning materials to our universities, we also strive to increase the scientific output of our universities and that of Saudi scholars studying around the world.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We provide five types of services. One is advisory services, where we help improve the performance of schools, training institutes, and universities. The second line of business is supporting investors both international and local to establish or acquire schools. The third service is teacher training; Emkan Education is the only organization certified by Cambridge University in Saudi Arabia to provide its renowned professional development qualification. In addition, we also support schools by managing Cambridge examinations. The fourth is developing content; for example, we work with operators to adjust international programs and adapt them to a local context. We introduced new subjects such as Arabic, religion, and history; we co-create the content alongside the operators. The fifth service is education technology. We developed a platform called “Aanaab,“ which is an online teacher training platform with the aim of providing high-quality content for teachers and creating professional learning communities.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Riyaadi is an initiative of the Ministry of Education under the National Transformation Program (NTP) to provide students with the right skills for the labor market and stimulate culture of entrepreneurship. We work to prepare the young generation for Vision 2030 and beyond. The country envisions more entrepreneurs and a more vibrant SME landscape to ultimately benefit society at large and increase GDP. Thus, we are working toward encouraging entrepreneurial mindsets with a unique digital platform that reaches out directly to students. This digital platform consists of various sub-programs. It contains digital training alongside a YouTube-type channel with exercises and activities. The program in itself is extremely interactive. Currently, we are launching a pilot program targeting well over 35,000 students, of which the majority are female. The engine of entrepreneurship is currently developed from various perspectives—funding, mentorship, and regulations, and we focus on training and stimulation.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>BIAC's core competencies lie in business incubation and acceleration services, which has allowed us to expand our business domain into several industrial sectors aligned with the national industrial strategy. In line with Vision 2030, we work with partners from different governmental sectors on establishing incubators in information technology, renewable energy, the water industry, and processed food manufacturing with the aim of reducing Saudi Arabia's oil dependency, diversifying its economy, and developing its public service sector. BIAC shares Prince Mohammed bin Salman's futuristic ambitions with regard to NEOM, as BIAC's strategy supports the same sectors, which are energy and water, biotech, advanced manufacturing, and the applications of industry 4.0. In the water industry, BIAC has developed operating and funding models for Water Innovation Centers, which include water technology incubators and accelerators, a water innovation network, and a reverse engineering lab.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>For the past two years, we have been determined to go global. Fortunately, the IMF invited us out to talk about fintech in the MENA region, which recognized our achievements in the finance, health, and technology world. This recent interest in us by investors made us more certain that our business model works. We anticipated that once it created value for people, it would be monetized, which is how it went. Aramco purchased a fair amount of equity and is now one of our partners. We look to work with medical facilities, as we align with other medical facilities throughout the country. The new funds will be used mostly to build more capacity, hire more staff, do more marketing, and deliver Sihatech 2.0—our new and improved product. Our goal is to “put care back into healthcare.“ Sihatech is a patient journey management service that delivers support from the minute of appointment all the way to diagnoses, tests, treatments, medication, and follow-ups.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We established Tawari toward the end of 2016. At the time, we decided to be as close to Vision 2030 as possible and knew the exact needs of the local market. We opened with two business lines: cybersecurity and big data analytics. We deal with highly sophisticated technology, which supports decision-making. In terms of cybersecurity, there are many companies in the local market that provide the same services as us. Studying the market, we decided to focus on certain niche markets, one of which is encryption technology services and security testing services. Encryption technology is an advanced subject, and Tawari has partnered with several companies with the experience and know-how in terms of developing and implementing encryption technology. When dealing with cybersecurity, we have to deal with huge amounts of data, and one of the complications is moving this data to the proper containers where it can be properly analyzed and patterns identified.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When we began in 2012 we saw an excellent opportunity for people to interact with digital content. In earlier times, people were more passive; they gave their attention to shared information whether it interested them or not. However, this changed when new technologies like smartphones came along: people lost interest in passive and static data. If you visit a museum today, there is often something to interact with. That is when we decided to introduce interactive technologies such as virtual reality, holograms, and augmented reality into the market; advanced technologies that are all about interactivity and engaging users with different sectors to gain the attention of target users. These interactive and immersive tools are also used in the education sector to increase students' attention levels; in the industrial sector to obtain the focus of trainees; and in the entertainment industry to intensify the experience.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Under the IT segment, we cover mobile apps, websites, e-commerce, and corporate systems for both IOS and Android. On the e-commerce side, we have developed systems for companies, mostly SMEs. What makes us unique is that we do everything in house—from logo design all the way to the last line of code. We start with the customer from step one, taking them through the entire operational process, and then handing off the entire project for them to carry on. In that sense, we function as an incubator as well. We have clients working with us in IT and marketing at the same time. We use all platforms including Google platforms for digital marketing, Facebook Ads, Snapchat Ads, as well as other third-party ads. Furthermore, we prepare annual reports for our clients. We deal with 36 third-party companies for data analytics and reporting in general. We have a content creation team for profiles, marketing, and ad copies as well as offline marketing. Many of our clients work with us on both the marketing and IT services end.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is witnessing a progressive change, and we are honored to be contributing to its digital transformation. Cisco, through its long history of partnership with the Saudi government, is helping enable a digital transformation throughout KSA, combining global technological knowledge with local talent and insight, and helping deliver the principal objectives of Vision 2030, including shifting the country from an oil-based to a knowledge-based economy. One of the key pillars of a digital economy is a digital-ready infrastructure. Our intent-based networking solutions, which we recently presented at Cisco Connect in Jeddah, represent one of the most significant breakthroughs in enterprise networking. This is the culmination of Cisco's vision to create an intuitive system that anticipates actions, stops security threats in their tracks, and continues to evolve and learn. This new network is the result of years of research and development by Cisco to reinvent networking for the digital age. Today, network engineers manage hundreds of devices, but by 2020, every hour a million new devices will be connected to networks.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>HPE is the result of a restructuring that has taken place from the old Hewlett Packard. It is one of the entities that became independent, with a greater focus on B2B. We have full coverage of this segment from SMEs, large enterprises, and the government. Our strategy has focused on three pillars: making hybrid IT simple, powering the intelligent edge, and having the comprehensive services and expertise to make technologies work smoothly together. We are able to execute our strategy well because it is focused and simple in nature. In many of the focus segments, we have become a market leader. For example, we are a cloud leader and a leader of servers, storage, and the intelligent edge. Due to the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent edge is an important pillar of our strategy. One needs to have more data processing power and computing at the edge of the network in order to handle big data and avoid sending everything to the data center.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Opening the first public cloud data center in the Kingdom has been part of our commitment to Vision 2030, and the digital hub was an initiative to enable this digital transformation across the public and private sectors. There are four components to the digital hub, and the data center is the core of it. Already, we have connected a government entity, which will help speed up and expedite transformation across different government entities. One of the most important elements of the government's transformation is continuous change, and the government continues to develop its regulation to make the business transformation work. With our support for the digital transformation, the regulatory changes will be implemented more smoothly. For us, it is extremely important to have a solid infrastructure for digital transformation on the ground that is tailored to support that transformation. As for the government's privatization schemes, such policy changes are just upgrades to a live system, with the government as main issuer. For SAP, it is a major investment, and we need tailor-made solutions for our clients.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft estimates the size of the Kingdom's cloud computing market to be more than USD29 billion, a number only expected to increase. Governmental agencies in Saudi Arabia drive this trend by utilizing cloud technology to meet their digital transformation targets and contribute to the success of Vision 2030. We currently provide our services and solutions to more than 2,000 private and public organizations in the Kingdom, and by having new cloud technologies like Azure Stack, we enable our customers to use the hybrid cloud quickly and efficiently in the most secure way. We are confident that with the Microsoft cloud, organizations in Saudi Arabia can enhance their businesses considerably and achieve their strategic goals. On the other hand, the recent regulatory framework for cloud computing will contribute to the knowledge economy and lead to more investment in cloud technologies. We predict cloud computing in the Kingdom to grow faster than the global average and reach 25% annual growth by 2020, which will foster a clear and transparent regulatory environment, the need for updates, and utilize more sophisticated technologies.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>As a local private sector entity, we understand that a key component of any development or transformation boils down to the development and participation of the individual. At SBM, we provide extensive training programs and see it as our obligation to Vision 2030 and the digital transformation to deliver on this human capital development. SBM is not just a hardware or software company—it transcends that. The market for IT and communication services has changed, and both companies and professionals need to be prepared for that. At SBM, we need to follow trends and train our people accordingly. Two of these trends are cyber security and big data analysis. The country is looking forward to implementing the latest technology in this field, and we should deliver on that. In the past, we worked with the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF), where we took graduates with non-IT backgrounds for a one-year program to prepare them for the job market in this industry. This was even before the digital transformation was announced, and HRDF financially supported this program.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2003, there was inadequate water supply throughout the Kingdom, so WEC was founded by the Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC) and Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) to implement water infrastructure projects using the public-private partnership framework to achieve further efficiencies and bring foreign investment and experience into the water sector. The program was backed by sovereign guarantees from the Ministry of Finance to give comfort to lenders and make the projects bankable. In May 2017, COM 494 announced the expansion of WEC's mandate as the principal off-taker of water in order to include the purchase of desalinated, purified, treated and untreated, and storage of water. The co-generation and ownership of WEC was also transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and its board of directors consists of the Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA), which together with representatives from the Ministry of Finance acts as chair, the Ministry of Economy and Planning, and one or two other independent members typically from the private sector. In June 2017, WEC executed a Water Purchase Agreement for the expansion of Shuaibah 2 Plant to provide an additional 250,000cbm per day of water to the Makkah region. It will be commissioned in 2Q2019.  We have issued a request for proposals for four new projects, including Rabigh-3 IWP, an independent water plant with a planned capacity of 600,000cbm/day, and Shuqaiq-3 IWP, which has a planned capacity of 450,000cbm/day.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The main objective of the change in tariffs is to reflect the actual cost of the energy consumed and reduce the dependence on government support. It was based on calculating the actual cost of electricity and reflecting this in the revenue from the tariff in order to have a balance. Depending on fuel prices, we calculated the cost of electricity for various categories of consumers, including residential, commercial, and industrial, among others. It was reflected in the current tariff, and now the industries are paying their cost. Some social aspect must be implemented into this, just like it is all over the world. The commercial sector pays its actual cost, and the government pays slightly higher tariffs than the cost of electricity for government offices and buildings in order to support low-income residential consumers. Now, the revenue from the tariff is equivalent to the required revenue in order for the sector to be independent of government support based on current fuel prices. If fuel prices change, there will be a change to the tariff. The impact on consumption is not yet clear because the change to the tariff is not huge. Electricity consumption in winter and spring is generally not that high, and people have not noticed a significant change in their bills. If they practice certain measures of energy conservation they may be able to absorb some of the tariff change.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There is a new trend in Saudi Arabia toward protecting and maintaining our aquifers and reservoirs for future generations. This is the latest policy and strategy of Saudi's decision makers, as outlined by the Deputy Minister of Water, Agriculture, and Environment. There is greater dependence on equipment that can handle water from dams, shallow water aquifers, and desalination plants. This is why we now focus on certain products that are used in dams and that require lower quantities of water while being more energy efficient. This means we no longer focus on large products, such as deep-set or large pumps. The majority of the equipment focus today is on using alternative power sources, such as solar panels on wells. We have already signed an agreement to represent a company specializing in solar systems for wells. The emphasis is on a more sustainable approach that integrates renewable energy sources into the equipment and solutions we provide. This is what NWWC focuses on and is where we see new potential in the market. We are also seeing new equipment standards being introduced into the regulations here and more restrictions on importing products. For example, there are codes for electrical and rotating equipment in Saudi, which have been upgraded to the European standard IEC4, the highest level of efficiency under that rating system. We have formed an agreement with the principals we represent in Saudi Arabia to start managing these products for them according to Saudi requirements—for example, bringing in new models of motors.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In terms of the professionalism of our work and what we recommend, Saudi Brokers is one of the top three or four companies. Many people do not understand the job of an insurance broker, which acts as the eyes of the insurer and on behalf of their client in all forms of coverage. This is what Saudi Brokers does well. We make sure the insurance company can defend both itself and the client. In terms of volume, Saudi Brokers not only chases new businesses, but is careful about being conservative in its business for the simple reason that we need to service clients. One cannot continue to increase volume with no service. Unfortunately, many industry losses are caused by brokers chasing volume rather than profit. Saudi Brokers tries to create a balance as much as possible. The regulators are doing a great job, though the market is not ready for the current regulatory framework. Compared to Europe, we are far off and cannot apply the same regulations to our small market; insurance was truly only legalized in Saudi Arabia in 2008.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started operations in 2013 with only six employees, and our initial focus was on direct insurance, with a division for reinsurance following suit in 2014, though we obtained both licenses from the beginning. Today, we are one of the top insurance and reinsurance brokers in Saudi Arabia. In 2018, we made a significant and innovative leap with the launch of our web portal, Bawabti, moving into the direction of a technology-based service provider. Our corporate clients can log in and do all their interactions online, with access to transactions, addition, mediations, certificates, generations of SOAs, and account statements. For us, it also eases operations as we can manage all our KPIs leaving our back office ready to jump in to help with questions or inquiries from our clients. Not all brokers have such a servicing tool to offer to their clients, and this is our unique selling point. It will help us grow our clientele base and reduce operational costs, freeing us to focus on client relationship management instead of operations.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>2017 was a good year for the company, with profits of about USD9.06 million on USD155 million worth of premiums. The company writes all types of businesses: motor, medical, engineering, property, marine, energy—where we have a great portfolio—and aviation. Motor insurance is on top, followed by engineering, energy, and medical. As far as VAT is concerned, 2018 was certainly a transitional year. In the first year, there will certainly be an impact on certain provisions, especially when it comes to unearned premium reserves (UPR). However, the market will return to normal once people better understand the mechanism of VAT and get used to paying it. The impact will be seen later in 2018 and will be on whatever business is written in 2017. Many obstacles are preventing us from collecting due VAT premiums, especially from motor businesses and individuals, mostly because of non-response. However, there is always daily contact with corporate clients, which makes collecting VAT significantly easier.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>One of our board members once told us that we should look for the right blend between a multinational culture and a family-run business. We try to go in between, being professional with corporate governance and all that comes as part of being a multinational group like Chubb, while still keeping the flavor of a local company, especially in being close to our customers and adapting policies and procedures that reflect local realities. This has helped us operate very efficiently over the years. We are not huge in terms of market share, but we are one of the best companies when it comes to return on equity and sustainable profitability. The company started 49 years ago as an insurance agency and 30 years ago as an insurance company. Since then, we have not had a single year with losses. We provide all insurance services with the exception of health. In terms of SAMA's recent regulatory updates, they are forcing everyone to raise their standards to an international level, which is much better.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In terms of our assets under management (AUMs), the number of products presented to market, and the creativity of our solutions, there has been progress. We have always stood at the forefront of the sector for investments in general and real estate in particular. Our firm has been a trendsetter when it comes to sharia-compliant solutions, for which we were recently awarded for having the most creative sharia-compliant solutions. Talking about longevity, over the past ten years our main strength has been being able to ride waves and jump ship at the right time. When it comes to Saudi Arabian real estate, things go in and out of fashion quickly. When we talked about real estate development focus 10 years ago, there were certain trends. If one were to launch a real estate development fund today, it would be suicidal—it is completely out of fashion. Income-generating real estate funds shortly came after that, and I launched the first one in Saudi Arabia through a different company.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Sukuk issuance is increasingly becoming a more feasible option for governments and big companies wishing to reduce their dependence on traditional bank facilities or who wish to seek alternative sources of funding. Also, due to its technicalities, i.e. preference for Islamic assets/financing for Shariah-compliance purposes, the demand for Islamic products has seen unprecedented growth as a viable alternative source of financing in recent years. When it comes to Saudi Arabia's new strategy and Vision 2030, sukuk has also become one of the most important sources of financing for the government and state-owned companies like SABIC and the Ma'aden Group. In the GCC region, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia have set up their debt management offices in order to perform the cash management functions of the government and raise funds from international markets, taking advantage of the globally low interest rates. As for us, Saudi Kuwaiti Finance House (SKFH) is a CMA licensed investment bank that provides wide range of services across several sectors and industries. We provides financial advisory services, including portfolio management, as well as investment funds.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been planning to launch REITs since 2008, and we have been in talks with the Capital Market Authority (CMA) since then. REITs are a great option for public investors to generate periodic distribution, at 5-8% yields per year. When the CMA approved the REIT regulations, the REIT market went through several stages. First, REITs were opened for everyone as speculative and went up by 130%. The regulations were then halted by the CMA and no approval or licenses were given to launch REITs for months. These actions were basically considered as an intervention in the business, which is beyond where it seems the CMA as a regulator had concerns and fears that not all in the business shared. Because of that, the REITs were treated as speculative tools, and therefore a limited number of REITs were listed in the market. After that “drought period,“ the CMA has approved more than four REITs at the same time. The CMA definitely intended to protect public investors, although the frequent changes and interventions were received negatively by investors. Later, many REITs were listed for public offering in the Saudi market but were faced with a very low appetite by both individual investors as well as institutional investors.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>2017 was a great year for us. We launched a large REIT fund worth around USD266.68 million. The coverage was over 1,000% the requested amount, which is an indication of the liquidity of the Saudi market. Its closure was extremely successful and on time. Fortunately, the REIT market was introduced to the country at the right time; real estate values are currently not inflated like they were four years ago. We were successful in our first distribution and promised to distribute 7% annually. We have made our semi-annual distribution of 3.5% and plan to distribute the remaining 3.5% on time as well. Not only were we successful in obtaining the Discretionary Portfolio Management license but are also extremely active in the private equity sector. We recently concluded two acquisitions: ARMAS Company, which made a profit in 2017, and a solar energy company called Edimax, which will have good results in 2018. Edimax is located in Jordan, but we plan to bring it to Saudi Arabia. With the increase of the energy prices here it is the right time to do so.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The Saudi Arabian economy as a whole, compared to the GCC and the MENA region, is rather large, but the number of banks and installment companies is relatively low. This leaves a number of sectors untapped. Our focus is on SMEs, one of the most untapped segments. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) classifies an SME as a company that earns USD53.3 million or less. If a customer, establishment, or company wants to obtain financing from a bank, it would be a challenge for them because banks seek partners that earn over that amount. This is where we come in. There are 37 installment companies in Saudi Arabia, though not many of them lend to SMEs. They instead look at retail, automotive, and mortgages. In terms of the growth in our potential customers, there are more than what we can observe. Our head office is in Jeddah, though we also have a branch in Riyadh and a license to open a branch in the east; that will happen in 2019 or 2020.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have achieved a number of goals and recently put a five-year plan into place. Our land has been licensed according to Saudi Industrial Property Authority (MODON) industrial standards, which means Wadi Makkah is now like a free zone and no longer part of Umm Al-Qura University. It does away with a great deal of the bureaucracy we used to have, giving us more freedom and investors a great opportunity. We have also launched our incubator and accelerator portals, which are new additions to our ecosystem of entrepreneurship. We improved the structuring of our deal flow compared to what we used to do before, which will allow us to have big data on a number of trends and initiatives in Saudi Arabia. What's more, a great deal of analytics can be done based on the information in the portal. We also offer a new summer training program, where 15% of our participants find a job within a week of completion.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The government had typically financed all education systems, including tertiary ones. Since 2010, the new goal has been to transform universities to non-profit organizations and self-sustaining entities. In order to do so, universities required an investment arm. The government issued a number of decrees establishing four "wadis", which means valley in Arabic, in Dammam, Riyadh, Jeddah, and Mecca. Wadi Jeddah was established to help King Abdulaziz University (KAU) invest in its assets, be they intellectual, land, labs, or intellectual property (IP). In a knowledge-based economy, it is sensible for universities to capitalize on these. The outcome of this process can be in many forms: products, patents, knowledge, or software. We have many great projects. For example, I-one is the first of its kind in the Western region of the Kingdom. It produces fluorodeoxyglucose for isotopes to be given to patients with certain types of cancer. This project was established three years ago and will officially be launched in 2018.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have venture capital investment with which we will focus on three major areas, namely renewables and green technologies, ICT, and health and life sciences. When going into the field, we consider anything that will bring strategic value to the university or country. We are now taking on the responsibility to operate a national diabetes center that is under construction. It is our responsibility now to furnish it, bring in the equipment and operator, and have it up and running. We took control of the project at the beginning of 2017. We have done a comprehensive feasibility study with one of the major consulting firms, and the results were promising with regard to the market and potential profits. We are now looking for credible operators and international technical partners to ensure the quality. We want it to be the center for Saudi Arabia. Our aim is for the center to grow organically and spread into various branches.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>DTVC started out as a center for oil research back in 2000. We expanded from oil to oil and gas and later to a broader umbrella called energy. We are proud that Dhahran Techno Valley hosts the world's largest collection of multi-national R&amp;D facilities focused on the energy sector. While the concentration of oil and gas companies is high, we are now expanding to include other sectors within the energy umbrella: renewable energy, water issues, desalination, and water management. Our Science Park has also organically developed and become the strongest representation of upstream oil and gas companies.  The world's largest upstream service providers—Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Weatherford, Sinopec—also have strong interests in automated systems and process controls. As crude oil is extracted from land and marine wells, the logistics and systems driving distribution and downstream activities will soon be based on completely automated control systems. This is ushering in a new era of the industrial Internet of Things (IoT).</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>If I were a young Saudi entrepreneur entering the market, I would look at the simple operations in the supply chain and start from there; I would not start big. Today, everything is needed. Sometimes it is easy to say one wants to go into something big, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, or infrastructure construction. However, one also needs to look at the more day-to-day opportunities.  Is anyone producing a great pair of shoes in the Kingdom? As a young entrepreneur, I would not necessarily look at the big league opportunities. There is business for everyone. Young people have to work, and we have to move away from a subsidized system into one where young people understand work is a personal duty as well as a social need, and provide them with the proper tools to express their capability. Though from our side, we have to improve the work environment. We have to motivate and incentivize people through a better HR management system that matches talent with the country's economic needs. With Vision 2030 and the oil crisis, we are rethinking our entire business model.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The market is changing in different ways. Many companies are looking at how their future fits in with Vision 2030, and whether or not they are aligned with its aims. We are no exception; we aim to align SEDCO Holding with Vision 2030. In our case, we looked at Vision 2030, our business, areas of growth, and expectations. There are fantastic initiatives across the board, and we found we were well aligned in many areas. For example, we are in the hotel business mainly in Mecca and Medina. We are well focused on the Hajj and Umrah market, and as these numbers grow, we are all set to do more. Furthermore, the country is gearing up for tourism. We are already operating the Elaf Hotel in Jeddah and just opened Galleria Hotel on Tahlia Street. Focused on car leasing, we recently signed with the German company Sixt, which gives us a strong strategic position. Our restaurant business is thriving and includes the Applebee's franchise, Ocean Basket, and others. Our fourth focus is capital markets.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Rusd Group was established in 2002, and we were the main founder of the Salama Group, which is listed on the Dubai Financial Market. We are also the founder of Jeddah International College and the major shareholder of Taajeer, the first company to provide financial leasing in Saudi Arabia. We are a diversified group of companies operating in areas including finance, education, transport, real estate, and tourism and hospitality. We are one of the larger-sized groups operating in Mecca in the hospitality sector. As for the country's overall appeal, Saudi Arabia is part of the G20, and its GDP and GDP per capita are extremely attractive. There is a population of roughly 32 million, with about 20.5 million young Saudis. This young demographic has developed certain consumption habits in eating, entertainment, and fashion that drive the economy in a significant way. Saudi Arabia is being transformed from a conservative and closed culture to an open and progressive one. This creates many opportunities in entertainment, food, education, and health.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We consider foreign investment as opportunities, not as a necessity or trend we need to follow. Saudi Arabia already has many opportunities, and we certainly tend to make our investments domestically. Our teams maintain this focus, though if opportunities arise and we expect high returns, we invest abroad. For example, we collaborate with Khazanah Nasional, a Malaysian state investment fund. Around 60% of the company's investments are in the GCC. Everyone that comes to Saudi Arabia with the objective of finding a sophisticated investor or partner will eventually run into MASIC, especially given our leadership through conferences like the Future Investment Initiative (FII) or our MASIC forum. Openness to foreign investors entering the country, stronger regulations, and tackling corruption have all made the Kingdom extremely attractive. Our portfolio is indeed diversified, ranging from progressive real estate and hospitality investments in Mecca to a shrimp farm in Jeddah, a logistics company providing housing and accommodation for laborers, third-party model factories, and so on.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Riyadh is the vibrant capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the largest economy in the MENA region. Its strategic location at the heart of Saudi Arabia offers it considerable advantages and access to markets across MENA, Europe, and rapidly developing Africa and Asia. Riyadh today has a population of 6.5 million people. Most are young, with 35% of the total under 15 years of age. Our new generation is among the most educated and technologically savvy people in the region. Riyadh has a vision to be among the best-100 cities in the world by 2030. This vision is ongoing through many planning and strategic initiatives across all sectors. This includes an ambitious strategy for the redevelopment of the historic core of the city (1,500ha) in partnership with the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund (PIF). Furthermore, we are developing major parks and environmental projects such as the prize-winning Wadi Hanifah restoration and the restoration of historic Addiriyah—a UNESCO World Heritage Site—that will help make Riyadh a more liveable city that celebrates its rich heritage and history.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Inclusion in PROMINENT global benchmark indexes, such as MSCI, FTSE Russell, and S&amp;P Dow Jones, is a significant milestone for Tadawul and the Kingdom as a whole. This will result in significant foreign investment inflows, which will further support liquidity in the Saudi capital market, already among the most liquid emerging markets in the world, and diversify opportunities for issuers and investors alike, contributing to greater market maturity and stability. The upgrades indicate growing investor confidence in the Saudi market, reflect the rapid and significant progress in implementation of capital market reforms in line with Vision 2030, and further signify the accessibility of Tadawul to international investors. It is an important step forward in achieving Tadawul's goals of becoming an active player in global capital markets, both as a source of capital and an investment destination, and of building on its current role as the regional hub leading capital market development in the GCC and wider MENA region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our main goal is to drive excellence throughout our higher education institutes and help universities continuously improve their performance measured against international standards. Toward this end, we built a new set of accreditation standards that respond to immediate and long-term needs that are outcome rather than process driven. The new accreditation standards are impactful, economic, flexible, and scalable. NCAAA does not yet work as inspection agency, but rather helps universities and faculty to build their capacities and improve their caliber for continuous improvement. We provide training, consultations, and a versatile range of support to all types of universities, from the oldest that were established a half century ago to the middle section created 20-30 years ago and the most newly established ones. Our accreditation standards concern two major domains, namely institutional capacity and educational effectiveness. For NCAAA, education is a major pillar of Vision 2030. It requires a skillful, impactful manpower, which is directly related to education and training, our core business.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Adaa has given a new momentum to Saudi Arabia's march toward a new era of transparency and accountability to achieve Vision 2030's goal to take the Kingdom to a leading position in every field. As an independent organization, Adaa reports directly to the prime minister. The last few years have been a period of continuous development and improvement during which our operational process has been further streamlined, and Adaa has been equipped with expanded capabilities to achieve its mandate. We are working closely with public entities to measure their progress in implementing the programs and initiatives that help them attain their objectives to create a culture of transparency and accountability in public entities. Adaa is tasked with performing timely and accurate reporting on government performance, and our mandate calls for two primary roles: measuring the performance of public entities in terms of delivering their KPIs and targets, and measuring satisfaction with government services, in which we have been particularly active. We launched our first set of citizen feedback tools in April 2018 for citizens, residents, visitors, and investors.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>By the end of 2018, our aim is to consolidate all operations in the railway project under one sole entity. This will be possible once a merger between the Saudi Railway Organization, a government organization, and the Saudi Railway Company, a government-owned company, is finalized, ensuring all work is completed efficiently and on time. In 2018, we will also seek participation from the private sector in key segments of the railway, specifically for links between the Dammam-Riyadh and North-South railways. We will also seek participation in the construction of the land bridge to connect the west and east coasts of the Kingdom. As for broader policy changes, Saudi Arabia is undergoing rapid changes and has already begun to make the necessary changes to ensure government operations run smoothly. Take the example of the Saudi Port Authority, which has undergone fundamental paradigm shifts in how it operates, the type of equipment being used, and most importantly, seen the introduction of digital tools to aid workflow processes and procedures.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The image of Dubai is accompanied by the words quality, innovation, and excellence. On the business side there are globally renowned exhibitions and Dubai has taken a major step by winning the right to host Expo 2020, which is a great achievement for a such a young city. From the millions of visitors to the Expo, 70% is expected to come from outside the UAE, which would be the largest proportion of international visitors in the Expo history. All these visitors will witness infrastructure of the highest quality and enjoy great networking opportunities and ease of doing business. In terms of our property, Address Dubai Mall, I am proud to say we have a 20-25% repeat clientele rate, somewhat significant given the competition in the city. This is exemplary of how people love the city. Transforming from a small village into a great city that is now a global hub, Dubai has a reputation for being a visionary city that does not follow but forms its own destiny through the spirit of possible and the wise foresight of its leaders.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our properties in the Middle East see a significant amount of business from within the region, but Dubai is becoming a key destination for visitors from India and China. We are starting to see more guests from these source markets. Our growing presence in China has also resulted in increased interest from Chinese travelers who want to stay at our properties when they come to the Middle East. Aside from guests from these countries, our Middle East properties have a loyal base of customers from source markets such as the UK and US, demonstrating that our accommodation is recognized globally and meets the needs of travelers from across the globe. This has contributed to the success of our current properties in Manama, Doha, and Dubai, which are enjoying average occupancies of over 85%. In fact, our presence in the region has boosted business from GCC countries to our properties in continental Europe and the UK as well.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is on track to achieve its 20-million-visitors target; significant infrastructure projects are fully deployed, leisure projects are coming online as planned, and efforts to promote Dubai globally are on-going. Dubai is currently the 4th most visited city in the world after Bangkok (20.2 million), London (20.0 million), and Paris (16.2 million); that is a remarkable achievement for a city as young as Dubai. Dubai needs to address four overarching trends. First, availability of skilled labor is vital. The recent growth in Dubai's hospitality market has exerted pressure on the quality of skilled labor servicing the industry. Second, the expansion of the MICE sector is important. Third, mobility and ease of travel are key to the success of a destination. Dubai's infrastructure has evolved significantly over the past 30 years, and the future is only looking better. Dubai is doing a wonderful job with infrastructure development and needs to keep at it—developing highways, metro lines, airport runways, and port docks. Fourth, the government requires funds to maintain security, promote the city, and develop infrastructure.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Ramada Chelsea has experienced excellent growth over the last year. Our market share has also increased despite the opening of many new hotels. We saw great growth in 2017 and expect to grow by 4-5% again in 2018. There is a significant rise in tourism in general due to certain decisions by the government and Dubai Tourism. The Dubai brand is doing extremely well, and the government has been focused on tourism, which is the backbone of Dubai. It arranges platforms for all hoteliers to come together and discuss how we can promote Dubai all over the world. Competition in the hospitality sector will grow significantly in the future. We expect many hotels to open in the run up to Expo 2020. Competition is always great; it makes you realize where you stand and what you need to do to stay relevant. Demand will change, and the strategies will have to change accordingly. It will definitely be a challenge. Dubai is growing and expanding rapidly, and there will be many new things to see and experience.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In our school of business, the focus is on establishing a center of excellence in entrepreneurship. We recently organized an international conference in entrepreneurship with a prominent keynote speaker from the University of Michigan. We are also working on establishing centers of excellence in finance, applied logistics, and other areas within our school of business. In our engineering and IT school, we are establishing a center of excellence in robotics and another in networks. Our goal is to be a leader in robotics by 2020, and we are collaborating with a number of partners to that end. Similarly, other schools are also establishing centers of excellence in their own fields; our goal is to be the best university in the UAE by 2020. In terms of improving our rankings, we have four areas of focus: academic reputation, research, industry collaboration, and further developing our alumni relations and internationalization.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We were the first overseas university to set up in Dubai International Academic City in 2005. It is a positive development to have more universities. Two years ago, we wanted to develop the China market for Dubai and went on a mission with the Knowledge and Human Development Authority and other universities to propel Dubai forward as a good proposition for education. Having more quality universities in Dubai International Academic City helps us put Dubai on the map. We would all individually benefit from that proposition because it means that we will be able to recruit students from outside. We used to get a handful of Chinese students in the past, and this year, we have nearly one hundred students from China. Heriot-Watt's entry standards are among the highest in the UAE, justifying the high tuition fee. We started the “Go Global“ initiative to move students around all of our campuses worldwide, and global exposure will help dramatically, especially in terms of employment.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>It has been a spectacular journey, and I am proud of it. Though, I have only been a part of the university since the end of 2017. We have two colleges: the college of medicine and the college of dental medicine. The medical college is a six-year curriculum and is significantly newer. We enrolled our third cohort of medical students in August 2018. Their impact on healthcare and healthcare delivery in the UAE is yet to be seen. However, our responsibility includes the continuing education of full- and part-time faculty and practicing medical professionals across Dubai, the region and beyond. This allows us to have an immediate and substantial impact on health and healthcare in Dubai and the region. Every year, we offer over 300 courses for health professionals from local and international areas. Via this channel, we have an even larger footprint and impact.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We regularly invite people from across the academic and business worlds. We have at least five research conferences throughout the year, including those in business, psychology, and accounting, among others. Every faculty member strives to get at least two industry speakers in their class every semester. We are focused on including speakers from across the world that have special knowledge and expertise in their fields. We want a blend between academia and professional life. I have no doubt that we have put together the best faculty and guest speakers in the region. And there are many synergies that come from having multiple campuses around the globe. Every year we send between 100-125 students to London to study abroad. We also receive students from the other campuses. Campus exchanges improve academics and administration. If something succeeds in one place, it is circulated across the globe. We have frequent faculty exchange as well, allowing us to regularly be in touch. Every faculty member has a partner in London because we deliver the exact same program.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We conceived several new majors in 2017, and everything we have initiated has been enacted or is in some stage of approval from our accreditation bodies. Among these new fields of study are a hospitality design program within interior design, a programs in artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical engineering, and a graduate-level management program in the school of business. At this point, we are also planning to add a business analytics major at the undergraduate level. We will offer psychology for the first time as an undergraduate degree, starting September 2018. For the first time, an executive MBA program was conceived in collaboration with Cornell University and will start before the end of 2019. AUD prides itself in being a preparation for life because of our focus on personal and professional development, rather than only on intellectual and academic development. We are one of only two universities in the entire Middle East chosen by TIME Higher Education for its employability ranking and among the top 150 in the world—that is the AUD advantage.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our distribution network comprises a 10,000sqm warehouse, and we recently added 16,000sqm in DC-2, our newest distribution center. Our advanced warehouse management system (WMS) is used to manage customer inventory. FCI enjoys a mixed client base that stretches from Fortune 500 companies to local companies. A new, twice-a-week freight line bringing airfreight from Miami to Panama has maximized operations. However, FCI's core business area continues to be its founding purpose: customs brokerage. The company manages most of the customs brokerage from the free zone to Panama. Our challenges in the past years have been working on balancing the diversification of our logistics services with different types of products—distribution, freight forwarding, transportation, and customs clearance—aiming to grow industries and customers. Our ability to innovate and bring new ideas help us remain at the forefront of logistics. Our foremost goal is to grow through sustained efforts in all departments. We want to give back to Panama and provide better lives for our fellow Panamanians. Commerce in 2018 is not growing as much; hence, the company's strategy is to maintain the operational cost as low as possible with technology and building efficiency in our processes and personnel. Every crisis leads to opportunities, and we will try to set up structures that allow FCI to thrive in the years to come.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>ClassIBS is one of the largest recognized organizations in Panama, the number-one maritime registry in the world, and 80% of our business activities comes from Panama flag vessels. The other 20% of our activities are from other flag states that recognize ClassIBS, such as Belize, Honduras, and Jamaica, amongst others. We are members of International Association of Technical Survey and Classification Institutions (TSCI) and are recognized by China Maritime Safety Administration (MSA). In addition, we are approved under the Code of Federal Regulations part 2.45 of the US Coast Guard, and our accomplished goals show our commitment to quality and safety standards. ClassIBS, as an independent classification society is duly authorized by several maritime administrations to carry out statutory surveys on their behalf. Our main activity with Panama Flag State Administration is to conduct surveys and issue the corresponding certificates. It is a technical activity that specializes in the safety and security of vessels. We have been authorized by Panama Flag State since 1995, and we are the leaders amongst Panamanian organizations in both classified and certified number of vessels. In order to ensure the quality of the vessels and our performance, we maintain a low detention rate worldwide, assisting the Panama Flag State in keeping its white list status within all port state control MoUs.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>King Ocean Services is a family-owned business that started in Curaçao. Panama holds great importance for shipping companies in the region; it would be a grave mistake to run a shipping line in the Caribbean without operating in Panama. Although business in the free zone has declined in the recent past, Panama continues to maintain an optimal base for service and communication in the maritime business. For example, Panama holds the key for transshipment, as shipping lines, both big and small, pass from here. There is no one dominant commodity that we specialize in, though domestic electronics is one category that records healthy volumes. We export a variety of fruits, and to a certain extent beef, seafood, and chicken. Panama's numbers are not comparable to countries such as Costa Rica, though for a country with a population of 4 million, Panama has a vibrant economy. The company serves a diverse list of clients dominated by local Panamanian importers and exporters. Our client base mainly revolves around the Panama market and Panama City. Also, there is a cycle of customers in the industry; clients switch shippers when encountering a problem. The key in the Panamanian market is that every customer demands speed in order to cut down on storage costs.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Expeditors has been operating for 39 years and has been in a great position in the global market. We are currently one of the top 20 global forwarders in the world, which is based on a strategy of information and service value add. We are in the top five from an ocean transportation perspective and in the top three from an air transport perspective. The company has evolved over the years, and our other competitors in the top 10 have more than 100 years' experience in the business. We have been in Panama for three years, and it is a different market from the other countries we have experience in, perhaps because of the economy around the Panama Canal. One of the main things we are currently working on is the development strategy of our warehousing and distribution, as the Panamanian market is not a big one. There is a market strategy to bring most of the Latin American imports from Asia to Panama and distribute them from here. We seek to enter that market; we are currently the number-one carrier in trans-Pacific trading from Asia to the west coast of the US and want to take advantage of that. We will also join the service for distribution to customers in South America and the Caribbean and Central America.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Our company is one of the pioneers in the ship supply business in Panama. Our history goes back farther than 1988, when the company was founded. We are now more of a general ship supplier, providing basically anything a ship needs. For 30 years, we have gone through many phases and changes in the shipping industry from a more informal market to one that is more technologically advanced. Our biggest achievement has been to stay in parallel with technological advantages. And beyond parallel, to be ahead of the industry, adjusting our mainframe to better suit the market. We are keen on efficiency and technology to create value adding processes for our customers. Today, we are not only ship suppliers, but also a logistics provider as well. We are like a supermarket for ships. We are a retailer and supply all the necessities that a vessel needs. This being a moving industry, there are needs for the ship itself and a crew. Our objective is to try to cater to the industry as much as possible in order to keep the journey smooth. While provide technical items, and food, as well as clothing for the crew. We are indeed a supermarket for ongoing vessels. We have about 15 refrigerated trucks, warehouses with more than 3,000sqm, and more than 4,000sqm of cold storage facilities.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Middle East is in the spotlight for cyberattacks in the world, possibly more than any other region in the world. It is the richest part of the world in terms of oil and gas, and this sets the region's infrastructure apart as an appealing target for cyber criminals and cyber terrorists. According to our Kaspersky Security Network, nearly half of all the attacks that have been stopped by Kaspersky Lab in 2017 were aimed at critical infrastructure and their ecosystems. At Kaspersky Lab, we pursue a holistic security strategy, which is based primarily on risk management factors. Cybersecurity must be on top of the agenda for every CEO, CFO, and risk management department. We have a market share of 31% according to IDC, and we are proud of this number-one rating. We have always been popular with consumers because we are a trustworthy brand. We offer a well-priced, award winning anti-virus program. Our main differentiator is having the highest threat detection rate in the market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Relevancy is the main challenge that all our clients face in their communication strategies. In order to become relevant to their audiences, one must start with the type of content. Brands face questions on how they can gain a space in the market and invest given the current takeover of social media in the communications world. Platforms such as Facebook enable anyone to add content and get data on who views that content. Thus, the answer to these questions lies in allocating money on content. Companies that have not adapted to the digital age face challenges, both internally and externally. Another aspect is how the government adapts to this trend and incorporates savvy employees to build frameworks for smart cities. For example, we are in the process of launching the first global Artificial Intelligence Readiness Index to test how prepared organizations, especially government ones, are in terms of comprehensively integrating AI. Market readiness has to do with regulation; as an entrepreneur, one must take risks and invest in R&amp;D.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>P-Link is a networking company in the Middle East that is most famous for its small office and home office (SOHO) products. In 2017, we mainly focused on SMEs and corporate solutions. We provide Wi-Fi solutions for hotels, schools, and shopping malls. TP-Link's SME solutions are now generally accepted by the IT industry and end clients, which is one of our main accomplishments. Another accomplishment is the launch of our Neffos brand, a prime brand for smartphones. 2017 was our second year in the mobile business, and our team has done great work, launching several new products. Our products are not the most expensive; we target customers seeking a top-quality product at an affordable price. We have positioned Neffos as a prime brand of TP-Link, which has 21 years of experience. Our secret to success is that we are manufacturers and can control product costs and quality. Dubai is our regional office with many tech companies here, making it a leader in the technology sector. From here, we can predict trends elsewhere.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The market is finally starting to adopt the cloud. When a company decentralizes and harnesses the cloud, it is better positioned to grow and develop. The cloud is a multi-purpose platform that can be utilized for workloads that require more computing power, for example, to lower a company's CAPEX bill, leverage the cloud for disaster recovery, or back up as a service. While certain workloads and data will be kept out of the cloud for various reasons, the cloud can still be leveraged in vital ways to make operations leaner and more seamless. Because of the relationship NetApp has with hyperscalers, our customers have the opportunity to utilize their data exactly as they would if they were managing it on their premises. We can even make their data mobile between clouds, so companies are not locked in to any provider. Using NetApp software in the cloud provides our customers with the same feature rich capabilities; hence, greatly reducing their footprint and the overall storage bill.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Among our products, Epicor ERP is focused on mid-market enterprises, and Iscala is focused on small businesses and the hospitality sector. In addition, we recently acquired Doc-star, which is a content management and workflow/document management-focused solution. Moreover, we have two products around business analytics and dashboards, Epicor data analytics and the PI, and have introduced an extension on the manufacturing execution system (MES). With MES, we complete the full business coverage for any manufacturing industry, bringing them full control over their shop floor and machines. We have a cloud-first strategy. We want to give the customer the option to select what fits their vision and strategies. The cloud provides a better ROI with a business application. We provide clients with end-to-end solutions and ongoing education so they can leverage technology to make better decisions to be more efficient and profitable. Cloud adoption rates in the region are 20-30%; however, within two years I can see it going up to 70 or 80% in GCC countries.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain will become a global platform for conducting transactions and building a ledger, eliminating the need for countries to have a centralized authority for currency. The UAE is committed to use blockchain in all government departments by 2020 and Dell is investing USD4.5 billion in R&amp;D annually. For Internet of Things (IoT), our strategy is about making it more intelligent by combining it with AI. Digital transformation results in higher susceptibility to attacks and Dell Technologies is well positioned to tackle that with Secure Works, a managed services security company, and RSA for identity management and advanced analytics. For cloud services we have Virtustream, a Dell Technologies company that allows customers to run their mission-critical applications on the cloud. In 2018, Data Hub Integrated Solutions, a fully-owned subsidiary of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority partnered with Dell Technologies to develop and deliver cloud computing solutions, integrated infrastructure administration services and servers, secure data storage solutions, and innovative information technology applications.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our devices are workplace assistants that help people to work more efficiently. All our devices have interfaces, and many of them have programable and customizable apps that can help with the workflow. Information security is another key aspect; when a document is opened on a device that sits on a network, there is the risk of an information leak. We partnered with industry-leading companies as McAfee and Cisco to ensure security. Scanning and archiving is a critical offering for us as well; banks and insurance and telecommunication companies that are historically heavily document intensive now have their documentation digitized by us. We enable people to share information throughout their organization in the most efficient manner, and software is an incredibly powerful way of doing that. On the office side, people want to be more efficient, reduce print, and control costs, while maximizing security and ease of flow. The convenience of connecting to and using any Xerox device from one core communication device is absolutely critical.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Since the foundation of USMA, law has been our primary focus because we want to facilitate society's fight against corruption. All the graduating lawyers at USMA have to sign an ethical agreement to commit themselves against corruption, which is one of the biggest issues in the world. In 2018, we are not only introducing new degrees but also technical degrees. This will offer the youth a possibility to acquire knowledge and abilities required to immediately set foot in the professional field. We took this step because of two reasons: to meet the increasing demands of the production sector and provide a higher number of technical employees to the private sector. The lack of technicians has forced professionals to take up technicians' jobs. I saw the problem first hand while I was the director of INADEH, which is the institution that prepares technicians for the public sector. However, due to the supply and demand gap, the private sector has been made to fill jobs in the public sector; USMA introduced technical degrees to solve that gap. We are trying to reach youngsters who need to work immediately to finance their education. Within the humanities department, we are offering general education electives, for example, a course on leadership or how to work in groups.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The university stands out in the area of health, especially in medicine. In the area of systems engineering, we are specialized in mechatronics and biomedicine. We are the only university that offers a degree in mechatronics; only Universidad Latina and another private university offer studies in biomedicine. The areas of business and logistics are strong here because of Panama's position at the global level. In 2018, we had the first graduation in master's in Educational Mathematics. We have also formed alliances with CrimsonLogic. For our students, this has been a great opportunity because they learn to create innovations that are related to the company. We also have a computer lab that allows students to apply a series of specialized computer programs and to work with a simulation of difficult cases in business. On top of this, we have the only Bloomberg laboratory at the university level as well as a courtroom; hence, students can see how a real-life trial is conducted. We have three master's degrees that are 100% online; however, Panamanians are not that used to working online. We are seeing the strongest demand for online courses from people who also work, and slowly online learning is taking hold in Panama.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>2017 was a new beginning for INDICASAT AIP; we started our first PhD program in English in 2011 and saw our first batch of eight students graduate in 2017. All eight of our PhD graduates from 2017 were from Panama. This has been one of our successful models for capacity building, not just in terms of students getting PhDs, but also building human resource capacity and research. From our graduate students, we have about 90 published papers, and we are also receiving international recognition. We have competent students with a capacity that matches any leading university in the world. Our second success story in 2017 was improving our infrastructure with a new building. This is the first international quality science and technology center in the country, and it allows scientists from Panama but who are working abroad to return to Panama and continue in their line of work. The center is called the Panamanian Research Institute for Science and Medicine (PRISM). The concept behind PRISM was to build up all of Panama's research competencies, including biology, medicine, and engineering in a campus similar to the US' National Institute of Health Campus model, which houses many institutes.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are a regulatory applications developer. We focus specifically on the Know Your Customer (KYC) process that banks use to identify their customers. Currently, KYC is a painful, inefficient, and labor-intensive process for banks. It costs the UAE financial sector close to USD1 billion per year to satisfy regulatory needs around KYC. At the same time, it is a process with an extremely high degree of duplication, both on the bank and customer side, when customers have more than one banking relationship. The norbloc KYC platform, Fides, allows for the KYC file to be carried between financial institutions by the customer, removing duplicated efforts both for the banks and their clients, saving time and reducing costs substantially. We use blockchain technology to store and share the information in a highly secure, auditable, and legally compliant manner. Blockchain technology allows customers to move, in an auditable fashion, their validated KYC information between institutions. Hence, duplication of efforts is removed as the recipient of the KYC file can also see the validating stamp of the first entity the customer has on-boarded. We are currently implementing our platform in two European countries with six financial institutions. We expect to be in production by early 2019 in markets covering around 20 million customers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Clearly is a digital neo bank; we do not have a banking license or our own balance sheet but instead partner with an existing bank that needs to transform digitally. We leverage an asset that we do not own, though we make money from that asset while helping its owner to create value. We are to banks what Uber is to taxis. Banks' current strategy of repackaging and rebranding their digital banking services does not represent a sustainable approach for the future. Banks pay us for every customer we bring them through our digital platform, and we receive the maintenance fee. Rather than come and disrupt the market, we partner with existing banks and disrupt from within, because it will benefit the entire financial ecosystem. Working with an existing institution allows us to enter the market more quickly, be efficient with capital, and benefits both us and the partner bank. Because the capital is already in the bank, we can focus on investing in technology and our brand. Any bank can partner with us and within 12 months have their whole digital bank set up, and this happens at zero cost to them because we bring the investment. It is a low risk way of building up their digital bank with us.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>With our SaaS offering, we have built a Bridg(e) that connects the offline with the online, but without relying on infrastructure as we are focused on emerging markets. Our patent-pending technology, OneConnect, enables such communication to occur between the devices without the need of additional hardware or connectivity. There are two different types of connectivity scenarios within our product. The first is the ability for at least one device to be offline. However, we also have a completely offline scenario where a user tops up their digital funds when they are online and when they are offline they can make transactions as they would with cash. Our product is Bluetooth based because it is one of the most democratically available, open source, wireless protocols in the world. Over 90% of smartphones in the world today are Bluetooth enabled. In addition, Bluetooth already has features such as connectivity and distance awareness, which are factors that add to security when it comes to a transactional environment. We go after developing markets such as sub-Saharan Africa, which have their own unique challenges. The number-one constant among developing countries is the fact that smartphones are becoming cheap, and cheap phones are becoming smart. We leverage this to empower the rapidly growing financial ecosystem.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We are a digital, peer-to-peer lending platform for SMEs. Retail investors come to our platform to invest in SME businesses in the UAE that seek to raise debt finance. Rather than going to the bank for a loan, SMEs come onto the Beehive platform. We check their application via our risk and credit model, determine if they are a creditworthy SME, and put them on the platform, where investors can bid to invest in that business. Once that is complete, the business will get the money and make monthly payments to Beehive, which will in turn distribute that money back to investors. This is all done on the proprietary platform that we built in house. We only work with SMEs, not start-ups. Through the technology, we allow people to invest amounts of money as low as USD25. That means people can spread their investments across the platform. Most importantly, we target a segment of the market that is a growth area. The millennials setting up businesses today are more likely to set up companies that are knowledge-based, digital, and asset light. We target such businesses that are high growth and connect with the community and audience.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Maliyya is a sharia-compliant P2P finance and investment platform. We give individuals the opportunity to invest with other individuals and avoid banks. We are disrupting the banking industry by removing banks from the chain. However, it does not mean that institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, cannot invest through our platform. The benefit of using our service is that it is cheaper, easier, and quicker to borrow through us. At the same time, on the lenders' side, it provides additional opportunities to invest, as well as more opportunities to invest for people with small investment sums. The major advantage of Maliyya compared to other platforms is that we are completely sharia compliant. Initially we are starting with the introduction of two consumer products, personal car finance, and real estate financing, both residential and commercial. The reason we came to Dubai from Azerbaijan to start Maliyya is that the UAE enables the implementation of fintech projects. We were selected by FinTech Hive amongst numerous applicants and are extremely glad to be here because the support provided by FinTech Hive has been enormous. The government here is doing a great deal to develop the fintech sector in many centers.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Whilst insurance penetration is still relatively low in the UAE and Gulf region as a whole, the insurance industry is starting to be recognized in this part of the world as a key growth contributor. AXA Insurance has been in the region for more than 65 years. In that time, we have built a sustainable business with strong foundations, of which we are extremely proud. Our vision, both here and throughout the AXA Group, is to empower people to live a better life, a great ambition that requires significant dedication from our side. We must bring the most relevant and innovative insurance practices to this market. We are at an advantage, as we belong to the AXA Group and have at hand a wealth of resources and talent from every corner of the globe to do so, and ensure it is right for this region. Another element that helps us reach our vision is quality of service: customer experience and customer centricity. Customer first is a core value at AXA, and drives our ambition and behaviors. The final aspect is risk awareness. It is our duty to make them aware of the risks and what is at stake for their families or businesses. Our communication team works on this continually, year after year.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, the major changes in the market came from the UAE Insurance Authority (IA) in terms of financial and investment regulations. It made a big change in the market starting from 2016 to streamline corporate governance and ensure standardization with international regulations related to the insurance industry. Thankfully, NGI started adjusting its systems in 2015 because we were aware of the draft and knew the regulation was imminent. The regulations ensure greater transparency overall for insurance companies and open their books to regulators as well as clients. We found ourselves having one of the highest solvency margins in the market because, financially, NGI is strong. In the first three quarters of 2017, we had a growth of 7% while our underwriting profit increased by 22% compared to the year before. For 2018, the number of sales agents will increase from 80 to 150 people, and we will open another branch in Dubai. We have nine branches now, and all are doing extremely well so we need another branch in Dubai. We plan, in 2018, for our new system to be 50% paperless and have this figure grow more in 2019. In 2018, we will study Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. We are also looking at Latin America and Africa, where we can add value in a growing market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>2017 was fairly successful for RAK Insurance. We saw a great deal of innovation coming into RAK Insurance over the last 12 months. For example, we launched our mobile app, improved the workflow of our website, and built more capability into our insurance application system. Overall, we have held our own and will hopefully have a positive, successful year. Technology will definitely play a greater role in our business in the future, and the year will see us continue with the development of our website with the introduction of more products and services. We are tech savvy as an organization. We look for technological solutions and have a good platform. This will link into developing our mobile application further in conjunction with our online portal. We are looking at moving some of that capability to other devices like Apple Watch as well in 2018. We are aiming to deliver more self-service to the client through all our digital platforms, including some first-of-their-kind solutions in the UAE. One of the areas we are looking at is allowing clients to settle their own insurance claims under certain conditions. We want to continue introducing more digital self-service capabilities. Companies that do not embrace the technology sector and invest in it will find it increasingly difficult to survive.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>As the leading financial center in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region, with an existing community of more than 21,000 professionals working across 1,750 firms, DIFC is the ideal platform to help both small start-ups and large financial institutions complement each other's offerings. As part of our inaugural accelerator program at FinTech Hive at DIFC, we have selected 11 start-ups to develop and test their technologies and work side by side with leading financial institutions and accelerator's financial institution partners such as Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, RAKBANK, Standard Chartered, Visa, and well-established fintech firms. We intend to bridge the SME funding gap in the region by offering leading technology entrepreneurs and companies the opportunity to exchange knowledge and develop the necessary solutions to meet the needs of a larger client base. The program's start-ups also have access to legal clinics and our independent regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). They were also provided with a working space that allowed them to host events, network with peers and competitors, as well as receive market feedback about their solutions. The 12-week program culminated in an 'Investor Day,' where participants were given the chance to showcase their products in front of 300 potential investors and partners from the region's financial industry.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Looking at the region in general, NCR has a leading market share when it comes to ATMs. In the Middle East and Africa, we have 58% market share, and in the UAE we have 77%. The UAE has always been on the front end of innovation, whether in government projects, the financial industry, or other industries such as transport and logistics. Many of our customers within the UAE have made regular visits to NCR's executive briefing centers and taken the opportunity to contribute ideas or views with our designers. A bank in the UAE was one of the first in the region to introduce what we call Interactive Teller Machines (ITMs). This solution has been approved by the Central Bank of the UAE and many other central banks. Dubai, and the UAE in general, has adopted such technologies, in turn providing input for the new video-enablement of the platform we are introducing through the 80 Series. This has greatly influenced the uptake of the new series in the region, which has been extremely positive. Around 10 banks in the region have committed to and placed orders for the 80 Series ATM, and several of these are situated in the UAE.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Turn8 is a VC firm that invests in young, early-stage start-ups. We also have an accelerator that provides more than just funding. We provide additional value by mentoring, providing guidelines, helping business development, and fundraising. We have invested in start-ups from all over the world. Our criteria for investing in a start-up are fairly clear-cut: faith in the start-up, the market, the technology, and the team. They could be based anywhere; however, once we invest in them we work with them to bring them here. Since we are early-stage investors, we find start-ups that are new and upcoming, and typically between seed and series A. We look at a start-up that still has a lot of potential to offer and  help it grow. Our model is that we will stick with the start-up for five to seven years holding equity, and then we exit with profit. Transportation, logistics, and infrastructure technologies have considerable potential. The automation of roads, transportation, and movement of products and services are the backbone of trade. The front end of e-commerce is saturated; however, the back end of e-commerce is the interesting part: supplying products, automation, security, and infrastructure. If there is a way to facilitate trade, that would be a winning formula.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The thinking behind Fintech Galaxy was to create a platform to join the dots in the financial technology ecosystem and to plug the gap that had opened up in the market for open innovation. Many financial institutions in the MENA region want more innovation but do not know where to start looking for it. Fintech Galaxy was created to help them find the solutions they need in a secure, cost-efficient marketplace through the crowdsourcing of innovation from global entrepreneurs. We will also provide opportunities and resources to start-ups in the region, helping fuel the growth of this important sector. Ultimately, Fintech Galaxy aims to improve the economy of the Middle East, create new opportunities, and change the face of finance in the region. The fintech market is developing fast. Regulators are moving ahead at high speed, in particular Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), where Fintech Galaxy is registered. There are a growing number of incubators and accelerators, and funding is also growing, although this still in the early stages. Dubai would normally be the natural hub for fintech in the region because of its developed infrastructure, its vibrant start-up scene, and the presence of investors. However, Abu Dhabi and Bahrain provide some healthy competition, and it will be interesting to see how that plays out.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We do not see banks retreating from the consumer space, though it will be crucial to see how banks respond over the next few years. If they manage to create strong analytics and data capabilities, then they can continue to build customer focused solutions. Banks are taking inspiration from the interactive services offered by challengers and building similar propositions themselves. Multinational banks are all starting to offer those services, as are the banks here in the region. Maybe they are not all there yet; there are better decision-making platforms and real-time analytics that they would benefit from implementing, but many of the fintech models are still applicable. The more innovative models have been successful. Peer-to-peer lending, for example, has created a lending solution for a segment that was simply underserved, offering a service that banks cannot or do not want to offer. At RAKBANK, we are adopting new technologies where it makes sense to do so, such as our partnership with Ripple for our RAKMoneyTransfer service to power instant remittance payments, using Ripple's blockchain platform and our deployment of both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay payment solutions. We are also adapting our core infrastructure to make it easier for us to work with fintech partners in order to provide enhanced service offerings to our customers.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company's history began in 2004. I had gained some experience from other companies, and the company gradually acquired new customers and projects. We specialize in buildings, particularly in building structures. Our biggest project is Bicsa Financial Center on Balboa Avenue. In terms of building construction, we are likely in the top five construction companies. We are currently working on the Costanera construction project, near Urracá Park, and The Colonial, as well as Empire projects, both in Santa Maria. We also have the Coral building project and are starting with Luxor 400. We are working on residential buildings as well as office buildings. At present, most of the construction projects in Panama are related to residential buildings. The sector is not on the rise, though we have always had a great amount of projects going on due to the property developers we work with. They are always building; that is their main business. Several years ago, the challenge was getting workers. Today, it is about making the work perfect. We want to provide excellent service to our developers. As the owner, I visit the projects at least once or twice a week, and this makes the project personalized. That makes the difference.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We established the company in 2014, though it started operating as Urbania in January 2017. Our initial plan was to focus just on three developments while we were consolidating and structuring the new team. After analyzing the behavior of the Panamanian market over the last decade, the partners decided to diversify the products on offer and divide them into three extremely specific business lines based on product type and location. Our core business, ALAMEDAS, consists of developing the local market, specifically around the outskirts of Panama City, with villas ranging from 50-65sqm created specifically for low-income families in order to offer them affordable housing opportunities. ACACIAS, low-rise buildings located in the suburbs of Panama City, are created for young professionals, allowing them to acquire property with the opportunity of using all of the loan advantages offered by the government. We also have SKY, mid-rise buildings located in downtown Panama City. These projects were designed for middle-income families that want more for their investment. Urbania has been able to grow and position itself in the Panamanian market. Our aim is to consolidate the company, both in Panama as well as internationally.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our main competitive advantage is a personalized and dedicated attention to our clients. We carefully manage all the details of the project, including quality control, the budgeting and rigorous control of expenses, and we are known for always completing our projects on time. In sum, we satisfy clients' expectations. Here in Panama, and the region, one of the issues people have with contractors is quality and the timeframes of the projects. We normally exceed expectations in these aspects. We focus on a limited number of simultaneous projects to ensure we are capable of satisfying and exceeding clients' needs. We live in a small country where the best reference is word of mouth, which has helped us significantly because many of our new clients were referred to us. Personalized customer service characterizes Construcciones RJT and has allowed us to grow and strengthen our name in the market: our brand is strong. We have reached a point in our evolution as a company where we've learned how to best navigate the private sector in the country. That is our preferred niche, known for less bureaucracy and more straightforward dynamics. We have been extremely successful in the private sector and prefer to remain that way.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our business solutions are for all types of industry because our products are open to customizations, which is something that large companies prefer. We have an excellent suite that works for almost 80% of industry while the other 20% we customize and make it happen for them. We can deliver a product that is standard and reliable as well as adjustable to the needs of our customers. We help our customers implement best practices without sacrificing how they personally do business. Our customers include the Felipe Motta wine stores, Empresas Bern, and Cable Onda. One of the biggest challenges is creating a brand in Panama so excellent that it will spread via word of mouth. There are also challenges in terms of limiting the technology because, if we import, we have a limit on how much we can negotiate in terms of prices. With the way things are in the economy, companies need to help customers survive this period. We can control our entire supply chain and production and can, thus, adjust to the market needs. Currently the market needs more accessible solutions, and we have a variety of products that will make them more productive.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>CrimsonLogic started in 1988 as a result of a recommendation from the Trade Facilitation Committee, established by the government of Singapore, to use technology to address a difficult moment in the economy. We expanded because other developing countries wanted to raise the bar and copy what developed economies were doing, similar to Singapore. Our principal markets are countries in the process of development. We aimed for Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, and our first operational business and marketing-oriented branch was in Latin America in Panama. This was the first office outside of Asia for CrimsonLogic. It was established in 2003 and went fully operational in 2011. Latin America is an interesting market, and it was a logical move. We chose Panama because at that time the Panama Canal Authority sought to put in place and develop a single window for all the advanced information needed to be submitted to cross the Canal or dock in any of the ports within the Panama Canal area. We won that tender in 2004, and subsequently established operations in Panama. Panama is a great place to serve as an operations hub.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Since our founding in 2000, we have established operations across the world. Our projects are spread across different areas, notably national security, social security, maps, health, and education. Moreover, we offer solutions for data centers and enterprise applications. In terms of partnerships, we have different partners according to various verticals in which we operate; Dell and Huawei are two of our known partners. Our current list of projects includes providing airport and public security and navigation solutions for Japanese ports, among others. We only partner with firms that make a difference because there are a great number of companies that offer products with inadequate qualities. In addition, our partnerships are based on a mutual agreement where our engineers can work on mixing products. The core of our business is largely different than other companies in Panama. Each project requires in-depth study, preparation, and analysis; the whole process can take up to two years. Following that, we need to assess the proper solutions because each company wants to invest in a different set of technologies.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Panama is an economically strong market. Our solutions can contribute significantly to the current digital transformation and to the growth of companies with our different tools. We want to include the best business practices that we have gathered from different countries for over 35 years in order to offer approved processes that allow customers to maximize their operations. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a commodity; we have tools for human talent management, a recruitment communication system, and mobile applications. For example, we have released the part of mobile approvals that allows one to approve issues of accounts payable, accounts receivable, purchase order, requests, and so on from their mobile phones. We want to focus on mobility because that is where the future lies; there is the facility for different executives to know what is happening in their company and operate at a certain level. The markets are changing. With all of our solutions, we seek to remove the technological barriers allowing the owner of the company to work at an optimal pace.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Business relations between Germany and the UAE have been developing tremendously over the last several years. We have seen a seven-fold increase in German exports to the UAE since 2000. Many small and medium-sized German companies active in the Gulf region and beyond chose Dubai as the headquarters for their regional activities. The German foreign trade promotion network AHK has been present with a delegate office in Dubai since 1999. The increase in trade and the growing presence of German companies led to the establishment of the German Emirati Joint Business Council in 2009, which now boasts over 500 members in the UAE and a has offices in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. In terms of German firms moving to the region, it is because Germany is fairly unique: there are few countries in the world in general where small and medium-sized companies have such a large share of international business, especially international export-orientated SMEs.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We celebrated our 30th anniversary in 2015. During the 1980s, there was a major push into Dubai by American oil and gas companies. The American Business Council was set up as an affiliate of the American Chamber in Washington DC. There are some 50,000 American citizens in Dubai, a significant community. Of the 3,000 American companies here, the American Business Council represents around 500 American companies in Dubai. These often run Asian operations, and some run everything in the eastern hemisphere from here. The reason for this is the high quality of life, though the logistics and the transport sector is a huge factor as well. There is also the commercial factor in terms of the ease of doing and setting up business. The UAE's long-term plan is to build an innovative and knowledge-based economy, and the transfer of American know-how is an important factor in this endeavor. In the current climate, we are focusing on a new objective: UAE investment into the US.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>BPC Dubai was formed in 2003 and is the largest organization of Indian businesses and professionals in the UAE. Although we are based in Dubai, we have members from all seven Emirates. Our primary duty is representing the 2.6 million Indians in the Emirates, the largest expatriate community in the UAE. IBPC acts as a bridge between our members and various government agencies and other actors. We also act as a catalyst in this part of the region to achieve the best benefits for Indian businesses and professionals. India is the UAE's biggest trade partner, and, reciprocally, the UAE is India's third-largest trade partner. Vision 2020's goal is to reach USD100 billion in trade between the two countries, which will be an increase of 33% compared to today. To this end, several high-level trade visits by India's leaders have increased the trade relationship between the two countries. This relationship has not only grown at the leadership and government level, but between the people as well.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The British Business Group Dubai &amp; Northern Emirates is proud to celebrate 30 years since its establishment. We were originally set up by a handful of business leaders from the UK who were either involved in their own businesses or had come to Dubai to represent British business in the Gulf. As one of the oldest business councils in the UAE, its purpose is to foster trade between British businesses, as well as the bilateral trade relationship between the UK and Dubai and the Northern Emirates. We are a not-for-profit membership group run by our own members on a voluntary basis. The BBG helps its members to build a network of relationships that establish or advance their business in Dubai, such as lawyers, accountants, local service partners, government connections, and potential clients. This is in line with the UK government's aim to bolster and increase the trade relationship between the UK and the UAE.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>2017 was a great year for the industry and Tetra Pak. The only other regional country performing as well as Panama is the Dominican Republic. Consolidation in the market is putting pressure and emphasis on reducing operational costs, forcing companies to look for alternatives, and one such way is through services. We focus a great deal on services, and our service business, lead by consulting, has grown by double digits. Our main customers are Nevada, Bonlac, and Estrella Azul; these companies seek to capture market share, and they place great focus on reducing operational costs. In the past, we only offered consulting services to direct customers; now, we offer them to the entire food industry. Quality in innovation is extremely important; we are always working on new packages, services, and products to maximize our position. Our ambition is to have a 100% renewable package. 2018 will be the 10th anniversary of “Tu Papel Cuenta“ campaign in Panama, which aims to create awareness among local consumers to recycle. In 2018, we will continue to focus on services and improve the level of end-to-end solutions we offer. We want to continue to help our customers reach their goals, which, generally speaking, revolve around reducing costs, improving the customer journey in the entire value chain, and bringing all our capabilities to Panama's food industry.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Samsung Panama is a regional hub for 23 countries in Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. 2017 was an excellent year for us, especially in mobile phones. In terms of total turnover, we are under the Latin American headquarters and have subsidiaries in many countries. Panama is a great place to manage regional operations due to its solid logistics and strategic advantages as a center; the country is also a great market for B2B activity and big multinationals such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Adidas that are based here. In terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR), we use our IT technology in mobile phones or tablets to educate students in rural areas through our Smart School program. In addition, we support initiatives to open a technology school and educate the trainees who we can then hire. Moreover, in 2017 we motivated school-going students to come up with solutions for society and selected 20 finalists out of a pool of thousands. CSR is one of our key tasks in all markets, and whether business is slow or excellent, we are committed to continuing our efforts. Our current market share stands at around 50%, and we want to sustain and manage that figure. We have the technology and the right products to make that a reality, and not just in the high-end segment, but also in mass products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>CEMEX has invested around USD600 million over its 24 years of operations in Panama. It is the only clinker producer, which is the main raw material for Panama's cement industry. We are proud to participate in some of the most emblematic infrastructure projects in Panama's history, notably the Panama Canal Expansion project, the Panama Subway Lines, the City of Colón Urban Renewal, and the first liquified natural gas electric generation plant in Central America. In 2017, we also entered the cement additive—admixtures—business, further helping Panama become a regional export hub. In terms of sustainability, we have several initiatives, including an effort to reforest 50ha in 10 years and working with other stakeholders to overcome challenges such as waste management. These are some of the projects under CEMEX's global initiative to reduce its CO2 footprint by 25% in the next three years. The biggest challenge is maintaining growth levels; Panama's economic model is changing and so are building methods, such as 3D printing. CEMEX has been preparing for the challenges ahead, and one key initiative is CEMEX Go: a digital platform aimed at providing a superior customer experience, providing a seamless experience for order placement, live tracking, and managing invoices and payments. It delivers real-time and detailed information, enabling customers to have more control over their businesses and increase value to their stakeholders.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The company was established in the Netherlands over 100 years ago, and it has been growing as a result of consolidation in the dredging market. Over the last 10 years, we have been diversifying the group and acquired Smit International and Docwise, which is involved in heavy transport that aids our offshore activities. We had our first project in Panama in 1987 and established ourselves here permanently in 1997. Our project in Colón is an interesting project that was revived in 2016; it was finalized in March 2018 after negotiating for almost a year. We delivered the sand to build a platform, but one of the challenges was that the existing seabed was extremely soft and we needed to place the material with certain care to ensure stability. Since the completion of Panama Canal's expansion, Panama has an increased focus on what it can do in addition to just transiting vessels and being in the shipment business. There is potential there, and for the last two years, we have focused on how we can further benefit from the canal's current operations. Through our experience, we offer ideas of how things can be done differently than what the client initially wants. This is an area in which we are competitive; our ambition is to work with potential developers and capitalize on the canal.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The diversification of the Panamanian market makes it an important part of our business network. Panama, along with Costa Rica, are the two most important countries in the region for us. The Panamanian market has a growing presence of international companies. In 2018, we have been restructuring our operations in Panama by establishing divisions that manage different lines of businesses. Since the company's headquarters are situated in Panama, it makes the country even more important in handling our regional operations. Panama is part of action number five of the OECD's BEPS project. This means that the OECD will review all the departments and governing tools and recommend changes across a number of areas. In total, the OECD has pinpointed three issues that Panama must modify in order to satisfy the organization's requirements. The Panamanian government is expected to follow the OECD's recommendations by YE2018; once successful, it will allow Panama to take its rightful place on the world stage. One of the main challenges in Panama is transparency issues. Nonetheless, Panama is a law-abiding country with a business oriented and a diversified economy. The country's connectivity, transportation, and communications network are unparalleled, and they are a major factor in why the country is attractive to companies. Our main goal is to finish our internal restructuring and to continue to establish our reputation as an employer in the Panamanian market.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Panama Pací­fico is one of the main projects in Panama with a mixed-use economic zone with residential, industrial, and commercial aspects, as well as an international airport on site, it is already impacting the Panamanian economy in a positive way. As the only mixed-use economic zone of its type in Latin America, the project is bringing multinational companies and is growing every year. We are delivering around 500 residential units per year, which is huge for a country such as Panama. On the industrial side, we are hitting around 400,000 sqm of warehousing. The target was 500,000 sqm in 40 years, but we have achieved 80% of our original goal in just 10 years. On average, three companies are entering Panama Pací­fico per month, with some big industrial names entering by end-2018. Our studies concluded that it takes a year and a half for a company to move its regional office, and we are working to improve that. Government projects outside Panama Pací­fico such as metro, bridges, and the widening of Pan-American road will have a great impact. Panama Pací­fico will create 9,000 direct and 5,000 indirect jobs. The salary and wage level at Panama Pací­fico is five times higher than the minimum wage in the highest wage area. Our most important aim is to attract and keep companies that generate quality jobs.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>PANEXPORT is privately owned and the first export-processing zone in Panama City. As a concept, free trade zones and any kind of processes for the handling of goods are still relatively new. Everyone recognizes Colón Free Trade Zone as the main player, so we have to add value to the products in order to attract new companies. It has been a hard evolutionary process because it is highly dependent on government's policies. The cost of promotion is high, and we have to promote the country first and then the location within the country. The industry has evolved over the past 10 years, and now, there are 14 free zones in operation or under construction. During the past six years, we were experiencing a growth trend; however, in 2017 almost everything came to halt. New investments will arrive, because every change produces opportunity. 2018 will be a challenging year, and the election in 2019 will add some level of uncertainty to the mix. At present, we have 24 companies in total, and they focus on all sectors. The majority of them are rum producers, bottling for well-known brands. Whether or not we attract new companies to our zone depends on our ability to plan long term. The main goal is to develop value chains with all the free trade zones here and in the region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Vacamonte Logistics Park is a family-owned property since 1826. As a result of its strategic location and proximity to the Bridge of the Americas, we decided to build a logistics park. We want to develop a community in the Vacamonte area, a space that consists of 600 acres. The logistics park was developed on 85ha; the first phase is now complete, including large access roads capable of handling large container shipments and the construction of an 8,000-sqm warehouse. We seek to attract three types of customers. We want to assist people bringing merchandise through the Panama Canal; there are many products that could be offloaded here, reprocessed, and reshipped via container ships or cargo aircraft. We are close to a number of airports that carry large cargo volumes, giving us a great leg up in terms of productivity. Our second customer base is businesses operating in Central America; Panama must become the port of Central America, and in order to ensure that, we must improve the transportation infrastructure. Our current customers are Mexican shipping firms and a US firm that brings technology from China to build pre-fabricated houses. Our third client base is distribution firms. In 2018, we hope to establish a free zone and begin construction on the second 8,000-sqm warehouse. This process should take about eight months because we have already completed the blueprints and the surveys.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Present challenges are related to maintaining the overhead costs of Music Hall, which are extremely high because we compete with places that operate with just a few DJs. We focus on quality and have many artists on stage. Our monthly payroll is extremely high; other places do not suffer from the crisis as much. We have the best locations in town and skilled employees, including waiters, kitchen staff, and chefs from abroad, who are all highly paid. Therefore, when people do not spend like before, the drop is drastic for us. We have to get extremely creative to maintain our quality and reduce expenses, which is a difficult management exercise. The venue is as packed as ever on Thursdays, Fridays, or Saturdays; however, our final sales are 40-50% lower compared to previous years. We always have change of programs, though classics will always be part of the show. As long as there is Music Hall, we must have iconic performances that will captivate the audience.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Sky Management was founded in May 2006 following the huge success of SKYBAR, which opened in 2003, and as we grew, we went into the restaurant business. We started with the opening of La Críªperie in June 2015 and in 2016 we opened SAX, a new experience where the art of dining blends with the widest selection of spirits and groovy live music. It is one of Beirut's most successful restaurants and bringing it to Dubai is our next step. SKYBAR Dubai has been in the works for years; we have been approached to open SKYBARs all over the world from Marbella to Las Vegas, and even Paris. We have found the perfect location and are moving into the Dubai market in October 2018. As a group, we are extremely passionate and detail oriented. We recruit staff with great knowledge and experience, rather than opting for inexperienced labor. Every project we go into is for the medium to long term, which is why we have been able to sustain our brand for so long. It is about paying attention to details, making sure your product is always on top, and surrounding yourself with the right people.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Yacht Vision was established in 2008 with one brand, Prestige Yacht. From 2008-2010, we sold 10-15 boats, which was an amazing result for our first years in Lebanon. We continued with Absolute Yacht, one of the biggest and finest shipyards in Italy. We had great results between 2010 and 2014, which were some of our best years. Every year, we have dealers meeting with companies to understand latest designs and technology trends, such as joysticks that allow owners to easily operate 15-20m boats. Our target clients are people who love the sea; we have boats that cost USD5,000 as well as boats that cost USD65 million. In terms of aftersales service, we have a company dedicated only to maintenance and servicing. In addition, we have a crew for service and cleaning in every port. We also have a service that provides a captain for owners who do not want to hire a captain just for a trip. Notably, we provide a free two-year service to every new client.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our beach park project is owned by WATERNATION SAL and was developed with YUCCA Holding as a beach water park and a members-only beach, which is a new concept in Lebanon and set to launch within 3Q2018. The company will select the members and one cannot become a member without an invitation, no matter how much a person is willing to pay. Moreover, the beach club, called the Beach will open along with the first Mediterranean restaurant by the sea. From Tripoli to Tyre, all the restaurants along the beach are Lebanese restaurants; however, we want to feature a proper Mediterranean beach and we are truly breaking the norms. The second phase of the project is a beach Water Park, called Blu Beach Park. It covers an area of 40,000sqm and we plan to open it by summer 2019. In terms of challenges, bureaucracy was the biggest one; just acquiring permits from the Ministry of Tourism and municipalities took a year. Comparatively, in Dubai there is a one-stop shop for all permits and unlike most countries, Lebanon doesn't have a tourism board that provides assistance.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Since Lebanon is a small country, it has a volatile economy of which the construction sector is a major part. However, at BERM, we were fortunate to maintain a certain continuity in our line of business because we provide a specialized service. Not many engineers currently specialize in structural engineering design, as they seek higher-paying engineering jobs elsewhere. We still work on some Lebanese and MENA projects and also back them up with projects in Asia and Africa. It is easy to design something expensive; however, we provide a more profitable and efficient design, which is why we have repeated business. In Lebanon, we have residential projects, museums, hospitals, and even factories. We also design and oversee the execution of a new glass factory; the current trend is to bottle dairy in glass and not plastic. All factories require a structure to perform these activities, and we deal with the design of these structures, making us one of the main go-to companies</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We operate in Lebanon, Nigeria, and Qatar and to a smaller extent in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. We have a branch in Syria, though it is currently idle, and a partner in Jordan. The market that will shoulder the most growth in 2019 will be Nigeria, a market with a population of 180 million which generates its own momentum particularly in infrastructure. The collapse of the market there in June 2014 has opened opportunities for new Nigerian contractors. In Lebanon, we have confirmed orders though we have not yet received the down payment, which clearly means there is a situation of wait and see. Moving forward, we want to reposition ourselves in Saudi Arabia and keep an eye on Syria. We are also keen on expanding to West Africa. We want to focus on environmental products, namely the recycling of concrete and water. From a revenue perspective, I do not expect anything remarkable in 2018, though our efforts in 2018 will have a great impact.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Over the past three years, the Lebanese market has gone through a period of consolidation as 2015 was a tough year for the steel market. Many players in the market reduced their imports because they had to purchase raw materials from China in advance. In addition, prices of raw materials were decreasing, sometimes by USD100 per ton, resulting in businesses reducing imports. In comparison, we have a steady weekly demand, and we never speculate because a large portion of our sales is retail. The cost of debt is expensive in Lebanon. There are infrastructure problems where if one is delivering by truck, for example, they will deliver less per day because of congestion. Moving forward, we would like to be optimistic as Lebanese people have always been tenacious; the problem is young people leaving the country to find jobs elsewhere. We need to create an environment where they feel economically secure in order to truly reconstruct the country.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The construction business in Lebanon has been suffering for the past few years due to economic crisis. However, we expect things to get better, since we went through successful discussions with France, the World Bank, and the international community, and we look forward to seeing some change and having more reconstruction in Lebanon's public sector. Abniah is a construction company with a mission to implement construction projects including structure and interior design. We are executing many residential buildings, complexes, and towers and recently started the MEA Green Office Building within the airport. Abniah has been accredited with the ISO label for its reliability and well-accomplished performance. The future depends on developments in the region. Lebanese human resources are in high demand; therefore, many Lebanese leave to work abroad because of lack of opportunities in Lebanon.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Today, the cloud is being implemented through digital transformation, which is touching everyone's lives. Some industries have to make the transition a little slower than others due to regulations or other challenges, but many firms are jumping on this technology. SMEs have made a particularly quick transition into these new technologies. Smaller companies without an IT department are much more likely to outsource their IT services, and that is why we have seen such growth. We have also seen a significant shift in manufacturing and retail. There has also been a good deal of development in the financial services sector, despite the challenges coming from the Banking Secrecy Law that imposes sovereignty of customers and transaction data. Despite this, the banks have been creative in going to the cloud with other workloads, to benefit from cost optimization, scalability, and security. We are lagging a bit behind in cloud technologies in the public sector. Lebanon has never had a ministry focused solely on developing and implementing new technology, and we are in vital need of one.<br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Site Technology is an integrator, supplier, and contractor with a focus on four main groups: contracting, technology, power, and power generation. Most of our projects are confidential since they are related to the government and security agencies. Telecom contracting manages the fiber-optic network's backbone for telecom companies, private networks, as well as public networks, such as the military. Site Technology is one of the industry's leaders in the region and deals with institutions on long-term basis. We deliver countrywide biometric security systems. Our services also cover audiovisual systems for transmitting video conferences. The company is currently working on smart cities, because the products we offer can be integrated to build smart cities, airports, and universities. The network integration systems division is a gold CISCO partner that taps into the Internet of Things, which is practically the backbone of modern technology. The Lebanese market is full of potential and has a large need for infrastructure to support the ongoing influx of technology. We hope that 2018 will be the year for restarting investments in the region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Security is vital. Today, security and compliance are two important areas for which lots of resources in our group are being dedicated. Security is tricky, and it will only get worse with time. In the past, we have been involved in the provision of various solutions related to IT security. As a group, we are looking to provide 'security as a service.' It will become more and more expensive for companies to have in-house expertise in security, which is where our managed services come into play. We plan to amortize this huge cost across many customers, making security cheaper and more affordable without reducing quality. Even large organizations, like banks, cannot afford to retain an in-house team of security experts. It is essential to partner with a company that is able to invest in and sustain such a team. Many customers are fully aware of that reality, and we have built a state-of-the-art security operating center (SOC). Our affiliated company Cirrus specialized in cloud and managed services and provides “security as a service“ as an integral part of its portfolio.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are looking at export markets, which is one of the reasons why we built Beirut Beer in the Beqaa Valley, as it is halfway between Damascus and Beirut. The Syrian market is extremely important for us, and the Lebanese alcohol industry reflects positively on the Syrian market; all marketing on local TV is watched by Syrian consumers. Being halfway between Damascus and Beirut was a strategic decision, and the Syrian market is a target once those sanctions are removed. Beirut Beer should be the number-one beer in Syria because Syrian consumers highly view Lebanese habits and consumption. We sell to many wholesalers, and there is a large volume going to Syria in parallel markets. In addition, we are developing certain export markets such as the UAE, France, the UK, the US, and Australia. Lebanese restaurants are popular everywhere, and having a beer named Beirut in those restaurants would mean they offer a true Lebanese heritage. We have the capacity currently because our investment was built taking into account this capacity. Three-quarters of our volume will be sold locally while one quarter will be for export markets. Beirut was one of the most challenging brands to register and develop; yet, we did it. When we entered the market, we wanted to declare the fact that there is now 100% Lebanese beer.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are the only distributing company in Lebanon to exclusively represent three of the top 10 spirits companies in the world. Since the company has a dominant position in the luxury premium spirits segment, we have developed The Cask &amp; Barrel, a master class to train professionals and consumers in different luxury premium spirits and categories. It is a functional area because we organize many dinners and private tastings for different types of people. Vrinks is an upcoming project that will be the first online platform purely dedicated to the online sales of our spirits brand. This a platform that we are opening under G. Vincenti &amp; Sons, and anyone in Lebanon can order alcohol and get it delivered to their home within 48 hours. People will find bottles and even services such as bartending, bar setups, and more. The civil war had a significant impact on the industry, as many companies left the country and started operating from Syria or other countries. We stayed in Beirut, and this marked a huge difference between G. Vincenti &amp; Sons and other companies. In the post-civil war era, we had a dominant position in the local industry and decided to expand our reach to other parts of the region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of the key developments in the beer market over the last few years has been the launch of Beirut Beer, which after four years really started to make an impact. After continued high investments it managed to make inroads in the market, especially with the introduction of the 25cl small bottle with the ring pull. This is a new proposition to the consumer at a magical price point of LBP1,000 (USD0.67). In April 2018, we started with Almaza 25cl priced at LBP1,250 followed by Al Rayess 25cl at LBP750. This way we cater for all consumers' wishes in terms of price and brand image. The Almaza 25cl launch was supported by a strong and smart media campaign including continuous presence on social media. So far it delivered the results we were aiming for as we gained market share. In addition to this, Almaza is back again at the top of mind, which means at the top of the shopping list of our consumers. In 2018, we celebrate our 85th anniversary. It is our ambition to stay the undisputed leader in the Lebanese beer market for at least the next 85 years. One could say that the introduction of Beirut Beer is helping us introduce necessary changes to the company.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have two banks: one focusing on investment, private banking, and wealth management and the other focusing on commercial and retail banking. We provide complete banking solutions to our clients, which is why we are growing at a rapid pace. Furthermore, we try and think differently in terms of reaching out to our clients and servicing them with the products we offer. We currently have equity of USD350 million, which translates to a liquidity ratio of around 40%, the highest in Lebanon. At the same time, we have the fastest-growing rate in terms of total assets, total deposits, and loans, which we hope to increase further in the coming years. When it comes to retail and investment products, demand is balanced between both sides. On the investment side, we focus on investment solutions that cater to our ultra-high net worth individuals. This includes real estate and private equity solutions. These are sophisticated solutions that we provide to our investors in markets that they otherwise would have no access to; there is a growing demand for that in Lebanon and the region. On the retail and commercial side, we focus on the middle and smaller markets, in which space there is high demand for differentiated service. We also provide SMEs with the quality of service that our ultra-high net worth clients get in the private banking space.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Banque Misr Liban S.A.L. ended the year with total assets of over USD2 billion, net profits of USD13.65 million, and deposits growing at 6.09%. At the end of 2017, Lebanon had some political turmoil, which negatively impacted the banking sector. Luckily, however, this turmoil didn't last long. The economical environment has changed positively, confirmed by the two conferences in Rome and Paris that had a tremendous impact on Lebanon—our expected growth for 2018 is now at 5.28%. One needs to stress the high foreign country reserves of the central bank and the great performance of its governor, Riyad Salemeh. As for BML's strategy to continue attracting the diaspora to deposit in Lebanese banks, our strategy is to focus on the 14 million Lebanese scattered across the Gulf, Africa, Latin America, Australia, North America, and Europe who have become successful entrepreneurs. BML recently opened a representative office in the Ivory Coast to cater to the Lebanese working across West Africa and providing them with full banking services out of Lebanon. In fact, Banque Misr's network will soon be able to service the Lebanese living in Egypt, the UAE, France, Germany, Russia, and China.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>First National Bank was founded in 1994 and conducts all types of commercial and investment banking activities under the supervision of the Central Bank of Lebanon. We are among the top Alpha Group banks in Beirut, and our bank sheet exceeded USD4 billion in total assets at the end of September 2017. We have 6,660 employees in our group. The bank has three arms in terms of financial institutions: the bank group head; FNB Capital, the brokerage arm of the group for stock, equity, and security trading; and FNB Finance, the leading Beiruti company for microfinance. Another company currently operating under the umbrella of the group is CFH, the investment arm of the bank specialized in creating special purpose vehicles (SPV) in the real estate business, restructuring companies, and bringing equities to companies. Its activities are mainly based in the Gulf and Europe. It brings in investors and consolidates equity in order to enter into certain transactions and restructure companies. The banks cover retail, FNB Finance oversees microcredit for non-bankable people, and CFH covers advisory services. We will have a great network of 29 branches by the end of 2018. This group is headed by our chairman Rami El Nimer, who is extremely active in terms of commercial banking and banking activities.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the nature of the debate surrounding quotas for women in the public sectors in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RAYA HAFFAR AL HASSAN</strong> The issue of the quota is fairly controversial, not because no one wants to execute it per se, but because it further complicates the already complex electoral system in Lebanon. Adding another layer on top of the confessional-based political system and the sociocultural sectarian values makes the whole equation significantly more complicated. In addition, parliament has passed a new proportional electoral law that further complicates the electoral process and compromises the fair representation principle. However, studies have shown that without a quota system, women in certain societies cannot reach political positions based solely on their credentials and qualifications. This is the case in Lebanon, where there were 130 female candidates and only six were able to reach Parliament, and half of which were already affiliated with certain politicians. Moreover, politicians need to realize that having women in leadership positions is not just about human rights or equality, but rather a matter of smart economics and enhancing productivity and efficiency. Diversity in politics drives economic development. This is something we need to work on as women to raise awareness on the importance of female involvement in decision making.</p><p><span></span><strong>JOELLE ABOU FARHAT RIZKALLAH</strong> The complexity of the quota is not a reason not to implement it. A similar quota has already been implemented in 128 countries around the world, with many of those countries facing similar issues to ours here in Lebanon. It is a must. Without the quota, especially in politics, women will not be able to reach political positions. We have only had eight female ministers in Lebanon since 1945. This has, and will continue to, influence the business world.</p><p><span></span><strong>MONA BAWARSHI</strong> I used to think quotas were insulting to women, though I later realized they could be used as a stepping stone. If having a quota is the only possible way for women to take on governmental positions, then why not? We need women everywhere. We realize it when women reach a top position, for example in Parliament, and make a huge difference.</p><h4>What is the situation like in the private sector?</h4><p><strong>RITA RIZK</strong> To be able to move forward, quotas are a necessary “evil." However, in the long term, having quotas in companies and the private sector is not something that we should even consider. It should be about performance and competence and nothing else. That being said, first we need to grow the pool of women leaders and change the basis of our laws and policies to encourage more women to grow within organizations. If we look at the majority of women in business, we can see that they remain in low management positions most of the time. The involvement of men in the process is crucial.</p><p><strong>FOUAD ZMOKHOL</strong> I am all for the quota in politics. Women want to change the system, and there was a lot of interest from women in terms of running for positions, but the result just was not there. However, when it comes to the private sector, I have a different mentality. We already have a diverse private sector, competing with any other private sector in the world. We are proud of the women who work in the Lebanese private sector. Most business owners seek to build dynamic boards of directors, and they understand that it has to include women. Yes, there are barriers for women in the private sector, and it isn't easy, but that boils down to everyday competition. It is a competitive world, and I want to keep it that way, because it is healthier for business in the long term.</p><p><strong>TAMARA SALHA </strong>Many men are invited to sit on boards without necessarily any question regarding how effective they are in corporate governance; whilst I see more and more women, such as myself, attending workshops to get certified in corporate governance. I felt that I had to get this accreditation so that I would have more relevance and validity to address my right to be on a male-dominated board. Speaking from the perspective of family-owned businesses in the private sector, if we had a quota, it would encourage people to open their minds and be more prepared to ask for such qualifications from all contributors.</p><p><strong>SALIM ZEENNI</strong> I am for the quotas, no question. However, we live in a country where quotas could lead to abuse. It is more a question of education. We cannot place quotas in without educating people about why they exist. There were over 100 women campaigning in the last election, though who could say if they were all qualified? I am not saying that 900 men are qualified to be in political positions either; however, quotas can lead to such a counter-argument. Still, there must definitely be a great effort to encourage more women to present themselves as candidates in general.</p><p><strong>JOELLE ABOU FARHAT RIZKALLAH</strong> Why are we judging women at all before giving them a chance to step into public life? Let us give them a chance. Women have the right to succeed or fail, just like men. Before any woman steps into politics, people are already saying she might not have the required degree or that she may not be capable. We are judging them already. I suggest we give them a chance; let the quota give them that chance. Today, women are 30 years behind men in political life and business; the quota simply puts women on an equal footing. Since we are working with the American Lebanese Chamber of Commerce, I would like to remind everyone that the US has implemented a quota for all minorities, which includes women. This is key in enabling women have a chance to reach high positions.</p><h4>How relevant is the scenario of the glass ceiling predicament for women in Lebanon at the moment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RAYA HAFFAR AL HASSAN </strong>Most men do not comprehend what we mean by the glass ceiling. The reason why we call it the glass ceiling is because it is subliminal. It is not overt or tangible, though all women have felt it at one point or another. It creates a need for women to have to prove themselves even more and puts an additional burden on us. As women in Lebanon, we are socialized to assume a much larger workload at home, for example. The glass ceiling is there, and the fact that it is difficult for women to balance life and work makes it difficult for women to achieve higher positions. The only way to handle this, as has been done in more developed countries, is in terms of maternity and paternity leaves and flexible work schedules.</p><p><strong>MONA BAWARSHI</strong> In regard to flexible times for men and women, I have found that introducing flexible time for women alone is not conducive to equality and respect in the workplace. When I came into power in my company, I removed flexible time as being solely for women. Flexible time should be divided between men and women.</p><p><strong>TAMARA SALHA</strong> At the end of the day, diversity will only take place and be embedded as a culture if it comes from leadership downwards. As a woman in a leadership position, my responsibility is to open pathways so that women do not have to fight on their own. The trend in leadership, whether male or female, is shifting from the “I know it all" concept toward empathy and soft skills taking precedence. The drive for results is not at the forefront; however effective listening, empathy and people skills are also required and increasingly championed. Our duty is to focus on enabling women to make the leap from mid-management to C-level. Our responsibility is to lessen the rigidity in terms of schedule to make it possible for high-potential female talents to break the glass ceiling. It is not only up to them alone; an environment of trust and safety is required so that women believe they can come across and reach positions and share their concerns, without being judged or fearing judgment.</p><p><strong>JOELLE ABOU FARHAT RIZKALLAH</strong> The glass ceiling is about competition. It is important for competition to be fair, though how can it be, when men have the privilege of being completely dedicated to their job, while women have domestic tasks or family responsibilities? The solution would be creating more awareness among men to handle 50% of the tasks that women have at home. I am not blaming men because they have been raised this way; it is the fault of society. We need to change this by raising awareness that women want to be fulfilled by a career as well, and they have every right to do it.</p><h4>What needs to be done to encourage women in the informal sector in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FOUAD ZMOKHOL</strong> 12% of the world's women can be considered entrepreneurs as per recent statistics. However, we need to push to raise more awareness as well as ensure there is more advice and financial support available for women, so that they are encouraged to take more risks, and to formalize themselves in this segment. Another interesting fact is that the growth rate of entrepreneurs worldwide is 32% for men and 213% for women. There are five or six times more women looking to create companies. These are the numbers we need to think of and consider as well in the case of Lebanon. Less credit goes into newly formed companies led by women, compared to those led by men. I believe we need more newly formed companies at this stage of development in the Middle East, knowing that 86% of our economy is based on SMEs. We are entering a period where it is increasingly difficult to secure financing and interest rates are rising around the world. Companies that exist in the market are looking for young entrepreneurs of both genders to work with. We're looking for ideas, dynamism, and new propositions, and we truly hope that these are coming with women at the helm.</p><p><span></span><strong>RAYA HAFFAR AL HASSAN</strong> Some of the solutions to boost women in the SME segment could be as easy as setting up an online portal that woman can access. Entrepreneurship and SMEs offer a way to foster gender equality, so a portal that allows women who are working from home and would like to access certain courses or material, or a forum for a debate with other women would be extremely beneficial.</p><h4>The World Economic Forum predicts gender parity will not be achieved in 100 years given the current rate of change. What practical measures could be implemented to accelerate gender parity?</h4><p><span></span><strong>JOELLE ABOU FARHAT RIZKALLAH</strong> In addition to implementing a quota, I want to point out that there are many discriminatory laws in place in Lebanon. We need to allow women to pass on their nationalities to their children. We also need to create a law that would allow women to open a bank account for their children. Can you imagine a CEO of a company who cannot open a bank account for her children? All these small, discriminatory laws weaken the image of women as leaders. We need to help women in this regard.</p><p><span></span><strong>RAYA HAFFAR AL HASSAN</strong> At government level, we have a list of measures that could be adopted; there is a great deal that can be done. Aside from the quota that must eventually be passed, there are economic and structural challenges that must be addressed; the entire economy has to be driven toward growth. There are structural rigidities in the economy that prevent us from fully exploiting the potential of women and young people as well. We could pass legislation for anti-bias and anti-sexual harassment in the workplace. We can also advocate for more transparency, such as forcing companies to publish data on the distribution of men and women in the workplace and the compensations paid to each.</p><p><span></span><strong>RITA RIZK</strong> We also need to talk about improving education, even at a primary school level. It is worthwhile to consider the pressure placed on young boys, as well as on young girls. The former are being brought up to provide financial stability to their families and to be responsible for families' major decision makings, while the latter needs to concentrate on raising the children and taking care of household matters. This can be a huge burden on men/women who possibly see themselves in reverse roles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Kettaneh Group was established in 1922 by four entrepreneurial brothers who then grew the business through trade with Syria, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. Lebanon was the core from which Kettaneh then serviced the region by bringing in products from countries such as France, Germany, and the US. Lebanon is our most significant market for historical reasons but also because most of our businesses are present here, automotive with Audi, Volkswagen, and Å koda, energy and automation with Siemens, pharmaceuticals, medical, and aesthetic products. We have other revenue streams, namely energy, automation, and construction projects, and this business line is project-driven. In 2017, we had an USD18 million project with Electricité du Liban (EDL), which was a major project. We also have various projects in Saudi Arabia for close to USD80 million. To maintain profitability and efficiency, we ensure every line of business is independent. As CEO, I act as the financier for the businesses. Each business “borrows“ money from the top and must have a business case for the return on those investments. We measure performance quarterly and decide whether to shift financing from one business line to another or growth based on performance and where there is potential for better returns.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are a Lebanese company, and it is our duty as an important player in the economy to continue persevering until we see the light at the end of the tunnel, economy wise. We are certain that once the regional conflicts subside, Lebanon will return to its previous growth levels, and so will our business. Lebanon remains the showcase for the region and is the showcase in our own business in the region. Our healthcare business is thus far the best performing. We represent the top leading firms in this sector that continue introducing new innovative drugs that spur growth. Over and above that, healthcare is less sensitive to economic downturns as compared to other industries. For 2018, we will continue to focus on aggressive growth, both organically and through acquisitions. We will continue improving our efficiency in doing business, which becomes critical in economic downturns. On top of that, we will continue previewing risks and mitigating them in advance. In a nutshell, our plans do not vary much from the plans that led this group to persevere successfully for more than 120 years. Our method to success can be explained in one phrase: resilience, optimism, and business as usual despite all risks.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The main part of Tahseen Khayat Group's business is publishing, which is a diverse field. We are particularly involved in educational publishing and have publishing houses in Lebanon, the GCC, and the UK. It is not only about textbooks; a great deal of our work is publishing government syllabus and training and developing materials and keeping these up to date. The government, schools, and universities are large clients for Tahseen Khayat Group in all the Arab countries we work in. In some markets, we cater to the needs of private schools and universities, while in others we work with government education institutions. Tahseen Khayat Group has been doing this work for 50 years, and it is not really a matter of expansion; it is more a continued focus on opportunities and upcoming business. We also involved in the engineering and contracting sector. Typically, there are periods of increased activity in the construction business and other times when the industry stagnates. However, it is always a sector in progress. The prospects for the construction sector in Lebanon are extremely positive, despite the various wars and now the Syrian crisis. Despite all this, the construction sector has never gone down.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Within our company, Mexico is a relevant market because the pharmaceutical market and different health services provided in the country are important at both the regional as well as global level. Latin America, for example, should account for around 9% of the total sales of pharmaceutical products as a group, and Mexico is the second market in Latin America. Therefore, for most pharmaceutical companies, it is important to have a presence here and commercialize their products. In terms of the strategy of the company, Mexico is a great place to develop clinical studies. We also develop other services related to the tracking and measurement of the pharmaceutical market here, technology services that we provide for clients, as well as consultancy services. Meanwhile, our acquisitions have been global and already have a presence in Mexico. We are a new company and integrate our services in the clinical studies area that Quintiles had as its main services. We also integrated CRM services with another acquisition as well as databases for physicians tracking and communicating with them. The traditional business that we used to have in the past is more oriented to consulting services and technology. Everything together results in a larger company and a more holistic approach to our clients giving the full breadth of services. It benefits everyone, including IQVIA and our clients, because now we can serve them better.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>From a group perspective, it is an important region. We have been suffering for the last two to three years due to certain regional circumstances, the main one being Venezuela, since we used to do a great deal of business there, but have halted operations for the time being due to the economic and social situation. The situation in Mexico was also critical; there was a significant devaluation in the last couple of years, as well as in Colombia, which hit us critically, as we used to be a USD500-million company here but have had to reduce our business in a significant way. We are assessing the amount of business that we lost. This is a challenging situation, and we are looking at ways to continue to push our organic growth. We need to find additional opportunities to acquire from a regional perspective, either certain companies or products to ramp the business up to the level it should be. This is the situation so far. From the group's perspective, Latin America is a key arena due to the business model we have. We need to understand what areas to be focused on and which regional opportunities to pursue, since from a group perspective LATAM should be the third leg of the group.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Globally, Novartis is well recognized for the high level of our investments in R&amp;D, which is close to 20% of profits, which has resulted in one of the strongest R&amp;D pipelines in the industry. In terms of how this translates to Mexico, we have been able to launch important molecules into the Mexican market thanks to all this innovation. For example, we recently launched a molecule to treat heart failure that is changing the lives of thousands of patients with heart disease. Innovations at Novartis are happening around the globe at the same time they are being introduced in Mexico, which is great. We have several other molecules coming up that will be launched in the Mexican market as a result of our strong pipeline. Novartis has several research centers globally, and we are constantly working on innovations to provide healthcare solutions for patients in different therapeutic areas. Of the major problems the country is facing, cardiovascular disease is one of the biggest issues and something we need to tackle as a health community. Another related issue is diabetes, a major concern for the government and industry. The third is cancer and is another area where you will see a lot of innovation from different companies, including Novartis.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In Mexico, wine remains an aspirational product. However, Mexico has one of the most important cuisines in the world and for many, wine is the best drink to accompany food. Mexican wine is not yet internationally known, and we still need time to achieve recognition in the global market; however, Mexico's industry is discovering the potential. The country is famous for its cuisine and beverages such as tequila, mezcal, beer, and pulque. Based on that reputation, we are certain that Mexican wine will achieve popularity. While we pride ourselves on being a family business, we want to behave like a professional company; the company employs only two relatives among its 150 employees. We were industrial grape growers for wine for 25 years but we entered into wine business 10 years later. La Redonda is a young winemaker but that suits perfectly to Mexico's current wine boom. During these 15 years, we have professionalized ourselves and have invested in the equipment and in the laboratory to achieve better results. Moreover, we have innovated in the field by adopting techniques from Australia, for example, protective nets against rabbits. La Redonda is one of the few vineyards in Mexico that adapts its production according to a region's requirement.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Querétaro used to have around 3,500 acres of wine planted and now we just have 600. We plan to grow in the next four years and we want to have about 1,000 acres. In total, the vineyards receive 650,000 visits a year and that is because we are close to 40 million people that can drive two hours from their homes to visit wineries. Currently, this is the first time that 50% of the wine consumed in Mexico is made in Mexico. The wine industry grows by double digits a year here. When tourists come here, that becomes a huge industry because they visit resorts, hotels, and real estate properties. Places like this offer colonial tourism as well. 3.5 million people a year come to visit Querétaro for many different reasons. In Puerta Del Lobo, the economic impact is about MXN2 billion (USD102.36 million). We are creating more than 3,000 indirect and 250 direct jobs. For the wine industry in Querétaro, we are the largest investors currently. We are number five in Mexico as a resort development as well in terms of wine tourism. We have great support from the government and it understands what we are doing to build this investment here.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Sala Vivé is a leader in wine tourism in Querétaro and Mexico. The main thing is to generate a family environment. It is essential to prepare our people before opening our doors. The team must understand not only the process of production of wine, but also that wine is a culture, and there is a human effort behind it. After realizing this, the team must be able to transmit this wine culture. When visitors arrive, they go on an hour-and-a-half tour to visit the store. Later, they taste the wines and make purchases. This business does not only involve a single actor; it is necessary to develop a wine region. The challenge is to encourage other grape producers to produce wines instead of just selling grapes. If they create wines, people will come to Querétaro and view it as a wine region. The Viticulturists Association of Querétaro (AVQ) was born in 2010 when wine tourism began to grow, and others saw a business opportunity. A committee was formed with a president, a secretary-treasurer, and an operating committee. Once a month there is a meeting with all the vine-growers to talk about the needs of the region and to help with the positioning of Querétaro.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We develop everywhere where there is a need for quality housing. We prefer vertical developments; we mostly build in suburban areas, though there is a trend of people returning to city centers. We are still looking for a formula that goes well in city centers where we can deliver a way of living that is different from any other development. We have been in talks with many funds and they find us attractive because we have been in the market for almost 50 years; for a fund, this is important as there are companies that have grown significantly but do not have the resilience to stay. Government regulations can learn from us the benefits of high rises. Newer constructions do not have problems so four or six lots can be merged to construct taller buildings with more open spaces. There are many things that can be done to improve the quality of life in urban developments and we have the chance to do it now.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are planning the first development in Morelia measuring 1,000ha. We decided to go in another direction and build the key portions of the project first, including a shopping mall, university, hospital, gas station, and a sports center. From the beginning, we have focused on the quality of life for people living there; all the streets have pavements for walking, trees, bicycle lanes, and a great deal of landscaping, including lakes. We are currently on our 10th project and every time we learn something for the next project. The model that we develop is tough to replicate in major cities because it is impossible to find large pieces of land. The difficult part sometimes is that the laws are completely different in each state and for each piece of land there is never one owner. We do not plan on going to Mexico City because we have a great future doing small projects. Our priority is to finish current projects before moving onto new ones.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Terrafondo Capital is a private fund that was created a year and a half ago; MXN1.5 billion was raised in equity and another MXN1.5 billion was brought from banking institutions to create a fund of MXN3 billion. We created the fund for three main reasons: first, we wanted to turn the company into a more institutional vehicle with better internal control, auditors, and a board of directors in order to operate at a level of a public company; second, we wanted to diversify; third, we already had a series of projects that belong to the fund and have profitability far superior to the competition. Prior to the fund, Terraforma bought a plot with equity and presales in mind. The fund replaced the capital of presales with the capital of the fund, reach the edge of the price we estimate and this improves the yields markedly. We realized we were leaving a great deal of value on the table because we did not have a secure funding structure.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>As the company has grown, we have always tried to find different sources of investors in order to diversify our platform. We have been lucky to forge great relationships with foreign institutions and we were not yet focused on Mexican investors. Regulations changed, but the CKD is still a new product despite being around for around 10 years. Mexican institutional investors were only allowed to invest in fixed income, so we saw an opportunity. Most of our platform and projects are here, meaning Mexican investors are right to put money into domestic projects in order to reach desired returns. Hence, we raised MXN5 billion. We are seeing mixed-use as a global trend for multiple reasons, but mainly efficiency and quality of life. There was no infrastructure in the suburbs so we decided to change our policy and bring people back into the urban centers. As land becomes more expensive, in order to make a project work you have to go vertical.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We import supplies such as Kevlar or iron from Colombia and Finland, though a large part comes from the US. The main challenge that security companies face is unfair competition, as well as a lack of regulation enforcement in the armoring industry. We are part of an intercontinental association of armor companies as well as the national armoring chamber. 2017 was the most violent year ever recorded in Mexico in terms of crimes involving murders and kidnappings. 20 years ago, clients who purchased such a product were wealthy and elite. However, the prices and type of present products has reached other clients. We invest the most in technological investments in terms of steel. We always have partners that innovate and make advancements. Currently, we have two products that have changed the market: Dragon, a level III glass that not only protects against shotgun fire, but also assault rifle; and the T Rex glass with an eight-year warranty, a unique feature in the market. We manufacture armored personnel carriers for the army; the Wolverine, for example, is a vehicle with protection level B6 or UL10. Furthermore, we have also manufactured Centurion, which is used by the Mexico City Police. We do not only have commercial armoring; we also have them for the government and cash-in-transit companies. Few companies encompass these three branches.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our quality is our biggest calling card. 2017 was a great year for us; the industry has been growing and we have evolved with new armor and vehicles. We should close 2017 with a 30% increase, which is not a typical figure. It has also been a year with many challenges and lessons that we have learned for the future. Currently there are around 90 registered companies registered as armoring companies and competition has become bigger; however, there are a number of non-regulated companies and this is one of the biggest challenges. All our clients are in the private sector; in the future, we might be interested in working with the government; however, in Mexico that is a complicated subject. Insecurity has always been an issue in Mexico; drug cartels and criminal organizations change every single year, which is why there is a strong need to continue to innovate and offer better options. One trend is the continued reduction of the weight for armored vehicles. Manufacturers are working constantly on new designs and technologies which is important for the armoring sector. We hope 2018 will be a great year, and we will work to make that happen. We seek to improve the quality of our products, processes, and procedures within the company. As for the industry, it will continue to grow and the growth trend will continue. We expect a busy 2018.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Currently, we have a production capacity of 600 vehicles per year; one of our cars can withstand 800 bullets and that is an exemplary quality. In 2014, we decided to participate outside the Mexican market and began to export. We opened an office in Austin, Texas, and started looking at markets around the globe. In 2016, we made our first export to Egypt and in 2017, we exported to the UAE; we had to endorse our quality with European certifications to excel. The level we export to the Emirates is higher than what we offer in Mexico. B7 Level has little demand in Mexico because only high-ranking government officials request them. After exporting commercial vehicles, we decided to produce military vehicles and participated in an exhibition in Abu Dhabi with military units and high-luxury armored units. We currently have projects in Colombia and Peru and have plans to expand across Latin America. Mexico has not solved its problems of insecurity so we expect the market in Mexico to grow over the next three years. We are migrating from purchases to leases, where clients choose the period. At the rental level, we have 63 armored vehicles, the largest fleet of armored cars for rent. The rental business works because VIP clients have high mobility and they demand full-time protection wherever they travel.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, Volkswagen Financial Services Mexico was keen to have a new software product to manage its business fleet, so we established an official company in Mexico in April, 2017. Once our first project is complete, we can spread our wings and look at new  projects. Since we opened this office, we have seen a great deal of interest not only from Mexico, but also from companies in other Latin American countries. In Mexico, networking is extremely important, and we seek to build that network going forward and get more clients interested. Within Mexico, we have certain challenges regarding new regulations, including a requirement for every invoice to be stamped by the government authorities. These regulations came in at the beginning of 2018, and we have to adapt our project to cover these requirements. Although Volkswagen is our priority, we are working to get more clients.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Mexico is a fast-growing market; it was a strategic decision to open our LATAM flagship office in Mexico because it is the ideal market from which to expand regionally. The size and maturity of the automotive industry and numerous opportunities in terms of digitalization also contributed to its appeal. Close to 95% of our work is in the automotive industry, but we also have some clients from the FMCG industry. We mainly focus on data driven and innovative solutions for the digital transformation and making sure our clients have the processes and IT infrastructure to increase the value of the automotive sales and aftersales business. Also, we help Mexican companies that want to be cloud ready by supporting them to scale on a global level. Moreover, we have a great deal of experience in data warehouses (DWH), CRM, and scalable predictive business intelligence (BI) models. In terms of goals, we want to prepare automotive professionals in Mexico for the digital transformation by focusing on data driven solutions that increase the ROI proven value for our clients.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Guillermo Ortega, iTexico's co-founder, invited me to visit Mexico to explore leveraging the technology talent and proximity to build a new type of company servicing US clients; this is the genesis of iTexico. Our near-shore model provides an option for customers looking for talent in a geography where there is more collaboration, communication, agility, and time zone alignment. Our focus is on getting the right talent at the right time through hiring carefully and by investing heavily in training. In IT, the US worked with teams in places such as India, Latin America, and Eastern Europe but for a variety of reasons, Mexico was not on the forefront. Mexico provides a number of advantages over other locations: things move faster here, people communicate and interact well, and Mexico provides access to bilingual talent, allowing companies to create solutions for millions of Spanish-speaking consumers. We achieved our goal to exceed 200 employees in 1Q2018 and are now aiming to grow our YoY revenue by around 60% from 2017. Moreover, we would like to build up our practice around blockchain and IoT.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company made a location analysis. Today, the aerospace industry has two major markets—Europe and North America—with a third one growing quickly in Asia. There are important players in North America that are a tier below the major company, Boeing. This middle segment is rich, making the entire region important for us. The industrial growth of the Mexican automotive industry developed the technical infrastructure required to give birth to a homegrown aerospace industry in Mexico. The aerospace industry really started to develop around 12 years ago, and a lot of companies entered the market. This development has seen an even bigger jump over the last eight years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have many competitive advantages for this industry in Mexico; the first is the availability of human talent in terms of specialized technicians and engineers. This industry has its own features and characteristics that significantly depend on skilled people and the right talent to be developed for the industry. It is also the best cost platform for the US and Mexico has become part of the equation in the America's aerospace market. We have not fully developed a supply chain yet, though Mexico's potential to develop a consistent, efficient, and cost competitive supply chain is another main competitive advantage. Currently, most of the R&amp;D of the industry is being done outside Mexico; however, efforts are being made in this respect. For example, the establishment of National Center of Aeronautics Technologies (CENTA) in 2018 will start generating the right R&amp;D for Mexican operations and aerospace industry.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We need to develop, for our interests and the interests of the country, the supply chain in Mexico. We work with the Mexican Federation of Aerospace Industries (FEMIA) on this issue, and there is a new commission within FEMIA to achieve concrete results. We are thus expending a great deal of energy on this topic. The first challenge is education. When we open a plant, it means we need to prepare workers for the fabrication of the most sophisticated parts. We prepare them a year in advance, sending them to France or other countries just to get prepared; it is a long process. To further develop this, we have the French-Mexican aeronautics campus in Querétaro.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The relationship between the public and private sectors has been strong; we are the result of setting up public competencies for developing the human personnel for companies and need to work closely with the private sector. This gives us the opportunity to put our graduates in many of these companies, eventually developing technologies for them. We have a client-oriented process, from administration all the way to technological solutions, either in terms of training or research. And these links with companies are part of our daily work. We develop curriculum with them, create labs with and for them, and develop technologies with them. UNAQ initially focused on developing training for the different sub-sectors within the industry; now, we are developing technology and supporting both public entities and the government on developing public policies. We are part of public policies developments that we need to create together with different points of view for industry 4.0. We have the entire support of the industry itself; we are a global industry and need to comply with all the specific standards.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Latin America has been the region with the fastest growth in recent years, ahead of Asia, though we only represent 6-7% of the global revenue. The northern Latin America area grew by 200% in 2016 while Latin America as a whole grew by 136%. Latin America features great opportunities for expanding our market penetration. We do cover all market needs; however, we focus on some specific sectors. For example, banks were the first to use analytics as a tool in terms of risk assessment and fraud prevention, and they are still the biggest users. Mexico is actually one of the countries where we have the highest penetration in the public sector, with 45% of governmental agencies using our services. The level of software penetration is similar to countries like Colombia, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, where companies aim to cut production and maintenance costs through information to improve effectiveness, productivity, and sustainability.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Mexico is our essence; we have been in the market for 17 years. Mexico accounts for almost two-thirds of our business. We have a worldwide hub here that easily connects with the US in the north and traditionally has strong bridges with Europe and Asia in terms of economic agreements and treaties. Financial institutions use huge hardware boxes to process transactions but customers are now used to personal devices. Financial institutions must face challenges such as fintechs and AN Global is helping them through design thinking, agile development, and dev-ops. We offer multiple high-end services including advanced analytics, digital marketing, sales uplift, and cloud offerings. Digital transformation in Mexico is unfolding rapidly. Industry 4.0, with the application of advanced analytics above cyber physical systems to forecast and replenish worldwide supply chains, could sustain Mexico's reputation as the place of choice for a manufacturing company.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The idea behind Axity is to have a Latin American company that will serve Latin American clients to achieve business value through the digital transformation journey. We focus on retail, manufacturing, telecoms, and the financial sector, both banking and insurance. When we approach a client, we understand their industry and the specific challenges that they face and co-develop specific solutions. Latin America is a step behind Europe and the US; however, we are picking up speed quickly. The country has become an interesting source of talent for global corporations, and that is also part of the goal of Axity: to become the global partner for nearshore companies that have close cultural and geographical proximity. Our main goal is to help our clients in their digital transformation journey by co-creating digital solutions that accelerate their processes and make their companies more agile to attend to their specific markets and targets.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>NEORIS was established in Mexico, although its headquarters are in Miami. The Mexican market continues to represent a significant region for NEORIS. International Data Corporation (IDC) ranks Mexico as the second-largest regional market for the IT industry, representing 23% of the IT services market. Financial services, manufacturing, and telco are the top-three sectors with the greatest growth potential for IT services in Mexico. We have four major industries of focus: healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and telecommunications. NEORIS is the only global partner of SAP in Latin America. We have developed a strong expertise in SAP technology. Coupled with our global footprint, we are able to service multinational companies wanting to roll out solutions across the globe. In terms of goals, we want to maintain our double-digit growth rate and continue with our digital transformation initiative.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Currency volatility is the biggest challenge for the industry in Mexico right now. In 3Q2017, the industry went down. Nobody knows what volatility or uncertainties will occur with the new government. Past elections have never created the level of volatility we experienced in the currency in 2016; so, right now it is really difficult to say. We do know that as a country we need to continue to create employment so that the economy generates more income and our GDP grows. I have heard that Mexican GDP growth is going to be 2.1% in 2017, and the automotive industry is the most important industry in the country representing around 3.1% of GDP. Central and South America are really important for Mazda. We have a robust presence in Mexico and the Pacific Alliance countries. Our intention is to continue growing in those Central and South American markets.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>KIA is at the technological vanguard. We are one of the first brands in Mexico to have a hybrid SUV for the domestic market and such vehicles are already trending in the market. KIA also has plug-in hybrids, electric cars, fuel cells automobiles, and developments in autonomy. For Mexico, we are just waiting for the right moment to start bringing them because well-designed infrastructure is needed for electric technology. There is an analysis of what has been done in other regions with this partnership between the private initiative and the authorities to develop this faster. Mexico can still generate incentives and such partnerships. Our Niro is the second-best seller, and the only hybrid small-SUV within the Mexican market. There is an important increase in the sale of hybrid vehicles, up to 30% compared to 2016. Mexico has to move faster in that sense, though it is one of the areas of opportunity that the country has.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The perception of Chinese cars in Mexico when we entered with the BAIC brand was poor. This was because of the market's negative experience in the past with the cheapest FAW brand cars imported from China and sold through Elektra stores with a poor business model that did not include solid aftersales support. That was a bad experiment for Chinese brands entering the Mexican market. What we learned is that we need to offer different dealer networks backed by servicing and so forth. We had to work hard to reverse that perception. There is definitely a range of quality with Chinese products; however, in the car industry the quality is excellent. We are changing that bad perception and have turned a corner. Both sales and dealerships are growing rapidly in Mexico. We want to grow our vehicle sales three-fold YoY from 1,000 units in 2017 to 4,000 units in 2018.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The premium market in Mexico, despite the fall of the global market, continues to grow, albeit more slowly. However, in 2017 Mexico became the first premium market in Latin America, ahead of Brazil. The Mexican market will grow in parallel or surpass the Brazilian market in the coming years. The luxury market weighs much more in Mexico than it does in other markets such as Brazil. The growth of Jaguar Land Rover as a brand was the fastest growing in recent years within the premium segment worldwide and that was achieved by being faithful to our brand positioning. We want to remain a moderately accessible luxury item; we will not be high premium. Our ambition for 2018 is to double our sales. It seems like an ambitious goal; however, it is fully achievable. In 2018, we will bring in six new products and we have a network that has an in-depth growth plan.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Acommon strategy across emerging markets is establishing a strong brand position among consumers. This is extremely important for our industry. Mexico, however, is slightly different from the previous countries where I have worked in Asia, because consumers here have great knowledge of automobiles. Our challenge is to continue solidifying our position. In terms of production, in 2014 we started a new production facility in Celaya, Guanajuato. We have to supply high-quality products into the US market. Needless to say, the US market is the most important market for Honda. I expect 2018 to be a complicated year because it seems as though the US market has already peaked. The 2017 sales record may be the highest for a while, and growth in 2018 may be flat. In Mexico, sales dropped a fair bit between 2016 and 2017, and sales for 2018 indicate that it will be another tough year for the industry. However, I expect us to grow and innovate, offering new products and ensuring excellent customer service.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Fintech companies will improve financial inclusion and reach out to those people who have been left out by the traditional banking system. Banks can then take advantage of this by offering their products to this larger banking population and compete with fintech companies for the clients they generated. This is great for inclusion and for the banking sector as a whole because competition raises quality and is always better. For traditional financial institutions, it may not be a great idea from a business point of view to take their distribution channels and offer products to people who are not in the financially included sphere; banks are businesses after all. However, fintech companies have agile systems that allow them to reach these unbanked people. However, traditional banks are not placing obstacles in the way of fintechs as strongly as many would think. I have not seen them opposing fintechs in a blatant way. Currently, many fintech business models are not directly acknowledged by the system.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In terms of the current financial infrastructure in Mexico, it is not ready. We did not see the growth coming in terms of the things we needed in place to help the digital economy grow in scale as rapidly as we are experiencing now. One specific example is a technology that, unfortunately, is non-existent in the Mexican market: an address verification system. When making an online transaction with a debit or credit card, there is no way to confirm someone's zip code from their billing statement at the time of purchase. In addition, as we migrate to more online transactions, the fraud that was occurring with card transactions is moving online with the presence of chip and PIN cards. Fintechs today are not trying to grab market share from each other but rather enlarge the market. The only way to make the market bigger is by collaborating.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Fintech in Mexico has an amazing opportunity to be frontrunners and the hub worldwide. Here, there is an absolute need for differentiated and different types of financial services. Around the world, the retail banks that are making the most money are in Mexico. That means, in Mexico, we are paying a lot of money for financial services, services that banks are not doing correctly. There is a huge opportunity to disrupt banks and provide a better service. If we take that together with the fact that only 40% of Mexicans are banked, imagine the amount of opportunity. Still with only 40% of the country, we are the ones creating the most money out of retail banking. The opportunity to make the country a better place to live, to make more money, and to make a better economy, comes a lot through fintech in Mexico. Our main goal for the next round of the Seedstars World Contest in Switzerland is to convey this necessity and opportunity.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We focus on getting access to information that is relevant to this business and interpreting it in such a way that we reach the final end goal that any traditional financial institution would look at. There is a great deal of data out there, and banks have an accounting team, a finance team, and tax team. When any bank analyzes information, they measure two things: payment capacity and willingness to play. The willingness factor is extremely relevant the smaller one is. The fundamentals do not change here; we are still analyzing two things. We gather the same amount of information that a typical brick-and-mortar lender would ask for. With that information we paint a more complete picture of what the payment capacity and the willingness to pay look like. Through such solutions that are more fueled by technology and digital services, we have greater accuracy in the risk part than a traditional lender. We have seen this with the numbers that we have.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, we broke records for remittances. We are still waiting on December's numbers; however, in 2016 we stood at USD26 billion and we are already at USD28 billion without closing 2017. The remittance corridor from the US to Mexico is the largest in the world and, thus, a massive part of the economy. One of the things that this enables is that one can send any amount of money across the world for a few cents. We looked at enabling remittances from the US to Mexico and realized it was extremely complex. We started to work on the first stage, which was creating infrastructure for Mexico to connect to the new digital economy. Instead of offering a B2C solution for remittances, we offer a B2B service for remittances. We work with regulated money transmitters that have the ability to move US dollars to Mexican pesos. They move money via cryptocurrencies, which is currently the most efficient way to do so.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>ın the hydrocarbon sector, there is currently a lack of infrastructure. The most important activity after the production of crude oil is refining, and Mexico's current refining capacity is no more than 1 million bpd. If we do not want to continue to import, one of the major changes should be in refining. Second, another area that should be looked at is pipelines. They are the main driver of an efficient energy industry to move crude oil, LPG gas, natural gas, and refined products. We always seek opportunities, though there is still a great deal to do in Mexico, and there are many possibilities. We have the US as a complementary market and already have assets there. Mexico will become a net importer of gas, and we should focus on the US to bring more gas from production centers to Mexican markets. We have to complete construction of our platform and hopefully by 3Q2018 we will have gas flowing all the way from Baja California to Guadalajara. We would like to continue expanding our network, and Fermaca will be active in liquids, which is where we are heading. Even though there is a tense political climate, Mexico is mature, and for investors, this country is a safe bet.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The rationale for Kiewit coming to Mexico all grew out of the energy reforms. We saw that with those changes, there could be many excellent opportunities for Kiewit in Mexico. Furthermore, several of our customers in the US and Canada were already coming to Mexico based on the energy reforms and were in touch with us to see if we could be of assistance. Based on that, we came down and started looking around and liked what we saw in terms of the reforms and companies here. It was all positive, and it made sense for us to explore opening an operation here in Mexico. Mexico needs all the things that Kiewit likes to design and build, including power plants, oil and gas facilities, roads, bridges, and mining facilities. Everyone in Mexico seems to agree that there is a need for additional hydrocarbon storage. We look at our bid prospect list, and there are more fuel terminals on the list of things to bid than anything else. We find many opportunities to bid for work in that area. The new players in the retail market coming into the Mexico market such as BP, Shell, Chevron, and Total want to have the ability to import their own fuel and control their own supply, and that all results in additional fuel terminals.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The energy division, despite being relatively young, is extremely successful. We started with engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projects in the electricity sector. We have worked for both the public and private sectors. We decided to invest in generating electricity using co-generation plants. We deliver electrical and thermal energy to an anchor customer and have surplus electricity that goes to the grid. We handle everything with power purchase agreements (PPA). Today, we have two plants. We offer clean energy because our co-generation is efficient. Additionally, our rates are lower than those of the Federal Electricity Commission's rates. We signed an agreement with Siemens for small gas turbines of 5-15MW that are used for co-generation projects. Siemens will deliver the turbine engines, and we will assemble in Mexico all the packages that integrate the generator, such as the cabin, ventilation, and fire system. Regarding solar energy, we are evaluating the acquisition of a 10-MW project to develop it into a solar park by the end of 2018. Solar energy will be significant in the Mexican market. The efficient co-generation we developed under the old law was considered clean energy, and our customers are exempt from the purchase of clean energy certificates.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Private equity has been growing at an impressive rate over the last 15 years, and we have been growing at a rate of 20%, which is very promising compared to other emerging markets. This growth is a sum of factors. First of all, public policy around private equity in Mexico has facilitated growth and supported entrepreneurship in the country. Prior to fondo de fondos, or fund of funds, the only investors in Mexico were international; no locals were taking the risk, so fondo de fondos emerged in 2006, and with it the government took part in the development of the industry by taking the risk indirectly. As of now, Fondo de fondos has invested in 70 private equity funds in Mexico and has a major impact on the growth of private equity. After that, the most important change was the change of pension funds to an asset class as of 2011. They have now deployed around USD9 billion out of 18 billion in that asset class. They are investing in private equity, infrastructure, and real estate. Another major public policy surrounding SMEs was the creation of the National Entrepreneur Institute (INADEM), which discovered that entrepreneurs in Mexico were not getting funding. As of now, they have invested in 42 different capital funds, each of which can invest in at least 10 start-ups.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are not many options in the Mexican market, but CKDs are a vehicle where most institutional investors are allowed to participate in Mexican infrastructure. This is a regulation that came into force approximately seven years ago. Until then, AFORES, Mexican pension funds, were allowed only to invest in stock and bonds—though this included both public and private, and international and national—but not in projects directly with the risk associated to the project or developer. This is a relatively new regulation, and by implementing this, AFORES, which have some USD160 billion under their management, were allowed to participate in financing infrastructure. The major advantage of this vehicle is the possibility of pension funds financing highways, water projects, electricity plants, and pipelines without the requirement of investing in a company that has many different sectors. Our first fund was USD175 million and our second was close to USD400 million. Once they saw they were interesting projects, they decided to move ahead with a larger amount. The appetite for risk is now larger than it used to be, and people better understand the risks compared to 20 years ago. They have been professionalizing the teams inside the pension funds, which also allows for investments in areas not previously explored.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Pacific Alliance II Fund is the official fund of the Pacific Alliance, which encompasses the countries of Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. For several years, we have noticed amazing entrepreneurs coming from these four countries. We see entrepreneurs in Mexico City wanting to grow their business in Colombia or Chile, and vice versa. When it comes to telling the story of Latin America outside of the region, it is important to show stability, size, and perceived risk. These are four countries that have somewhat stable democracies, independent central banks, and floating currency exchanges. When we are trying to raise funds, we talk to the world's big tech companies, which all want to participate. However, it is a hard region to tackle, and we do not have yet the best possible reputation. We have learned tons of lessons from the first to second fund. Fund one was mostly about Mexico, which at that point in time made sense because we were mostly in Mexico. We started to see pipelines and explore trends, and we were trying to form our own opinion about what was an excellent, exciting, and entrepreneurial company. It took us four years from starting the investor network to setting up our first fund, the Angel Ventures Investment Fund One.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Alta Growth Capital's previous two funds taught a number of lessons,  most notably, the value of raising enough capital to execute a strategy correctly. Raising capital for the first fund during the 2008 financial crisis was challenging as it turned out to be smaller than planned. Raising adequate funds to create a healthy and diversified fund of portfolio companies is vital. We were able to raise more capital for the second fund, and we hope to raise the bar higher with future funds. Also, challenges related to regulatory changes have made us extra careful about investing in companies in highly regulated industries. There is a higher degree of risk in highly regulated companies, particularly as it relates to regulatory changes and alternating interpretations, but our strategy will largely remain the same for subsequent funds. By focusing on the lower-middle market, we are maximizing our growth potential. The segment has limited access to capital in terms of both equity and debt. On the equity side, relatively few players are pursuing this area. Our average investment is USD10-30 million, so there are a few similar players. The majority of our investment capital comes from the US, though we do raise some capital from Mexico and Europe. One of the challenges is the relatively small private equity industry in Mexico.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Private equity in Mexico is completely underpenetrated. On the one hand, it is a challenge, though on the other it is a great opportunity. The private equity industry is one of the most employment inducing and creative in terms of corporate governance and putting companies back to work under the rule of law. Mexico has tremendous needs and capital, which is a perfect recipe for growing private equity. We opened The Carlyle Group office in Mexico, in which we raised USD134 million, although for a USD100-billion company, this is fairly small. It decided that because of the size of the Mexican market, it would allow us to manage its assets while raising our own fund. This is the origin of EMX. The very fact that a large player such as Carlyle was unable to find attractive opportunities is mind-boggling, although this is because there are many needs and requirements in this dynamic and growing country. One of the biggest challenges in the industry is the number of deals. There are no more than 20-30 buyouts a year, which is extremely small. Of these deals, the average value is USD20-30 million in transactions. Despite the decline in exchange rates and the relative weakness of the economy, we have achieved great things.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, we launched a product as a pilot called A Tu Medida, where we targeted exactly the segment of people who may not be able to present us with a salary slip or any formal proof of an income. We used interview techniques, which mean visiting customers directly and building a relationship based on this. We have had a large ramp-up phase; in 2017, we had more than 150 contracts based on this product. We distribute this product through dealer networks and in this case, dealers are asked to organize events where they call people from this segment and they explain our product to them. We are still in the pilot phase; we want to determine if this is truly the way in the future to go bigger with this. If it does well, then we will go bigger; we might even consider having national campaigns, though we are not yet at that stage.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have an opportunity to increase the penetration to close to 85% in 2018. That is because in such economic conditions, the number of people purchasing vehicles with cash falls. History shows that in such times of crises, the participation of credit is higher. Our expectation is to increase our penetration by 15%. We work with third parties, OEMs, and dealer networks, which in our case is NRFM, to demonstrate low, one-digit rates in the market. It is possible to get credit with 5% annual percentage rate (APR), which is extremely attractive. It is possible for companies to book a leasing contract with zero down payment. This is a competitive market compared to others. Súbete and Llévatelo—our programs for unbanked people—as well as self-financing represent 4% of the market. We have many different alternatives available to open possibilities for all customers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of the main characteristics of BNP Paribas Personal Finance on a worldwide basis is its footprint in terms of car finance loans. This is a unique characteristic that makes BNP Paribas Personal Finance able to anticipate the major trends of the market. We have regular meetings where we assess the new trends of the car market before the car financing market, and we are getting ready not only for the electric vehicle trend, but for what is coming next, which is driverless vehicles. This is a huge question for financing companies, as the ownership will not necessarily be clear. We are preparing to finance electric vehicles though we are going even further and are watching the medium-term trends in many countries. The big disruption in terms of credit will come when eventually there are no longer any owners or drivers as ownership will be shared. It will be more about usage and access.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have 20 plants across Mexico from where we serve the world by providing different products from Continental's divisions. Without a doubt, the Mexican market is a huge one. There is a large market for both trucks and passenger car tires in this market; it is among the top 10 in the world. We are focusing only on the tire industry because it has grown every year between 5 and 10% since 2008. For the first time in 2017, the market is down 5 or 6%. For the first half, the market was fine; now, for the first time in more than 10 years the market is down. However, it is clear the fundamentals of the market are excellent. We have a young population and ambitions to own a car are big. The population will purchase a car, despite the limited space within Mexico City. On the truck side, it is a large market with a big gap to be filled. The market will return and growth will resume. We have programs explaining that fitting a quality Continental tire is cheaper than fitting a less expensive, lower quality tire when we consider the lifetime of the product. As the market becomes more aware, I am certain the truck tire industry will progress and reap returns.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The North American market is extremely important for us in terms of global strategy, not only because of its size but also because of the number of customers we have here. Having a facility here is not just for the supply chain; we rely on our staff in both Mexico and the US to improve the partnership and relationship with our customers. This team of professionals for customer service and technical support is dedicated to provide the best products and solutions. Over the past five to six years, we have increased our relevance here significantly. Today, we have 1,300 people in Mexico, in addition to the sales office and warehousing in Atlanta. It has been a major driver for us here in North America, and we continue to focus on finding different ways to deliver value to our customers and improve our operations globally. We focus on two things: innovation and sustainability. On the innovation side, we invest 3-4% of our revenues in R&amp;D. Today, globally we have almost 600 people who are dedicated to research technology and innovation. We have 47 labs around the world for R&amp;D. At last count, we had 1,700 patents granted worldwide, and almost 60% of revenue in the past five years came from products launched within the same period.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The first priority for Hisense while expanding into Mexico was first and foremost the domestic market. Our analysis, supported by the World Economic Forum, is that the Mexican domestic market will be one of the largest in the world and among the top 10 in the near future. The second aspect was Mexico as a manufacturing base. Mexico is blessed with many benefits in that sense and has worked hard to establish many other benefits such as raw materials in the country and its proximity to the massive North American market. There is a well-established supply chain of raw materials, and many other components that can be purchased, and those are things that are not easily replicated around the world. China maintains its advantages as a production base even though salaries have increased and a big part of that is also due to its existing supply chain. Mexico has similar benefits as a production base. We are a conservative company. We believe in growth at a reasonable—but steady—rate, and part of that culture goes into how we make investment decisions. Our timeframes are not six, eight, or 10 years; we look at 20-30 years.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The LEGO Group is extremely pleased to be in Mexico. We started with LEGO Mexico in 1994, and we truly believe in the potential of the country. Mexico plays an important role in the LEGO strategy. We have a major factory here, which is a testament to that. The factory employs 3,500 colleagues that produce high-quality products for the entire Americas market. We touch the lives of millions of children across the region with this factory. In addition, Mexico is also an important market for us. There are many children here that we want to reach with our creative play experiences. We are extremely pleased with our location near Monterrey. We have access to great colleagues with the right skills, which is extremely important. We are also committed to our presence in the region. We are extremely engaged and committed to our employees, who play a key role in delivering our high-quality products. We also focus on our corporate social responsibility. We do this through our commercial branches, LEGO Education, or the LEGO Foundation. Mexico is one of the countries where we have great interaction between the commercial side and the foundation.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Caterpillar has a significant footprint in Mexico. We have 21 manufacturing facilities throughout the country, mostly in the northeast, including in Monterrey, Torreón, and Reynosa, and more than 11,500 employees in the country. Moreover, our three dealers Madisa, Tracsa, and Matco serve our clients in the Mexican market. We have a diverse production coming out of our manufacturing facilities here, from gas turbines to trucks, machine components, and after-service parts. Certainly, Caterpillar sees Mexico as a strategic ally in its pursuit of global competitiveness. Our facilities are constantly being reviewed and evaluated for the potential sourcing of components and value-added work. At this point in time, I see organic growth with the products we are already producing. Caterpillar Mexico has gone through an evolution, and things have changed for the better in the technological space. Through the talent and entrepreneurship of our employees, we have advanced from being just low-cost manufacturing facilities to going more and more into product and process design and innovation. Since processing technologies have evolved to increase the competitiveness of our facilities, we have to go with the latest trends.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Huawei is the largest solar and string inverter supplier in the world. We have over 50% market share in the solar string invertor market and serve our customers globally. In the solar industry, there are investors, developers, and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) companies for the utility market, while in the commercial industry and residential market there are also many installers where we work mostly through our distribution partners in the market. We work with all of them in the solar power market. The Mexican electricity market is becoming healthier due to the energy reform. Huawei works with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and other major players on the transformation toward the smart grid. However, the grid is not ideal at the moment, and there are still some areas where we can improve. In addition, the transmission resource is still limited, and it is still expensive to transfer the electricity from one place to another over long distances. However, with the introduction of the latest advanced string inverter technology instead of central inverter technology, the grid will be more stable when more solar plants are connected to the grid, resulting in fewer issues for CFE's grid.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In business since 2012, DMSolar has always been focused solely on distribution, and our strategy for 2018-2021 is to stay at the forefront of consumers' minds and have the product in stock. As with all distribution companies worldwide, we need to have the best products available at the best prices. Mexico's renewables sector is still in its infancy. DMSolar distributes solar solutions to industrial, commercial, and residential customers. The business represents around 150-160MW per annum on distributed generation (DG) market, which is nothing compared to a more mature market. DMSolar is part of the distribution committee of the Asociación Mexicana de Energí­a Solar (ASOLMEX), which works closely with the government. ASOLMEX has published a book setting out possible strategies for how government and private sector can develop best practices for the solar industry here. DM Solar does not sell to just anybody. We protect the market. Those who want to get products from DM Solar have to fulfill certain criteria, which is one of the factors that has put the company where it is today. We provide consumers high-quality products at competitive prices, not to mention excellent service. In 2018, we want to consolidate our position and build more alliances with installers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The real advantage of Jinko is that we are able to satisfy the needs of the countries we operate in by understanding every country's unique local demands. We are a vertically integrated company, and through our integrated system, we are able to control the quality of every single step of production. Jinko has been the largest photovoltaic (PV) solar global manufacturer since 2016. In 2017 alone, we provided 9.7GW in total and around 1.7GW in Latin America, which is our biggest market after China. Boasting strong local teams in 10 Latin American countries, the region represents around 18% of our global sales. Within Latin America, Mexico is our most important market due to its medium- and long-term outlook. To date, 90% of the total installation is mainly utility scale. There are three main markets in Mexico: auctions, private power purchase agreements (PPAs), and distribution generation. We are approaching the Mexican market with dedicated teams for utility scale and distribution generation. Our target is for each house to install 2kW solar panels with a battery and storage system that produces energy without contamination. At present, we supply solar PV panels for an 820MW project, which will be the largest project in the Americas upon completion.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We developed the first utility-scale solar project operating in Mexico in 2013. We had to develop those supply chains in a short time. We are currently developing a new project where supply chains are fully developed and extremely competitive. In order to provide those USD20 per MW/hour prices, we have to put together the supply chains with equipment and services in the most competitive areas. If parts and equipment have to be manufactured and assembled in other markets, then we must take advantage of that. In Mexico, we can specialize in something that we are competitive in, vis-í -vis other parts of the world. The way of doing business has flipped 180 degrees as a result of the energy reform. The most direct impact has been the promotion of renewable energy. With respect to solar, since the reform has been in place, around 37 new projects are now under construction or ready to start construction. This will mean 5GW of new capacity in solar with a direct investment of USD5 billion in solar alone by 2020. We see similar numbers with respect to wind, pipeline, transmission, and oil and gas development. The main issue currently is how the energy reform will play out with the new administration. However, it is a chance to gain more momentum to further implement reforms.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Mexico has a strong regulatory system that began in 2010, making solar an attractive prospect for our operations. There are nearly 1 million households that can benefit from solar energy in the distributed generation (DG) market. In terms of our company, we are keen to work with large Mexican companies and international companies with operations in Mexico. We want to partner with many different brands and help them develop and grow. We are a Chinese transnational company and have the ability to focus on different market types. In Mexico we are only focused on utility scale projects and in this segment, Mexico has an extremely strong potential of up to 20GW in the next few years. Mexico is the fourth-largest market for our global presence in the coming years. In the next five or six years, it will require 25GW of solar installation. Mexico is a great environment for using trackers as opposed to fixed infrastructure. Tracker technology yields excellent technical and financial outputs. We have a global R&amp;D team in offices across the world to find and develop the best technology. We help our clients optimize their solar farms and designs. We want the best product and the lowest price for our clients.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Changing SMEs' mindsets is crucial to grow their businesses and internationalization; we need to show them the world. Although Guadalajara is a great city that has so much to offer, like great weather, food, and people, there is an attractive world out there waiting for us. Second, we must open bridges to the world. In 2018, we will go to China for a mission to attend its first expo for people who want to export to China. It is about changing the mindset and opening bridges to the world. We have many bridges to the US, wall or no wall. However, we need to open more bridges to the south to our partners in Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, Brazil, and so on, as well as with Europe and Asia. In terms of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and digitalization, we also have a partnership with Microsoft so companies can transform their processes to join the digital era. In sum, these actions all together promote investment. In terms of tangible results, we want to grow the number of affiliates and show them a chamber that is young, dynamic, and open to new technologies. We are working to refresh the chamber's image to a closer, more friendly space for young people and all our members, and to digitalize enterprises.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We manufacture 70 million pairs of shoes per year that are catered toward the upper-middle market segment. The overall industry focuses on women's footwear, and in Jalisco state alone, we produce 97% of women's shoes for boutiques. In terms of job creation, the industry created around 21,000 direct jobs in 2017. Out of the 250 million pairs produced at the national level, Jalisco produces 30%. We have 900 established companies, the majority of which are SMEs. Around 6% of Jalisco's production is exported, most of them to maquilas such as Zara, Aldo, Nine West, Naturalizer, and Steve Madden. We have been training and sensitizing the shoe industry because we see great growth potential and positivity in the market. We support our affiliates with workshops that are aimed at developing an export culture by training managers in foreign trade knowledge. We also offer detailed information about the specific market, because each country has different rules regarding footwear. Finally, we carry out trade missions to search for niches, countries, and specific buyers. We have done extremely well in Central America and Colombia over the last four years. In addition, due to our rising popularity, specialized buyers in France and the US have shown great interest.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We need to look past the traditional education model and aim for a more practical, pragmatic, and flexible model—one targeted toward the demands of the business sector. We need to revamp and rethink the educational model in two ways. First, we need to bring the model and teachings in line with the rapidly changing world. Second, we need to reassess the linkage between the academic sector and the private sector in terms of getting these two areas working together. We need to speed up economic and social development, which is what we focus on at SICYT. Jalisco started as an electronic cluster focused on pure manufacturing. At that time, the Mexican economy was a closed economy, and our advantages were cheap labor and our proximity to the US. These factors are not the only ones. Today, talent and the ecosystem are the main attractors of foreign and national investment. We need to attract more investment to continue to grow our start-ups and digitally transform SMEs. Jalisco is a state of SMEs, and nearly 98% of the legal economic units in the state are in need of culture change. We have several major events designed to target development. For example, our Talent Land event over Easter attracted 33,000 programmers, developers, entrepreneurs, major corporations, and investors.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have tried to build a government that has a balance between social initiatives and the corporate sector. In the state of Jalisco, there are 125 municipalities, and Zapopan has become the economic engine of the state. We generate 30% of the state economy and create a third of all the jobs and investment. Even though we are not the state capital, we have an extremely important economic dynamic derived from our geographic coverage. We are eight times the size of Guadalajara, the capital of the state. As a result, we have a diversity of economic activities, ranging from commercial and real estate to industrial, agricultural, and forestry. We initiated a regulation improvement process and reduced the number of days required to start operations for a company in Zapopan from 47 days to 48 hours. Furthermore, the base of the city's economy is SMEs, and we have managed to create digital tools to allow licenses to be renewed online and also to approve new licenses for commercial establishments such as butchers, shoe stores, restaurants, and so on. We have also started the largest infrastructure project in the history of the city. We increased our revenue with a more efficient tax collection system, reducing our expenses, and using the available resources in investments.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Expo Guadalajara is the second-largest venue in Latin America and the largest in Mexico. There is only one larger in Bogotá and another emerging in São Paulo. In addition, it has the largest proximity tourism infrastructure, which is an asset that people appreciate. Without considering the 96,000sqm we have for rent, within a 2-km radius there are about 4,200 hotel rooms, providing an adequate infrastructure for meetings. The hotel infrastructure of this city, which has 23,000 rooms, is an important factor when it comes to large exhibitions and congresses. There are 10 macro events in our country and Expo Guadalajara has eight of those. The International Book Fair has been with us for 31 years. At the same time, other exhibitions have been added, such as the National Association of Self-service and Department Stores and Alimentaria, which is an exhibition that only fits here. We have Expotransporte, whose demand for hotel and peripheral services are not covered elsewhere. In addition to permanent exhibitions, every year we have smaller events. The venue can be used for more than one event at the same time, especially in the high season. Currently, Expo Guadalajara is working to attract more congresses and conventions to grow in that market.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Excellent institutions covering education, research, and innovation are engines of societal and economic transformation. Up until recently, some institutions came to RAK with a commercial approach, but with the creation of the Academic Zone, authorities are taking a harder look at the institutions that want to operate in RAK. This emphasis on quality control will benefit the entire education environment and the economic ecosystem of RAK and the UAE. Equally important, the programs offered should match the current and future needs of the local and regional economy. As institutions embrace the vision, the quality and profiles of the new graduates will be better suited to enable and support the local and regional economy. The government has a vision for economic transformation. To this end, programs are needed that promote innovation and help transform the economy, such as digitalization and artificial intelligence. In 10-20 years, the countries that are not digitally enabled will be in a position of serious competitive disadvantage. RAK can become a regional model in that sense.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The Academic Zone, which is part of RAKEZ, is a welcome addition to the current educational landscape. The education sector in the UAE was not heavily regulated as compared to western countries; however, since establishing our institution in 2008, we are delighted that the Academic Zone has implemented the strictest of guidelines which all institutions operating or seeking to operate have to comply with. The University of Bolton is the first British University to be licensed by the Academic Zone. In 2008, Ras Al Khaimah was a relatively unknown place for universities, but due to its beautiful landscape, affordability, and renowned universities, expatriates and locals are rushing in to avail the potential on offer. Students value our linkages with professional accreditation bodies, industry associations, and corporate affiliations that would help them secure well-heeled corporate positions. Due to the competitive nature of the job market, students prioritize workplace recognition and value-added learning opportunities that help set them apart from the competition.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Students in the UAE are more interested in a British education compared to other options. However, Brexit is making it harder to obtain student visas. Dubai is already home to plenty of brand campuses from around the world and Ras Al Khaimah is showing more opportunity for growth. Companies are hiring students from abroad; however, those studying in the UAE receive better job opportunities due to the exposure of the local area, language, and communication. When comparing job applications, companies give preference to local residents rather than expats. Students want to come to Ras Al Khaimah to continue their studies because it offers the same quality of education at a cheaper rate. At present, there is greater potential than before, which is why international universities are setting up campuses here. We expect Ras Al Khaimah to be the preferred destination as it offers lower costs of living as compared to other Emirates.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Education will continue to grow in RAK because the government is taking steps to organize an academic zone. In comparison to other Emirates, RAK does not want every higher education entity to come here and set up; it is selective and the government helps and supports institutions throughout the process. It is important to have a local partner that has strong relationships with high schools. The Dubai higher education landscape is a competitive space; at present, RAK offers greater potential for prospective institutions. The advantage of RAK is that an interested institution can directly communicate with the authorities. Such encouragement would be difficult to find in an Emirate like Dubai, which already has a number of large players. RAK offers a highly regulated environment that ensures healthy competition. We have no problem with other British universities in RAK because we believe in our uniquely structured programs. In addition, if we want to open further institutions, our established credentials will help us in the process.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In our business, the main challenge is the extra demand from the export market. It was not in our calculations, and we were not ready for it. On a positive note, this higher demand highlights how the end users trust “Made in RAK“ and Emirati production in general. Now, we need to leverage this higher demand and aim for more production lines and open more markets, boosting the kind of exposure we have externally. There are high-quality products in Ras Al Khaimah, and we know there is a high demand out there from markets in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt. However, it is important to retain a balance, and prioritize both local and regional markets in the GCC, Africa, and the Indian Subcontinent.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The biggest challenge was to educate our customers on the key differences of our food because at first, they only looked at the price and chose cheaper alternatives. Once our customers understood that the value of our product far outweighed the price, we became their first choice. Our toughest challenge was to introduce our cheese to different demographics that do not historically eat the types of cheese that we produce. We have managed to grow our brand despite the many challenges that we faced and now distribute to most of the major hotels, restaurants, and supermarkets in the UAE. Ras Al Khaimah was our first choice when looking for an Emirate to build our organization because it is continuously growing and improving. Regarding accessing raw materials, we still bring in some from Europe. However, we pride ourselves on the fact that the milk that we use comes strictly from the UAE. We have many local resources and believe in the importance of buying local first.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The public and private sectors need to bring in more professionals who can develop this sector. In Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the industrial areas are well organized in terms of security and infrastructure. We are also doing this in Ras Al Khaimah, though there is still more that can be done to improve the environment. I have seen a factory in the area that does fit in with the idea of environment sustainability. There is a need for professionals who can advise the government on how to operate with the environment in mind. That said, the manufacturing sector will not play any less of a role in the future. The industry sector is wide. It is already progressing excellently, given that we are already competitive, even against Saudi players. Quality speaks for itself. A customer often agrees to pay a higher price when they see the difference in quality. The UAE is working to eliminate any international competition by making sure that 80% of the consumption of plastics is sourced from within. Previously, we faced a large competitor in Saudi Arabia. However, as it had a great deal of diversification in its products and is generally larger than us, it can lose in one product line and still be covered by other products. We, on the other hand, cannot do that. It can compete by reducing the prices of certain products and covering the losses with others. Such competition was tough on us. Now, however, it is not the case due to the new regulation.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Having a business set up in the economic zone has been a great experience for us. We can have full ownership. That is why foreigners are more interested in setting up here. It is also possible to get visas and paperwork processed quickly. Other benefits include no customs duties for importing or exporting goods or materials. There are customs fees or other charges; however, it is still extremely competitive. In our case, we have felt the benefits because we do business with customers outside of the country as well. We export freely to them without problems. We import materials from outside of the UAE without paying any taxes. The main reason that we chose to set up at RAKEZ's state-of-the-art Al Hamra Industrial Zone was the convenience of the location, with logistical accessibility to both Sharjah and Dubai. RAKEZ also provides extremely cost-effective solutions for businesses, and that is why we chose to set up our business here. The team at RAKEZ was extremely helpful when we were in the early days of setting up our operations; and their assistance was invaluable, especially when establishing the power connection. We enjoy an interactive and supportive relationship, and are proud to be one of RAKEZ's companies chosen to be visited by foreign delegations that come to Ras Al Khaimah from all around the world to explore investment opportunities it offers.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: initial;">We decided to base ourselves in Ras Al Khaimah firstly because it is convenient in terms of reaching the other UAE centers such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. For example, most of the companies working in industries that use equipment like stone crushers are based in Fujairah, and we can reach these clients in 25 minutes. Dubai is only 45 minutes away. This is a huge advantage for us. If we were based in Dubai, we would face many difficulties with the traffic, rent, and competition. Ras Al Khaimah is growing in the sense that there are people who are motivated to come here and open companies. This is because it is easier to get things done here compared to Dubai. In addition, prices are cheaper, including salaries. When we came in 2009, we were the only large workshop in the area. Since then, I have seen many workshops open so there is some competition now. However, it will take more time for competition to grow markedly in Ras Al Khaimah, unlike in Dubai, which is extremely competitive.</span><br></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Aas Al Khaimah's main economic driver will be tourism, though there are also several private-public partnerships (PPPs) underway for investment in industry and agriculture. 2018 will see the development of a new industrial city. We have partnered with RAKEZ to manage it because it has experience in running developments such as these. Unlike Dubai or Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah grew organically. As the city grew, workshops emerged near houses, which led to mixed land use in different areas. That is why the new industrial city plan aims to locate light and medium-light industries in one place. This will free the areas they currently occupy for further development in tourism, housing, or other commercial uses whilst meeting the increased demand for industrial lands. Additional value for the economy will come from a higher focus on energy efficiency. A strategy has been developed toward lower energy intensity of the economy and a higher share of renewables in the energy mix. The strategy comprises nine main programs: green building regulations, building retrofits, energy management, efficient appliances, water reuse and efficient irrigation, outdoor lighting, solar programs, energy from waste, and efficient vehicles. The municipality is driving the strategy with its newly established Energy Efficiency and Renewables office, which collaborates with multiple government stakeholders through a dedicated management committee.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The RAK government is developing the financial framework to enhance and support the sustainable development of the Emirate and public institutions' financial solidity by drafting new financial laws, unified policies and procedures for governmental entities, and developing better financial planning processes. Shortly after implementing the VAT, we did observe some increases in prices, but the market soon adjusted. We are, however, facing major challenges regarding public understanding of the VAT and unnecessary fears that stem from a lack of tax experience. That said, it will still play a major role in the sustainable development of all aspects of society, the environment, and economy of the country. In order to attract new investment, we are developing a new financial framework that includes unified policies and procedures for governance and transparency that will positively impact our relations with outside investors and increase their trust in RAK's financial system.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As a key government entity, our primary objective is to ensure that RAK's society is best served by the various government entities, which includes investors and citizens, in a smart and efficient manner. We do so by collaborating with various other government entities in RAK to understand what our investors and citizens need. These are assessed and analyzed with a scientific and methodical approach by experienced and efficient teams across the board to provide comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions across the spectrum. Today, everything is expected to be just a click away, from envisaging a business opportunity to executing it, and citizens services like applying for permits related to land, building, or utilizing the civic amenities citizen services. Our teams have enabled them with smart and efficient solutions and continue to enhance the citizen experience by adopting the best services and technology. As such, we are always looking for new ways to boost citizen satisfaction in hospitality, tourism, health services, education, aviation, and entertainment. We are also paying close attention to disruptive technologies like blockchain, AI, and the internet of things. While new technologies are tempting because they often promise better solutions and enticing possibilities for business change, more often they promise solutions that support to enable an organization to implement IT without changing its business processes.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In terms of quality, our university is built upon two solid foundations, the first being our graduates. We measure quality by the level of development and fulfillment of their dreams, and the improvement in their quality of life. Our second is the qualified professional profiles that meet the current requirements of different sectors. Regarding innovation, it is interesting how we have progressed over the years. We have created 29 innovation projects on which 80 professors have actively collaborated. We work toward the objective of students carrying out their learning process through challenges that are relevant to their specializations. We chose 10 of these to receive financial assistance from the university in 2018. Our goal is for our students to improve their professional development through the results produced by these projects and expect them to take risks by applying new technologies and ideas to improve their careers and professional lives.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The university was founded during a critical political situation for our country. At the time, some students in Antioquia sought rapprochement with the Archbishop of Medellí­n to create the Universidad Católica Bolivariana de Antioquia, and on September 15, 1936, it was founded. Today, the Ministry of National Education has issued a program aimed at educating the best educators so teachers can do their masters and doctorate degrees. Recently, we graduated the first 52 students from our master's degree in education in Puerto Asis—Putumayo. We have additional university extensions, such as one in the city Armenia where we have an agreement with the city's Commercial Chamber that includes postgraduate programs in law, management, and economics, and a business unit with postgraduate programs in Bogotá. We have also been helping our teachers and students study around the world and vice versa, and currently have over 200 foreign students across our different faculties.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>USB is a unique university with its own values and mission. The university promotes an inclusive education that since its creation has sought to help groups that have been historically excluded from higher education. And today, after 45 years, we have students from every social and economic background. In particular, our student population is made up of those from the lowest income levels in the region; 92% of our students are from strata 1, 2, and 3, the most disadvantaged of society. Yet we continue to be an educational institution of great quality, research, and innovation. Founded by Dr. José Consuegra, a social scientist, the university's first emphasis was the social sciences, but today we have all the main knowledge areas at the pre-graduate and post-graduate level. We also offer masters and PhDs in education. Our objective is to educate professional researchers who can interpret the social reality of our region and contribute to improving our society's quality of life.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The university has made interesting steps forward in recent years. First of all, last year we received our eight-year institutional High Quality Accreditation from the Ministry of Education. Secondly, in 2017 we started the construction of a USD50 million building, which one year later has already transformed our campus and competitiveness, both academically and physically. The main concept of the building, which we named “Ad Portas,“ is interaction and strengthening the university's relationship with society: its design and spaces facilitate co-creation and interdisciplinary work among our students and faculty for teaching and research, and opens our campus to the local community as well. Third, the fourth industrial revolution has come to campuses worldwide and is transforming every sector with data, analytics, AI, 3D printers, and nanotechnologies. We need to both maintain the traditional university model while transforming ourselves to thrive in this new context.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>It is a time to reflect on what has happened here over the last 70 years. If we go back to our beginnings, it is really amazing how a group of youngsters who had just graduated from US universities decided that the best way of contributing to Colombia was by founding a university. None of the founders were over 25, and in those days it was a major innovation, particularly because it had no religious, political, or business backing or affiliation. It was a private, non-profit endeavor. Uniandes started with no campus and no planning, just a clear belief in the necessity of this educational institution in Colombia. They were proven to be right, and it has certainly been a success story. One aspect of this that stands out the most is our record of attracting very smart kids from very underprivileged places in Colombia due to the funding we have been able to develop, firstly through our own financial hub structure, the Quiero Estudiar Program.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are part of a holding that includes nine companies, the biggest being Clinica Las Américas. We provide services for high-complexity patients in the region of Antioquia and nearby cities. We recently had a change in our first line management. I have been here since August 2016 and have brought a new perspective to the business. Talking about healthcare as a business may seem anathema; however, we have to face the fact that it is and needs to be sustainable. As such, we have planned a new strategy for the coming seven years because in 2023 we will be 30 years in Colombia. We have been reinventing ourselves. We will not change anything, but will transform the organization into a more sustainable and developed structure. We have discussed nine lines of strategic planning. The first and most important is called “Tetris.“ It is based on an organizational structure that is functional, dynamic, and flexible and will be related not only to the administrative field, but will also have developed many functional disease-based units like an institute of cardiovascular health, an institute of neuroscience, a renovated women's institute, and so on. The second line of strategic planning is called Crisalida, which symbolizes transformation and relates to people for which we have developed and implemented a holistic people-centered approach.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ours was was one of the first clinics in Bogotá and was founded 70 years ago. It was oriented toward private users, prepaid medicine, and insured individuals. The 100th law, approved in 1993, changed the economic models of health institutions, and the clinic got a little left behind as a result. Around 15 years ago, the clinic was going through a complicated financial situation that lasted until 2014. In 2015, we started restructuring the company, a process we have continued to this very day. We have changed the patient service model and strengthened each area such as internal medicine, gynecology, and others in order to give more integral attention to each patient. In economic terms, the last three years have been profitable, and we strengthened our operation model for surgery rooms and the ICU. In terms of our competitive advantages, our largest differentiating factor is our staff, which must have an attitude of service. We are working on effective communication skills, which relates to how our doctors and staff communicate to users and their families. While some of our main partners are insurance companies, we used to receive mostly privately insured clients. Today, however, 80% of our patients come from the contributory scheme. To recapture the private insurance market, we need strategic allies. Our main partners are Sura, Compensar, Sanitas, and Famisanar.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The hospital, which started as a maternity clinic serving Medellí­n, is celebrating its 70th anniversary. Since then it has evolved along with the healthcare system of the rest of the country. As things currently stand, the hospital is the most advanced, complex hospital in Colombia and has the most prominent role. We have the capacity to compete with hospitals and clinics in the private sector and provide services not only for people from Medellí­n, but also for those in departments such as Antioquia, Cordoba, Choco, Caldas, Quindí­o, and Risaralda. Most of the population is poor in these regions—we serve the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. In this group, around 92% are from Antioquia, 4% from Choco, and the remainder from the rest of the aforementioned departments. In Antioquia alone, some 80% of our patients are from Medellí­n and its metropolitan area. Originally a maternity clinic, we are still one of the most important hospitals in pediatric and obstetric medicine. We also tend to different specialties and subspecialties ranging from our special care unit to bone marrow transplants. We have 10 surgery rooms and 442 beds. Our main client so far is the public health insurer of Antioquia, which is called Savia Salud, which represents 67% of our sales. The Secretariat of Health of Antioquia pays for those who are not part of this contributive system, which generates 8% of our revenue.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our digital real estate platform evaluates real estate all over Colombia. People can now evaluate their real estate by going online and entering their property information in order to get an immediate digital evaluation. People like it and will continue to do so all the more in the medium and long term. It is a process of bringing people into the digital age. Our products are innovative; we are always launching new things. Right now, the low rates at the banks are helping people to get real estate, and we have a product at a good price. We are looking to expand into neighboring markets, but maybe it will be through storage. That is an easier operation to move abroad. Another thing that puts us ahead is that we are adopting green systems with our buildings. We currently have 12 buildings that are LEED-certified and environmentally friendly. We try to have all our buildings environmentally certified.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started building high-rise projects in Cartagena. We developed some major projects of this kind in Castillogrande, such as two 36-floor buildings named Trocadero and Malibú.  We also started other projects in Manga, a historic neighborhood in Cartagena with mansions and other buildings that have been abandoned over the years. Our most famous projects were Delamare, Regatta, and Atalaya. Our projects at Manga have enhanced the neighborhood, and people are interested in the area again, so much so that today Manga is an exclusive part of the city. In Barranquilla, the most iconic project we have is the Grataciello building, a 40-floor tower. Over the last year, we finished two buildings for a project called Solara Towers, and now we are finishing the sales period of a building called Illuminata. We are pioneers in offices buildings, as we participated in the construction of Centro Empresarial las Americas 1. We work in several sectors, including housing, hospitality, and office centers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>2017 turned out to be a good year for us despite our initial forecast that it was going to be hard due to the economic conditions, which led to just 1.8% GDP growth in 2017. This situation reduced foreign investment and drew people to rent houses, offices, and warehouses; as a result, the retail business changed from ownership to rentals. That development brought good news for Unifianza, because we focus on guaranteeing the rentals of the tenants to the landlords. We are warrantors of several multinationals, with some based in the US and Europe. We understand the investment these companies are bringing to Colombia, and the risk attached to such investments. And our creativity helps us provide clients with different alternatives, something that is not common for the rental industry in Colombia. We understand the real estate market, and we are reinsured by a Mexican company, Reafianzdora Insurgentes of the Grupo Financiero Aserta.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We are a unique model and cannot only be viewed as merely a real estate or office space. We highlight three things when it comes to how people should work within their lives. Our spaces are extremely dynamic, and we have a specific and uniquely functional design. Furthermore, every single thing is planned to produce a successful business partnership or business meeting and goal. Over 70% of the businesses within Wework have done one business within the community, an important pillar in the structure of our business. Today we have a community of over 250,000 members around the world. Being a member of Wework gives one services that a company may need at any given point. There is a great deal of potential in Colombia. We plan to open at least another three buildings in Bogotá by the end of 2018. Then in 1Q2019 we will open in Barranquilla and subsequently Cali.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, we have seen exponential growth. The most important projects we have been developing are focused on 4G. We have also worked on projects for large educational institutions, aqueducts and sewer systems, and other infrastructure projects, as Barranquilla City has been developing its infrastructure. We are fortunate because Barranquilla has contracted the most number of projects during this time. We have tripled our staff in the last three years to serve the new projects. Our role is based on our civil engineering consulting services to support the state authorities on several civil engineering tasks such as designing, public works audits, and civil engineering construction. For example, in Barranquilla, we have developed several projects to channel small streams through pipes. The intervention of these streams is crucial for Barranquilla because the streets become flooded when it rains. We have channeled five streams to date and are currently working on La Felicidad, one of the more complex ones.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Growth has been remarkable in recent years as we started to develop five or six projects per year, which put us in an excellent position in the upscale sector. We are in Envigado in Medellí­n and recently started to develop two projects in Sabaneta. A year and a half ago, we began to see other projects, this time in the middle and lower-middle range thanks to government policies that are encouraging the creation of housing. On top of this, at the end of 2017, we started to build three large projects of 250 housing units in strata five and six. The architectural design is the only aspect we do not take care of. Outside of that, we have the entire business. This is our value proposition. We do promotion, sales, and the structural design. We have a strategic business unit called Vertice Estructural that handles the structural designs for all our projects. We handle all the presales, sales, construction, deeds, and delivery procedures.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We work with many of the best companies in Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Mexico. We like to be present in medium-sized companies because when you rent equipment to them they do not take all of it at once, as opposed to when you work on a large project. Our customers rent a variety of amounts, but we like to have that diversity. In Mexico, we have very few customers and rely a lot on these big customers, whereas in Colombia we have about 80 customers and are happy with that. We are a company with four services: design of the formwork, logistics, equipment, and supervision. Where there is concrete, there is a market for us. It is possible to be successful in a depressed market. We started a business when the market was on a downward curve. When the market grows, all the costs go up. We have a big advantage because we are active in the housing, infrastructure, and buildings markets.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Most of the projects we have in Colombia are long term. We are a private company developing and investing in infrastructure projects; therefore, our commitment in Colombia is derived from the type of projects we are facing. At the moment, we are in 25-year concession projects in which Sacyr is investing EUR400 million and involving financial institution for additional EUR1.6 billion. For a company building concession project, resiliency is a necessity. The two main markets in Latin America are Colombia and Mexico. Both are similar for the volume of investment they need and the infrastructure programs they are deploying, but Chile is still our main market because we have been there since 1996. Our main clients here in Colombia are public, and our responsibilities are more and the scope that the public sector assigns to contractors in Colombia is bigger than other markets. In Mexico, Sacyr mainly is a pure constructor; in Colombia the contractor has to manage, build operations, design, expropriations, local communities, environmental licenses, and so on.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The initiative for the infrastructure and roads associated with the 4G project is an opportunity to restructure our transportation sector and get the proper network of roads that, due to many problems over time, have suffered from a serious deficiency. Now is the time to reshape the territory and connect producers with customers at principal points such as ports and airports in order to build efficiency, improve business, and reduce the cost of logistics in the country. Our mission is to be a reference in developing and managing road infrastructure, not just in Medellí­n, but all over Colombia. Our shareholders are some of the leading construction companies in the world, and that guarantees that we can develop, build, and manage the best roads. Our shareholders have different projects all over the country, and they are implementing their know-how and technologies in all the projects they are developing in Colombia. Hence, we are putting our strengths together to improve how infrastructure projects are developed and managed.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>This is a family company that has been in the market for 32 years. Our specialty is the construction of infrastructure projects, such as tunnels, bridges, roads, and hydroelectric plants; we have participated in some of the largest projects in Colombia, such as the Buenavista tunnel, La Lí­nea tunnel, and Occidente tunnel, and we are currently working in the Toyo tunnel. We are also experienced in small hydroelectric projects and have built seven throughout Colombia. 2017 was an extremely tough year for all the industry. However, we participated in several bids and were granted projects to be built during the next two years that have a commercial value of approximately a USD100 million. These projects include the construction of four tunnels that have a total length of 9km, six bridges, and a hydroelectric plant. Estyma has had the fortune of building more tunnels in this country than any other company, and after this 4G program ends we need to invest in the development of rural regions by building tertiary roads.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The bidding processes slows down fairly significantly during an election year and the year after, and we expect this to hold true in this election cycle. However, there are big projects already in the pipeline. In Bogotá we have the metro project that will provide plenty of work for those who won the supervision, construction, and supply chain. In addition, Peñalosa has awarded a number of design contracts this year and will award the construction contracts possibly by the end of 2018 or next year. We have business relationships with the main clients in Colombia, namely the National Infrastructure Agency; INVIAS, the highway agency in Colombia; and the city of Bogotá. We deal with asset management and look after a number of road networks in Colombia. We have also entered into the supervision of technology projects. In transport, there is Transmilenio, which is the operation of a public transport system. We are currently submitting bids for works in the sewer system in Bogotá and clean water provision in the city.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We are a group of three companies: an investment bank, a real estate company, and Ashmore Inverlink, which is a private equity fund to invest in infrastructure. The Ashmore Group is the largest private equity fund investing in emerging markets in the world. We have a fund that is fully invested, which is a little more than USD200 million. In addition, we are well ahead in the fundraising of the second fund. Finally, we also have a USD400-million bond fund that is developing strongly. We have three development funds. One was the office building in Calle 26, which is the avenue that goes to the airport, though we are already in exit mode as we sold it. We have another developing project that is also an office building targeted to a specific niche, namely BPO call centers, and is in the Bogotá Free Zone. Finally, we invested in a company that develops strip malls in Panama.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, the industry grew around 4% in terms of passengers, and we are maintaining our 23% market share so we are growing as the market does. We have 15 planes operating in Colombia, and in 2017, we changed our fleet from A320 to the A319, which is more efficient. The most important thing is that for the first time since LATAM entered this market, we are in the black in terms of net profit margin. That will give us a great deal of credibility for future growth in the company. When the operation is profitable, we have more opportunities to bring in more planes to the market. We are playing in Avianca's home market and that makes it difficult for us. We have gained a good position, though we hope to keep growing and positioning our brand. That is why we are moving to a hybrid model where we can lower fares and stimulate greater demand.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>On 1Q2016, we started the weekly Bogotá-Panama-Istanbul route. 2016 was a difficult year for Europe and Turkey and the airline industry has been affected accordingly. However, Turkish Airlines adapted its policies to overcome the situation and continued its development through Latin America and launched Bogotá flights in 2016. We carried out country studies on Latin America in general and more specifically Colombia and Panama before the upcoming launch. Colombia and Panama are two countries with buoyant commercial activities and are worth visiting too for tourism purposes. Flying to 120 countries through 300 destinations worldwide, Turkish Airlines showed interest in developing tourism and commercial activities between both countries and Turkey. The company was well received in both Colombia and Panama. Both of the countries are growing markets, and Turkish Airlines offers different options all around the world to travel for business purposes to those two countries.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Colombia is an extremely important market for Iberia, and the company has been here for the past 60 years. 2017 was important for us; our business class product in Colombia was ranked one of the best in Latin America. Another product that was launched last year, premium tourist, was also selected as one of the best. This product falls in between business and tourist classes and has found great acceptance in the Colombian market. It is an ever-changing industry, and new companies are being created as a result of all the market players that have entered. Colombia will continue to grow, and we must live up to our clients' expectations. There are many Latin American airlines in the Colombian market; however, European companies are also keen to operate in Colombia. In 2017, we announced three additional frequencies that will be launched in 2018. This increases the number of routes that are currently active on the Bogotá-Madrid route by 40%.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We initially started as an air charter company in Medellí­n when the new owners acquired it in 1996. We started with helicopters and worked primarily for Ecopetrol, based in Cucuta. Around 2005, the oil sector went down and our contract was discontinued. At that point, we started seeking new contracts and exploring the possibility of changing from rotatory wing to fixed wing aircrafts. In our business exploration, we noticed that critically ill patients did not have safe medical transport. We decided to start our air ambulance program and became the first company in Colombia to be certified as an air ambulance company. We have 13 aircrafts for both charter and air ambulance services. Rather than expanding we look more to create a network of partners that have our same high quality standards for medical transport in order to reach other destinations, creating accessibility and better patient outcomes. We also looking to expand the charter segment of our business.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Airplan invested COP101 billion up through August 2017. Around 40% of total investment has been invested in Rionegro for its terminal building expansion, platform expansion, and airplane parking lots. Generally, airplane parking is the infrastructure part that becomes saturated most quickly and creates the most bottlenecks. We have invested in nine new airplane parking positions; therefore, we are going to be more competitive. We have also invested in Monterí­a and Quibdó, not only on runway and platform but also on building infrastructure. These investments represent 30% of total investment. The remaining 30% has been distributed to other airports like Medellí­n, Carepa, and Corozal. We have airport expansion plans and government-updated master development plans for six airports. This way, we have a development route where we monitor the growth of each airport in order to timely plan the investments according to the expected demand. Our commercial projections are well defined. We need to establish our new airport according to the new development plan whereby the airport itself is a commercial center to promote international connections and new businesses opportunities. This is exactly the business model we are promoting in Rionegro, Medellí­n, and Quibdó. We have another important challenge of promoting the air cargo business through a new building. This building will have the latest generation logistical and warehousing technologies for air cargo services.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>75% of airports are state-owned, the principal owner being the national government and Civil Aeronautics, the rest being owned by local authorities such as the Medellí­n airport. In 2008, a Colombian and a Chinese company got a public tender through a license contract for six airports: Rio Jose Maria Cordova airport in Antioquia, Los Garzones airport in Monteria, El Caraño airport in Choco, Las brujas airport in Sucre, Antonio Betancur in Antioquia, and Olaya Herrera airport in Medellí­n. The contracts last between 15-25 years and were worth USD250 million. Maintenance, modernization, management, and doing new business were all included in the contracts. The company that covers those obligations is called Airplan. Before, the funding resources given to the airport were low, but this is increasing. For example, in 2016 we gave Medellí­n USD4 million for the annual budget and have been investing that budget in social development programs. With foreign investment in mind, in 2019 we are requesting a public tender to develop the master plan, which reflects the planning of the airport in the next 20 years. We are currently working on developing our technology to see if we can start to have international flights, as the Olaya Herrera airport only handles private international flights for users or companies with their own planes.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our current phase of expansion is near completion, though the airport as a whole is in a state of constant growth. The sector will enjoy continuous growth for the coming years. The airport is growing at a rapid rate, which is a reflection of what the country means for the region. Airlines are betting on Colombia's continued growth. This particular phase of construction is about to end. We are about to complete the northern expansion project, which will be dedicated to international flights. Additionally, we will add more area to our domestic flights. These two new areas account for almost 50,000sqm of additional space. The idea is to not only improve the passenger areas, but to also improve our commercial offer. We want to improve customer experience in every possible way. An improved experience is our strategic objective. We want to provide not only a high quality infrastructure, but also a world-class experience. We are not just improving infrastructure, but revamping the experience of passengers and visitors of our airport as well. We need to recognize that Colombia, and Bogotá in particular, is in a geographical position that offers several natural advantages. El Dorado has become a connection point. We have made efforts to attract new airlines and have worked to improve connectivity of our current airlines.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been in Colombia since December 2010. We are currently focusing our efforts on growing our dealer network and portfolios and adding new brands to the operation. All these will prepare us for our future goal of achieving a 10% market share. We have key brands such as Fiat, Jeep, Volvo, Chrysler, Peugeot, and Dodge. We have one regional strategy: to focus on excellent relationships with manufacturers. Over the last 12 months, we have been preparing the company for a new future. We are a wholesale company in Colombia; we do not own any retail operations. This is different from our Chilean and Peruvian operations. We have a dedicated team of people for Volvo, one for Peugeot, and a third for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. We also have an office for our fourth company that provides support to the three commercial companies. Our key point is to have a professional dealer network. It is important to provide excellent experiences to customers. That is how we try to add value.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The market is going through some difficulties in 2018. We participate in three different segments: passenger vehicles, trucks and buses, and construction and mining. Construction and mining has been significantly affected by of the Odebrecht case, which has translated into lack of financing. The trucks and buses segment has been difficult for the past three years, decreasing its volume significantly due to market conditions and regulation changes. Passenger vehicles performed the best. We expect the market to perform better after the presidential elections in June, when uncertainty should be reduced. Our focus is to offer a differentiated experience to all our customers, based on reaching operational excellence and offer a differentiated experience to all our customers. We are investing in the development of new tools to adapt to new market conditions and prepare ourselves for future growth. The introduction of two new brands will give us the opportunity to participate in new segments and have a more robust portfolio.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Porsche Colombia is part of the Volkswagen Group, and we are present in 25 markets; however, we report to a holding company in Austria, rather than directly in each country. There are several aspects to the business. One is that Porsche is a wholesaler, selling our cars to dealers, which is what Porsche Colombia does in Colombia. Second, Porsche Colombia provides financing for customers who buy our vehicles. When we started the business in Colombia in 2012, we had a market share of around 2.2% in Volkswagen passenger cars. In 2017, we achieved 4.1%, and our goal for 2018 is 4.6%. As with many global brands, our group has a market strategy for volume globally. When it comes to Latin America, this is a complex region. South America is a large continent with complex geography and logistics, and the countries are not well connected. This means vehicle brands need to have a strategy that is divided into a number of sub-regions within South America.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>One of Volvo's main brand values is that it cares about people, which is something we always try to prove. The first thing is safety, which has been one of Volvo's core values since the company was founded and this continues today. We have an automatic braking system that has reduced collisions by 30% in Colombia. In some countries, insurance for Volvos is cheaper than for other brands because Volvos are safer. This concept is extremely well developed because Volvo started applying it five years ago. The system initially just detected cars; however, it now detects animals, pedestrians, and bikes. The pilot-assist is also excellent for safety because most accidents happen when the driver is not paying attention to the road. This is one of our key pillars in relation to caring about people. In terms of environmental impact, worldwide Volvo has decided to phase out internal combustion engines. From 2019, all new models will have an electric component, whether hybrid or fully electric. We are starting that strategy in Colombia in 2018 and bringing in certain hybrids. The third pillar of caring about people is our design, based on the “design around you“ concept. At Volvo, our cars are not just luxurious in order to show off; they are made this way to simplify people's lives. This is our main differentiation.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ferrari is positioned as a car line for a particular user who likes speed, design, luxury, as well as standard cars. I am not saying the other brands do not have them; however, all these factors are enclosed in a smaller equation in Ferrari. Ferrari is not aimed precisely at the public; it is a special product with particular characteristics, standards of performance, and perfection between the particular relationship between man and machine. We have a strategy with three focuses: the connoisseur Ferraristas, which manufacturers call repeaters; a new generation of luxury, speed, and Ferrari brand lovers who have wanted to be part of the family; and those Ferraristas who own a Ferrari but do not want to purchase a new car. The concept of Ferrari is exclusive: they are cars with little mileage and maintenance. All this has given the brand the possibility of moving a community that has become closer and known. The dealer's function is to tend to them in a personalized way, and subsequently promote the growth of the brand in that community that becomes both ambassadors and bestsellers of the brand and the experience. Ferrari is the experience of a passion, the experience of an impeccable machine, and the experience of speed and design.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We started in 2009 as a sub-distributor of Maserati. There was already a regional importer placed in Panama. We took this sub-distributor and started working on Maserati with it. Introducing the brand was not easy, but we saw good results. We started with a small operation, which gradually increased. We signed a contract with the factory in mid-2015. We made a USD1 million investment in inventory and the showroom that follow Maserati's international regulations. Because we have direct contact with the factory and I am the official importer, we have the purchase-sale, import, and billing processes under direct control. Since there are no intermediaries, we maintain transparency through every step. We unveiled the Levante SUV in October 2016 with an excellent reception. In 2018, we will open directly in Medellí­n. We already have units there and in Calí­, but the market in Antioquia is not mature enough to have a showroom such as ours. These luxury brands attract a particular type of buyer. We have dedicated ourselves to identifying a certain buyer profile composed mainly of people of emerging and recent success. We approach people at certain kinds of events, such as horse-riding events, to meet those who fit the profile but might not otherwise visit our facilities.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Expert Partners was set up as a software development company for SAP. With this, we began to provide services to large multinational companies such as SAP, Nutresa Group, and Deloitte, among others. As the company grew, we started to see other business areas; we were not only working on the customization of the development as a software house, but started to evolve and attend to the process and configure the SAP system to the processes of each of the companies. With all the technical knowledge we had and experience in creating developments tailored for the industry, we began to see different ways of doing things and we took the models that served us the most from each of those lessons. We rebranded as Savios because we are now much more than a software and development company. We are working on digital transformation processes and guiding the topic of agile methodologies and process models to work with high-performance collaborative teams. Today, we have a greater Latin American presence. We needed to have a name that was shorter and more sonorous, such that our clients will understand that we are not only a software house; we have truly transformed ourselves and are developing a series of fronts. This process started in mid-2017 and what emerged is Savios: technology that inspires.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The testing industry is growing, but also changing. We must use new technologies because of the way businesses and their points of view of technology are changing, not only as a support, but also as a strategic platform for themselves. The way Choucair Testing does its testing will also change; indeed, it is evolving. We will have to move to find new ways of interacting with clients to align ourselves with their business strategies. New technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, deep learning, blockchain, and so on will be useful to create that interlink. The new ways the world is moving are changing everything from how we communicate and interact to the questions we create in technology. With the convergence of knowledge and technology we will learn new skills and ways to think, a point where Choucair is completely committed. It will no longer just be about completing a process or a transaction. We will need to look at how biology, ethics, and other fields interact with technology and we will have to test that technology; therefore, we are focusing our efforts in that direction. We will be moving into many new areas. It is simultaneously complicated, interesting, and challenging. Certainly, we will use this new technology for the good of people and the planet.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Conexia was founded in Argentina and has expanded to Colombia, Peru, and the US. It was a small company at the time though it has an innovative concept: information in real time at the point of care for healthcare. Our business started as a real-time information provider, though it has evolved to organizing the ecosystem of the healthcare system so that all roles can function properly. Using technology and connecting all the players, we have provided easier access to health services. When one starts a medical treatment, it should not just be a relationship with their doctor, but with the insurance company and the Ministry of Health. The goal is for the roles of every sector to be simplified so they can check the progress in real time. Our platform has the capacity to solve their biggest internal issues and all are validated by the same logic and model, upholding the local regulations. At the processing level, we solve clients' issues. We digitalize their internal process, making it simpler. Our second goal is to improve health coverage by anticipating their needs. For example, we have a risk management system that gives advice on prevention strategies for patients who are at risk of a certain condition. The traditional healthcare system is not focused on prevention, and this has to be improved in that aspect.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Colombia has been part of Saphety's internationalization strategy for a long time, and in 2013 we decided to open our office here. Our main business focus, for this market, has been electronic data interchange (EDI) for large retailers, especially while we expect the government's electronic invoice obligation. We also chose Colombia because electronic invoices are currently the most developed in Latin America. In Colombia, we worked with DIAN on a pilot project with 59 other companies of various sectors in 2015 and were subsequently authorized to work as an electronic invoicing service provider here. We are prepared for a boom in electronic invoicing in the next two years. Large companies will be the first to be included in the government's electronic invoice obligation, and  steadily from there, we will reach out to smaller companies as the requirements progress. Electronic invoicing significantly increases transparency and reduces costs, and is a major step toward the digital transformation of the Colombian economy. Our focus is the private sector: large companies with a large number of transactions, which means a great deal of invoices and information to organize. We have reached out to large companies, such as retailers and retailers' providers, and part of our strategy has been to work in close partnership with local and external ERPs, implementers, and consultants.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Part of our challenge is to educate businesses on how to become a part of the fourth industrial revolution the world is experiencing and the cultural change that comes with it, so they can focus on more than just digitizing a few processes and instead thrive to make the most of this new era. We have a five-year plan to take us through to 2020, and we are advancing through our goals rapidly. Some highlights in our strategy include investing significantly to create a center of excellence in agility, through which we want to produce software, as well as advise companies on agile methods and their benefits to take businesses closer to true digital transformation. We are also helping companies in Colombia to embrace artificial intelligence; we have our first customers in this field, including certain telecom operators that we are helping to become more productive and efficient through AI. Our main clients include large financial companies such as Grupo Aval and telecom operators Claro, Telefónica, and Tigo. We work with the main companies in the utilities and energy sectors, such as Ecopetrol, Terpel, Gas Natural Fenosa, and EPM. In the public sector, we have a strong relationship with SENA. Our advisory and management consultancy business is dedicated to transformation. We are also active in IT professional services and in BPO.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Tappsi was created as a solution to the safety issue when hailing taxis. It was a valuable proposition as taxi companies were not doing any background checks. For example, certain taxi companies share the passenger's phone numbers with the driver, and women do not like that. We could not also force people to pay with credit cards, as only 25% of the population has one. As a start-up, our first objective was to survive; around 60% of new companies fail within their first two to three years. Over the next several years, we must continue to transform transportation in Latin America. We were the first taxi app in Colombia, and we then became the largest app in North Latam; we employ over 140 people, which for a technology company is extremely hard. We focused on high-end consumers at first, who have the money to order two to three taxis per week; however, our next focus will be the base of the pyramid.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are extremely proud to be a unicorn company; part of the secret of Cabify was to enter a market that was not getting a value proposition according to what customers wanted. It will be difficult to own a car in the future; Cabify allows customers to request for a car, share it, and decide their preferred method of travelling. Cabify grew five-fold between 2016 and 2017; last year was an extremely successful year. In Colombia, we launched P2P in cars that have a regular license plate for private use. We launched a new category called Cabify Light as well as a cash payment solution. We have many difficulties with the government because we are neither illegal nor regulated; there are different government agencies trying to figure out what we are doing and trying to shut us down. We have been in talks with the government. Most Colombians are in favor of us, which will help us to be regulated since this is the future of Colombia: mobility and entrepreneurship.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We invented software that allowed users to add items to their cart and scroll through the supermarket. We went for an on-demand model and the project started to grow; we added restaurants to the platform and entered into an alliance with Grupo Éxito in Colombia. We started putting shoppers in supermarkets and it grew to other cities and subsequently Mexico and Brazil. One of our competitive advantages is that we are multi vertical. Having an open text feature allows us to understand and hear what the market wants. We decide to work with stores, improve the conversion, and make it easier for people to buy through opening this new vertical. As well, people order cash online as customers playing poker may have run out of cash, so they need a cash delivery, similar to an ATM to one's door. One competitive advantage of Rappi is focusing on hearing what users want and adapting the business to them by truly focusing on service and improving the way couriers deliver orders.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>August 2017 marked three years since the merger, and we are pleased with the results. The merger put us in a great position in Colombia. We are now the second-largest telecom operator in the industry. Before, Tigo was only mobile and Une was only fixed; we were accomplishing half of what consumers wanted. Our results are great during an extremely tough year. We had to do a great deal of work internally, reshape our investments, and work hard to not affect our consumers. Some regulations changed the way we operate, putting the industry in a tough position. However, we sustained our company. We expect to return to growth in 2018. To do this, our number-one priority is to connect more Colombians. Colombia has many opportunities; we have only 15% penetration of 4G in Colombia. We are one of the slowest-growing countries in Latin America in this segment. In terms of residential TV and broadband internet, we are at 50% penetration. We grew our fixed network by 60% since the merger. We cover over 50 new cities and more area. Our portfolio includes around 11.5 million customers and of those, we have nearly 160,000 companies. Our second priority is to better understand our customers in order to provide better services.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>2017 was the best year for the company so far. We have been in the market for five years now. The main accomplishment was to stabilize and make a profit well ahead of the business case. Our numbers are all black in terms of net profits, cash flow, EBITDA, and others. We have also finished our checklist of financial health and are extremely pleased with the outcome. One highlight that we are proud of is our number-one ranking regarding quality of service by the regulator. Since the regulator began polling the market, we have ranked number one, and 2017 was no exception. It is important for us to be recognized by our customers and our competitors' customers as the best mobile service in the country. A second highlight is our introduction of a new line of business, pursuing fans of soccer teams. We launched our first product with one of the most popular soccer teams, America de Cali, and expect more teams to join this year. The third accomplishment for our shareholders was to return the highest EBITDA of the region. We will stay oriented to the end user and regular consumers. Larger players have to play in the B2B arena; however, we are focused exclusively on B2C.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Phe company was established in 2007 to deliver a service called push-to-talk. It targeted large corporates such as Ecopetrol, the national police, security companies, and transport companies such as TransMilenio of Bogotá, with a special service based on push-to-talk technology. The company was successful and in 2013 it decided to bid for LT spectrum. Avantel currently manages two different products: push-to-talk and broadband mobile. In 2017, the company was recognized as the fastest LT network in Latin America. The corporate segment is extremely important and comprises one-third of our total revenues. It is not only a matter of service revenues because we have had great partnerships with many of the largest corporations that are leaders in sectors such as security, oil, and the government. We have been the leader in the country in the last seven to eight years and have had long-term partnerships with most of our large customers, which are still truly important for the company. When we set up the LT network, it was set to ensure that we could also deliver quality broadband services to our corporate customers. We deliver fiber in Bogotá and Medellí­n; our network is placed in the business areas of those cities as well as other major cities.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Since we began, there has been a significant regulatory change in Colombia. We managed to gain markets in large companies, and we focus on the development of products for enterprises in the oil sector. We are also linked with major Colombian companies in electric power distribution. One of the greatest landmarks of Ectricol history was developing 90% of the electric infrastructure in Campo Rubiales. We also established an R&amp;D team that has been developing our products for five years. We are the largest company in the country in such manufacturing, though if we compare ourselves with international companies in this field, we have a 15-20% share. Among national companies, we cover 45-50%. In 2018, we had an important participation in construction and infrastructure sector, and we hope that will be the case next year as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We work with any industry that handles any kind of fluid that needs to be received, stored, processed, consumed, and/or delivered. We represent various top companies in Colombia that manufacture high-quality industrial equipment as instrumentation, automation, pumps, valves, and so on. We buy products directly from factories, promote them locally, and distribute them in all the markets we cover. Our main line has been instrumentation and automation for industrial applications, and mainly for custody, transfer, and application in the oil and gas market. However, due to the fall in crude oil prices, we started to open other types of industries that apply the same concepts used by the oil and gas industry. We are in charge of the technical and commercial support locally in each of our markets. The most important advantage is that we try to represent the manufacturers of industrial equipment of the highest quality. We try to represent the top of the market, so quality is the first factor.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Deviteck currently has 65% of the ITS market in Colombia. We were the first company to start electronic toll collection in the country and since then we have installed around 38 lines for electronic tolling as well as around 70,000 ID TAG stickers for vehicle identification. Our main experience lies in supplying systems for vehicle identification in line with the Ministry of Transport's regulations and documentations. We also ensure consumer consulting at Deviteck follows regulation and ensure that the concession can get the right system and equipment. The first step is to consult on the technical specifications, produce the documentation, and finally supply and install the system. Our commitment to the sector and end users is important for us because the concessions themselves have contracts with the government for 20-30 years, which means they need a partner to share that concession for the next 30 years. We have a responsibility to be sustainable because our goal is to provide a national service on time.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In 30 years, we have approached all types of industries. Our biggest business was in the petroleum industry, namely refinery and production. One of our biggest projects was for Pacific Rubiales and all the fields it developed in Colombia for more than seven years. We were almost the only supplier for this company and installed more than 5,000 instruments. Another of our large projects was the refinery in Cartagena. We sold Skids and LACT units to many other customers in chemical and petrochemical industries, as well as SCADA software for plant management and factory floor automation and supervision to companies dedicated to plastic production, and also in the waste and clean water industry sector. Almost every industry in Colombia uses our products. We are extremely technologically oriented, which gives us an advantage in the market. We sell products from Germany and the rate of failure is less than 1%; we have not experienced returns because of bad quality.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>As commercial director, over the years I sought to focus on three main factors: reasonable prices, great wines, and top-class customer care. Maestri's aggressive price policy has been part of a greater strategy to democratize a market that in Colombia has been historically limited to the upper class. Maestri made the tough decision to lower its margins despite the tax reform in order to target a larger segment of the population. While the selection of wonderful balanced products has been a proud differentiation flagship of our brand since the company's founding in 2015, we have worked on offering the most complete set of Italian products available in the country. Starting three years ago with four vineyards and 12 wine references, we now have nine vineyards and over 30 wine references out of the most representative of the Italian enogastronomic tradition. Maestri is proud of its sales results after 40% growth in 2017 and due to an impressive 70% improvement on 1Q2018 despite the initial 30% forecasted.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Maestri Wine Boutique (MWB) is now a reality. Strategically and financially speaking, we realized how important it is to sell directly to end-users. This was the reason why we considered setting up a wine boutique that is a store, showroom, and private dining area. Located in Quinta Camacho, MWB is already a key spot for wine lovers. It is the only Italian wine shop in the country where one can find all types of wines and liquor at import price. Our strategy is clear; we want to make great wines more accessible to old and new clients. We seek to be a major part of our clients' lives, especially for important events such as weddings. Maestri Milano will soon count on a national coverage as a result of a network of distributors that ensures a capillary presence on the market. As a result of a two-year effort to bring together the best professionals in the country, our wines can now be found in Bogotá, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, Bucaramanga, Medellí­n, and Cali, with new cities in the works.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Facing peaks in demand due to the seasonality of the market together with great selling performance required special attention. This is why we developed methods to predict demand levels so that the procurement mix could match the effectively sold gamma. Such work required working closely with all areas in order to develop a top-down approach to solve the delicate supplying matter. Charting complex processes made it easier to manage operational tasks along with the Colombian legislation. All these were done while learning how to correctly evaluate the risks implicated in various steps of the administrative and logistics chain. On the back end, we have been optimizing various processes, formalizing aspects and jobs that will take us to entirely comply with the ISO normative in 2019. We are also extensively studying the financial dynamics of the market especially focusing on risk coverage to exposure in the foreign exchange market. All these changes and dedication will ensure we will be fully ready to efficiently support sales nationwide.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), has been in the market since July 2017 when we announced the transaction combining GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes. We are very proud to be the first and only full stream supplier of integrated oil products, services, and digital solutions. Every project has unique requirements, and BHGE brings a depth and breadth with access to equipment, service, technical expertise, and solutions across the value stream. It is important to mention that our footprint has increased to more than 130 countries. At the same time, our portfolio in Colombia has grown stronger. We want to show our customers how digital capabilities can increase efficiency. Most recently, we introduced the LM9000 aero derivative gas turbine, an innovative design based on proven technology from GE's Aviation business. It offers 50% longer mean time between maintenance: 40% lower NOx emissions, 20% more power, and 25% fewer trains. We combine our history of invention with the mindset of a start-up to overcome today's toughest energy challenges, so we have high expectations currently. In 2018, we are entering our second year as BHGE; we want to prove to our customers that our portfolio can generate benefits for them through technology synergies.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Activity in Colombia was at a minimum for many years; however, things are changing and the oil price is starting to get more stable. The vast majority of E&amp;P companies that had exploration commitments are now undertaking them due to the flexibility given by the National Agency of hydrocarbons (ANH). Compared to 2017, business is flourishing and we are pleased with the situation. Although things look better, our worry is that few companies are conducting activities. Our biggest fear today is the toll social unrest has on the efficiency of oil and gas projects and hence on the Colombian economy. We need to start putting something together to ensure that the transition between large contractor companies and local contractors is smooth. The geology here is relatively complex, and there are aspects such as logistics that impact the direct cost of drilling, However, things have changed for the better because of modern equipment. Our main target is Colombia, and we will maintain our focus on Argentina because it followed the same trajectory as Colombia between 2003 and 2013, with a great deal of stability and activities. Our goal is to undertake more projects; we have to increase our profits and want our entire fleet to be occupied. We are exploring our CSR strategy, as we want a sustainable impact on the community that pays dividends for us.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Halliburton has been in the country for 75 years, and we have 14 product service lines that primarily focus on upstream and certain midstream operations. For 2017, highlights included being able to serve offshore operations. Our goal is to commence these operations in the second half of 2019. This is an area that will thrive if the country continues to support such activities for the next 10-15 years. The biggest challenge we face is building relationships with the communities, but this is also an enormous opportunity. Today, communities want a broader participation in oil and gas activity that creates an opportunity to increase employment, contract local goods and services, and support local entrepreneur projects. We have many different ways of collaborating with the communities where we live and operate. Our Good Neighbor initiative outlines plans for our efforts with local communities, government, and suppliers. Also, we have a chapter for young professionals called IMPACT, with the primary objective of furthering employee development and enhancing leadership competencies. To achieve our environmental goals, we follow mitigation plans to avoid potential environmental impact and follow emission regulations. Moving forward, we will continue to see an appetite for investing in the country. We will likely see a spike in activity in 4Q2018 with the recovery plan from operators; the expectation is to cover that activity with safety, quality, and new technologies.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span></span>We have been operating in Colombia for 25 years, and in the last 10 years, we have been a member of the Gerdau Group. We have a long-term contract with Gerdau to provide coal, including the delivery of over 7 million tons of coal. Being the largest operator in any market is difficult; however, we have worked to solidify our reputation and people respect that. Safety is the number-one concern of all operators in the mining industry, and we are dedicated to ensuring that this remains true. We have nearly 1,000 small mines around the country, and we have to work closely with them to develop the best practices. Our 2017 figures are extremely strong; we sold 700,000 tons of metallurgic coal to Gerdau, and in 2018, we hope to sell 500,000 tons of met coke. Our total sales figures for 2018 are expected to surpass USD150 million, which are fairly impressive for a local company.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>MTC, our project, and the Muzo companies, which include our international sales arm and marketing, have fundamentally changed the Colombian emerald industry. We are proud to be part of a modern, forward-thinking industry that is in line with the law, protects the environment, and works with the local communities. We have significant plans as we have many areas in our titles to develop. The market for top-quality emeralds remains strong; our main goal is to improve the quality and quantity of the emeralds. In order to form strong relationships with the community, we employ almost 90% of our workers from the Muzo or Quipama municipalities, where our mine is located. Overall, 2017 was unquestionably our best year ever. Our production levels increased tremendously, and many of our projects to modernize the mine came to fruition. For 2018, we will try to modernize and bring online production for an unexploited area.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Sandvik is an industrial group with more than 155 years. We made our main investment seven years ago with a head office in Bogotá and are currently constructing a primary service and logistics center in Medellí­n. The strategy is to be geographically close to our major customers in Antioquia Province. Initially, we only had two or three machines as compared to 112 machines at present, mainly working in the underground mining segment. We are also involved in tunnel construction operations for the 4G highways. We put a great deal of focus into new technologies. Around 2,700 employees work in our 60 global research and development centers, where approximately USD380 million are invested each year. 2017 was our best year thus far; we closed a large deal with a huge customer while increasing our fleet with 31 machines. We want to increase our sales by 25% and expect to have 11% YoY growth in 2018.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>HK Trading is a mining service company. Our latest promising development is the non-detonating technology for fragmentation. In our current position we have just regular industrial explosives, though not every operation has access to it. In regard to infrastructure projects, this will push forward the government's initiative to make 4G a priority; Colombia's road system is 30 years behind, and the high costs of transporting kills a great deal of business. We are working on concessions and trying to establish a partnership to develop services to support them with construction, especially in Antioquia, Boyacá, and Cundinamarca. We help save time and money while minimizing the environmental impact by using our rock fragmentation technology. The industry is witnessing a resurgence and will reach 90-95 million tons in two to three years. However, moving forward, our idea is to grow in infrastructure because it is an immediate need for the country.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The main challenge of transforming from a successful car niche company into a bank was to establish ourselves not as a traditional bank, but a digital bank. There is a huge opportunity to implement technologies where the client is at the center. The main challenge is how we digitize the current model and create new niches, products, and segments with a 100% digital model. It is also important to not neglect the traditional model in the process of digital transformation. If our allies are not ready to make the digital transformation, we have to do a step-by-step process of transformation with them in mind in which we help them understand that digital sales processes are much more efficient for all parties involved. We have two main strategies to improve financial inclusion: using fintech to create networks and bring transactional capabilities closer to people while generating greater transparency in operations; and the creation of financial tools that facilitate the life of the entrepreneur or the people that generate an integral part of financial movements. We made the decision to move the bank from the financial center to a place closer to our workers in order to avoid a greater carbon footprint. Colombia's future is not clear due to the elections but it is important that bankers maintain an optimistic vision and continue to undertake new projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ventures EPM has consolidated its strategy and positioning since 2013. Our first fund, FCP Innovación, made its debut investment in 2014. The first year was a learning curve for our investor in the best possible sense. After our first two investments, we subsequently averaged three investments per year, and, as a result, have closed eight investments in total, moving us closer to our mid-2018 objective of having between 10 to 11 investments. The experience of the fund for EPM, our sole Limited Partner, has been positive. It saw a high strategic value in the companies we have invested in and is considering enlarging the fund by USD10 million. On top of that, we are structuring a second fund for USD50 million. We have analyzed 530 opportunities to date, which is well within the average number for a VC fund. We have invested in eight opportunities, and if we talk about the mix in the 530, it is dominated by two types of industries: ICTs and energy technologies. Our main priority for 2018 is to receive confirmation from EPM if we are effectively extending the fund. Should this happen, we will then deploy USD8-10 million in two to three investments. The focus would be to have all our companies on our portfolio meeting and exceeding their business goals and attracting other funds and strategic buyers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been doing what many payment companies worldwide have done, which is to expand regionally through mergers and acquisitions to gain scale and geographic coverage. We currently operate in seven countries in Latin America. With those countries, we cover 80-85% of e-commerce in the region. We are the only company in Latin America that has a single platform to operate in those countries allowing us to provide our services to global and regional companies, allowing region-wide payments through one single contract and one account manager. We are starting to move from pure payments into credit to leverage our information and network; payment companies worldwide are eyeing a great opportunity to move into credit and participate in fintech. We are also innovating to develop the sector. A year ago, we started a service where consumers can buy products online and choose not to pay for 14 days for a small fee. Such strategies will enable us to move from payments into being a more comprehensive fintech player. From a Colombian perspective, we truly want to get involved in the field of credit for merchants. Our objective on the consumer side with our buy-now-pay-later product is to ensure that it is profitable from a microeconomic point of view; we want to grow it 10-fold.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are the insurance broker in Colombia with the most relationships with top global insurance companies; out of 100 top brokers, we work with close to 65. We belong to various networks that cluster a certain group of firms. 2017 has been an excellent year for us. The major reason for our success is that we are independent. We are not linked to any of the three largest brokers in the world. From a service perspective, we are focused on providing the best services to our clients. In addition, our good standards and excellent business practices allow us to make decisions faster. We have an interesting year ahead; the growing middle class will become an important player in the insurance market. We are going to open offices in other cities and establish other mechanisms to service our clients, by specifically providing alternative services in addition to the ones we currently offer.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We want to be present locally and consolidate the relationships between Lloyd's market and local markets in the region. Having a presence in Colombia is extremely important for us because Lloyd's representative office was established only two years ago, while the other international players have been present here for several years. Colombia's market is heavily underinsured due to two reasons: low income and a cultural barrier due to lack of education. The company has produced great results; Lloyd's 1H2017 results showed a profit of GBP1.22 billion. There were losses in 2H2017 due to the hurricanes and the Mexican earthquake, but we will continue to focus on maintaining strong underwriting discipline. Over the next year, we want to improve our relationships with the market and collaborate with governments to close the under-insurance gap.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Fifty years ago, the insurance market in Colombia was not an attractive business; however, people with strong social skills were drawn to the sector. Over time we transitioned from an informal, relationship-based business model to a formal, specialized, value added one. Another important change we made was to move from an insurance procurement focus to a risk management focus. We were the pioneers in introducing enterprise risk management, business continuity, crisis management, liability exposure analysis, strategic risk assessment, and so on. Since our main clients are within the industrial sector, we launched a global industry-focused strategy in 2017. The insurance industry as a whole has major flaws that impact penetration levels. The first thing we need to do is educate people and redesign the way we market insurance. In terms of future prospects, we see the concern that business people have regarding the election. It is a major year and the concerns of normal Colombians are reflected in our operations.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>One of our recent major achievement has been receiving AAA grading for the third consecutive year. In 2017, we had a new structure approved that will allow us to be more modern and dynamic. We have also developed agricultural insurance as well as an insurance that insures buildings built over 10 years ago. In 2017, our profits amounted to COP39 billion (USD14.04 million), with investments of over COP87 billion (USD31.3 million). For our 2017-2021 strategic plan, we are focusing on five main fronts: strengthening the state market; developing the SME market; increasing our focus on clients; technology and digital transformation; increasing efficiency; and creating a new area of customer service culture. Our 2018 goal is to improve our accident ratio for the automobile and compulsory traffic accident insurance areas. Equally important, we want to work more on alliances, even with companies in the same sector to reach new niches that we may not be able to tap into on our own.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>QBE is a global property and casualty insurer and reinsurer. In 2005, because of the divestiture of non-core assets from the government, it found a way to enter the Colombian market. From 2014 onward, we moved from that federative model to a more centralized, global company. It was challenging because the Colombian market has a good mix of local and international competition. What sets us apart is our tailored customer value proposition relying on the three pillars of experience, service, and culture. We want to have a go-to-market strategy where we are fast and efficient, jettisoning any parts of the service chain that add no value. Looking at the Colombian market, we are witnessing a shift in 2018. We want to focus on the specialty lines in the corporate arena, as well as more tailored products for small- and medium-sized enterprises. We want to provide the added services so risk management can be a value-creating tool for our clients.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Pensions in Colombia are a regulated industry that offer great potential, as labor formality and economic growth materializes with higher growth rates that match those of developed economies. Colfondos has achieved sustainable double-digit growth in operating revenue amidst difficult market conditions and industry inefficiencies. In particular, we have one issue that has negatively impacted our results for the past decade: the increase in the cost of disability and survivorship insurance for our pension customers. To maintain its competitiveness, Colfondos had to look at internal improvements and operational effectiveness in our daily operations. We also try to keep pace with technological innovation within the sector and have migrated over 80% of our transactions to digital self-service channels. We are investing a great deal in innovation and plan to invest even more because we have reduced our footprint in terms of branches to benefit from cost efficiencies without sacrificing customer service.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The main goal after establishing in 2012 was to keep the entity up to date. Our procedures are all in order, which is an important indicator compared to past years. Today, our goal is for all procedures to be addressed by March 2018. We have a great team that has a great deal of responsibility and is assisted by the latest technology. All our office tasks are technologically handled; this has also eliminated corruption massively. We are one of the highest ranked companies and the best pension fund in Colombia. At present, we have close to 1.3 million pensioners and 6.5 million affiliates. The challenge for us is to broaden coverage, which means people should formalize employment or employers should formalize their workers. Our aim in Colombia is to provide personalized council and give the best advice possible. From a macroeconomic perspective, Colombia is handled responsibly, which makes it secure for foreign investment.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In the last two years—and this will likely continue in the near future—we have continued on the path of growing our position as a premier wealth and asset manager in Colombia. We follow a different strategy than most of our competitors; instead of the mass market, we are selective of the type of customers we serve. In the last three years, we created a new wealth management unit focused on serving high net worth individuals and brought together a group of tax, legal, and financial specialists to serve that market segment. Although we have four different legal entities: a pension company, a trust company, a life insurance company, and a stockbroker, we take customer segments as the principle to organize and operate. In terms of future goals, the company is betting on five core strategic initiatives: improving market positions, product innovation, commitment to digital, cost efficiency and automation, and retaining the best talent—one that understands that drivers of the past are different from the drivers of today.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>2017 was an outstanding year for Porvenir and more importantly, for our customers. Porvenir has taken advantage of the markets and had great results in terms of the returns for our billings. We gained more than 637,000 new customers and reached COP100 trillion (USD36 billion) in assets under management in our mandatory pension fund. We have continued to work on our internal processes in order to become one of the leaders in the local industry. In 2017, Porvenir was one of six Colombian companies that received recognition from the government for our work on improving transparency; we were also awarded the next level of quality certification in 2017. We have set great goals in 2018 to ratify our leadership. We expect to register an increase of more than 600,000 affiliates. Finally, we need to assess the best investments for our current assets under management in order to secure good returns for our customers.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Today, we have a market share of around 35% with an important evolution in terms of the assets managed. Most importantly, we have about 7 million customers, and our main purpose is to help more Colombians achieve their dreams. Colombia has the lowest savings rate in Latin America and it is our responsibility to educate our clients. Protección has experts who work together to provide education, services, and financial, pension, and tax advice to provide the best possible assistance to customers. Pension reform is an immense challenge, one that Colombia must face as soon as possible, because the world's demographic conditions are changing every day. Two major steps to improve Colombia's pension reform are increased coverage and a sustainable multi-pillar system. In 2018, Protección is looking first to create a memorable customer experience and second to contribute to a change in the behavior of all our stakeholders.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Avenida Capital started investing in Chile, Brazil, Panama, and Colombia in 2007-2008. The company decided to focus on Colombia in 2010 and launched Avenida Capital's first institutional fund in 2012. The fund consisted of institutional investors with the aim of funding low and middle-income level residential, retail, and mixed-use real estate developments in Colombia's primary and secondary cities. The company has spread Fund One and Fund Two over 30 projects throughout Colombia. While each project presented its own challenges, the biggest concern has been execution, as time is of the essence in real estate developments. Once an opportunity is spotted, an analysis regarding the company's desired market position in different cities is carried out with respect to a city's size and market. Colombia is a great country to invest in, but there should also be tax breaks to incentivize developers to take on large housing projects in the cities. The local pension funds are tax exempt and it would be positive for the sector if foreign investors were offered some sort of exemption as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our first transportation client mainly sought consultancy and we assisted with business plans and complex financial models. We worked with urban transportation companies like TransMilenio and SITP operators. TransMilenio's success lead to Colombian operators offering us tenders across the region, including Panama, Peru, Chile, and Brazil. Over time, we started closing deals in different industries, like healthcare, industrial security, chemicals, and others. We currently work with land, air, and river transportation companies in financing, M&amp;A, and consulting. Foreign companies interested in the Colombian market prefer to start with an acquisition to accelerate their learning curve. Due to our well-developed relations with banks, equity funds, and lawyers, we can help foreign investors capitalize on local opportunities in the middle market. In terms of future goals, we plan to increase the number and size of closed deals. The financial sector in Colombia is fairly conservative, which has helped us through recession periods; however, financial institutions should improve their decision process in order to facilitate transactions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our greatest accomplishment has been partnering with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in Canada in 2015; it is the sixth-largest investor in the world that manages around USD180 billion worth of pension plans. We decided to take a long-term approach and invest for 10-20 years because catering to the needs of society leads to success. Our current focus is on education, healthcare, financial inclusion, and the food system mainly in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile; we opportunistically analyze Costa Rica as well. Although the current situation is not optimal, we have high hopes for Colombia. In terms of the Colombian healthcare market, we want to wait and see how the policy evolves in order to pull the trigger on investing; healthcare across the world has an unpredictable nature. Moving forward we want to cement our relationships with Ontario Teachers and Polymath Ventures. 2018 will be a construction phase, and we will continue to participate in different energy auctions the Mexican government has for energy. Our future plans focus highly on large investments in education and healthcare.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Paladin was one of the pioneers of investing institutional capital in Latin America 20 years ago. To date, we have invested in hundreds of assets totaling over USD5 billion in eight countries. Currently, our strategy is focused on the four larger economies of Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru. Most recently, we announced Paladin's first investment vehicle for investors domiciled in the Andean region; in 2017, the Superintendent of Finance approved our first Colombian private equity fund. Our strategy and investment thesis boils down to three primary drivers: demographic tailwinds, market scale, and superior project economics. In our 10 years in Colombia we have worked with four active local operating partners. The greater Bogotá region typically produces between 50 and 60,000 units a year. Despite an average 2017, we forecast 2018 to provide better results because low interest rates will re-stimulate housing demand. We plan to launch nearly a dozen residential and mixed-use development projects across Latin America in 2018, accounting for more than USD420 million of projected sales revenue.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Pei is the most important real estate investment institution in Colombia, with assets under management valued around USD1.6 billion. We have managed to become one of the main institutional investment instruments in real estate with our portfolio of investors, which is 60% in the hands of pension funds. One top of this, we have expanded the investor base, and today have more than 3,500 investors. In 2017, we surpassed COP1 billion in transactions in the secondary market. Geographical diversification is one of our significant achievements; our fund has a presence in 25 cities and municipalities across Colombia. At present, one of the most important projects is the internationalization of our investment vehicle. The Colombian real estate market faced a difficult year and a half, so we must be careful to determine where we invest. However, since we invest in an asset once there is a tenant, we do not face a commercial risk. Our plan for 2018 is to issue our bonds or credit content titles, along with an emission of participatory titles worth between USD300 and 400 million.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Colombia has a market of 45 million inhabitants with a purely hydroelectric energy matrix; thus, it requires more diverse energy sources. There will be more production in 2018, though the regulations prevent better results in the Colombian market. The environmental laws are also tough for autonomous organizations. In Colombia, we are partners of Ser Colombia, the country's association focused on the renewable energy sector. SOLAR GREEN has been in the Colombian market for two years; we started to work with Law 1715 and began to open new businesses in Colombia. We are developing new projects and with the results obtained we have great expectations for our Colombian market. We were working from Spain from 2004-2008, and after 2008 we started to do international business and opened offices in Israel, India, Italy, Japan, and nine other countries. Our main markets are the UK and Japan. Uraba is our first installation of self-consumption solar in Colombia. We are working for a mall in Uraba—one of our industrial customers—and only use the B2B model. We are currently working on our commercial model because the market has not been regulated by the government. The regulation is meant to be ready in November, and we have great expectations for the future.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There has been a gradual maturity of the market in Colombia. Our main interest is to introduce green energy technologies, efficiency energy, and new technologies that allow industries and the commercial sector to improve their processes. GIE is an energy company established 15 years ago with a core business of electric infrastructure and conventional energy. Later, we went into lighting solutions. During this period, we developed consultancy and studies in co-generation, demand response, small hydro-electrics, geothermal, and wind energy integrated in energy efficiency programs. We offer different business models to our clients to allow the development of these projects like a PPA, via renting or leasing, which allow for the development of these solutions. What we look for in the market is new solutions and green building technology that saves energy and improves performance and processes. Our target clients are those from the industrial and commercial sectors that operate at warehouses, for example Coca-Cola and Bimbo, among others. Each conventional energy user is a potential client as well for renewable energy implementation. Our purpose is to retain such clients with other solutions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our business model for Colombia is aimed at selling turnkey solutions to corporations, so they can sub-generate energy and reduce their energy bills. We are also developing large multi-megawatt plants that sell electricity to the grid or major energy consumers and energy operators, though our main focus is on businesses wanting to generate power. Our operations in Colombia were established in time with the booming market. Because turnkey solar solutions were a new concept in the Colombian market, we had to put in hard work to generate interest, generate awareness, and open up the market for solar solutions. Initially, CEOs and companies had trouble envisioning these solutions because of widespread misconceptions about solar energy systems. However, we are now witnessing the rise of solar business in Colombia; we have four installations of various sizes scheduled for 2018, ranging from small (less than 100kW), medium (300-400kW), to large (over 1MW). In Colombia, we enjoy a number of great relationships, but there has been considerable uncertainty in the market due to lack of regulations. With new regulations in place, the stage is set for businesses to start flourishing.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>VISA has been in Colombia for over 40 years. We initially worked with a processing and service provider owned by banks in Colombia and that entity managed our franchise here. About eight years ago we reviewed the opportunities to expand in the countries where VISA did not have a direct office at the moment. One of those countries was Colombia, and in 2013, we started a transition to open an office here to manage the business directly. VISA's business here continues to grow, and this is because we are closer to the market and have been working on establishing solid business relationships. Colombia is one of our key markets. One of the differences between here and most of the rest of Latin America is that Colombia has over 10 cities with over 1 million people. Furthermore, each region in Colombia is different in the way that customers behave and make payments with their cards, and this makes the opportunities in Colombia unbelievable. The high levels of innovation in Colombia have also surprised us. Both multinational and local banks are sophisticated in the tools they use and the products they have developed here.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Without a doubt, Colombia is one of the three most important countries in the region, not only in commercial size, but also in the vision of the future. The government has implemented several transformations, for example in security issues, and investment in Colombia is increasing, having a positive effect for the country. Likewise, we have evidence that several of our clients are investing in the development of local operations, handling and management of their customer service centers for South America in Spanish, for example. Undoubtedly, Colombia's economy remains positive, with stable growth. As the main headquarters of the Andean cluster, the country presents is a nation of great possibilities. Schneider Electric has been present for 43 years demonstrating its commitment to investment, confidence, and growth in the territory. 2017 was an important year to consolidate the presence of Schneider Electric as a provider of digital technology solutions for efficient energy management and automation in Colombia to be more competitive in their markets.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our main objective is to create a large development center increasing our investment and employment opportunities. Over the last 10 years, we have invested close to USD200 million in both technology and infrastructure, as well as employment opportunities, creating 1,400 direct jobs and over 2,000 indirect jobs. Since our free trade zone is the biggest in Colombia, measuring 140ha, we want to focus on the needs of adjacent towns. In collaboration with the government, we have been working on sewers, drinking water, energy, and road infrastructure, improving the well-being of inhabitants. We are 8km from the city, 18km from the port, and 100km from Cartagena Port. We have a great logistical platform that helps us boost our exports. 2017 was extremely positive. We closed 10 deals: six in land negotiation and four in corporate real estate. We completed 2017 with 30 users; two years ago, we only had 13 users, which demonstrates the significant growth of the region, our free trade zone, and the free trade zones regime in Colombia. Furthermore, our import operations increased by 30% and our export operations increased about 32%; we are one of the free trade zones with higher growth rates in Colombia. We also had a 32% increase in income.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Zofiva International Free Zone is located in the south of Aburra Valley. We are a relatively young free zone, established in October 2012. We have three stages at the free zone; this first stage covers 20.7ha, and we will have 181 holdings. We will have around 80 companies, and most of these will be logistics operator companies and groups. We will have three important industrial districts: precious metals, automotive spare parts, and textiles, as this part of the country has developed the industry of fabrics and textiles. We will have a building where about 20 companies from the gold industry will establish, and there will be a gold refinery with a company from San Francisco. For medical cannabis, we will have two companies, one from Denver, US, and another from Canada. We have companies from Venezuela due to the political and economic situation there; they see many positive opportunities to establishing themselves here in Medellí­n. These companies work in cosmetics and food, among other sectors. In the free zone, the idea is not localization of companies here in Colombia; the idea is for new companies to enter. With the tax reform regarding income tax and VAT, we have the best opportunities in Colombia.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2014, we were just starting our development in the free zone. Today, we have investments exceeding USD15 million from Colombian and foreign investors, particularly Mexican companies that have made additional investments of USD18-20 million in infrastructure. In terms of our investment plan, we have USD9 million for 2018. We also expect to close deals of USD10 million with new companies entering the free zone. We have grown a great deal in infrastructure both in the free zone and its environs. Buenaventura currently has road infrastructure that connects to the interior of the country. There are completely different conditions that favor us, so much so that companies are interested in investing in the country. There are 18 companies that have invested in the free zone and eight companies that are operating in the free zone with import merchandise. These eight companies are currently building up their infrastructure. Cauca Valley has positioned itself as one of the most attractive points of Colombia. The best infrastructure is in Cauca Valley, which also has highly skilled labor, extremely competitive prices, and additional benefits for investors such as connectivity of public services, airports with international flights, the proximity of Buenaventura to the main port of the country, and so on.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Zona Franca Intexzona does not operate other free zones. Free Zone Bogotá has been in the market for a long time and operates 50-60% of other free zones, both permanent and special. We have concentrated on managing this free zone; our business model is to operate other free zones. We have links with the Rí­o Negro free zone and Antioquia port free zone. We only share the inventory systems and sit on their boards of directors. Our difference lays in the occupation indexes of the Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial. Before the Decree 3600 of 2005, we prepared the building and urban planning license. This allowed us to have higher construction indices, with an average of 91%. In other areas, the construction index is 55%. This is an area of competitiveness and differentiation compared to other free zones or parks. Another strategy has been the industrial districts. We emerged as a cluster of the textile and clothing sectors; however, we did not have a free trade agreement with the US at that time. On the other hand, the life sciences sector successfully grew. In about five years, we can announce to the business sector that we have a cluster in this sector with about 220,000sqm fully operated allowing us to achieve greater competitiveness.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>This free trade zone was created in 2009, and the mission of free trade zone has been to work with companies that are committed to conduct several investments. The firms have successfully maintained high levels of investment to ensure that they will qualify within the free trade zone. There are 36 companies in Zona Franca del Cauca from different sectors. Approximately 24 of those are operating under the regime of free trade zone. Some companies in this area have the free trade zone regime, though there are others that do not. There are around four companies in our free trade zone that are international, while the rest are Colombian. Most of our companies are goods and services manufacturers. The portfolio is fairly broad. We are not focused on any particular sector as our free trade zone is diversified. The regime of free trade zones in itself is attractive. However, we are important for companies that want to sell products in Bogotá and those that want to export to the Pacific. Additionally, our costs are cheaper when compared to other free trade zones in the country. We also have a high-skilled workforce, because some of the best universities in Colombia are located in this area.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The origins of our group are in Germany and Russia, where we have been equipment dealers for over 40 years. I had been in Southeast Asia since 2009 on a different assignment, but in 2015 I founded Vantage Commerce Group. I was able to combine some of my pre-existing connections and create a great team for our new venture. The economy in Indonesia had been growing considerably, and the only thing it truly lacks in order to offset domestic logistics costs was further development in infrastructure, such as roads, railways, airports, and sea ports. I saw the potential in this market and worked to develop Vantage Commerce Group, focusing on construction in Southeast Asia, and, in particular, Indonesia. After establishing our HQ in Singapore in 2015, we opened our first company in Indonesia in 2016 and are about to open a second company here to meet increasing demand. While our first Indonesian company was established to distribute state-of-the-art construction technology from Europe and the US, the second company will handle contracting jobs. We are specialized in soil improvement, which is one of the pillars of any successful major infrastructure projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The objective of our acquisition process is to mix key elements of our business. We have a strategic business, especially for our wider group strategy, which focuses on precast, prefabrication, and geotech, namely soil testing. Precast is industrial products, and we already have a subsidiary in this segment. We also have our prefabrication or module components business, where we make module products, especially for high-rise buildings and to support the government's One Million Houses program. As for the balance between private and public projects, around 70% of our projects are private and the remaining 30% come from the government. Our residential and hospital projects are mostly private, while the airport and other similar projects are public. Our plan is to develop our airport business using the build, operate, transfer (BOT) system, though we will only do the construction and not the operations. Similarly, we have recently started working with PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) to develop the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) concept area in Pasar Senen Station, Jakarta. Moreover, our precast business produces precast components for the government's housing program not only in Java, but also in Kalimantan and other provinces. We have growing projects elsewhere, and around 80% of the buildings we construct are sold.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We originally set up business here in 1981 and have been here for 36 years. Two years before that, we were involved in one of the first projects in Jakarta's central business district. Our history goes all the way back to the creation of a more formal real estate and office market in Jakarta as it began to open up. We are the founding foreign company that came to Indonesia and set up with a local partner. Because of that, many of the original practices around measurement standards came from our first forays into the country. As for JLL, Asia has been always been a major focus; the original branch of the business was opened in Australia in 1950s, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, and Jakarta, and eventually China and Japan. All offices essentially offer the same services, ranging from facilities management in which we look after properties onsite, to project management and advisory and feasibility studies, selling, and leasing. Aside from Jakarta, we operate offices in Bali and Surabaya. In addition, we have staff in around 30 locations around the country and are about to sign a large outsourcing deal with a large foreign manufacturer that will take our headcount from 650 to 1,700 in 2018.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, not many companies went public, mostly because of the tax amnesty issue. In 2017, these issues were sorted out, which sparked a greater appetite for IPOs. Most of them are successful and seeing double, triple, or quadruple returns; however, we are pleased that our IPO has surpassed them all. One of the reasons for this success might be that investors were waiting for it. Another reason is our involvement in the oil and gas industry. Even though the market is down, we believe it will actually go back up. Our involvement in oil and gas is as a logistics services provider; our services are provided in an integrated manner, which helps us.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>From a strategic perspective, there were two objectives when I joined: the first was to closely scrutinize and stabilize our core business, i.e. provide a one-stop integrated logistics shop for the coal mining industry. The second was to look for diversification opportunities in the oil and gas sectors as well as the dry bulk ocean going-fleet. Our recent results had been fairly dismal, with losses around USD30 million in 2016 and USD12 million in 2015 due to the severe downturn in the coal industry, which forced everyone to squeeze prices. That being said, from a diversification standpoint, the opportunities are plenty, though they may take years to materialize. The government faces enormous challenges in addressing infrastructure issues due to the huge geographical spread of the islands, but it is great to see the maritime vision as espoused by President Widodo. To become a top-quartile shipping company in Indonesia within the next five years, we need to hold ourselves to extremely high standards. Our globally experienced staff will be our key differentiator in achieving this.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Damen is still a family-owned company. Worldwide, we have around 11,000 employees and an annual turnover of USD2.46 billion. Within the Asia Pacific region, Indonesia is a large market for Damen, with the Indonesian Ministry of Defense (MOD) our biggest customer, having procured six Frigates/Corvettes from us over the last 10 years. Other ministries within Indonesia are also important to us. Over a number of years, we have delivered 12 navigational aid ships to Indonesia's Ministry of Transport. These are vessels used to keep the sealanes navigable, for example, by placing, relocating, and maintaining buoys. We have also supplied a number of dredgers that are used by Indonesia's Ministry of Public Works to maintain irrigation dams that build up silt over time.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>INSA is an association of shipping companies formed in 1967 and recognized by the government as the only organization of commercial shipping companies by various binding decrees since that year. Back in 1953, there were eight Indonesian commercial shipping companies committed to establishing an organization, Unie Perusahaan Pelayaran Indonesia (UPPI). Over time and one by one, INSA's membership has increased. In 1989, we had 309 members, and a decade later in 1999, membership had more than doubled to 747 members. In 2009, INSA's members totaled 1,064, and in September 2010, we reached 1,200 members. At the beginning of 2017, our members include 1,490 shipping companies, consisting of firms of various sizes. The government's plan to connect the islands, develop the entire country, and establish shipping systems to promote trade and boost development is absolutely necessary. Once the more remote areas become developed and the economy grows, cargo throughput will increase, furthering connectivity and commercial shipping. We at INSA fully support the plan and are committed as the government's partner.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>IIGF is a state-owned entity under the Ministry of Finance whose mandate is to be a go-between for government fiscal policy in infrastructure. There are four mandates we have to abide by in line with the Ministry of Finance's objectives. For example, we provide a form of sovereign guarantee, which the Ministry of Finance was previously responsible for undertaking. Now, it can do it directly or indirectly through us. Second, we assess the appraisal for projects that have been given guarantees and do the risk and claim management assessments for any failed projects. Third, we are a risk manager for the government, whether the project is guaranteed by the government or IIGF. The objective is to minimize risk. Every three months, we inform the Ministry of Finance about the risk potential. Finally, we are mandated to accelerate infrastructure development through the PPP office and make the state budget more credible so the government can allocate funds for more important projects, while infrastructure can be done with private participation.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, there was a great deal of infrastructure development. Of the sectors that received this kind of investment, the majority went to transportation. In terms of our current portfolio, transportation still dominates our operations. Toll roads, ports, and airports are all major components of our portfolio, but the most effective sector in terms of attracting private investment has been toll roads. From a regulatory point of view, airports and ports are also beginning to attract private investment, though the readiness of projects in these areas is not as developed as projects in the toll road sector. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are driving a great deal of the growth and working to invite private players. In parallel to this, the government is working to develop airports and ports that they are structuring and preparing as PPPs. Fundraising, for the time being, has not been an issue for us, as we still have enough room to leverage. Getting funding is much easier than the speed of project development and completion.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our first partnership was with Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (IIF) in 2016, which was promoted by then-Minister of Finance, Bambang P.S. Brodjonegoro. IIF supports us by jointly investing in good infrastructure projects throughout the country. The reason for the partnership was that at the time, the government was strongly supporting cooperatives. In Indonesia, there are three economic drivers or institutions: first, the government and other SOEs; second, the private sector; and third, the cooperatives. Even the country's constitution states that the driver of Indonesia's economy should be cooperatives, but unfortunately, they are not developing compared to the public and private sectors. When forming our partnership with IIF, our shareholder was actually a cooperative, KOPELINDO. Bulog is the SOE for the food and logistics sectors, and the idea was to find a way for a cooperative to enter infrastructure. Kopel Infrastructure was thus established as a subsidiary of KOPELINDO. Then, we started looking for projects and funding through IIF and banks to get into infrastructure.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>PINA is an institution for equity financing because when it comes to infrastructure, it is not only about loans but equity financing as well. The investment injection from the government is typically supported by the state budget toward SOEs in terms of equity. Currently, the political will is not there to give SOEs equity. It is not that we do not favor SOEs, simply that we want to cultivate alternative financing. This trend is visible around the world. There is approximately USD200 billion of untapped alternative financing globally, and these sources of financing are also contemplating investing in emerging market countries, including Indonesia. We have been traveling around the world to countries such as Australia, which is keen to enter the Southeast Asian market. We are also developing an Indonesian desk, though thus far, there has been a lack of global understanding about investments in Indonesia, partially because we are not promoting Indonesia well enough.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia is an archipelago, and air transportation will always be the main choice for people to travel between districts, cities, and islands because it is the most efficient in terms of cost and time. It is our duty to provide more services and deliver new domestic destinations and routes to strengthen our network connectivity in order to support our customers throughout Indonesia with Lion Air, Wings Air, and Batik Air. That said, Thailand and Malaysia are two large countries with strategic locations as potential international hubs for Lion Air Group. In addition, both are large primary coverage areas for international flight connectivity networks, especially in Asia.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>PT Angkasa Pura II recorded a robust performance in the first semester of the year due to our operational efficiency after implementing information technology in our airports. The growth of the tourism industry in Indonesia also contributed to our overall performance, and the visa-on-arrival policy plays a significant role in boosting the number of air travel passengers. Moreover, we are committed to developing digital services at all of its airports. Indonesia is a country with high quality IT infrastructure, and we must take advantage of this to drive digital services in order to add value for passengers. In driving digital transformation, we focus on three pillars: customer experience, efficiency in operational systems, and our business model. To digitalize our services, we introduced a mobile application called Indonesia Airport, which further enhances the customer experience.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) business, especially on the domestic side, is growing by about 9% YoY. According to our data, there is potential to grow more than 10% and this is an opportunity for MRO to create growth. GMF's strategy is to grow the group and be one of the top-10 MROs in the world in the coming years. We have two strategies: one organic and one inorganic. The first is to improve capability and increase capacity. In the second, we plan to form collaborations with a partner to expand GMF in the domestic and international market. Recently, we signed an MoU with our partner in South Korea because, like Indonesia, its growth is excellent. In South Korea, there is no institution concentrating on the MRO sector, and we need to be closer to our customers in South Korea. The strategy in South Korea is to have light maintenance and a fast-moving component and hangar.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our business is primarily supporting the key players, namely airlines, in the aviation industry with support services. While we have a small investment, our core business in airport services includes some of the fastest-growing airlines in the world. In terms of fleet capacity, Lion Air and Garuda have ordered a lot of aircraft, though Sriwijaya is ordering aircraft as well. Then, we have Air Asia, which is active in Indonesia. CAS is the largest private company doing this, and we focus primarily on international airlines, with state-owned entities working for the state-owned airlines. Our market share for international airlines in Jakarta is well over 70%, and in other airports such as Bali and Surabaya, it is the majority. However, going forward we would also like to focus on some domestic airlines. Traditionally, airlines start by doing all the services themselves, but as they grow the business, they begin outsourcing support services.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>With our 2G, we already reach 95% of the population. For 3G and 4G, that figure is around 92%, with more than 400 3G cities and 338 4G cities. Although 60% of the economy is concentrated in Java, and our network fully covers Java, our main focus is now to expand outside of Java, both in network and infrastructure build up. In total, we are investing USD600 million, half of which is outside Java. We want to have the government redistribute the economy more uniformly. We have lobbied the government to be able to co-build with other operators, but unfortunately it still lacks the right regulations for us to do that. If we can share networks, we will be able to build more with the same amount of money. In other countries the government really does encourage industries and reduce foreign debt—the latter as the equipment is generally imported. Although there is very little movement, the government has plans for an Indonesian broadband plan.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are trying to convince the government to re-designate towers as vital to national development. This would make operations much more effective and much smoother. It would also make it easier for certain government entities to operate. Permitting issues would also be greatly reduced, which would make our operations much smoother. The government has a program that is designed to improve the power grid in certain areas, and we plan to participate through solar energy. Solar energy is a great solution in areas that do not have strong grid systems. We expect many of our towers to be using solar in the near future. We believe that the expansion of the network will be the key to future success. Geographic expansion will provide a greater footprint for the industry while also providing more opportunities for Indonesians. We also expect our clients to be better positioned within the industry thanks to their financial position. I look forward to strong growth for the industry and Protelindo.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our discussions on 4G started in 2014, when all the players in the industry recognized that CDMA was a dying network. All the major players appealed to the government to terminate CDMA. Fortunately, our frequency was suspected of interfering with 3G, which motivated the government to allow us to switch frequencies. After this, we negotiated hard; however, our frequency was migrated from 1,900MHz to 2,300MHz. We had no other choice but to switch to 4G, which requires a large investment of times and resources. However, by doing so we ensured that our company had longevity. This process began in 2015, and we were the first operator to provide 4G services at that time. We have now completely transitioned to 4G. We are extremely ambitious about 2018; our target is to grow at least 50%. We also plan to double network capacity and expand bandwidth. Our volume will be more than double its current levels. We are entering an important investment phase and are extremely excited about the coming year.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We provide leverage to mom-and-pop stores to help them be a part of the digital world, serve their customers, and also enjoy the benefits enjoyed by urban populations. At the same time, we leverage them with financial capabilities to sell and earn more and have a minimum debt stock. Kioson will be fundamental in achieving this national transformation and help increase digitalization in rural areas. When the nation is digitized, the economy will be better and investments will increase. We were the first Indonesian start-up to go public. We have a solid management team that has been in charge for years, and it understands capital markets. We decided to explore the IPO option and realized we could truly do this. We felt local investors investing in a local start-up would appreciate that our value was market determined. From the book-building period to the official day for public offering, we have seen great results.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia is a huge country, with more than 90% of the population still using cash and more than 60% still unbanked. Another characteristic is that card usage is low, even among the 40% banked population. We now see the launch of new products like e-wallets, though the adoption is not there because they have to create new ecosystems. That is why there is no prominent player in the market yet, despite the huge size of the market. The market is flooded by Android and Apple phones, so we began to see that as our processor for payments. We are looking at SMEs, which are still underserved by the banks. We become the agents that deploy to all the merchants, and they do not have to send multiple readers. They indicate which transactions they want to acquire, and we can route it to them via the cloud. We use technology to create efficiency.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our platform is being re-developed currently; however, we are different in that we aren't a sales-driven company. Our competitors focus on revenue and hard selling. We cater to really understanding someone's financial status and offering them the best solutions possible. We see companies offer their staff bonus and incentives to sell or push loans or products onto Indonesian consumers, but those are not core to our values. The same goes for our expanding SME division. Financial literacy in Indonesia is miles behind the rest of the world. For this economy to thrive, we need to allow it and enable it to do so, from personal banking to commercial and business banking. Right now, many companies are still trying to maximize how to get credit cards to people, which might be the wrong direction and missing the economical zeitgeist of Indonesia completely. This is where we see a lot more entrepreneurship in the ability for traditional banking to become part of digital banking.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Start-ups all across the world go to Y Combinator to learn as much as possible from the company. At the beginning, we availed ourselves of the resources that were available on its website. From here, we applied to it and received an invitation for an interview less than a week later. During our interview we explained exactly how and why Indonesia has a huge problem in payment infrastructure. This is a clear problem when we consider that e-commerce is taking off, though 80% of the country remains unbanked. The idea is to allow people to convert their cash into a digital balance by using our network of agents, and then use this digital balance for purchases or for reconverting back to cash using the same network. Our customers can then use their wallets for online purchasing and paying bills. People need sustainable financial solutions, and we are utilizing some of the most sophisticated technology in the space to enable this.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Compared to banks, we cater to a different asset class. Between peer-to-peer and normal deposits, bonds, or even stocks, I would place our risk and return profile between stocks and bonds. We are quite conservative in the sense of our underwriting approach. Another differentiating aspect of our platform is the social factor. We try to build awareness with our lenders that it is not just about their financial relationship with borrowers; it is also about the social benefits that they deliver to borrowers. We give affordable loans to the under-banked population and segments that are not served yet by banks. In the education loan segment, for example, we are perhaps the first to launch a student loan education market in Indonesia. Thus far, the repayment rate has been great as well. We have also had protection funds since we started the company because we wanted to focus on retail lending to make sure retail lenders can join our platform comfortably.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Mining is a long-term investment; therefore, we need consistency of the government and policy. The recent changes create some concern for us, especially in the nickel segment. The government introduced the law and is generalizing minerals into one item. It is facing issues of exporting concentrate and the copper concentrate. Not all minerals are all equal. For nickel, Indonesia accounted for 30% of the global market share in 2011. Indonesia will always be an important nickel producer in the world, which is why nickel policy will have an impact on the global market. Our quality and grade is high compared to other countries in Asia. The policy of banning the export in 2014 revealed the trends. We are seeing the growth of value added—already USD6 billion in investment—and the process of value addition is happening. When the government imposed that law, development started to happen.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Infrastructure is important and will result in higher productivity and potentially lower energy and logistic costs, eventually translating into lower inflation as well. However, infrastructure is a long-term investment. PPPs are a great idea, but making them a reality is a long-term process. The investment climate has to be conducive, the policy has to be stable and supportive, and in some cases there has to be some central reform that needs to be done before a project can be viable. For the private sector, there must be an economic angle before this can work. China has also committed to balancing the price of coal. If the price of coal is too low, the industry will suffer. Around 85% of its coal comes from underground operations and, therefore the costs of operation are higher. Whereas in Indonesia, coal mining is mostly open pits and, therefore, cheaper. The industry seems to hope for it to remain at USD65-75 per ton. We are satisfied with that and believe in 2018 that the coal price will still be above USD75.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our products are mostly exported to China. We initially exported all the ore to China; however, the government later introduced a new law that stated we could not export raw materials. Consequently, we built a flotation plant to extract the higher quality of leads and zinc, or the concentrates. We now sell a more premium and value-added product than we did when selling just ores. We also save a great deal of the cost. Before, we had to transport 200,000 tons of ore a month from mines to ports, and it would cost a lot. Now we just transport 2,000-3,000 tons of concentrate, which costs less and requires fewer trips. When the government enacted the mineral export legislation, we started building a smelter as well, and we are looking at other markets besides China. We are doing a great deal of testing now to determine if we can produce bullion from the concentrate with a higher grade. If all goes well in the coming two months, we will consider starting in 2018.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our Turkish partner, Hitay, after it studied a number of different geothermal blocks in Indonesia, asked us to be its local partner due to our excellent track record, relationships, capabilities, and experience here in the sector. Our contribution to the partnership is that we bring the technical experience and meet the pre-qualification requirements, while Hitay brings the finance. Hitay has calculated a great price at which we can provide electricity to the government under this project. Things are moving well right now. We have already conducted the survey for the mapping and topographic survey. We should be drilling by 2018. Fortunately for us, given what has happened to oil and gas prices over the last four years, we have been geothermal experts from the outset. Plus, when oil and gas prices fall, geothermal activity goes up. We have a future plan with Hitay to acquire more geothermal blocks in Indonesia. Unfortunately, there are new regulations from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources that are not investor friendly. Nevertheless, investment is not really slowing down; people are still waiting to see if the regulations will change the situation. The great thing is that the minister is pushing geothermal growth, whereas there was not much activity happening in this segment before.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We made a conscious decision in 2012 to focus on geothermal projects. Back then, it was impossible to project that oil would dip so low. However, we looked at the regulatory structure that was more flexible for bidding, and there was an opportunity to negotiate directly with operators. We made that decision and have been exclusively geothermal since 2013. We started with six wells for Supreme Energy Rantau Dedap in South Sumatra and then moved to Star Energy Geothermal (Wayang Windu) in West Java, where we drilled six wells. That same rig 253 has now mobilized to North Sumatra to drill for Sorik Marapi Geothermal Power (SMGP). Rig 231 is already there and has drilled seven wells for SMGP. Thus far, we have made the right decision and the operators have been fantastic to work with. It is a different kind of drilling from that of oil and gas. When a geothermal operator comes in and bids for a block, they are bidding based on relatively incomplete information because often no wells have been drilled there yet. After conducting seismic studies and estimating potential, the company negotiates a power purchase agreement with PLN based on the expected geothermal production. Indonesia is number one in terms of potential for geothermal in the world and third in current capacity.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In October 2017, Sarulla commenced the second unit at its geothermal power plant, after the first unit opened in March 2017. The second phase generates 110MW. Each unit of the three phases consists of seven generators: one steam turbine generator from Toshiba (Japan) producing about 60MW and the remaining six manufactured by ORMAT Technologies (US). With those six units, we produce another 50MW. The third unit is scheduled to be operational by May 2018. It will add another 110MW to the total capacity. The Sarulla area is brine dominated, and the energy coming out is high-pressure steam and high-pressure brine (hot water). In other parts of Indonesia, most of the areas are steam dominated. For brine-dominated resources, the ORMAT equipment is suitable for energy extraction. For geothermal development, the challenge is that, in this country, there is not much reliable subsurface data. The government has not invested enough to find resources by itself and has been relying on private investors to do so. The regulations have become more reasonable than those in the past, and there are some successful examples, including Sarulla, with many keen investors and interests from banks. However, the basic scheme has not changed much, which is one of the remaining challenges.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Geothermal is one of the main platforms of Medco Power. It not only offers significant resources potential, but the government has also outlined its intention to increase the role of geothermal in the future power plant fuel mix. In 2018 we are focusing on the completion of Sarulla Unit 3 (110MW) and Pusaka (8.8MW) projects. Gas to power is also our key platform. With the introduction of Minister Regulation No.45/2017, there are opportunities for development efficient gas to power projects, for example through wellhead gas to power concept. We have opportunities to team up with our upstream affiliates to realize this concept. Some of the potential areas we are currently reviewing are in Aceh, Kalimantan, South Sumatra, and Sulawesi. Leveraging our unique position with upstream affiliates, we seek to develop 1,000-1,800MW gas-fired power plant capacity potentials.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Marubeni started an EPC business in power over 50 years ago; however, since the end of the 1990s we have done independent power producer (IPP) projects and have become the owner of private-based power projects. Currently, we have more than 40 power stations all over the world, and that has become our major profit sources. We have many opportunities both in IPP and EPC business in Indonesia as the country has proceeded with ambitious 35GW program projects, including Tambak Lorok Project, which we were awarded. Indonesia has the largest potential market for power projects in the world and is an extremely important market for us. Coal fire holds the greatest business opportunities as Indonesia still has a great need for a substantial amount of electricity, and coal fire will still play a key role in supplying and satisfying the huge amount of potential and demand.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of our CSR projects is installing solar lighting in remote villages, which transforms the lives of these villagers. They can study, play, and have social gatherings at night without having to use a kerosene lamp that is 90% less bright and more dangerous. Another of our CSR initiatives is visiting schools every quarter to talk to children about energy efficiency and how they can contribute to Indonesia and the world with their environmental practices. We also partner with UNICEF to help children go back to school and have committed at least IDR2 billion (USD140,000) for 2018 to help UNICEF with these programs. We also opened a Lighting Application Center where our customers and partners can see what we are talking about when we say that lighting goes beyond just illumination and can help cities.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In order to provide better electricity supply, we have outlined three approaches. The first is grid expansion, which can be done when the community load is near the electricity system. Then, the transmission network interconnection is developed to acquire a better management electricity load. The second approach is the individual stand-alone, the variant for areas where the community is spread out and far from the PLN system. In order to meet the electricity needs, the government provided solar home systems for each house whose financing is on state budget. The third approach is the micro-grid or distributed generation. This is developed when communities are far from PLN systems, but in one area. Micro grid-off grid is the most efficient and reliable to be developed separately. To increase the electrification ratio, we have introduced small-scale power supply operations.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our priority is the motor insurance business, and in 2018 we will continue to focus on growing this business. Even though we expect sales of motor vehicles to increase, it will not be that significant this year. We will try to expand to enter other non-group multi-finance because we want to utilize our advantage in doing the motor insurance business. In Indonesia there are four or five general insurance companies that currently cover a large amount of motor insurance. One of the requirements of doing such business is that if we get a large amount of motor insurance, then we can manage the loss ratio of the business. Another area where we have solid penetration in is what we call auto series; independent brand surveyor Frontier recently acknowledged us as the second-best brand for auto insurance. Having a product known as a top brand will help us further penetrate other segments of the market. One benefit that we deliver to our customers is our auto claim apps, where our customers can report their claims 24 hours a day. In the past, they would have to wait until our offices opened; now they can download our app and use it to report their claim whenever they want. We immediately respond through the app by directing the customer to go to our auto garage repair shop.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our company was formed by the current BPJS Kesehatan to focus on health primarily for employees of state-owned companies, though also other companies. Our portfolio mostly comprises corporate employees. In 2014, the government set up Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), one of the largest health insurance schemes in the world to provide social health insurance coverage for all citizens. JKN has rocked the boat regarding health insurance companies. Previously, companies could use their budgets for health to purchase private health insurance coverage. Now, they have to pay a mandatory amount to JKN, and what is left is used for hospitals and family doctors; it is not mandatory for all cities in Indonesia. We are fortunate because we can structure our premium so that it takes into the account the claim that can be paid from JKN. We have been exploring how we can maximize the benefits of this. We still have some concerns from our clients because of the level of comfort experienced in hospitals. Hospitals cannot turn down those with JKN and have thus become more crowded. We structure our business around that and have a designated line at the hospital to provide better care for our members. Our business is fairly unique in the healthcare market because there are few insurance companies that have the ability to compete with us on the scheme.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Taspen Life's portfolio is divided into two products. One is the retail man-to-man and the other is group. The employee benefit service is focused on group life insurance, so we grab the group and focus on state-owned company employees. Our parent company is PT Taspen (Persero), state owned company primarily providing social insurance for government employees. Taspen serves around 4 million active employees, more than 2 million of which are public sector pensioners. In 2015, Taspen gave us a big portfolio from state-owned company employees since it was no longer allowed to hold them. At that time, our assets increased from IDR4 billion to IDR2.7 trillion; now they have reached IDR3.2 trillion. Our products are group endowments, group annuities, and group whole life. They are the best products in the industry. There are over 50 life insurance companies in the country, and more than 20 companies are joint ventures; however, we are a local company. In terms of assets we are number 24 because we have focused on government institution and state-owned companies since 2014. In terms of premiums, our growth has been huge; they increased by more than 200% from 2015 to 2016. Our ambition is to be in the top 10 in the industry. Our strategy is to grow our assets through government employees and introduce brand awareness day by day in Indonesia.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Asuransi Reliance is in the IDR200 billion-1 trillion income bracket. If we take out the captive insurance companies, then we are in the top 10. We received awards in 2008, 2010, and 2014 for being the best insurance company. Some other companies already have captive business because they have their own financing and banking company. Our established premiums have grown up to 70 times and in 2018 we expect to grow by 100 times. We currently serve over 1 million customers across Indonesia through 13 branches and representative offices. We are also partnered with up to 1,000 hospitals across the whole country. Our three main products—motor vehicle, personal accident, and health insurance—are performing well at the moment. Premium production in life insurance has slowed down, though Reliance is still able to maintain its performance with continuous growth. In addition, we focus on health insurance, motor vehicles, and personal accident. We offer customers a wide variety of options in terms of insurance and want them to experience our great service. We have a strong claims department and a one-day service for claims. Our mission is to become a world-class finance company through excellent service quality and the highest integrity. We want customers to choose us because of our service rather than our price and we want them to trust us implicitly.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Capital Life's holding company is PT Capital Financial Indonesia, which was publicly listed in 2016. We also have a bank, PT Bank Capital Indonesia, which was publicly listed in around 2007 and was the first subsidiary company in this financial group. Then the owner established a life and asset management entity and grouped this with venture capital and sharia insurance under one holding company, PT Capital Financial Indonesia. PT Capital Life was established in 2015, and we have three directors in total now. We have a new sister company called PT Capital Life Syariah that was established in 2017 and is operating independently. Our business model at PT Capital Life is to do bancinsurance business; in 2015, we had around IDR200 billion in premiums. In 2016 we achieved IDR2.2 trillion in premiums for new businesses and as of September 2017 had achieved about IDR4 trillion in premiums. The assets of the company are growing rapidly. At the outset, Capital Life had just IDR100 billion in asset capital; now our assets have grown to IDR5 trillion. The company's equity has grown from IDR100 billion to around IDR1.2 trillion. Our growth has been rapid due to our business model. We are a bancinsurance business serving PT Bank Capital Indonesia and other banks and financial institutions, including multi-finance, general insurance, co-insurance, and micro-insurance companies.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Citibank received the Best Foreign Bank award by Finance Asia in 2017, and we have also been recognized as the Best Global Bank. We are focused on digital and were accordingly acknowledged as the best bank in consumer digital and the best bank for corporate digital, both by Global Finance. We have also received awards in other specific areas such as mutual funds, corporate social responsibility, corporate bonds, and syndicated loans. In November 2017, four Citi bankers were inducted into the top 100 bankers in Indonesia by Infobank Magazine. These are important because earlier in 2017 Citi globally targeted to be the best bank in the eyes of our clients. We do not seek to be the biggest bank, though we want to be the best bank. A few years ago, we also globally outlined our philosophy: Citi wants to be simpler, stronger, smaller, and safer. We learned our lessons in the quest to be the biggest and forgot that we are in fact a bank when we got involved in businesses that we did not understand. We used to have an insurance business and a brokerage business, and we used to own assets that we did not understand. When it comes to our matrix we focus on returns and efficiency. We want to deliver the best returns on asset, equity, and efficiency, which is a cost-to-income ratio below 50%.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The proximity of Indonesia and Thailand is a key advantage, and one of our key drivers to look to Indonesia for business opportunities. We started with trade financing, because trade in the 1960s was focused on commodities when Thailand sold some of our agriculture products to Indonesia. Since then, business has transformed. Thailand is fairly strong in the agricultural base, and we play a role outside of lending to bring investors into Indonesia to take advantage of the resources that the country has to offer, such as ample land and human resources. 2017 was better than 2015 and 2016 because commodity prices stabilized and are currently in a period of slowly catching up further. In general, 2017 was a relatively successful year compared to previous few years, and I expect 2018 to be better than 2017. Overall, we plan to grow by double digits and higher than 2017. There will be provincial elections in Indonesia in 2018 and general election in 2019, and these will play a part as well. 2018 and 2019 should be large spending years for everyone, which will get businesses rolling. We look to continue our work in petrochemical and food and beverage, as well as consumer-facing sectors. We will also emphasize on logistics, for example those related to infrastructure. The energy sector will also be in play in both 2018 and 2019.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ijoined Bank Sampoerna in early 2014, when the bank was still in its early stages. The purpose of acquiring the bank was to ensure that we could help and nurture the growth of our colleagues in the micro and SME sector. There are around 60 million SME and micro players, and only around 30-40% are served by a formal financial institution. We compete with the informal sector, namely individual moneylenders, and are performing better than them. As a small player, we still have a great deal of room to grow, and our performance in the last three years has been positive, though banks have been leaving the micro sector in the last few years due to downturn in the commodity-driven sectors of the economy. We are growing quite well in terms of net earning assets, with growth at around 40-50% per annum in the last three years, though we only have 20 branches so far. Opening up branches can be costly, and, therefore, we leverage our strategic partners that already have a presence in more remote areas. We focus on monitoring the performance and underwriting criteria, as our main business is simply savings and loans. 2018 should be better because the impact from investment in infrastructure has started to kick in, and some of the projects are now functioning well.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, average financial growth was 7% while third-party funds grew at around 16%. Our profit was around 5% on average. In 2017, the consumer lending sector and commercial lending grew the most. In commercial lending, we saw growth in the construction sector, while in consumer lending it was mainly in housing. We will conduct an IPO in 2018; we want BRISyariah to be an open public company with greater transparency and professionalism. In terms of financing, we also want to raise new capital for three areas: IT, expanding our business through financing growth, and new brands. Our composition is commercial and retail, with commercial representing 30% and retail 70%. Our decision is to therefore focus on retail. Additionally, there are four classifications in Indonesia for financial institutions; we are currently tier two, and our capital is around IDR1-5 trillion (USD70-350 million). We want to increase our capital via an IPO to become one of the top five players in Islamic banking. We are currently the third largest amongst 13 Islamic banks in terms of assets. We target increasing our profits and revenues by between 15 and 30% and expect 2018 to be significantly better than 2017. We will focus on infrastructure such as toll roads and new energy solutions, while in retail, the focus is on customers through housing and pensions.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Citi is in 100 countries though we operate in 160 countries. Indonesia is categorized as an invest-and-grow country in the overall context and strategy of Citi. The firm wants to invest and grow the franchise in Indonesia. It is an important franchise globally, in Asia, and ASEAN. In 2018, we will celebrate 50 years in Indonesia as we started operations in 1968. We have an internal tagline: 50 years for Indonesia instead of 50 years in Indonesia. We have been here for 50 years and want to be here for the next 50 years and the following 50 as well. The Indonesian banking sector has grown tremendously with certain uniqueness. We are the perfect fit for investors who want to invest in Indonesia, be it in the financial sector, portfolio segment, or real estate. We were pleased that Indonesia's investment grade was upgraded and its position on the World Bank's ease of doing business index jumped from 91 to 72. 2017 was a great year for the banking sector. The banking sector is well capitalized, the capital adequacy ratio is around 23%, the banking sector has ample liquidity, and the loan-to-deposit ratio hovers around 18%. The banking sector is experiencing a low interest rate environment and the central bank has got the benchmark rate of eight times since the beginning of 2016.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Lufthansa Group has experienced solid growth in the Indonesian market; the number of customers from this market increased by more than 50% in 2017 compared to 2016. Other than Jakarta, we also see traffic coming from Denpasar, Surabaya, Medan, and Manado. These cities are connected with our partner Singapore Airlines via Singapore. For Denpasar and Surabaya, Garuda Indonesia and Jetstar also offer connectivity via Singapore. Our partnership with Singapore Airlines allows us to offer greater connectivity and flexibility to connect more secondary Indonesian cities to our hubs. We connect our Indonesian customers via Singapore to Frankfurt, Zurich, and beyond. We recently adjusted and enhanced our sales force in Indonesia. And with that completed, we can now focus on developing and strengthening our presence in this key Southeast Asian market with both corporate and individual travelers. One of the priorities is continuing our work to enhance the joint venture scope and include more travel options for our customers in this region. Next, on the Lufthansa Group level, we continue to include elements of digitalization and modernization into our products and services for our customers. We have set an investment of EUR500 million until 2020 into digitalization and innovation. Lufthansa Group is also investing EUR36 billion on fleet modernization between 2016 and 2025 that sees 252 new aircraft joining the fleet.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As a luxury car manufacturer, we choose our products for this market based on our customers' demands. With that in mind, we are currently assembling most of our flagship products—X1, X3, X5, 3 Series, 5 Series, and 7 Series—in Indonesia. Our local partner, PT Gaya Motor, under the supervision of BMW AG, can assemble up to 18 units per day. Almost 85% of our total sales come from locally assembled products and, based on this, we look forward to increasing our assembling capacity to offer even more premium cars to our customers in Indonesia. The electrification of road cars is inevitable. In Indonesia, synergy between the government and industry players, through the key components of infrastructure support and tax regulations, will lead to the success of this new segment. 2018 is set to be an exciting year, as we plan to introduce a series of new products in the SUV and sedan segments, including an unprecedented all-new product. Overall, we will launch more than 10 new vehicles in 2018. We are extremely thrilled about these new products complementing our current offerings and bringing sheer driving pleasure to more people in Indonesia. We will also offer more locally assembled products. We hope this will further expand our business in Indonesia and also increase our market share.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The mission of the chamber is simple: to facilitate trade and investment between Indonesia and the UK. Our focus in particular is providing market access support to British companies that are not yet doing business with Indonesia or not yet investing and to also provide various platforms of development opportunities for those British businesses that are already trading or are already investing in Indonesia. There are certain sectors that are more difficult than others in terms of doing business. The supply chain of the oil and gas sector, for example, is really tough. A great deal of the ease in doing business for a company is the result of using the expertise that is available, which is where an organization like the British Chamber of Commerce comes in. We have a team that is dedicated to providing market access support across sectors. Our greatest asset is our network with a huge reservoir of experience across all sectors, whether it is within membership or stakeholders outside membership. The best and most practical thing that we can do is bring an interested British party together with someone that is already doing it here or has an interest in the space here and that has an excellent reputation, and they work it out and remove the bumps in the road.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The German Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia is part of our worldwide network of 135 offices in 90 countries. We are an organization with a number of functions; one, the oldest, is representing the interests of our 500 corporate members. About 50% are German companies, while the others are Indonesian companies who either represent German companies or have business ties with Germany. We do individual as well as generic advocacy and act as a social and informative platform with around 200 events per year in different formats; some connect to German culture or activities such as Oktoberfest and Asparagus Dinner, while others are informative about new technologies or legislative changes. Within the trade and investment promotion function we act on behalf of the German government and support everything that is market-entry related either in Indonesia or in Germany. If a company wants to acquire information about Indonesia it can appoint us to conduct market and product studies. We also provide legal advisory services such as corporate establishments, registering for licenses, working permits, and so on. We have our own lawyers, but also work with a number of specialized local as well as international law and tax consultancy firms. The third part of our responsibility is the development and implementation of various government and institutionally funded business development programs for specific sectors or topics.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>EuroCham is essentially the chamber of the chambers of Europe, where we all come together in the interests of all the European business chambers and speak on behalf of Europe as a whole. EuroCham does not specifically support individual companies. Our role is mainly about advocacy and lobbying the Indonesian government and different authorities to make the voice of European business heard. Significantly over the last few years we have evolved to work closely with the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN). KADIN is powerful as well so it is an excellent partner. We have MoUs with it and are currently working on writing a joint position paper to give input to both the Indonesian and EU governments on all the topics where EuroCham and KADIN have a common view. EuroCham is also gradually improving our influence here. We have even been invited to roundtable discussions with certain ministries. We are also part of the Customs Reform Team as an observer to give our input to those reforms. We partner with all the different chambers when there is a common need to act, for example, where there is a manpower regulation that affects all foreigners. In these cases, we all come together and pool our resources under the International Business Chamber of which all chambers are members.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Baker Hughes, a GE company is a unique company that touches on upstream, midstream, as well as downstream. The merger was extremely important for both companies to create a full-stream vision. Baker Hughes' strength was mainly in upstream, reservoir studies, and services. The oil and gas section of GE had an upstream portfolio, pipeline solutions in the midstream segment, as well as strength in downstream with turbo machinery solutions, valves, compressors, and pumps. Today, the new company links all that with strong digital offerings. That has created a great deal of strength for us to tackle the markets and be a real partner to the oil sector, and not just in upstream. We touch all the pieces of the oil sector and partner efficiently with all our customers. Together, both companies have over 125 years of experience worldwide and we bring that to Kuwait today. Kuwait is one of the key players in the region when it comes to oil and gas. Kuwait is one of the countries that continued to invest during the downturn, unlike many places where CAPEX slowed down and projects were canceled. Kuwait Oil Company plans to increase the number of rigs and build new production facilities. We expect to see new petrochemical complexes and a new refinery. The Kuwaiti market is healthy compared to many other places in the world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Kuwait is going through a transitional change, and a particular problem of the country is that insurance companies have their own sales force. In other countries such as the UAE, companies run through brokers or the bank insurance sector. In Kuwait, companies are not allowed to provide a mix of banking and insurance. To date, insurance companies had their own sales force and competed for market share. We are bringing change to the system here. There is huge opportunity for large brokers like us to have presence in the country. At the moment the size of our operations in Kuwait is limited; however, among brokers we are the largest. We are already big in the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, and other countries, and in Kuwait we want people to be aware of the quality they should seek if they require financial advice. We are a growing company in Kuwait and expect to have more advisors, more interaction with the consumers, and more business activity. We are ahead of competition because the theme of insurance brokerage comes from other Gulf countries where we already have developed significantly; we can follow the innovation that Nexus has brought in other GCC countries. There is a huge scope in Kuwait, and we have not even scratched the surface.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The three pillars under my management are document management, technology, and lighting. The document management division is represented by the Xerox business in Kuwait. The printing industry is declining because of the digital transformation, so we will not see a great deal of action in that area. Within the document management business in Xerox, digital transformation is a key pillar of growth, while traditional copying and printing is declining. We have different value offerings for our existing clients. Book publishing and digital printing is seeing great demand. 2016 was a slow year, though we are anticipating some recovery. With the stabilization of the oil price, everything is steadier now. Despite the difficult economic climate, we have some megaprojects that were launched in Kuwait. The airport expansion is coming up, and we have many great project developments for hospitals and hotels. There has been fantastic growth in the infrastructure of Kuwait, so this demonstrates the direction we are heading in. It provides an optimistic outlook for the future and inspires us to continue to be innovative, adding to our portfolio solutions and partnerships with other vendors and manufacturers. With these changes in infrastructure comes great opportunity for innovation. We have a strong economy in Kuwait, and I am positive about the future of our business and the country as a whole.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Aristan EPC has three areas across the group, namely construction, design and architecture, and property management. The real estate business is flooded in a way now that most segments are already tapped in the larger cities; however, we are still working in real estate, especially residential. We work with the private sector and see a revival in residential real estate. We seek to be involved in larger and more sophisticated schemes that are not yet present in this market, such as healthcare and infrastructure projects in logistics or airports, for example. These are key segments that have been more active lately. Such an evolution for the group happened naturally, rather than deliberately. We started from scratch as a start-up business almost 11 years ago and now the group itself and the key companies are growing. The focus we can put into a project is simply limited to the number of experienced staff in the company. We thus try to select unique projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Orda Invest holds a unique niche in the development, residential, and commercial real estate markets. In the intervening years, there were several large projects realized in Astana, Almaty, Pavlodar, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Aktobe, and Shymkent. We are talking about hundreds and thousands of square meters of residential and commercial real estate. In 2016-2017, Orda Invest commissioned several projects that have truly become landmarks in the capital. These are Altyn Arna, Asyl Park, VIVERE!, and Yantarnyi residential developments located on Mangilik El Avenue as well as the Nur Aspan and Zhetigen residential developments constructed on Koshkarbayev Street and Millennium Park Lane, respectively. Despite the challenges in the real estate market and price appreciation of building materials, we decided not to raise the price of apartments and fulfill our obligations. Moreover, we started the construction of the first clubhouse in Astana, Baisanat, in 2017. Our corporation is gradually working on the diversification of our business, implementing new projects and increasing our investment attractiveness.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Coming into the market in August 2016 as the newly branded EMC, we realized the opportunity for a professional real estate management company couldn't be riper. There is over 1.2 million sqm of commercial real estate to compete for in Almaty alone. We decided it was time to encourage the market to be more transparent. Around 80% of business centers were built without any real thought or intentions; there are no classifications, organized management, or standards. We consolidated all our assets and attacked the market by deciding to become publically listed in December 2016. We committed the first year of our strategy to properly reviewing our assets and employing the necessary changes, if not renovations. With regard to all those assets that were not brand new—our buildings currently have a strong B+ rating confirmed by CBRE—we had to ensure they were energy efficient and implement green standards in our business centers to make sure our clients would be satisfied.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>From an operational perspective, 2017 was an excellent year. We finished the year having achieved our targets, especially as the mining sector shows steady growth. In fact, 2017 was the start of what I expect to be many more great years to come. This is mainly due to the increase in demand. 2018 will be a bright, interesting, and challenging year. Our customers are chasing demand and trying to do it at the lowest possible cost of ownership. We would like to contribute to their success as much as possible. Furthermore, we see increased demand from our customers to work together in terms of planning and managing the demand to supply parts. They want a strong partner that can track machine performance. We have also started a few interesting projects in terms of technology options. The changes we have enacted internally have positioned us perfectly to capitalize on these opportunities and retain our place as a leading player in the local mining and industrial equipment business.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, we grew in every possible way compared to 2016. In terms of revenues, since 2016 we have grown approximately 50%. We do not only sell equipment and parts; we form long-term partnerships with our customers. We are mostly on site in terms of our warehouses, mechanics, and the 24/7 services we provide. In terms of staff, we also managed to grow from a team to 700 in 2016 to over 800 people today. There is more investment required in our machinery as well as training processes to enable quality servicing and aftersales work. Mining accounts for about 75-80% of our business in Kazakhstan. We are present in the construction as well as in the energy sectors as well. Commodity and oil prices are most important here so it is vital to be aware of trends and adapt the business accordingly. Both are now on the positive side, which means most of companies in the sector investing. This is the environment that we like and in which we thrive.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The company seeks to be a professional distributor of premium brands in Kazakhstan. At the time of founding in 2004, the main partner was, and remains, Komatsu. In 2013, business in Kazakhstan and Russia was developing fast, and we decided to also represent the Bomag brand, one of the leading manufacturers of road construction machinery whose product line complements the Komatsu range. Today, we are also studying the possibility of further diversifying our portfolio, though we are approaching this carefully. We are currently focused on two industries, mining and construction. We are engaged in machinery supply and provide an integrated comprehensive service for mining enterprises, road construction and construction companies. The oil and gas market is also interesting, and it is dear to me from my experience in Russia. Our goal is to provide a professional and comprehensive service for our customers that meets the highest international standards and requirements of Komatsu and Bomag.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>ATF is currently present in every region in Kazakhstan and, as it stands, most banks only work in just a few cities, namely Astana, Almaty, Karaganda, Shymkent, Aktau, and Atyrau. We have increased our business volume substantially in the last 12 months. We have also increased our SME portfolio 63% YoY. We have increased deposits from our SME clients by 28% and our interest income by 26%, while we also have increased our fees and commissions by 14%. On the retail side, the increase is not as large, because we only target a small part of the retail segment. Our retail portfolio increased 35% YoY, and we issued 17% more debit cards as well. We have increased our fees and commissions by 60% in retail as well. We have decided not to open new branches, preferring our clients to use our services through the internet instead. A major achievement over the past four years has been to bring down our NPL rate from 46% to 10%, and this is an ongoing effort. The issue is that the low-hanging fruit, or easier recoverable debts, have been collected. Now we have to go through the court system to collect the rest, which will take some time.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 1Q-3Q2017, Home Credit Bank managed to once again outperform the market due to its strong sales culture and superior risk expertise. This enabled 42% growth in sales volume and significant improvement of risk costs. In the first nine months of 2017, our net loan portfolio grew by 34% due to both business lines—consumer and cash loans. The retail deposit base increased by KZT14 billion YoY. Today, we are ranked number one in deposit growth, with the number of deposit customers exceeding 260,000. NPLs have steadily fallen to 4.19% as of September 2017, compared to 5.22% in December 2016. The bank continues to strictly supervise NPLs. Two bonds in amounts of KZT10 billion and KZT5 billion were issued in May and October 2017, respectively. As a result of all this, Fitch confirmed our ratings as B+ and BBB with stable outlook. We are always looking for opportunities to react faster and better, adapting our value proposition to a dynamically evolving banking market and even more sophisticated client pool. Some of our product introductions, such as conditional-interest products and family protection insurance as a bonus to deposits, are still unique to the local market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have two main goals to build our competence in the SME market. First is private loans, or small-time cash loans, for whatever purchases the client needs. The second is small to micro business, where micro is typically below KZT30 million per loan. These are the regular traders in the market. Earlier, they were not covered much by major banks. They are clients of microloan companies that provide services without official financial documentation and at high interest. Therefore, it was thus an obvious opportunity for us to introduce a unique and efficient scoring system. With this, we analyze the result and the official track records of making payments and taxes and can provide financing at lower rates. There is a matter of balancing our interest in attracting more customers and the coming, conservative regulations. There are always new laws to comply with while clients always have certain demands. What makes a bank stand out is being able to talk. Banking is still a broker business and a bank needs to attract brokerage. Second is the ability to be creative. For example, if one is unique in their identity, then one does not need to spend so much on advertising to introduce its service or product.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>GEPA is a government institution that develops export-related activities under the trade and industry mandate. Our target is to develop non-traditional value-added exports. We are looking at the service industry where we have to market in terms of education, health services, tourism, and creative arts. Export development has been neglected in the past 15 years and this has cost the nation badly. In 2017, we earned export returns of USD2.4 billion, and when we took over, we made a bold statement declaring we wanted to develop exports to the tune of USD10 billion. When we set high targets, it helps us consider the unthinkable and think outside the box to ensure we achieve those goals. We have changed the vision and focus to concentrate on developing value-added and sustainable products. We are done with just exporting raw goods. Our president has also said value addition is key, and we have set out on this task by focusing on value-added products such as cocoa, gold, cashews, soy beans, gold, timber, mango, pineapples, coconuts, cassava, and more. Each product and every aspect of the value chain will be an industry of its own, including farming, transportation from farm to factory, support industries, packaging, marketing, and more. Such a value chain can create many jobs, which is the vision.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The chamber has been in existence for the past 250 years, and since 1968, it has been the leader of the private sector and the engine of growth. The government alone cannot bring about development, and the chamber was established to bring all business people together to advise the government on how to provide an inviting atmosphere for businesses to thrive. Doing business in this region is fairly expensive. Since we do not have trains or ships that operate on these routes, we rely greatly on air and overland transport, making it expensive. The police and customs extort money from people, which delays the delivery of goods and services; therefore, we need to create borderless systems to ensure that services are updated and the best practices are employed. We hope to get funds for investment and development. We also receive support from various countries that have ports to give concessions to such businesses. At the African Prosperity Conference, we finalized a common free trade agreement (CFG) that will result in free movement of goods and services within the region. This will increase exports and reduce imports. When it is done, there will be less pressure on the dollar and it will reduce inflation and corruption. We are looking at a technology called kaizen, which helps one utilize resources.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our mandate to drive investment in Ghana covers the full spectrum; however, the government has set priority sectors, for example energy, infrastructure, agri-processing and agricultural production, tourism, and ICT. These are all foundation sectors for the direction we expect the Ghanaian economy to grow in, from aid to trade and from the export of raw materials and resources into value-added and production. Thus, we have to look at some of the foundation investments that are needed, such as energy. Without energy, we have no business trying to industrialize. Industrialization and manufacturing also require a certain supporting infrastructure in terms of access, transportation, and the logistics value chain. We also focus on integrated rail, road, air, and water transport. There is also a need to invest heavily in agriculture. In 2016, our total food imports were in the region of USD2.2 billion, while we have significant amounts of arable land that is lying fallow. If even half that money was invested in Ghana, we would move from being a net importer to a net exporter. As a result of the One District, One Factory program, we see foreign investors coming in with the desire to partner with local players to manufacture equipment and provide energy to tackle the issues across the 216 districts in Ghana. This program is almost an ideal PPP opportunity.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We came to Ghana in November 2015 when the country lacked a reliable and consistent supply of electricity, even though the existing installed capacity of the power plants was far below total demand. Therefore, the government of Ghana and ECG decided to deploy our first Powership with an installed capacity of 235MW, followed by our recent 470MW Powership, which is currently undergoing requisite commissioning procedures. We are 100% focused on maintaining an efficient supply of power to Ghana and its people at a low cost. Karpowership is operational in four countries: Indonesia, Lebanon, Mozambique, and Ghana. Each country has its specific needs, advantages and disadvantages. Ghana is a democratic country with a peaceful and stable political setting that creates an enabling environment for foreign investors. Companies wanting to do business in Ghana must always be reliable and trustworthy. Additionally, the Ghanaian people are hospitable and human relations are important in Ghana. In the big picture, these are positive attributes that influence management issues and not just the operation of making business developments so operation wise this is extremely effective.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Nokia has actively been operating in the country for the last 19 years, first as Alcatel-Lucent and then for the last three years as Nokia. Ghana is a growing market for Nokia, with ultra-broadband access and IP networking at the top of our priority list for the country and the region. Our business in the country is strongly aligned to position us as a market leader that competes from a position of strength from all perspectives—from our technology portfolio and geographical reach to our operational plans. The mobile market in Ghana still has growth potential and displayed stable signs of organic subscriber uptake in 2016, performing in line with market researchers' forecasts. We anticipate the market to grow in the coming years. The broadband internet market is underserved as customers' expectations of speed and reliability are not yet matched with suitable offers they can afford. Projects such as the Google-backed CSquared open access network and nascent fiber-to-the-home deployments from major operators should foster the sector. Introducing new technologies will improve ICT infrastructure and provide the means to extend internet broadband connectivity nationwide.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of our top priorities is to put Dizengoff back on the business map. Our key focus is to ensure that we are visible in the marketplace and that people are aware of what Dizengoff offers. We are not just a product-based business but also a solution-based one. Ghana's competitive advantage starts with an educated and willing workforce. The infrastructure can deal with growth over the next few years, though it needs some investment. The stability of the currency over the next few years would be a big plus. Our proximity to North America, South America, and Europe is of great advantage. If shipping lanes had to open up directly to Ghana, rather than around the tip of Africa it would be of great benefit to us. There only needs to be a realization of the existing opportunities for the Ghanaian economy to flourish. The northern region at the moment is untapped. Because of the logistical issues of getting to that region, it has been largely circumvented, with the focus having been on the Greater Accra region as well as Kumasi. We have also concentrated on supporting neighboring countries, despite linguistic and logistic challenges.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have name recognition because we have done detailed feasibility studies for a long time and have been customizing our system to make up for infrastructure challenges in terms of proof of address, proof of ID, and so on, as well as to be able to provide total exposure and more accurate affordability calculation for a potential client. If an individual has taken loans from several places, our products help banks and companies combine all these loans under that client so as to be able to calculate affordability and determine the person's exposure. Participation has gone down in terms of smaller companies; however, banks are fully on board. We have many products that analyze indebtedness, performance of loans in different sectors, and other details of portfolios that should be of interest to financial institutions as well as the government. Banks agree they need these products though they claim budget constraints. We work with the banking and retail sectors, embassies, and International Finance Corporation to convince the Bank of Ghana to help reverse the trend. Along with our partners, we provide continuous education to increase participation and awareness. It seems that the new administration is starting to work on the infrastructure, the national ID system, and the address system. When these come together, it will be easier for us, using these technologies and systems, to expand.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We opened our offices in 2012 and in the past five years we have been constantly expanding our operations because of the vibrant expat market in Ghana. deVere's multicultural staff truly gives us an edge when dealing with the specific needs and circumstances of our clients. Our main business is locally managing the UK pension funds of Ghanaians who have left the UK, facilitating access and increasing growth. Due to the large amount of funds from our 80,000 clients, previously we received special deals from large investment banks to replace the underlying investments of those pensions in 8% fixed-income products. In the future, we will do it via our own investment bank, establishing direct contact with our clients, who now benefit from more freedom. Around 75% of our clients are locals who have lived overseas while the rest are expatriates living and working in Ghana, which means there are two different tax systems. We use our own auditors and lawyers when clients have particular questions about local tax duties or tax. However, when there are changes in this country, they are done within a day, which means everyone immediately has to adapt to these sudden changes. We have an ever-increasing number of individuals working with us, which creates greater awareness of what we are actually doing due to the fact we do not have any competition in the country.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Technology drives most of what we do. Our customers are not the average sophisticated consumer that is familiar with high technology; however, we can still extend technology to them in a way that they understand gradually to make our business even better. For example, we have a portal that people can use via their smartphone to check if they qualify for a Bayport loan. We, thus, see fintechs as partners, not competitors, as they have platforms that we can adopt easily to facilitate our business. We are working with many telecoms companies in this regard as well. Our payroll services have always been for civil servants, which made collection easier because we deal with one institution. However, that client base is finite and fairly small because there are only around half a million civil servants in Ghana. In comparison, the informal sector is huge, and that is where our attention will be focused. The average Ghanaian is now familiar with mobile phones, and we want to use this channel to reach them. We do not just offer payroll loans; we also provide loans to SMEs, individuals, and groups. We have started with group lending to groups of market sellers where if one member does not pay, the rest of the group can cover the debt. These are the people that grow to the point of starting SMEs.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Cummins is an American company established in 1919. After operating through independent distributors for some years, Cummins Ghana was established as a fully owned Cummins distributor in 2009. Cummins Ghana is here to provide support for Ghana and the sub-region. We started by establishing strategic locations to bring resources closer to our customers and reduce lead time and downtimes. We are in the power and energy solutions space providing technologies in these areas. We also have engines for trucks, the marine sector, and oil and gas sectors. Cummins Ghana has invested USD20 million in facilities, strategic branches, dealerships, talent management, and inventory in the past five years. It is in this regard that the regional distribution center in Accra was established to stock huge parts—filters, new and reconditioned—to serve customers in our market and the region. Cummins only has two regional distribution centers in Africa, Ghana and South Africa. This enables us to push resources closer to our customers in Ghana and the West African territory to reduce downtime.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Mantrac Ghana has been the sole authorized dealer for Caterpillar products and services since 1937. Between 2012 and 2020, we spent over USD60 million on facilities development, and that is just for buildings, infrastructure, and equipment. Nevertheless, every year we invest around USD500,000 minimum on tools and equipment, all to offer clients the maximum support for every piece of Caterpillar equipment purchased from us. We run a network of four branches in Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi, and Tarkwa. In addition, we run many customer sites, with the largest ones for international mining customers like Newmont Ghana and Goldfields Ghana Limited. Facilities investment is an ongoing project with additions every year, key amongst them the state-of-the-art component rebuild center in Takoradi with an investment of USD45 million that should triple our current capacity when it comes to rebuilding component engines, hydraulic systems, and so on. The facility will be the largest in West Africa and possibly one of the largest in Africa. This is also the largest investment for a Caterpillar dealer in Africa currently.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We were in Nigeria for six years until 2010. Due to security reasons, we sought new and secure ports and moved to Ghana, one of the safest ports open to international markets. We operate in other neighboring countries through our distributors. We support these distributors on projects, especially with our technical team. Due to demand for generators, we bring in Perkins Engine products. We also have different types of engines, including John Deere, Volvo, Aksa, and Doosan, which is our bestseller. We want to diversify our product line, which will help us grow. Demand for our products is growing. We see opportunities in generators, as they are used by everyone. With Aksa Energy and other competitors, there is more reliable power. Ghana is predicted to grow under government programs and start manufacturing. This means the country will need generators more than ever. Ghana will definitely need more reliable and technical perspective that we can easily support.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2018, we want to be strategic in our approach to business and hope to get more robust with digital banking. We are a retail-focused bank and want to reach out to many more people. Banking is moving away from brick and mortar, so we will push forward with digital. We are going to do more trade finance and want to open up Africa to the world through our network. UBA is looking forward to facilitating payment across trade in Africa and looking at an innovative mobile app that will also rely on biometrics. What's more, we want to leverage bank account transfers using social media platforms to facilitate banking services, including the movement of money. We will be focusing on that in the retail sector for driving financial inclusion not only in terms of mobilizing their deposits but also giving out digital credit. The recent announcement of higher capital requirements will strengthen banks, making us bigger and increasing our capacity to do more. The government can continue to improve the environment and create an enabling environment for us to thrive. It is on course but can do better. Finally, it would be great to allow banks to do business. There should not be competition in any way with banks from the government side.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Stanbic Bank in Ghana is becoming increasingly significant, and today we are among the top four or five countries together with Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Angola, and South Africa. Since early 2016, Stanbic has been the leading corporate investment bank in Ghana. We have a well-developed investment banking advisory business that works with our colleagues in China to work with both Chinese businesses coming to Ghana and Ghanaian businesses going to China. We also work closely with our team in London to look at sovereign eurobonds and with our teams in South Africa for larger African businesses. Another investment bank in Ghana would not have such a spread that covers all areas. Our debt capital business, which is part of investment banking, has been part of the government bond program for the past three years, through which we helped the government raise its debut local currency bond. We also advise it on eurobonds. Finally, we put together large private-sector debt transactions through our structured debt products to leverage debt and over time increase clients' equity. We also have our staple corporate banking business for large multinationals and domestic companies. We are digitizing the ability of our clients to receive payments locally and internationally using digital platforms, which makes us the global leaders in foreign exchange trading, fixed income trading, and structured products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have grown from one branch in 1990 to 78 branches as of 2016, spread all across the country. This underlines that the distribution of our services is key. Over the past five years, digital has become central in what we do. If we want to be responsive to the needs of our clients we have to position ourselves to be able to ride the curve of this technology and the technical development that is taking place in the sector. In December 2016, we became the only country in Africa to launch a unified mobile app that allows customers to send and receive money from 33 countries. We extend it even still further to non-Ecobank account holders, who can now receive money through the generation of an e-token sent via WhatsApp. As of November 2017, we have over 220,000 people using our mobile app, and they are actively accessing services. This figure is a combination of our internet banking solutions, POS service stations, QR codes, and ATMs. At the SME level, we are working to introduce the informal banking sector to formal services, creating a credit history and a track record for them. For corporates, we also want them to initiate and terminate banking transactions from the comfort of their offices.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Honey Bun has long been known as an innovator; we never looked to existing standards as a reference for the basis of the company, but looked outside of Jamaica to establish best practices. We were the first to invest in equipment for firmer bags for our products. We are also the first bakery in Jamaica to be HACCP-certified for food safety. Honey Bun is also the recipient of many stock exchange awards for corporate governance, best practices, investor relations, and so on. We do not work for awards, though we look at what we can do to be as good as the rest the of the world. We export to the UK mainly. Two of our products that are doing well have a longer shelf life as a result of their ingredients. One of them is called a spice bun, which contains preserved fruits. The other product we are re-marketing is our rum cake, which is popular.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are a community-based company and have a close connection to the surrounding community and farmers. Farmers account for around 30% of our scotch bonnet pepper needs at the moment. We work closely with them by providing technical assistance, seed and water support, and land on which they can farm. When we showcase the connection between factory and the farms, one truly feels the authenticity of our brand and product. We use only natural ingredients; we do not have the hottest pepper out there, but a wonderful flavor profile with a nice kiss of heat. Our secret is that everyone involved in Walkerswood has great pride in our business. Our jerk seasoning, hot sauces, table sauces, and condiments are the real core of our products. Jamaica has a diverse heritage, and we try to stay true to that in our product lines. Jamaica should focus on value-added products, because this allows the country to capture wealth, improve the economy, and support our workers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The company was registered in the early 1980s, starting as a truly micro-company. The first years mainly involved air shipments to fill that diaspora market with products such as hot peppers and breadfruit. We are passionate about contributing to the economy, supporting rural farmers in their production systems, and developing sustainable businesses in the industry. For us, it is not just about shipping things out in the raw state, which is what we did initially. Now we seek to add value, and by doing so, we assist farmers in getting a better price for their produce. We produce gluten-free breadfruit flour as well as sweet potato flour and cassava flour. There is a growing need for gluten-free products, after all, but it is also a product that will help small farmers with the trees and fruit. Our company has also started producing teas, and we use only Jamaican products like moringa, lemon grass, sorrel, ginger, guinea hen, and turmeric for our teas.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>No one offered a healthy chicken menu in Jamaica or jerk chicken in a formalized restaurant environment. I felt that Jamaica needed an authentic Jamaican restaurant chain that offered healthy food. Jerk was mainstream enough to penetrate all strata and all nationalities; we felt it was a concept if successful in Jamaica, we could take it overseas plus have the added bonus of being healthy. There were two things we were aiming at: healthy food and Jamaican food. This is still our vision, and we continue to develop more healthy items. We also are conscious of the environment, so we do not use styrofoam and instead use environmentally friendly packaging. The Ministry of Health has indicated it will endorse our products, and the Heart Foundation approves of our menu and style of cooking. We are also part of the Jamaica Moves campaign with the Ministry of Health. We are being innovative in emphasizing the fact that we are a health-conscious chain.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Jamaican coffee is considered a fine coffee throughout the world and is highly regarded for its quality and flavor, especially Blue Mountain® and High Mountain. It is also a boutique coffee because it is so rare. In relation to world production it is small, at less than 1%. Jamaica Standard Product has been in business for 75 years and is one of the oldest companies. I am the third generation involved in this family business. We are one of the few that do all the different types of coffee, including Blue Mountain® and High Mountain. Many of the other producers are only Blue Mountain®. In fact, the High Mountain brand is ours, which we are known for. We also have the single-largest coffee farm in the country, Baronhall Estate, with over 300 acres. With 75 acres in Springhill, Portland, we also produce our own Blue Mountain® and purchase from neighboring Blue Mountain® farmers as well. We are a fully integrated company from seedling to cup and are one of the leaders in terms of quality coffee offering. Our goal is to ramp up coffee production. We want to rebuild production on our farms due to some of the losses from rust and drought. We are also trying to expand our value-added side by bringing in new products</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We developed our Mountain Peak brand in the 1970s, a spray-dried instant coffee. We have grown the range to include a three-in-one and decaffeinated coffee, and in 2016 we launched our low-caff, which has 25% less caffeine than our regular brand. In 2017, we rolled out our flavored coffee—Cinameg (cinnamon and nutmeg) and vanilla. Salada Foods currently holds a little over 50% of the market share in the instant coffee category of the coffee market. Our biggest competitor is Nescafé, which is a mega-brand; however, we have been holding our own. We consider ourselves the coffee of choice of Jamaicans because most of us grew up drinking Mountain Peak. We do a process run each quarter, which is the actual manufacturing of coffee powder that we continuously package thereafter. We are the only company in the English-speaking Caribbean with spray-dry capabilities, and we leverage this capability to produce instant coffee not just for ourselves but also for the Jablum and Grace. Our biggest challenge in the coffee industry is producing the volume of local coffee we need to meet demand affordably. Jamaica does not produce enough green beans locally for the instant coffee market; it produces a large amount of Blue Mountain Coffee, and we would not able to produce instant coffee at the price it sells for.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Jamaican coffee industry is relatively small, less than USD100 million in sales. It is possible to triple or quadruple that through developing new products. Despite our 250-year history, we took an objective look and saw that the business focuses overwhelmingly on the sale of green wholesale coffee. If we want to turn the corner and make more money, we have to get closer to the final end product by selling more roasted coffee. Blue Mountain Coffee is similar to champagne in terms of regional production. If a farm is located outside particular area in Jamaica, it cannot be called Blue Mountain Coffee. Although a farm should have 900 trees per acre, many Blue Mountain Coffee farms have far less. There is a great deal more that could be grown on existing farms. As the largest holder of land in the Blue Mountain Coffee area, we are in the best position to lead this effort. Many Jamaicans and global drinkers of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee think of Wallenford when they think of a leading provider of high-end coffee, largely because we spend a great deal of energy differentiating our company. We have old farms running for over 200 years in some of the areas where we grow coffee, and we want to leverage that as we seek to diversify geographically.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our third-generation company holds a strategic balance between years of industrial experience and cutting edge technological solutions. The combination of experience and technological innovation has helped CESCO expand its range from an electrical supplier to a solutions provider meeting the demand of its clients in the rapid development of many sectors both locally and regionally. Today, we remain committed to the highest quality solutions that we offer from our five divisions of electrical, building (construction), energy (generators), lighting, and data-comm solutions. Many of our clients testify that CESCO does not only sell a product but that we offer a complete solution. Our building division has been located among the top suppliers for solutions in construction. We sit with the architects to find out exactly what unique, creative ideas they desire in order to offer the best solution. Our Ultracem products, which range from molding, siding, sheets, decking, and ceiling tiles, are a key solution in modern designs, both commercial and residential. The building division is proud to have supplied our solutions to a number of hotels across the island, especially the recently completed Jewels Grande on the north coast of the island.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><del>I</del>nitially, I purchased a gorgeous piece of land with the plan to build around 40 luxury homes. Although high-end homes are more or less my usual business, I felt there was a tremendous need in Jamaica for affordable homes when I looked around. There was incredible expansion of hotels on the north coast of the island, but really the residential market was not developing at the same speed. Today, Jamaica has hotels employing more than 1,000 people and those people need a place to live. On top of that, there is always the issue of safety. So, not only do we have to provide a home, but one that is in a safe environment for these families. We have already delivered about 350 homes in Falmouth, about 1.5km from the center of town, and we should finish the development within three or four years. Demand is extremely high, so that is not the problem. The problem in Jamaica is that, while in the rest of the world when building affordable housing the government steps in and does the infrastructure work, here the government does not do any of the infrastructure. This means the cost is becoming prohibitive. The government does everything it can to help investors in Jamaica short of providing any financial assistance. This is because the government is on a tight budget.<del></del></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Prior to RE/MAX, we were a mom-and-pop operation to about 40 years. We wanted attract an international clientele even more than when we were just Sunshine Villas. We have been RE/MAX for five years now, and with that, there has been a pull through RE/MAX to get people here both for rentals, sales, and land purchases. Because we are RE/MAX, they are more confident giving us the opportunity to assist them. Some have long-term goals that they want to achieve, and we help them with the price points when they are ready to invest. Others are concerned about healthcare, security, and so on. Currently, our business is mostly residential, though we had to diversify more into commercial because as people come, they are inspired to open commercial businesses. Compared to other countries, it is relatively cheaper to set up a business here. One can get fantastic real estate in great locations for a fraction of what they would pay elsewhere. As a country, we do not have everything that other countries may have, such as a drive-through car wash, and people who move here start to realize that they can make great money opening businesses. We are not just in the market of real estate; we are in the market of Jamaica as a whole.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have grown significantly over the last five years. We have moved from being a start-up to a medium-sized to a large-sized BPO services provider. We have three main goals that we have continued to work on to grow our business. One is acquisition of new clients. The larger we get, the easier it is to land bigger clients and deals. Another is providing different services as we grow, going back to our existing client base and sharing additional services with them. This is a way we can further entrench ourselves in our client base. The third is acquisition of other call centers. These include medium-sized players that may have difficulty because of capital constraints or getting new business due to the size limitations. We want to bring them into our world, help them grow faster, and help ourselves grow faster. Industry wide, I started the Business Process Industry Association five years ago with JAMPRO. The industry association has been there to hold the hand of the government to drive and steer it in the right direction to continue to make it the industry that investors would like. It is important to drop all of the barriers to entry and the process to start a business made much easier.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>From my perspective, which includes 25 years of experience, the industry is resilient if you adapt with it. With changes in legislation and automation of call center services, the whole industry was supposed to collapse. Soon, chat was going to destroy the industry because the next generation would never pick up the phone. Now, there is actually a swing back to live voice skills because everyone is getting blitzed by digital marketing, and there is no personalization or engagement. Technology was supposed to save time, but it has yet to fully replace the need for people. This is good for Jamaica, as technology will help bridge the gap in human capacity. It is not that we do not have people here that are just as intelligent or just as capable, but we just do not have as many. Technology will come in and bridge the disparity in numbers and help develop our human capital. I predict language translation will be a key technological development to build on our human resources. This will be live voice. We are working right now on market research. This will all be a game changer and will help the country tremendously if companies adopt it.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Six years ago, the government could not see the potential of business process outsourcing (BPO) services. Other governments in the Caribbean were doing a better job of incentivizing call centers, while we were lagging. However, we are making progress. Our energy costs are still high. In comparison, Trinidad has low energy costs and is on the verge of truly expanding in the BPO space. Energy is our biggest expense and I do not see this changing anytime soon, which impacts our competitiveness. Despite this, people still come as a result of our high productivity. I foresee even greater growth in the future. We are keen on establishing our own solar facility, though the upfront investment is still too high. The government could play a role here, though thus far it has not. Incentives such as zero interest loans for energy improvements would be extremely helpful, as would more opportunities for financing. Our technology infrastructure is vastly superior to our competitors; we expect innovation to continue changing the business. I see Jamaica's BPO sector as being poised for huge growth in the years to come. Employment in the BPO sector has the ability to far surpass employment in the tourism sector. We are a booming industry. More international investors are coming to Jamaica and seeing excellent results.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have had significant investments that have taken place in the last two years. The first is an investment by the American group New Day in Noranda. New Day brought Noranda out of bankruptcy, maintained the operations, and is presently moving those operations back to peak levels. The second investment was by the Chinese firm Jiuquan Iron and Steel Company (JISCO) in Alpart in St. Elizabeth. Alpart had previously been closed for almost nine years. It is currently producing alumina, and the first shipment was sent in December 2017. Restarting the plant required an investment of in excess of USD300 million. Additionally, JISCO has substantial plans for major investments. It expects to spend USD3 billion in the next three years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>JBI is a Limited Liability Company owned by the government. We are not a straight civil service agency. In the past, all of the bauxite and alumina companies here were traditional operators with technical R&amp;D facilities that provided support for their subsidiaries. Currently, the companies that operate here do not have this same support. JBI sees these types of services as its responsibility. We see ourselves as an organization that supports the entire community. We have developed and earned a great deal of respect from the industry, and we will only strengthen this position as we bring the industry back to Jamaica in a powerful way. The government is also helping to incentivize bauxite and alumina development within the private sector. There is the Bauxite and Alumina Mining Act, and there are new legislative structures looking at special economic zones that will take over where bauxite and alumina mining programs stop.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Energy makes up approximately 30% of the cost of alumina production. When you have a generating plant that is small and old, you are faced with many challenges and the need to modernize equipment. Jamalco's power plant is fitted with steam boilers and turbines, using heavy fuel oil to produce the power and steam for operating the alumina refinery. Over USD100 million per year is spent by the refinery for purchasing of heavy fuel oil for operating the facility. Therefore, when 30% of the cost of production is energy and the oil price goes crazy, you can see the effect it has on production. Jamalco has entered into an agreement with New Fortress Energy (NFE) to build a natural-gas-fired combined heat and power plant. NFE is building a marine gas terminal and offshore storage facility. A pipeline will transport natural gas into the plant at Jamalco, which then generates energy at a competitive price, supplying power to the JPS grid and steam to Jamalco.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Lydford Mining has the ability to produce 2 million tons of construction-grade limestone per annum and around 250,000 tons of chemical and industrial grades of limestone. Then, we make milled products, which go into plastics, paints, and various other industries. Some 80% of our production is used in the US while the remaining 20% in Jamaica. We started supplying limestone for construction and industry and moved into limestone for plastics and paints. We have also moved into animal feed products and currently supply chicken farmers and fertilizer additives with screened and sized limestone. There are over 300 different uses for limestone and we have only tapped into seven. In 2018, we are considering entering into the pharmaceutical sector with our limestone products. However, we need additional funding. All foreign investors would like to keep plants in their country, and foreign capital as opposed to local lending is key in the mining industry.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Citi is bringing international standards to Jamaica. Our business is very much focused on delivering our global platform of products to our client base in Jamaica through our strong partnerships with our global product partners. We play an extremely important role in the public sector and for local financial institutions that are important clients. As the only locally domiciled US international bank, and having been here for the last 57 years, it sends a strong signal of Citi's commitment to Jamaica, and hopefully our international brand provides a clear message to the international investment community, the multilateral agencies and the rating agencies of our continued support to the development of the economy. We are proud of the role we have played leading several landmark transactions for our clients in Jamaica, including the two very successful voluntary government domestic debt exchanges in 2010 and 2013 executed in partnership with our New York product partners, as well as a PetroCaribe debt buy back in 2015, which allowed for a significant reduction in the government's external debt. Our local relationship management, aligned with strong global support, allows us to deliver our products with unique added value.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>It is important to create a culture in which people enjoy working and feel that they can develop and achieve their full potential. While that is not specific to banking, I feel there is an opportunity for firms in the private sector, as leaders, to focus more on how we treat our employees and how we create a great culture. We have made some progress. However, we still have a long way to go. And that is true throughout the country, not specific to us. What gets me excited about my job is the ability to come in and figure out how to put together a leadership team that motivates others. The second thing is, because of how we are positioned in the industry, we are the people that can go to new frontiers and really make a difference. We are pursuing a strategy of financial inclusion. We do well because we have more customers and are getting more people into the banking system. We are a part of the conglomerate GraceKennedy Limited. We have a sister company that handles remittances with hundreds of thousands of customers. We, at the bank, have far fewer customers. A portion of our remittance customers do not have a bank account, or they have a bank account that is not with First Global Bank. Our group opportunity is to locate ourselves within the remittance business through an innovative concept we call satellite branches. They are little kiosks and a teller window. Basic banking services will be available at any of these locations.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The commercial bank JMMB Bank came out of the Capital and Credit Financial Group, a group acquired by the JMMB Group in 2012. When we took over the reins in July 2012, we began by setting out to rebuild with the objective of being able to eventually apply for a commercial banking license. Year on year since then, we have been growing faster than the sector in terms of loans and deposits. Of course, we set about fixing the prudential benchmarks over time to ensure we would be on side with the regulators. We then applied for the commercial bank license in March 2016, received approval in September 2016, and launched in August 2017. While operating as JMMB Merchant Bank we had two challenges: the cost of funding and attracting depositors. This was largely driven by the different prudential benchmarks across the industry, which meant that we had a higher cost of funding as a merchant bank, which made it more difficult to operate. In addition, if another financial institution placed deposits with a merchant bank, it is not considered part of their 26% liquid asset requirement. Therefore, although other financial institutions could have gotten a higher interest rate depositing with a merchant bank, they did not.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Sofos is a Spanish company based near Barcelona that started working on renewable energy in 2004. From 2004-2008, the market grew exponentially in Spain. We also enjoyed government subsidization, which allowed us to thrive. After 2008, the government cut these subsidies and the solar market declined drastically. At this point, we decided to expand into new product lines and expand internationally. Many Spanish solar companies were expanding into different markets, and we saw a great deal of opportunity in the Caribbean. We originally expanded into the Dominican Republic because we had some links there. While there, one of our clients in the hospitality sector asked us to study which of its Caribbean hotels would be the most feasible in terms of installing solar. After studying the different markets, we realized that Jamaica offered the most benefits. This was one of the main avenues through which we discovered Jamaica and one of the main reasons we are here today. Since then we have expanded significantly.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I saw an opportunity to start Solar Buzz Jamaica in order to go up against a monopoly, the Jamaica Public Service Company Limited (JPS). The venture was also about my desire to help the environment. Around 2010, energy prices were out of control in Jamaica; oil was at USD100 a barrel, and the national grid here had been neglected for a long time. There was an energy crisis, and everyone was trying to find solutions. I thought people would embrace solar power, but we ran up against a great deal of resistance due to the JPS monopoly, limited public knowledge, and high costs. Initially, we had to focus on energy efficiency by supplying energy monitors that show users' real-time energy usage. Solar Buzz got the exclusive distributorship for the Owl energy monitors, which we placed in homes and businesses. That along with media coverage put us on the map. By 2014, the Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) came along with financing and more people started using solar power.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>New Leaf Power is a pioneering green energy company known for innovation and leadership. We are advocates for energy reform and new legislation. Although we are a small, new company, we have made a difference in exposing Jamaica to new ways of doing business and financing renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects. We have also broadened the kinds of clean air technologies that should be considered in Jamaica. These are mainly solar, wind, and hydro; however, we have expanded that to include geothermal and ocean thermal in particular. We are among a few clean tech companies in the Caribbean that are doing exhaustive work in the ocean thermal space. That is a big part of the blue economy, which is huge, and Jamaica is an archipelago with a great maritime tradition. There are several areas in which we have been pioneers. One is advocating for new legislation and programs to liberalize environmental law to boost competition. We provide a lot of leadership there. And in terms of innovation, we have brought new technology that is being proven around the world.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been a leader in the entertainment and creative industry in Jamaica and the Caribbean for almost 40 years. We have pioneered a number of areas, the main one being the modeling industry. As a result of Pulse, over the years, Jamaica has produced many international supermodels. We will introduce a number of new faces into the market in 2018, as we look to expand the agency again at that level. Also, in the music industry, we held the Peter Tosh Music Festival, which has been well received both locally and internationally for the past two years. We are involved in many other areas of the entertainment business, such as fashion television, and Caribbean Fashion Week, which we own and produce. There is something special about Jamaica and what it represents; it captures the imagination of people all over the world. This is something we need to leverage and use to grow our tourism business, as well as our entertainment business. Kingston is where the Jamaican music experience evolved; a great deal of creative energy emerged from Trench Town, and other inner city communities. In terms of the creative industry, Kingston has become a magnet for tourists, not only because the talent is here, but also because we create “in demand“ products from that talent.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The creative industry is a competitive advantage for Jamaica. People around the world know about Jamaica—its reggae music, the cuisine, the dress, the attitude, the athletics, the culture, and so on. It is this ideology that drives the long-term vision of how to utilize the creative industry as a driver for economic growth. However, there is a level of infrastructure and policy that is required in order to realize true growth. Our research shows that the creative industries, more so than other sectors, can change an entire economy in as little as a decade. We have been reviewing models and examples and looked at best practices to determine what we can learn, borrow, or adapt for Jamaica, as we go about advancing the structure of our ecosystem. The animation industry is important in terms of framing what is happening here at the moment. The World Bank has provided Jamaica (through the Ministry of Science, Energy, and Technology) with a USD20-million loan to develop the animation sector. The World Bank did an economic impact assessment and validation to come to the conclusion that animation and the digital industries are transformative for urban renewal because of the speed of digitization and millennials working in the digital industry, making this a gamechanger in a developing economy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In the past, dancehalls were out of control; no one could get support from major sponsors for dancehall music because the crowds were unruly and uncontrollable. I developed many dancehall artists, and through my concert involvement, we have managed to clean it all up. Now, Downsound Entertainment has the full support of the largest conglomerates in Jamaica for the Reggae Sundown Festival. I feel great about that, though we do not know how long that will last because everything is unpredictable here. The reason I got into concert production is because I love concert production, I love events, and I like doing things that are bigger than life. We have the biggest brand in dancehall and reggae music, and it is loved all over the world. We have revitalized the brand and are opening our doors to Africa. They are the ones who really want to be here and not take advantage of the Jamaican name, to pay respect for what Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Dennis Brown have done in the past. That is what Reggae Sundown Festival is all about. We are an international brand, and we know how to do reggae and dancehall music in a way that others do not, like sunshine reggae in Europe. We are the real deal.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Total is a major player in the Caribbean. We are present in the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, Haiti, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, where we have been present for over 13 years now. We started by acquiring a local company called National Fuels and Lubricants. Four years later, in 2008, we bought the Esso assets. We are present in different distribution sectors. With a network of close to 60 service stations, Total has the largest number of service stations in Jamaica. We also have assets at the fuel depot Jamaica Petroleum Terminal in Montego Bay. We are in the aviation business at both airports and supply lubricants and special fluids. Total supplies fuel mainly from Petrojam, the local refinery, but also imports fuel directly from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). We also have a general trade business in Jamaica, which involves B2B activities, where we supply fuel products and lubricants to various businesses in Jamaica, including mining, transport, agriculture and tourism.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our company, New Fortress Energy, came to Jamaica three years ago. The utility company JPS had started an initiative to bring gas to convert its power plant in Montego Bay. In December 2014, we competed for that mandate because we were interested in being a part of the energy infrastructure business in Jamaica. We were fortunate enough to be successful in the summer of 2015. From there, we built the terminal in Montego Bay that became operational and commissioned the 120MW Bogue gas-power plant 13 months later. From this first investment and partnership with JPS, a whole series of transactions has developed. We are also partners with JPS in providing gas for the 190MW plant it is building in Old Harbour. Jamalco is an interesting case because it is an industrial partner that needs power as well as steam for their industrial processes. Given how important mining is to Jamaica, we want to be in situations where we can make a difference.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Fujitsu operates as a regional business in the Caribbean, with Jamaica being a primary location. As such, it is a part of our regional business and incorporated into our global business. The IT industry is undergoing a deep transformation as it deals with the reality of the fourth industrial revolution and the impact of digital. Fujitsu believes there are tremendous opportunities and how we leverage this differentiates us in the Jamaican market, allowing us to be locally responsive and at the same time drive scale and innovation. Fujitsu has been in Jamaica and the Caribbean for 70 years. Before Fujitsu acquired us, we were a European company called ICL. Fujitsu has profoundly changed the region and pioneered several advances in ICT, by selling its products from mainframes to complete digital technologies, but also by developing local capabilities and capacities. Fujitsu has influenced most IT practitioners across the region and in Jamaica.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Citi opened its doors in Jamaica 57 years ago under the name First National City Bank. Until the early 1980s, we operated 11 full service branches before making a strategic decision to focus our business on a select group of corporate clients and effectively exit the retail banking space to become a single branch dedicated to managing relationships with a select market target of corporate clients. This remains our core focus to date. Our product offering spans corporate and investment banking, which includes structured loans, mergers and acquisition advisory, international and local bond issuances, and treasury products ranging from foreign exchange to complex exposure management derivative solutions. We also offer trade finance and cash management services. Our clients include the financial industry in which we play a unique role as a US bank with a local presence. We offer correspondent banking services to many of the local banks and non-bank financial institutions, a service that has recently seen significant challenges in the region.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Progress here has been remarkable within several dimensions. Looking back, Jamaica was on the verge of an economic meltdown 4—5 years ago: net international reserves dropped to below USD1 billion; there was an overwhelming public debt burden nearing 150% of GDP, resulting in the government spending more than 8% of GDP on interest payments; and inflation and current account deficits were in double digits. These massive macroeconomic imbalances required both an internal and external adjustment. On the internal front, this is the fifth consecutive fiscal year that the government will achieve a primary surplus equal or in excess of 7% of GDP. As a result, public debt is projected to fall below 110% of GDP, an amazing reduction by international standards. There is also an ongoing effort to reshuffle expenditure toward growth-enhancing spending, including public investment and social spending, to support the most vulnerable in society. Our net international reserves have more than tripled, to more than USD3 billion today.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our main role is to facilitate economic growth and development that is inclusive. We promote the latter in a number of ways, such as by financing programs for the productive sectors. The major focus here is on micro, small, and medium—sized enterprises (MSME), as they are the true engines of most economies' growth. We provide concessionary financing for SMEs and capacity development through technical assistance to these enterprises and provide them with access to financing from with a number of loan products and financial institutions. From the perspective of our financing program, we are focused on ensuring that MSMEs are able to grow, develop, and be part of the growth trajectory for the economy. Jamaica needs economic growth and development, and we have been through a period of significant fiscal constraints under the IMF program that have been extremely successful. The economy has stabilized and the country has reduced the debt; now the focus must be on growth and job creation.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have a long and strong partnership with Jamaica. Our current country partnership strategy was developed in 2013 together with the IMF and IDB and prepared a comprehensive package of support for Jamaica's stabilization and growth program. The strategy focuses on three main areas: building the foundations for competitiveness and growth; public-sector transformation; and addressing vulnerability and building resilience, which is related to both natural disasters and social vulnerability. We have provided over USD510 million over the years, with more than half in budget support, and the rest in project financing and a strong program of advisory services and technical assistance. We did a performance and learning review in 2016 that assessed the implementation and validity of the strategy. The conclusion was that those three areas continue to be critical for Jamaica's development. The second part of the assessment was on how well we have done in contributing to the reform agenda and development of Jamaica—a great deal.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Jamaican economy has not grown substantially for 30 years. It is heavily indebted because of a combination of domestic and external burdens. Jamaica's financial crisis in 1997 had a massive impact on the financial landscape and economy at large, costing it 45% of GDP. There are a lot of residual effects associated with that crisis, mostly on the level of public debt. In recent years, notably since 2013, the debt has been on a declining trajectory, and the macroeconomic management of the country is much improved. This, however, does not mean that Jamaica is out of the woods, as debt to GDP is still over 100%. Nevertheless, the country is on the right track. Where there is room to improve quickly is on the growth side. Jamaica's private sector is dominated by a few family-owned companies, of which some are listed on the stock exchange. Our research shows that while some small pockets of innovation exist, there needs to be more.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The most common reason for genetic screening here is for gender selection, not so much for diseases. Sometimes, though, we catch abnormalities in the screening. We seek to introduce this much-needed education. We started with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to prevent parents from passing on genetic diseases to their offspring. We can screen embryos for diseases and use those that are not affected. There are more opportunities than challenges. In Lagos alone, the population is 20 million. One of the challenges, though, is that the government cannot do anything about the regulatory environment because it also faces certain problems. We spend less than 5% of GDP on healthcare. My wish is that we would have the proper structures in place so that everyone adheres to the rules and regulations. All the problems we have stem from certain people believing that they are above the law. However, if the law of the land is applied to the letter, corruption will be reduced and everything will improve. Health insurance, which the government seeks to develop, could be a positive; however, only about 4% of Nigerians use this program, and it is still extremely underdeveloped.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I want to leave behind a legacy project for the next generation, namely Nisa International Hospital under construction in Maitama, Abuja. Nigeria's population is constantly growing so the present Nisa Hospital in Jabi District will continue to serve those who are socially and economically less advantaged. The upcoming expansion, Nisa International, will attract those who typically go abroad for their care. We must cater to the needs of our middle- to upper-class population. Nigerians are not confident in the national healthcare system because public hospitals are overwhelmed: the population is large, the quality is low, and workers are often on strike, sometimes for months. Therefore, the growing middle- and upper-class Nigerians know if they go to the UK the standards are higher than what they get at home. What we need to do—which is what Nisa focuses on—is create a system in Nigeria for outsiders to have the confidence to come. Nisa has managed to attract a growing patronage from the Nigerian diaspora who use our facilities every year either for fertility or gynecology. Nigeria's focus, therefore, should be to have global level hospitals so that people come here to utilize our medical facilities. Its sustainability requires the joining of hands of Nigerian medical experts at home and abroad.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Bridge Clinic has been in the fertility space for 18 years, and we have the largest market share. The fertility market is becoming extremely competitive. When we started 20 years ago, we were the first fertility-focused clinic. However, 20 years on it is a crowded market. The great thing is there are many small players and it is fragmented, and there is an opportunity for consolidation. We are currently beyond fertility and, at present, our strategy is to leverage on the capabilities that we have built in running IVF clinics to run general medical clinics. The Bridge Clinic is evolving; we are building medical centers across the country. We recently completed a comprehensive feasibility study; our first clinic has gone up in Port Harcourt, and we are working on two at the moment within Lagos Mainland and the third will be in Victoria Island. I am optimistic; we have the population, and all we need is to get a few things right to unleash Nigeria on the world. Nigeria has tremendous potential; however, we need to tweak a few things to get it right and that starts with the government. As for the clinic, we want to focus on our rollout to expand our primary care infrastructure and move into the hospital space as well.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have always had a manufacturing presence in Nigeria. Currently we manufacture some of our products locally but still depend on imports for our vaccines and antibiotics businesses. We will continue to review our localization plans to ensure that we can serve the Nigerian patient effectively. We are one of the few companies in Nigeria with over 200 representatives reaching out to doctors not just in the larger cities but in the interior as well. Apart from branded products, we also launched an access portfolio that is substantially more affordable. We have created a separate portfolio and an access team that brings medicine at a different price point without compromising on quality. We are also leveraging technology in a big way to reach out to physicians in the interiors of Nigeria. We no longer have to travel to the interior of the country because of our email database to connect to physicians and nurses. Nigeria is on the cusp of its transformation.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The economy in 2016 was not particularly favorable in general. However, despite the challenges, we never gave up; rather, we strengthened our team and improved our strategies. We stuck to our belief that it is in difficult times we can truly gauge the capability and resilience of our people. So, the benefit this has brought to the market is that we have remained committed to our priority of increasing access to medicines by making our brands more affordable. Because the country's population is rapidly growing, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, is also increasing rapidly. For these diseases and other conditions, we have adapted our launch strategy to sustain affordability and access to our products. This helps the product to be affordable to many consumers. 2017 promises to be another good year where we are looking at strong double-digit growth of about 35%. Having two consecutive years of strong growth is really tremendous.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>It helps that the government is working to solve the problems that we have spoken about for 10-15 years. We are glad the government is doing something to address these issues. We are the first pharmaceutical company in Nigeria to introduce Western medicines, and we have also sought to be at the forefront of developments in the industry. We are also among the first companies to commence local production of pharmaceuticals. When the AIDS epidemic hit, we were among the first to take up the challenge and built a facility to produce HIV vaccines. We looked at the quality of vaccines coming into Nigeria and felt there was a need for improvement in standards. Hence, we invested in our pharma center, a manufacturing facility that is comparable to any in the world. A country the size of Nigeria should be able to manufacture the products that sustain the health of its citizens.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We are consistently improving and increasing our health portfolios thereby providing access to quality medicines for unmet patient needs. We are working on an innovative and commercially sustainable model to improve access to medicines by partnering with public and private institutions like NGOs, NHIS, and HMOs to address and improve access to affordable and quality medicines. We are also doing a great deal more in retail pharmacies in the area of capacity building. We are improving on some existing products in key therapeutic areas for expanded use and advocating for more government investment in healthcare and improved distribution system. With an improved drug distribution chain and appropriate incentives structure, the private sector supply chain will deliver products to even the remotest areas. Sub-Saharan Africa is predicted to be one of the fastest growing regions for the next five to 10 years, and Nigeria is particularly attractive.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are currently developing a residential property in Lekki with African Capital Alliance that is targeted at the middle end of the market. We also have a high-end development that currently has a showflat. This is located near the French Embassy and will be one of the tallest buildings in Lagos—110m tall and 25 floors—with a double entrance, gym, game room, multipurpose room for events, swimming pool, and tennis court. Prices start from USD1.5 million to USD4-5 million. It will be completed by March 2019, and 60% has already been purchased, mostly by Nigerians. Demand remains low for residential properties overall, but constant for the very high end. There is an oversupply of luxury properties, but the great ones are still being bought as the extremely high-end is recession proof. 2018 will definitely be much better than 2017 as we have hit rock bottom. With stability, things will start to catch up, salaries will start to increase, and the market will start to recover.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The luxury segment seems to be facing oversupply, both in terms of commercial and residential. In Lagos, people talk of entire buildings lying vacant in Ikoyi. We have seen prices come down across the board, and until the economy experiences some real growth, high-end real estate will remain bearish. The oversupply is short term. Once we get out of recession and start to experience growth again, supply will be absorbed. However, demand must meet supply, and so right now it is important to react to the market and be realistic about pricing. There is opportunity in the mid-income and lower sectors, where there is still a huge shortage, but a lack of consumer finance means that one needs to find an innovative model that will make one's product affordable to the end user. Overall, sentiment has begun to improve, forex has become more accessible, and the currency has started to appreciate. Nevertheless, we are still very much reliant on what happens with commodity prices.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our vision is for The Belmonte to be a landmark building in terms or quality and luxury. Our quality of construction is on par with any international standard. In addition to all the amenities, the apartments are huge; four-bedroom apartments are around 532sqm. Then, there are four- and five-bedroom duplexes, which are villas in the sky at 483sqm and 680sqm respectively, and the penthouses are over 1,021sqm. This is suitable for the Nigerian market as Nigerians like big homes and can appreciate luxury. Here, the weather is nice so we have made sure each home has large balconies and each bedroom also has access to a balcony. Our duplex apartment has its own swimming pool and the penthouses have two private pools, which has never seen before in Nigeria. Another advantage is that we are an integrated company; from design, architecture, structure, to the actual building and construction, we have everything in house, so we can control the whole process to achieve high quality.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been rolling out new services and investing in new warehouse infrastructure whilst also expanding our fleet size to support our new lines of operations. Some of new services launched include the Express Food Delivery Services (EFDS). Our freight division has also grown by leaps and bounds. This will require a great deal of investment and drive in order to achieve what has been done in some parts of Africa and in other parts of the world. In Nigeria, the logistics sector accounts for 5% of GDP, while this figure is around 18% in other countries with diversified supporting transportation infrastructure. It is an extremely attractive industry because our current challenges are really opportunities in their own right. The work that needs to be done on rail, aviation, and road networks is an opportunity for growth in the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Skynet's operations in Nigeria are extremely important. Skynet started in Nigeria in 2013 and since then we have won many awards, both globally and regionally. We won the Best Station in Africa in 2015. At the Skynet international conference held in Sri Lanka in 2017, we also won Best Performing Station in Africa. Nigeria is also the largest economy in Africa and cannot be ignored by any company that wants to explore the market in Africa. The sector needs a solid transport system, namely by roads, rail, and air. We are hoping we will get to a time the transit time from Lagos to Abuja will be just 7 hours from the present 15 hours. If the nation's road network is top grade, then that is one of the best the government can do for the sector. We expect the government to support us by providing the necessary infrastructure to ease our business.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria is a challenging environment; however, we know that in the long term the potential is huge. It is a huge country with a large population and in terms of infrastructure there is still a great deal to do, which leaves room for significant growth over the years. We are currently working on a physical expansion of our terminal through the acquisition of additional land in our off-dock terminal. This is because we expect the country to see continuous growth for cargo. The fact that the last two years have shown a reduction in the volumes of cargo is a sign that eventually volumes will bounce back. This year will be one of transition as we expect to record a slight growth in 2017, which will be positive after a year of recession. We are confident that in 2018 and 2019, unless there is a major collapse in the price of oil, things will be positive for Nigeria.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the years, we have invested heavily in port infrastructure and operations. SIFAX invested in two harbor cranes and replaced all the dilapidated reach stackers. We invested in terminal tractors, forklifts, and other equipment. As the business developed, we invested in more harbor cranes and now have a total of seven. Any port, particularly a hub such as Lagos, is the gateway to the country. Therefore, it has to play a major role for imports and exports. We have land borders where cargo comes through, but there are initiatives from the government that try to restrict that, and they are trying to make sure that trade comes through the waterfront. The maritime sector has a key role to play because without imports and exports, the economy will not grow.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Nairabox is a lifestyle wallet application that allows users to make payments for different services. We have been able to add many services to the application, for example buying mobile airtime and paying bills, such as satellite television, utilities, and toll fees. We are also the only aggregator for major cinemas across Nigeria, and users are able to buy cinema tickets online. We use this same technology to sell tickets to events through the application. We are plugged into all the premium events taking place, especially over the holiday periods. Nairabox is the preferred choice for event promoters because our technology allows for crowd control and has other features. Customers can show up at an event with their phone or just their phone number and redeem their digital ticket. Many start-ups in Africa are looking at Silicon Valley and believe they have to proceed in a certain way and find Series A investors to fund their ideas; however, it is not always the case. Before the whole technology boom and the popularity of Silicon Valley, there were companies in Nigeria that grew from small shops without the whole co-founder and investor network concept. Start-ups need to understand that it is all about getting partnerships: that is key.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Amplified Payment Systems started in 2015 but was officially registered in 2016. We are a financial technology company that works in the electronic payments space. We help businesses that accept regular payments to automate the entire process, from collections to disbursements and management of their payments. When we launched, our target segment was mostly Internet or technology businesses. Over time, we realized that many non-bank financial institutions needed what we were offering. Now, many of our clients are finance houses and credit companies. These include micro-finance institutions, consumer loan companies, insurance companies, asset management companies, mortgage firms and internet companies such as e-commerce companies, subscription businesses, and entities that do bill payments. The opportunities for collaboration have significantly improved; there is now an ecosystem of developers, designers, engineers and business people that is being stimulated by these tech hubs. The tech hubs have also brought positive media attention to the sector and country as a result of some of their impactful works in developing technical skills and harmonizing the tech ecosystem. Tech hubs are creating a central point where not just web developers but also other stakeholders, such as investors and corporates, can come in, mix, and collaborate. Collaboration is the way to grow the tech industry in Nigeria.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Iam one of the co-founders of Jobberman, which was set up in 2009. Since then, we have grown to be the biggest online recruitment platform in West Africa in terms of revenue, traffic, and number of subscribers. The employment market in Nigeria changes every year. In the beginning, with the problems of online scams in Nigeria, it was difficult to convince Nigerians that our website was not a scam and that we are here to stay and redefine the market. In terms of the Nigerian jobs market as a whole, we have had great successes as well as our own share of challenges. We work with the government at different levels to help solve unemployment. With Lagos and Kaduna states, for example, we are working to build a database of unemployed candidates considering the fact that this is important for policy direction. At the federal level, we have a partnership with the National Bureau of Statistics where we give access to our dataset. One of the things that we seek to do is further focus on extending our reach within Nigeria, West Africa, and Africa as a whole. For example, Jobberman is based in Nigeria and Ghana; however, we also have investment-type partnerships with BrighterMonday in East Africa.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>From new product launches to awards, we have continued to blaze a trail in a sector we are passionate about. Our mobile money product, PocketMoni, has been active for a number of years now, with thousands of agents that use the product for a variety of services involving cash ins and cash outs. We have also introduced other innovative solutions around it to help drive the product to the masses. There is a need to build much more services around mobile money that can bring in more revenue for agents, which is what is happening currently. One of the services introduced is called MPOS to help people who want to withdraw from ATMs. They can go to an MPOS agent and swipe their cards to get cash, 24/7. We just started with a few and now it is growing to the thousands. We are licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria, and we partner with global money transfer operators (MTOs) such as Western Union and Paypal. The only way MTOs can succeed is with efficient and exceptional services to customers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>PAGA is making considerable progress on our goal of building up our agent network. PAGA currently has 12,500 agents, and our goal is to get to 15,000 in 2017. We are well on track to achieve that. The next thing for us in 2017 is building on our agent network to offer financial services to the unbanked and under-banked. We are excited about the opportunity as our agent network gives us the needed distribution reach to the mass market. I do not believe we can have a digital-only strategy, because we still need a way to get cash into and out of a system. In four years of trading, PAGA now has 6.8 million users on its platform and a significant chunk of that growth has been over the last two years, due to our agent distribution network. With that distribution network, we are able to layer a digital platform on top. Over time, more people will get comfortable with using digital services, but for financial services, we still need that physical interaction and structure.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We were the first Nigerian company to be accepted into Y Combinator, arguably one of Silicon Valley's best-known accelerators, and the home of well-known technology companies like Dropbox and Airbnb; now, eight or nine Nigerian companies have done so. The first thing Paystack has done is open up that path to young people who are creating things. Secondly, we have made it extremely easy for businesses to start accepting payments; before Paystack, it would take about three or four weeks to set up a system, and now with Paystack, businesses can accept payments within 30 minutes. Another thing is figuring out why the failure rate for transactions was high and fixing this to ensure we have the best success rate for transactions in the market. However, ultimately  we are pushing limits simply by empowering local merchants of all sizes, making it easier for them to accept payments from their customers.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, Aiteo acquired 45% equity share of Oil Mining Lease (OML) 29, with three producing fields, and the 100km Nembe Creek Trunkline (NCTL). When Aiteo took over the operatorship in September 2015, average daily production was 23,000bpd. By December, we had increased production to 60,000bpd and reached a peak of 95,000bpd by YE2016. Our current production is 85,000bpd. Being a brownfield, a great deal of reviews, expenditure, and work had to be done. We have a projection of those activities that will increase production, which are all CAPEX dependent. These are medium- to long-term activities driven by CAPEX investment in existing producing fields and green fields that will grow production beyond 150,000bpd. We have a world-class asset with huge reserve base and the technical and operational capacities, and by 2018, we can start these activities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 10 years' time, we want to produce 100,000bpd and have domestic refining capacity of about 50,000bpd. We also want to achieve 2,000MW of power generation. All this is predicated on the domestic market and demand. Hydrocarbon sources should be an enabler of the economy and used to generate development of the economy. We do not want to focus on the export market; 50% of whatever we produce should be consumed locally. We want to produce and refine oil and use the gas that we generate to produce power for the domestic market. We all have a responsibility to do so as Nigerian companies. Nigeria has no option but to get to the point where we can provide refined products for our nation. We want to be a local refinery, not a national refinery. We will be located close to the source of crude oil and want to take our product and service the market not more than 30-40km away.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Today there is a healthy mix of international and indigenous companies operating in the upstream sector. The indigenous companies will play an increasingly larger role in this. By being an extremely well-run indigenous, independent firm, we would like to believe that we are creating a model of operations for other Nigerian firms. We must operate to the same global standards of excellence as international oil companies, but in more cost efficient and effective social partnerships with our communities and stakeholders in the Niger Delta. The country needs credible and well-run indigenous firms that can last the test of time, and FIRST E&amp;P aims to be that company. There are probably about 100 indigenous companies operating in the upstream sector, and I envisage that in 10 years there will be anywhere between five to 10 mid-size to large upstream E&amp;P companies operating between 150,000 bpd and 250,000bpd. This will happen through expected consolidation, and we are doing everything in our power to ensure that we are in a position to be amongst these top five-10 companies.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>TechnipFMC has an excellent track record of winning new projects and being able to execute them. Opportunities are limited globally. In this new environment with lower oil prices, every company asks for the lowest level of technology available to get the oil out of the ground. We see standardization globally as a supplier of equipment and services and we are promoting this in Nigeria. This goes back to lowering the project CAPEX and the breakeven point so that projects can move forward. However, Nigeria has two of the main projects in the pipeline for 2018-19. Our objective is to win the available projects so we can continue the work we have done and be sustainable in terms of all the investments we have made. For the future, I see a more Nigerian operation, where our mix of expatriates to locals keeps moving in the right direction in support of the local content law. On the equipment side, we produce it all here. The shift will, therefore, be on the project management side and the development of the Nigerian workforce so that they can execute the projects 100% from here. By reducing the interfaces and costs of project management, we enable companies to go ahead at the current oil price levels. This, in turn, allows Nigeria to continue to produce and reach its targets.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Egina Field is a great project for us. We are the contractor for only a single part of the project, the umbilical riser and flow lines; however, it allows us to really shine. The concept of single hybrid risers that we are installing is important. We have worked hard to ensure that our operations have satisfied every client requirement and have succeeded. Our competence, dedication, and commitment throughout this project have been extremely high. It is one more success story in our books. Egina has allowed many people to remain employed despite falling oil prices. Additionally, it is the first project to be awarded since 2010, which is the year the Nigeria Content Development Act came online. This project is huge for Nigeria. We have large investments in the country and our integration is unparalleled. We have fabrication capabilities in Port Harcourt, and we have fabricated over 40,000 tons of steel in Nigeria by Nigerians through the Egina Project. This is fundamental to our operations. Talent is as available in Nigeria as it is in any other part of the world. We need to grow people, and it can only be done if a company has a policy of staying put and dedicating itself to the country. No one is born a manager or an engineer; they are trained to become those things.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Schlumberger provides technology services and products that help our customers efficiently find and develop hydrocarbon accumulations. One of our main responsibilities is to make sure we maintain quality, cost competitiveness, and focus on meeting our customers' needs. In times like these, service companies need to bring innovation and cost efficiency to make every dollar our customers spend count. We are proud of our participation in the first successful oil discovery in Nigeria at Oloibiri, now in Bayelsa State, in 1956. Since then, we have been instrumental in many of the hydrocarbon discoveries in Nigeria and have helped, along with other service companies, in the various development projects that followed. We have a strong footprint in the country with several physical locations across the country, the majority of them being in Niger Delta. We were also the first international services company to hire Nigerian engineers and send them abroad to work internationally on par with their peers from around the world, and we have done this for decades. Today, we are pleased that many of the leading Nigerian service companies in the industry are led by Schlumberger alumni and are doing well. That means we did something right by creating that exposure. Today, we have partnerships in key areas with Nigerian companies both during project execution and in our supply chain.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your views on the resiliency of the banking and payment sector and the role technology plays in this resiliency?</h4><p>
<span></span>UZOMA DOZIE Looking back 20 years, we see how banking has evolved and responded to market conditions. When I returned from university abroad, I was using point-of-sales terminals, a debit card, and a credit card; however, all that was available in Nigeria was basic current accounts and saving schemes. Today, we are doing more things in payments from an innovative perspective than a UK high street bank. For example, in Lagos, I do not have to carry a card or cash and can make payments through mobile or do transfers instantaneously, which I cannot do in most places in Europe or the US. We also reach more people in urban areas in a cost-effective manner through not only banks but also organizations such as PAGA, which do not have physical locations to serve people but leverage mobile solutions technology. It took Diamond Bank 23 years to acquire 7 million customers using 300 branches while in the last two years without any new branches we acquired another 7 million customers via partnership and collaboration. We have had to evolve the business to increase our market share. This is why we moved to a mobile philosophy; this is the future. From that perspective, we are resilient and also forward looking; we look at what the customer will want in the future in order to build our solutions around that.
</p><p>
<span></span>VALENTINE OBI The banking sector in Nigeria has seen a tremendous uptake in electronic transactions, not only by design but because the sector truly does not have a choice. We have an extremely sophisticated customer base in Nigeria today. Banks have taken the initiative and changed as people come up with innovative solutions that disrupted the market, which is what is happening today. Smart banks today are beginning to deploy technology to reach the end user in a way that solutions are built around them. Mobile technology has become part and parcel of everyday life; this is why many things are happening around mobile technology, and we will see many more things, especially with the Internet of Things (IoT) coming in the future as Nigeria adopts such solutions. Continuing to run a cash-based economy is too expensive for the customer and the country. It is important that we begin to change. We will learn from the mistakes made in Europe and the US and try to correct them with some of the technology being deployed today. The IT departments of banks used to be inconsequential departments, but today this has changed and they have become mainstream.
</p><h4>Are we moving toward a cashless society?</h4><p>
<span></span>TAYO OVIOSU We are, though it will take longer than anticipated. Until the central bank issues money digitally and does away with physical notes, we will always need physical notes alongside digital because fundamentally cash will always have to enter a system to be digitized and needs to come out as well. In the foreseeable future, a physical distribution network of services will be needed in Nigeria and similar countries. In Nigeria, for example, we cannot have manned branches due to the expenses involved. It will instead be via a network of agents such as independent retailers or stores that one can go to for financial services. That is what PAGA has focused on: a distribution network that accesses the mass market where people can go to open an account, receive a loan, pay their internet bills, or access services that they want and bring them into the digital sphere. In the last four years, we have acquired around 2 million customers every year and have seen people doing transactions at those locations as well as digitally as well. Nigerians are underbanked in terms of the services available and in terms of competition between banks and more can be done around driving differentiation among banks. There are still many issues around banking that need to be resolved; however, I see us moving toward digital, and I see the adoption happening.
</p><h4>What is the competitive relationship in Nigeria like between tech companies and banks, and is there room for collaboration?</h4><p>
<span></span>Juliet Nwanguma Currently the buzzword in the payment industry is “fintech." Everyone is talking about fintech at every corner and looking to create a niche for themselves with various product offerings. The banks in Nigeria equally are playing in this space as they have always been during the era of e-banking. However, the fintech companies are truly differentiating themselves with their unique product offerings and lean structure within their organizations, being dynamic and making decisions quickly. So far in the market, I have seen more of a collaborative relationship between banks and fintech companies than a competitive one. From my point of view, there should be no basis for competition between the banks and the tech companies in the market because fintech companies and banks complement each other in the role each plays in a payment transaction—one provides ways to pay such as the debit card while the other provides places to pay like e-commerce websites through payment gateways. It is important that each party performs their own roles efficiently to provide an excellent payment experience to the customers. Banks are excited about the fintech space; however, my advice would be to focus on their core businesses ensuring that their role in the payment systems is working. The key thing is for tech companies to collaborate with the banks and vice versa, leveraging each other's strength and weakness. For example, PAYU is extremely particular about failed transactions and the reason why the transaction failed. This is because conversion rate in payment matters to us. We use our technology to monitor transactions at every step and available data to analyze reason for failures. Banks truly need to work on their payment card processing to ensure that their customers have an excellent online experience. Merchants want to accept payments and are keen to adopt technology while cardholders only want to make payments. Unfortunately, for certain banks their cards do not work, they fail and it is our duty to collaborate with them to ensure their cards work which will ultimately help to improve and grow the entire payment ecosystem.
</p><p>
OSCAR ONYEMA A number of speakers have spoken on payment systems; however, the core financial service that banks should provide is lending. Banks have to truly improve on lending or they will lose out to fintech companies. Globally, there are several megatrends that drive the uptake of fintech in addressing this issue from digitalization and big data to IoT. In Nigeria, based on the penetration of telecoms and the use of data, it is unquestionable that a bank must deploy technology to reach the population. SMEs need a large amount of funds, which is something they do not have. However, there are new solutions to provide finance to manage receivables, for example. Traditional models are being challenged around the world, and it is a matter of time before it reaches Nigeria; therefore, we have to be prepared. While payment systems are growing within the banking system, for banks to be truly resilient, they need to find new ways to provide lending. We have to find new ways to provide capital to firms seeking equity. Some of the things we are doing include automating our entire ecosystem, from generating orders and inputting through order management systems to the matching of trades to post trade linkages with banks that do trade settlements and then do billing. The next step is seeking investors who can use mobile credit to purchase securities and drive the capital-raising efforts both from the debt and equity ends. <br>
MUDA YUSUF If we take a snapshot of all the sectors of the Nigerian economy, it is clear that the financial services sector has provided undisputable leadership when it comes to the application of technology. In the West African sub region, for instance, the presence of Nigerian banks across the region revolutionized the banking system. Banks were amazed by the solutions and technology that Nigerian banks brought to the West African region. In many sectors, players in the economy worry about the presence of foreign investors because they fear they will come with superior technology. But, there is no such concern in the financial services sector as technology application is already high. However, one of my concerns with the current fast pace of technology applications is the risk of exclusion of the large informal sector in Nigeria. Penetration is still low in this segment of the economy. There are challenges of trust when it comes to adoption of technology applications, especially in financial transactions. Many still want to see and feel the physical cash in the transactions. The social dimension to this is the implication of fintech for job losses as the application of technology solutions tends to result in increasing loss of jobs in the financial services sector. It may be good for the bottom line of banks, but not so good from a social perspective. The number of employees needed is shrinking even if business is growing. This is the flip side for me when it comes to technology solutions. This is not only with the banking system but also in manufacturing sector. The more technology applications, the fewer the number of workers needed, which has extremely serious implications.
</p><p>
UZOMA DOZIE In terms of the loss of jobs, I completely disagree. We have 15,000 employees and 5,000 core staff. In creating our proposition, which was banking to the market at the bottom of the pyramid, we had to create over 3,000 new types of bankers who could go to the marketplace and sell the solutions. There is no other way we could have employed over 3,000 employees; we are in fact creating more jobs for people at the most important part of the pyramid—the bottom. Technology in fact creates commerce, regardless of whether it is e-commerce or not. We have more people now with jobs and are providing more services than if we had only banked those in the metropolis and not gone out to rural areas. We only have to look at the number of PAGA outlets to understand how many jobs have been created that would not have existed if they had not been provided with this solution. Almost every small business customer has the problem of obtaining finance and getting money. This is where technology comes in, helping a company partner with people to make the connection in a cost-effective manner. This is where payment will always be the main driver. One of the benefits of a bank is that 80% of transactions are digital; it sits on a treasure trove of data, and it can begin to see what people are doing, allowing it to create new services. Fintech is a way for Diamond Bank to provide the best customer experience, and the best is allowing a customer to choose how and where they bank and when they want to do so. The only way to do that is via innovation and creativity, which is what we try to do.
</p><p>
<span></span>VALENTINE OBI On the lending part one of the biggest challenges in the country is the sophistication of data. If we look at what telcos have done with their data, they can see the journey of the customer, how long they have been in place, and what they are doing in a day, week, or month. They know what they can lend. At eTranzact, we pay millions of people in terms of payroll on the platform and today banks partner with us because of that data; they know exactly how much an individual earns, which makes it easier for them to make a decision to lend money since they can see the flow. Over these 14 years that we have been operating, we have been able to build quality data, which is one of the biggest challenges the lending industry has: ensuring that the data that banks have is truly quality data that can be used to make the right decisions when it comes to lending. If the credit bureaus in Nigeria work as they should, this will also help. Many smaller companies want to borrow NGN1,000-5000, and how we analyze the data will therefore help in the situation of lending.
</p><p>
<span></span>OSCAR ONYEMA Banks are highly regulated and it is almost the same amount of work for a large company to borrow NGN10,000 for two days as it would be for a small company. There are sources of data and a great deal of shadow banking going on today, and many people are not included as banks only cover 35 million people out of 180 million. Competition will enter and someone will be smart enough to find a way to use the alternative sources of data to provide financial services. From the capital market perspective, there are many people looking at these things and for us to be truly resilient and sustainable in the long run, we have to adjust our business model and take advantage of these unofficial sources of information in addition to the official sources to reach people and find alternative ways to provide the financing they need.
</p><h4>
What challenges will emerge as a result of non-banking institutions providing lending services?
</h4><p>
TAYO OVIOSU Collaboration will be key because on the one hand, fintechs with access to data could use it to provide small loans for people. Our view is the best way to do it is to work with banks to figure out how they can change their structures to reduce regulations so that they can lend through platforms rather than trying to figure out how to do everything by themselves. For example, the Central Bank of Nigeria now has rules on microloans and gives banks targets on micro lending; however, the processes and requirements may not be as valid. What they could do is partner with lenders who lend on a micro level. We have built a platform that allows financial institutions to offer loans through us and we are about to launch with one bank a service where one will be able to go to an agent and apply for a loan that will not be on our balance sheet but on the bank's. This allows another path to the mass market by leveraging the distribution network that we have built and that is the kind of partnership that we want with banks so that we can combine our experience of reaching the masses with banks' financial muscle. We are also considering other institutions that may have MFB licenses but take non-collateralized loans and offer such loans to people as well. I see a great deal of potential for this and ways to offer lending services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I read physics at school and had a special insight into the country's great need for adequate generation and distribution of power. When I visited Guangzhou, China and saw their exhibition on the wide range of solar power applications, I came back and started working in a solar energy company in Nigeria to gain experience before helping set up Wavetra Energy. More people can now independently generate their own clean power, which gives me satisfaction, as it is what I have always envisioned. We basically sell clean energy. We have packages for power based on clients' power consumption. We do consultations and even orientation online, as well as repairs for inverters and controllers. We offer complete installation, warranty, consultation, and repair. As a company, our advantage is simple: we developed our own way of driving down costs with no compromise on quality. The market here was overpriced; therefore, we partnered with manufacturers in Germany, the UK, and OEMs in Asia and optimized our operations.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When I returned from California, I looked into Nigeria's problems, one of which was—and still is—power. We did some solar rooftop installation for several customers, which launched us into the solar market. We came up with some designs on how to power filling stations using solar. Though demand was initially low, we powered on. In 2012, we partnered with ABB (Newave), one of the top manufacturers of UPS in Europe. Two years ago, we decided to go back to basics and create many of our designs for gas station projects. If it is possible in some countries where they have less than three or four hours of daily sunlight on average, then it is possible in Nigeria since we have six or seven. One of our plans in Powercell is to have complete off-grid solar solutions for both commercial and residential areas in form of solar micro/mini grid projects. We are working on major filling stations across the country, as well as solar microgrids.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are three key aspects in our logo: the color blue, a camel, and the sun. The blue represents hydropower, the sun represents solar energy, and the camel represents storage, so that is the concept of blue camel. We started in 2007 as a small company, a running store where we deployed small household inverters that store power from the grid and use it for home appliances. Shortly after, we discovered a great deal of potential in the industry, and within six years of operations we grew significantly. Since then, we have been expanding in other areas. We are located near the equator and have strong sunlight compared to most of the world; thus, we should harness this potential. We seek to go much deeper into the industry beyond installation, maintenance, and operations and into research, supporting the government, and education. The idea is that if we do not get it right this generation, we should be able to get it right for the next one.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Protergia emerged from our passion to provide solutions in the energy sector and bring in our own expertise in green economy. We started in 2015 and decided to stay within a particular market segment that we considered to be largely untouched: the commercial and industrial to utility scale sector. Before we entered the market, there had been a great deal of effort in small home systems (SHS), e.g. the 1-10kW systems for homes; however, because of the way the market evolved, there were many sub-standard products, poor workmanship, and engineering such that many Nigerians became disenfranchised and disillusioned about renewable and solar technologies. When we came in, we decided to sidestep the potential land mine in this market and embraced the commercial to utility scale market. We entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the Niger State government to deliver 1,000MW in December of 2015. The first phase involves 100MW, the land has been allocated, and we are at the pre-development stage.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are areas in which we have been more successful, which is proven by the fact that in the last 20 years we have systematically grown more than our competitors. We are more insightful and entrepreneurial than some of our competitors, and we harnessed several areas of the economy that are growing significantly worldwide, namely the digital space. In everything that has to do with digital transformations and digital approaches to businesses, we have been particularly successful; we have built a great ecosystem of companies around us with whom we work together quite closely. There are also several areas where we are growing significantly because we had a smaller starting base. We are less present than some of our competitors in some regions of the world; thus, we also have a leeway of gaining our natural market share there. We are also more capable in terms of analytical insight, especially in situations of uncertainty.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The objective of the Luxury Network is to create unique partnerships. In the normal world, businesses operate within the boundaries of specific sectors. However, our proposition is cross-sector marketing that connects businesses with pre-qualified HNI clients from other businesses and sectors. Our events create a platform to connect with potential customers interested in the brand in a comfortable and relaxed environment. Over the years, this has proven to be a winning formula as the global network boasts a membership base of the world's most prestigious brands and a high retention rate. Currently, the true definition of luxury is not clear to consumers. We will help to define what it is and educate consumers and businesses on the fundamental principles of true luxury. Our goal to build a luxury network requires meeting various criteria, but we have a successful blueprint that has been developed for 10 years in 27 countries.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>AIIM set up its Nigerian office in 2011 but had made our first investment in Nigeria in 2008, a 40% stake in the Lekki Concession Company (LCC). Since then, we have made many more investments. We seek ways to play power in a distributed fashion. For example, a building can either be plugged into the grid or generate its own power. It is typical energy efficiency and clean tech play; what is also useful for Nigeria is that users do not have to rely on the grid at all. What we do is go in and provide green energy to corporations, which also get large discounts on the prices they are paying for diesel fuel. If we look at some of the businesses we have invested in, they have a power generator constantly running onsite because if a tower goes down, the mobile signal disappears. Therefore, IHS Towers installed solar hybrid systems on all of them and has about 14,000 sites in Nigeria and about 22,000 in Africa.<br></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The company started operating in Africa in 2004 as the product of serendipity and keen interest by a few close friends and myself. Today, we are an investment banking boutique and do corporate finance and investments, mainly in energy. We have been active in Nigeria for the last seven years. We participated in the first Shell investment round in Nigeria in 2012 and never looked back. Nigeria is in many ways the land of milk and honey. As a private investor in oil and gas, many other countries and markets are difficult to enter for a multitude of reasons. Private energy investors have a few options when seeking decent risk and return scenarios, namely the North Sea (the Norwegian continental shelf and the British continental shelf), the US, Mexico, and Canada. When we compare Nigeria to these markets, the country truly shines, despite its problems. Currently, Nigeria is extremely important within our portfolio of operations; we are committing USD120 million into the country.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, we entered the government and enterprise space, whereas before we had been focused on the carrier space. We launched the first 4G LTE network in Nigeria with three major operators in 2016 and now operate almost 60% of the market in partnership with them. In the last few years, we have launched a number of products in the ICT domain. The first was the Business Enabling System (BES) system, which changed the telecoms business. Our BES projects provide real-time experience for clients. The younger generation wants things on demand, and we seek to provide this. We offer clients a fully online experience that is completely reshaped. This is the first project of its kind for Huawei overseas. We still lack some fundamental infrastructure in Nigeria, though in the next few years we will play a major role in upgrading the network for Nigerian subscribers. On the enterprise and government side, we are focused on security and want to help develop smart city solutions.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are catering to the middle market, which is where we want to position Ras Al Khaimah. Obviously, the airport is working very closely with us on achieving the right sort of connectivity to assist us with our growth targets. We have set a target of reaching one million visitors by YE2018-1Q2019. The airport signed a deal with Qatar Airways that initially connects us to 170 destinations, but still the key focus is Europe and Russia, as our key source markets are Germany, the UK, and Russia. Similarly, the latest deal the airport did with Air India helps us to develop the Indian market further. That has become our fourth-largest market with fantastic YoY growth of 50%. Russia had been our number-four market earlier in 2016, but as of September 2016 was number three with 4% YoY growth. Ras Al Khaimah also grew its German tourism market by 68%, even though the total number of outbound tourists from Germany only grew by 3%. This means we have managed to capture a higher share of the German market compared to other destinations. Most of those arrangements involved co-marketing, so we put up dollar for dollar to market Ras Al Khaimah as a destination.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Ras Al Khaimah continues to see strong growth in both the commercial and tourism sectors. Statistics reflect a huge air travel market existing in the four northern Emirates, and Ras Al Khaimah is leading this growth with the largest market share, at over 44%. In line with this growth, RAK Airport is experiencing increased activity, therefore we will invest in its infrastructure development including a new cargo terminal, passenger terminals, duty-free shopping, corporate aviation areas, and security facilities to meet our customers' needs. The expansion projects follow a 26% increase in aircraft movements of scheduled flights in 2015. Furthermore, cargo business at the airport grew 51% in 2015. As we move in to unprecedented growth, the challenges of providing secure and safe skies will be our highest priority. The aviation markets in the UAE and around the world are innovating constantly, and we are preparing ourselves to welcome operators who demand the very best in service, safety, and security. In conjunction with Air Arabia, we are establishing a regional market that has now gone on to international markets with the addition of Qatar Airways. This will promote other carriers to base their operations out of RAK Airport, as we offer convenient, cost-effective, and efficient solutions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Even though each Emirate is promoted separately by its tourism authority, as a whole we offer compelling reasons to visit to a diverse clientele. Each Emirate is beginning to position itself accordingly, and Ras Al Khaimah has done the same. The reason our visitors come here is because of the Emirate's natural beauty and its sense of authentic Arabia. We are a unique escape for residents of the UAE as well; close to 50% of our business comes from the neighboring Emirates. We serve as an ideal destination for short breaks and family escapes to residents within the UAE. However, other nationalities choose Ras Al Khaimah for different reasons, such as longer but peaceful vacations or adventure tourism. One of the ways we complement the other Emirates is through our cultural and heritage attractions, such as the village of Al Jazeerah Al Hamra, where archaeologists are doing incredible work.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>One of our outreach strategies is to facilitate virtual access to our museums' collections so that people who cannot physically visit our museums can still benefit from it. The other two strategies relate to physical and intellectual access. In this regard, SMD continuously seeks to extend its commitment to access and engagement with the virtual domain. SMD has been a major contributor to the largest virtual museum in the world, the Museum with No Frontiers. Over 100 objects from the SMD collections are featured in its database and its permanent virtual exhibitions dedicated to Islamic art and important historical topics such as its most recent, “Sharing History-The Arab World and Europe 1815-2015,“ an international intercultural collaboration to explore relations between the West and the Islamic World during a crucial time in world history. In addition, SMD consistently works to build bridges of cultural exchange and dialog with international organizations. We have an ongoing collaboration with the Berlin State Museums and also brought in the Goethe Institute as a third strategic partner. Together, we now organize the SAWA Museum Academy, a capacity-building program for current and future museum personnel in Arab countries, Germany, and the West. On a more general note, we look forward to an exciting and dynamic continuation of our ongoing temporary exhibitions and educational activities across our 16 museums and heritage sites.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our most important role is to communicate, opening and maintaining channels for dialog. It is better for individuals and entities to talk about their own positive and even negative image than for someone else to speak about it. We used to lack this dialog in Sharjah, but we are now taking the lead and sharing our experience with others. Our annual forum is one way of finding out what people are thinking. We get a lot of very high-profile speakers and people attending who have vast experience and knowledge that we can draw on and subsequently implement in Sharjah. We trust the people we bring to this event and benefit from their experience, and we implement their ideas under our remit. In 2017, our theme is about how to make society prosperous through inclusion. You cannot have a prosperous society unless you include everyone in its development; for example, you have to include women, children, the younger generations, and disabled people. This is what we have here. We have honed in on issues that relate to women, the disabled, young people, and children. We have had all these segments of society participating in the forum so we can listen to them and find solutions to communication issues.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Sharjah has become more prominent in its positioning, and investment in the Emirate has grown. Multinational hotels are opening up, which increases our profile on the global stage. Our events are becoming world famous; for example the Sharjah light Festival has been compared to Sydney's Vivid, the World Championship week has been streamed live globally, and our International Book Fair is now the third-biggest in the world. We now plan to expand the MICE market and see another 7,000 key events coming in over next three years. In environmental tourism, we achieved a lot through collaborative approach to deliver unique and exciting eco-tourism products. Furthermore, we have kept our top source markets and added to them. The GCC continues to dominate the list of Sharjah's source regions for the tourism sector, sending 450,388 visitors to the Emirate in 2016, which amounts to 25% of total visitors. Asian markets have continued to grow throughout 2016, constituting a 9% increase from the 370,528 Asian visitors who came to the Emirate in 2015. Europe sent 348,570 visitors to the Emirate, 20% of all visitors to Sharjah in 2016. Non-GCC Arab countries came in fourth as a source region for Sharjah's tourism sector, with 262,027 tourists visiting the Emirate in 2016, 15% of total visitors.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been committed to developing specialized, smart, and integrated cities. Our business ecosystem is designed to support ICT startups, SMEs, and large businesses in their growth, many of which have chosen DIC as the location for their regional headquarters. In line with the Dubai Strategy for Innovation, which seeks to encourage and promote innovation and creativity, DIC is committed to inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators. Over 60% of our partners are SMEs, which benefit enormously from our formal and informal networking and knowledge exchanges, including complementary seminars and workshops around a number of SME focused topics. Many of these sessions are co-hosted by IBM, Facebook, Microsoft, SAP and other partners, creating an environment for SME's to learn directly from market leaders. In regard to organizational support, through DIC's Business Centre, businesses of all sizes can set up and accesses a rich and diverse ecosystem of knowledge workers, nimble service providers, and expertise from all over the world. Additional benefits include a simplified incorporation process facilitated by axs, the smart gateway for government and corporate services provided by TECOM Group to its business communities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our role is to be a platform and catalyst for business, so we endeavor to do as much as we can for our clients. For example, for the aviation sector we invested in a VIP  terminal for all of the fixed-base operators because it is quite a big undertaking for them to build one independently. Now they have a common terminal to ease operations and add value to their operations. These entities now have their own maintenance, repair, and operations facilities as well as warehousing, paint shops, and more. This has helped generate a downstream industry in this particular sector. One of our current focuses is to look at the human side of our operations beyond our administrative role. In our residential district we focus on creating happy cities for people to live and work in this area. We have, in effect, become a developer, creating the infrastructure to ensure a high quality of life. Having a fully developed infrastructure allows us to moderate the cost of rents. The next step will be to bring in schools and hospitals, cost effectively, because we want to be competitive in terms of costs.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In line with TECOM Group's AED4.5-billion Innovation Strategy to accelerate new start-up development and foster entrepreneurship in the UAE, we are working on making innovation the fabric of the media industry through the in5 Innovation Centre for media and the YouTube Space in Dubai Studio City. In addition to several innovative initiatives that will be introduced throughout the year to continuously empower our young talent, in5 will strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem of the UAE media industry by supporting freelancers and entrepreneurs in acquiring the right skills through mentorship and providing them with the tools and right facilities. Furthermore, Dubai Studio City's recent partnership with YouTube to open the first YouTube Space in the MENA region will foster the region's most talented content creators and provide them with free access to high end audio, visual and editing equipment, in addition to training programs, workshops, and courses. Therefore, we are focusing on enabling talents to utilize innovation in generating content in line with consumer behavior and has changed dramatically due to the digital revolution.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The most important measure of any higher education institute is quality, and we achieve that through the accreditation process that we have in place for all of our programs. This is one of our first priorities as the youngest federal university, having been established in 1998. Zayed University has completed the process of international accreditation and recognition from US-based bodies for the majority of its academic programs. This process started in 2008 with the institutional accreditation by the Middle State Commission for Higher Education (MSCHE), one of the regional accreditation boards in the US. Then, the process of program-based accreditations started with our College of Business programs obtaining AACSB accreditation in 2012, while College of Education programs achieved NCATE accreditation the same year and was the first college to achieve that outside of the US. Thereafter, two of our College of IT programs completed the ABET accreditation in 2014; our College of Arts and Creative Enterprises obtained substantial equivalency from the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) in 2015; and the College of Communications obtained accreditation with ACEJMC, the accrediting body for colleges of communication and mass media in the US, in 2015.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The first phase of our campus expansion has opened. It is a student hub with student services office, library, and university leadership offices. The second phase is expected to open in 2017 with academic spaces, classrooms, faculty offices, gyms, and recreational campus facilities. In terms of student intake, we were astonished by the number of students that applied for the new academic year as well as the rate at which our admissions offers were accepted. This most recent intake thus became the largest in the history of the university with more than 600 new students. We will also open our College of Science and Center for Teaching and Learning in 2017 with interesting chemistry and science programs. This growth has forced us to grow our services and reflects how reputable the university has become since we are outperforming our peers, some of whom have struggled with the economic downturn.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In consultation with key stakeholders, ACTVET has built a flexible, responsive, and quality-assured, industry-led national vocational education and training system. In recognition of our progress, ACTVET became the official awarding body for the UAE in 2014, not including Dubai, in order to provide students with high-quality learning opportunities and the skills required to meet labor market demands. Our achievements are directly linked to UAE Vision 2021 and Abu Dhabi Plan. The number of TVET institutions has increased and hence the student numbers. ACTVET has developed qualifications aligned with labor market requirements, and has increased the number of licensed training providers. In addition, the cost per student has dropped dramatically reflecting efficiency in operation. Vocational certificates have been issued in alignment with the target of creating a diversified knowledge-based economy.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The changes in ADNOC's administration and the new vision of the Abu Dhabi government have made it clear that the country wants to rise to a different level. They have embarked upon a journey that will become the new benchmark for NOCs, where capability, technology, efficiency, and selectivity will become vital when it comes to building partnerships. The new mindset in ADNOC is to re-energize the entire industry and everyone is enthusiastic about keeping up in this fast-paced environment. For BP, this has made it easier to see how we can support ADNOC with our world-class technology and expertise, as well as contribute to Abu Dhabi's vision of a sustainable and highly profitable oil industry. We have been in the country from day one and have never wavered in our commitment. We are delighted with the ADCO deal that we recently signed—a 40-year concession with ADNOC that brings our partnership to a whole new level—through which we are building a new framework for partnerships between IOCs and NOCs that will transform the industry in the region.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Even though we were not the first IOC to sign a partnership contract with a national UAE company, we were the first at this specific time, which caught the attention of other multinationals. The oil and gas industry is going through a rough patch, and decisions take much longer to be made. However, Abu Dhabi is a pivotal market for us, and we wanted to show that regardless of the circumstances we are here to stay through thick and thin. Moreover, ADCO's estimations project that daily production will go from 1.6 million bpd to 2 million bpd, which is totally feasible and will further strengthen our position. The change in management of ADNOC has fundamentally changed the company's approach toward the industry. These changes range from its decision-making processes to the way its investments are carried out. My projection is that we will see more alignments between NOCs and IOCs and this will ease the path for both of us to work together.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>2016 has been a wait-and-see-year for us in terms of concessions. Overall, the year was about restructuring in the oil and gas industry, and the recent appointments to ADNOC's leadership completely transformed the company's strategies, leading to an impressive series of changes that will spur growth in ADNOC. For Statoil, 2016 was about continuing with our ambitions for the UAE: adding value to Abu Dhabi and its oil production capacities. We continued to strengthen our partnership with Masdar, with which we have jointly developed a green wind partnership in the UK. We have also been working with The Petroleum Institute by helping to develop a new laboratory for R&amp;D and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). We fully support ADNOC's prudent target of 70% EOR, which will be highly beneficial in the long run. One of the areas where Statoil can add value to Abu Dhabi is through this objective for increased oil recovery, since we have some of the highest recovery rates in the world.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In spite of the recent downturn in the oil and gas sector, Wintershall has remained positive, adjusting its strategy to remain efficient even during a period of volatility and tailoring its investment policy to achieve its strategic targets. For example, in November 2016 we launched the Shuwaihat project, a sour gas and condensate field that we want to develop into commercial production. After drilling one well and getting encouraging results, we are planning to continue, gathering enough data about the reservoir in order to go into development planning. As a way of cutting costs and improving efficiency, we decided not to use the normal logistics track for offshore drilling; instead, we signed a contract with Abu Dhabi Ports in 2016 to allow us to build a supply base at a small port in the area. This saves us USD10 million per well, about 10% of the total project cost. We hope to be able to deliver gas to Abu Dhabi through the Shuwaihat project by 2022.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>INPEX/JODCO has been engaged in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil in Abu Dhabi in partnership with ADNOC for over 40 years. In April 2015, we acquired a 5% participation interest in the ADCO Onshore Concession, which further strengthened our ties with Abu Dhabi and ADNOC. We also have been contributing to Abu Dhabi's social infrastructure, including human resources development, education, and environmental protection. Over the 40-plus years we have operated here, we have made considerable technical contributions to the country and industry. Most recently, we announced our agreement in principle with ADNOC on the extension of the joint development of the Satah and Umm Al Dalkh offshore oil fields. Both oil fields have abundant reserves and have stably produced oil for many years based on a strong partnership between ADNOC and INPEX/JODCO. Moving forward, INPEX/JODCO will continue striving to strengthen its oil development and production activities in Abu Dhabi, as well as helping to further develop the strong relations between Abu Dhabi and Japan.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The UAE remains our major hub. In the UAE, there are different sectors such as oil field support, Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS), and transporting nationals to the different islands around the mainland through fixed wing aircraft, remain our largest chunk of services as a company. On the other side, we also have done a series of international contracts that have gone from leasing aircraft in India and lending our services to the oil industry in Brazil during an oil boom to firefighting services in Spain. We also run HEMS in Saudi Arabia, where we were well positioned due to the promptness and efficacy of our services. We also do a great deal of maintenance for other parts of the world. Our secret is that we are a diverse company in terms of services, so we are able to evolve, grow, and retract depending on the market. This opens the door for a better position among the local competition.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>At Abu Dhabi International Airport, we are constantly becoming smarter. High-tech integration and connectivity plays an important role in our development strategy, and the MTB will have the latest technology in every system that is installed, exceeding global standards. This will provide passengers with an unrivaled airport experience, and airport operations and management teams will have an integrated infrastructure platform that will streamline processes to make the airport run as efficiently as possible. We recognize the need for smart solutions that can be implemented parallel to the construction of our new terminal to improve capacity. From passenger processing solutions to aircraft and airport management systems, we have implemented modern technologies across the airport with the aim of dramatically improving efficiency, increasing the functionality and uniqueness of the airport, and providing passengers with a smoother travel experience. In March 2017, we launched the Smart Travel system, which allows passengers traveling through the airport to complete all their travel processes, from check-in to aircraft boarding, interacting only with technology.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed, Chairman of Emirates, said, “One third of the world's population, nearly 2 billion people, live within a four-hour flight from Dubai International, and 80% within 12 hours.“ This is a natural geographic advantage of the UAE. The country's leadership has an ambitious vision to diversify the economy, and the aviation industry is central to any such effort, whether through trade or tourism. Additionally, industry growth is dependent on the quality of infrastructure. The UAE is recognized as having the best road transport infrastructure globally and the second-best air transport infrastructure. Our open skies policy is yet another catalyst to enhance connectivity and sustainable growth. Together with stakeholders like national airlines, airports, and academic institutions, we are working on stimulating innovation and creativity that we are certain will yield long-term, sustainable results. Historically, growth in the UAE has been mostly focused on building capacity in airports and airlines. Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah have made huge investments in upgrading the runways and terminals at their respective airports.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The construction sector is the leading sector and the other sectors follow. Right now the construction sector is struggling because of a delay in payments and it is like a chain reaction affecting other sectors. If contracts slow down or stop, then they are not able to make payments to suppliers and subcontractors and this affects the entire country and prevents development. The only way to keep the sector alive is to attract private investors to open alternative sectors like tourism, where there are many opportunities. It is also a case of finance as the tourism sector can find financing but not the construction sector, and as they are linked then we cannot achieve the goals for growth. Oman has introduced certain rules and regulations that make it easier for investment, protect investors' rights, and provide benefits.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Tanfeedh is encouraging and should help strengthen the economy and investment climate.  We are keen on it being fully implemented, as it promises great results. As for the overall economy, there is a slowdown in economic growth compared to the previous years. The construction sector in general has followed a similar trajectory. The government and related entities are by far the biggest client drivers of construction activity in Oman. However, over the past couple of years we have seen more activity being generated by the private sector toward the development of the economy. A lot of this activity revolves around touristic, educational, and ITC housing developments. In addition, there is growth in retail projects from the private sector as well as governmental pension funds. Our company's main focus is industrial projects related to water, wastewater, oil and gas, and general civil works. In the last year, we focused on infrastructure. Our portfolio is dynamic and changes from year to year in conjunction with the project intake.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We see great growth in the services sector. Projects in hospitality, healthcare, retail, and logistics are in high demand. Many private hospital projects are coming up. We have recently completed Burjeel Hospital in Al Khuwair and are currently working on another hospital design. The retail sector is also doing well. In this sector, the local investor constructs a building as per the end users requirement and leases it out for 25-30 years. We have done two such projects whereby we helped the end user connect with the local investor. Because of Oman's focus on tourism, the hospitality sector is booming. There is high demand for hotels in the country, and as we speak, there are quite a few four- and five-star hotels under construction.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>According to the World Bank, the construction industry will always have a future. There is a great potential in Oman for development in many sectors. I am confident that, although at present there is saturation in the real estate market, within a couple of years Oman will bounce back. Although the oil sector seems to be stagnant in development, there is great hope in the mining industry. It is evident that Oman is seriously looking into diversification and self-sustainability where possible. This means that there is room for optimization in infrastructure. Additionally, Oman has started focusing on food safety. This gives Milcris an opportunity to work on more projects in the future, where we will  be an asset to clients, providing our cost consultancy services. Currently, we are working on over 30 other projects and have employed 70 professionals to execute them.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Oil and gas is not the only sector we are serving. We are also serving, for example, mineral exports. Sometimes it is forgotten that the port is not yet finished; there is still another two and a half years of construction to go. However, it is functional. Therefore, today we can cater to any type of cargo through what are called multipurpose terminals instead of dedicated terminals. Nevertheless, our efficiency is not at its full potential. When in the next two to three years we are fully finished with dedicated terminals, this will definitely increase our efficiency. From that moment onward, we will be able to position ourselves in the global market. This port is massive and will take many years to build. However, in the next two years we will deliver a fully up and running mineral terminal, a container terminal with a capacity of 2.5 million containers a year, a RORO terminal, a liquid terminal, and a break bulk terminal. With these five we can cover the entire industry.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>By focusing on two factors, namely service reliability, through punctual schedules of trips, and service quality, through better services, seating, space, and facilities for passengers, we saw increases in both passenger and vehicle transport. In terms of passengers, our growth was 9%, and for vehicle transport it was 14%. This mainly came from one of our busiest line operations, the Shannah-Masirah route. We operate two ferries on this line and transported around 168,000 passengers in 2016. Our overall movement is dependent on the season, especially for the Muscat-Khasab route. Khasab, up north in the Musandam Peninsula, is directly linked with Muscat. Dibba and Lima are serviced by scheduled service linking Shinas and Khasab. Efforts began in 2008 to connect far-flung areas with the mainland. These areas are beyond the borders and to reach them travelers have to pass two to three border points by road. This is where our ferry provides a unique service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The shipyard is relatively new compared to its competitors in the Gulf. In the first years, the major strategy was to set up a shipyard and incumbent services in order to accommodate, repair, and maintain ships. We have now reached a point where we want to move on to the next step, which is also the plan of the Asyad Group. With the appointment of a new CEO, it has become the main hub for ship repair and the conversion of commercial and navy vessels, as well as the offshore industry and industrial steel construction, not only in Oman but the entire Middle East. We are now playing in a lower league and it is great; we do ship repairs, basic work, and ship conversions, and our docks are occupied. In order to maintain a certain top line and generate financial volume, we need to move into other business areas that will allow us to play a major role in the champions league of globally recognized ship repair yards.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of exciting new developments in the port this year. Sohar Port South is our new land reclamation area and will create sufficient space to attract more businesses to guarantee us additional solid growth in the years ahead. Orpic's new USD6 billion plastics project in the port is on track to open by 2019. It will create 1.4 million tons of PE, PET, and PP annually for a wide variety of uses, including food-grade packaging. This will put Oman on the world map as a major plastics producer and will attract many downstream industries to both the port and free zone. There is a lot of interest in our new food zone, as today over three-quarters of the GCC's food is imported. It's a market that will continue to grow in the coming years, boosted by one of the world's youngest and fastest-growing populations, not to mention phenomenal growth in regional tourism, which is expected to top 83 million annual visitors by 2026.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The traditional property development model does not work anymore because of declining demand. At the same time, supply is going up because all the projects coming online now were started a few years ago, when oil prices were much higher and the economy was doing well. Supply is increasing and demand is falling, and there is therefore a great amount of pressure on the sector. However, there are pockets of opportunity. For example, integrated tourism complx (ITC) projects are doing well, as are hotels. We expect around 6,000 rooms to be added in the next three to four years. At the moment, most of the action in Oman is in Muscat. Salalah is growing as well because tourism has led to an increase in the number of hotels, while the international airport at Salalah has come online. We can expect good growth in Duqm and Sohar, which are becoming large industrial and logistics hubs.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The company established the middle-income segment as its main target, and we are building villas. We have to keep the economic situation in mind because there is hesitation among people and banks have become selective in offering loans. There is a good chance, once the villa is ready and people see it, that it will make a big difference. We are not in a hurry, and we can wait until the local villas are ready. Then I think things will start to change. We are receiving inquiries everyday, but it is hard to close a deal without clients seeing the villa first. Everything is open to all GCC citizens. There is no struggle and a lot does not need to be done from the client side. I would love to see every Omani owning a house. I would like to see communities and small cities with integrated homes and services for everyone. We are working hard to achieve this.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The young and expanding demographics of the country are such that there is enormous latent demand within most sectors of the real estate market. It is most obvious within the residential sector. As young Omanis grow up and look to enter the workforce, the more the workforce needs to expand to absorb them. There is a natural expansion of the economy that will happen. With those demographics, there is this underlying driver within the economy, where demand will continue to increase as the population ages. From a real estate perspective, the trick therefore is finding the right properties—the right supply—to match that demand. Over the long term, there is certainly scope to develop higher-end ITC products; however, this will only be achieved over a significant period of time. And crucially, not all developments will succeed if they follow the same path that the current ITC schemes have trodden.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Based on the income of Omanis, luxury housing is not moving quickly. Most young employees and newlyweds are looking to start a new life in a new home, and they are the most targeted sector. We have concentrated on affordable housing since 2008. Now, we are doing very well in affordability, and we are releasing a new project in a central area in Boshar. Compared to other housing options in that location, we are still considered affordable in a luxury area. Affordability is often misunderstood. Sometimes they think that affordability means poor quality and bad location. But, for example, in this project, we have a central location in a luxurious area; however, we maintain affordability by controlling size. We keep it simple with normal-sized rooms to reduce the cost, and the selling point is to keep it affordable by being smart in the design of the villa itself. This is how we ensure we can provide an affordable villa.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There is a thirst for digitization to further condense the huge amounts of information now available into manageable chunks. We know that life and the digital economy are driven by smartphones, which we all own. Ooredoo's brand focus is all about internet experience leadership and having great connectivity at the heart of the digital economy. It is about moving into the self-care and app-driven world. After all, business is increasingly conducted through an app. It depends what country you are in now, but whether it is Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, or Ebay, everything can be driven through a smartphone. This is what is driving our strategy and satisfying this demand for ever-increasing amounts of data and making sure the experience is something unique. It is about having a great network, great coverage, and great speed, particularly for video. It is also about providing affordable data plans for the internet for as long as possible.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Oman has an excellent tool with MVNOs today, and Omantel can use these to compete with a third operator. Renna Mobile can try to protect its low-end segment of the market from the third operator while Omantel competes with Ooredoo and the third operator in the corporate, post-paid, and high-end segments. Ooredoo will be more affected by a third operator because it will have to compete across every segment. Oman is a tough country in terms of coverage, so a new operator will not be able to cover Oman from day one. High-end customers will want to stay with Omantel because it has good coverage, and they want that reliability, while Renna Mobile will continue to dominate at the lower end. Whereas in the past we were growing, we now want to maintain our position and optimize as much as possible. We have a strategic relationship with our partner Omantel with whom we will work against a third operator.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our purchase of Renna Mobile was always a means to an end to position ourselves as a key participant in Oman's incoming third operator. We have now accomplished this after TeO's acquisition of a significant stake in our preferred 3rd Mobile Network Operator (3MNO) Consortium. In the meantime, we have been speaking to every significant stakeholder to prepare TeO and its affiliates for the introduction of any 3MNO, whether we win it or otherwise. Our collective experience and capabilities in mobile, OTT, and international wholesale telecoms in coordination with selected partners will still enable us to present strong alternatives in the market. Our consortium has the right mix of private and government entities and the right mindset and prior experience to make 3MNO a success. We have also submitted a bid document that carefully lays out our long-term plans for Oman, with particular focus on service coverage, quality, and customer service. I am cautiously optimistic.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In order for the country to achieve our vision for 2020, Oman needs to undergo a digital transformation, and Awasr intends to be at the forefront of that. We have agreed upon a partnership with the international solutions company SAP to deliver the HANA Enterprise Cloud, which will serve companies of all sizes in different sectors, especially SMEs with fully fledged software solutions, customized for their every need. From managing a small boutique operation to running a large shipping port, HANA will deliver the right systems to improve operational efficiency and drive productivity. SAP is also helping us develop and put in place predictive technology for infrastructure in order to maximize productivity and response-effectiveness. With HANA, we are capable of helping the government create a digital cabinet and start modernizing Oman's infrastructure and services such as water distribution systems, traffic lights, fire prevention, and to help predict problems before they happen by leveraging business intelligence provided by SAP.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Recent developments have been dynamic, challenging, and good for business. The telecom sector is always going to be in the loop: 3G was launched, 4G was launched, and we are closer to the next generation. Operators are already looking at positive revenues from data contracts, and mobile penetration is nearing 150% in Oman, unlike the early days of telephony, when a family shared a single fixed line. What is more, operators' volumes and revenues have increased because of data; with this revenue they are spending more and expanding more. Access has good business volumes from operators and vendors, and there are some new tenders in the process of finalization. The next quarter seems to be good for us. We also welcome the third operator, as it will bring new business for us. Subscribers are going to have more options, prices will get more aggressive, and services will improve as each operator tries to increase it.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Due to current oil prices, we are always aware of the general macro-economic factors and what is happening across the Middle East. It would not be right to say that manufacturing is not impacted by those factors, and although we are slightly affected, I would still put my money on Oman and encourage companies to establish manufacturing units in the country. There are a couple of reasons for this; firstly its geographical location, secondly its political stability; and finally the cost, especially the power costs. If you look at catering to the fastest-growing economies in Africa, there is no better place than Oman to start a manufacturing unit. In order to make the manufacturing segment more competitive, there is an ongoing discussion. There should be some incentives for companies that are exporting, like in India for example, where export-focused companies benefit from exemptions and inducements. Exporting companies are bringing dollars into the country, which is beneficial for the country's GDP. In Oman, even small incentives would encourage businesses to come to Oman.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Al Sarh group is one of the leading diversified firms in Oman. The group has developed successful enterprises in a number of strategically important sectors and integrated them to create a high-quality end result. The group satisfies the needs of consumers in the construction, development, and manufacturing sectors. In the former, Al Sarh Omani International is a strong player in construction services, offering an array of services from small renovations to multi-billion dollar projects using a variety of delivery methods. We also have Middle East Steel Products, serving as a provider of 42 types of the best quality steel with reasonable prices. In the development sector, Resolution Engineering Consultants provides culturally harmonious and contemporary architecture while considering the needs of sustainable development. Meanwhile, Muscat Ornamental is one of the leading specialist interior decoration firms in the Sultanate, with several years of experience and a diverse selection of decorative finishes. In the manufacturing sector we have Oman Dairy Products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Reem Batteries started off based on two strategies. The first was an export orientation, because Oman is a small market. The second was a technological strategy to create internal technical capabilities instead of depending on external sources. Even though we started in technical collaboration with Johnson Controls, we then became independent and created our own highly qualified team to do continuous R&amp;D and were one of the first companies in Oman to do so. In automobiles, batteries are the most non-standardized component. Toyota Corollas manufactured in Japan, Europe, and the US all have different battery specifications, following national rather than international standards. Because of the differences in these, they become separate products, and so the product range is vast in the battery industry. European battery manufacturers mostly cater to European standards, Japanese, Koreans, and Americans to theirs. However, a battery manufacturing company from our part of the world has to be able to cater to all kinds of models and standards.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Muna Noor is primarily a manufacturer of pipes. On our manufacturing side, we produce polyethylene pipe, PVC pipe, and polypropylene pipe for all purposes. Our pipes are used for everything from telecoms ducts to water transportation. We do major infrastructure projects that other firms cannot handle and do a lot of work on water mains, sewage mains, and more. We also do large-scale desalination jobs, including bringing water into the desalination plant via large polyethylene intakes and pumping the brine back out to sea via outfall pipes. When desalination first started, they used to use short outfalls, but they discovered that the brine was so concentrated that it was killing the sea life close to shore. However, now is not a great time for us in Oman, because infrastructure spending has essentially stopped. Even the government is struggling with how to work best with industry to tackle this crisis. The private sector has to find new ways to work while we are in this crisis, and that is taxing everyone.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We have a range of products, and in the detergent powder segment we have more than a 35% market share in Oman. We already diversified two or three years ago when we decided to get into specialty industrial chemicals. We recently put up a plant that came on-stream in 2016, but have entered this new sector at a difficult period, with the oil market under a great deal of price pressure and investments slowing down. However, we know this move is part of our long-term plans, and the market will improve at some point. Naturally, we are preparing ourselves for that upturn; however, being a new player we have our fair share of issues and problems. Industrial specialty chemicals are a good industry to be in for the future. On the employment side, we have always supported the government's wish to hire more locals. Certain positions require certain expertise, such as sales and marketing, or fluency in English, so we organize external training to get them these skills.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We were the first independent power producer (IPP) in the Middle East. We started out with a small plant compared to some of the larger ones we now have. We commenced Phase I of operations in 1996, a 20-year concession that ended in September 2016. Phase II started in 2000, which when finished will have its assets handed over to the government in April 2020. There is an option in the Power Purchase Agreement to terminate the agreement earlier as well with the consent of UPC. The plant has a useful life beyond 2020 whose assets would be realistic for the government to resell to any new bidder under the public tendering process. Demand for power is continuously growing, and the government is keenly looking at increasing generating capacity of the country. I expect renewable energy to be the new frontier not only in Oman but also in Middle East. Although the cost of renewables is still high compared to oil and gas, the willingness to look at environmentally-friendly sources will be seen favorably by the government. The cost of renewables is coming down gradually, and in a couple of years it may be viable to shift. Until then, traditional gas-generated plants will still be at the forefront.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We felt that it was important not to feel limited by the current services we provide. We need to expand in terms of the product and move into new concession areas. Cooling water is one product of Majis, but we have four more products: potable water, process water, effluent treatment systems, and irrigation water. We are now looking to see if there is need for other water products inside the concession areas we are in at the moment. For the time being, no one is approaching us with a request for products other than what we have already identified a need for. Wastewater from domestic waste or sewage systems and industrial effluent is collected and treated by us. Out of that water we can create irrigation water and process water, which is sent back to the industry. Currently, we receive around 10,000cbm per day of water to treat and process. From that, we can produce about 7,000cbm of processed water. Some of that goes on to become irrigation water and 20% goes to the sea as brine. We also take a keen interest in the industrial sector. Although it is not yet in our concession area, we want to start serving that sector with water solutions, such as potable process water and management.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The company is currently engaged in meter readings, billing, collection, disconnection and reconnection, and customer service in the Muscat, Batinah, and Dhahirah governorates. OIFC is the pioneer in this field in its service to customers and principals. OIFC's business scope addresses two areas of service. The first relates to corporate contractual agreements with the Omani government, such as the Public Authority of Electricity and the water and electricity sectors, where OIFC is currently providing meter reading and billing operations services for electricity and water and telecom service providers for whom OIFC prints and mails telecom bills and collection services.  This enables OIFC to manage customers' utility accounts, including printing and mailing their bills and collection services for all the customers (individuals and corporate entities) and pay their utility bills in one place. These services are offered to all general public and corporate entities via multiple channels of customer interaction platforms, including OIFC's network of 43 branches located throughout all the governorates of Oman and in every major city and town. OIFC has also established 37 bill payment machines installed in prime locations for facilitating their customer's convenience of services around the clock.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In our region, most crude oil produced is sold specifically to end-users. While the trading of oil is usually prohibited, Omani crude oil has always been freely traded. The latter has positioned Omani crude as a marker crude in the region and initiated interest by all players in the market (from traders to end-users).  Simultaneously Oman was considering the creation of a more active marketing and trading vehicle to capitalize on the trading value chain from production to consumption. There was overwhelming consensus, driven mainly by the Minister of Oil and Gas, Dr. Mohammed bin Hamad Al Rumhi, that a more active unit should be created to capture any value beyond the typical FOB sale. OTI was created in January 2006 with the mandate to add value to Omani-exported energy products and thereafter expand globally and trade third party barrels. From humble beginnings trading Omani produced products, OTI expanded its footprint to include global products, and nearly 50% of its products are now sourced from outside Oman.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>ONEIC was established in 1978 with the chief goal of supporting the electricity sector by providing meter readers, bill issuance, and collection. The company's success story began when it decided to diversify. Instead of focusing on billing, the company created new business lines such as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC), operations and maintenance (O&amp;M), and marketing. This allowed ONEIC to have a successful and sustainable business for 40 years; we currently have 4,200 employees and one of the highest Omanization rates, some 48%, within our line of work. The future is even more challenging with advancements such as the use of technology in meter readings and non-traditional sources of payment through apps, but we are coping with these challenges and creating new business lines to better face the future. We certainly compete with other billing companies, which is extremely healthy for the country. One of these, OIFC, has a great deal of experience in technology, and we are trying to compete in its area.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Oman is almost completely oil-dependent, and prices affect everyone, from oil companies all the way down to food and beverage establishments. Tanfeedh aims for diversification, though it will not happen overnight. The current situation of the market, however, is positive for Genesis in terms of business, considering that part of our job is to provide customers with information as to where and how to dig to extract more oil. We entered the market at the right time, even though the process has been challenging. We are newcomers competing with the American company Weatherford for market share, and we have had to prove ourselves. In the last 18 months, we have been in contact with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) for a trial job. It wants us to demonstrate our knowledge and expertise before it commits on a more long-term basis. Things are slow, though we are moving forward, and drilling operations have increased in the past few months.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The playing field here has certainly changed, and we are seeing companies beginning to realize that a USD50-60 barrel is here to stay. The government's Tanfeedh program is also focusing on doing something about it and, to a certain extent, the oil crisis has created opportunities for us to seriously look at our expenditures and other sources of revenue. It has created new impetuses for government and businesses alike. For sure, most businesses have been hit hard, but the drilling and exploration sectors have been hit the hardest. Luckily, the government has been prudent about maintaining certain production levels, but in the long term it needs to continue to grow. Therefore, at least the drilling rig numbers have not gone down drastically like we have seen happen in the US and elsewhere. The Ministry of Oil and Gas has been very clear that we need to find more oil reserves; to do so, we need to drill.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The Joint Supplier Registration System (JSRS) of Oman went live in 2014.  This is an ICV (In-Country Value) initiative of Oman's Ministry of Oil and Gas. The JSRS addresses the core needs of both the suppliers and O&amp;G operators, which was to have a single pool of credibly verified and updated suppliers that operators could commonly use for their day-to-day procurement. The JSRS is meant to form a consolidated national level procurement system to be governed by the Ministry of Oil and Gas, and Business Gateways was appointed to develop and implement this system on behalf of the stakeholders governing O&amp;G activities in Oman. We not only developed the registration system, but also created a detailed validation mechanism before awarding the JSRS certificate to the company to make sure that only the right companies come on board and tap into the system. We currently have over 5,800+ suppliers on the platform, around 4,200+ of which are Omani companies while the rest are from 80-odd countries.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Everyone knows the current situation is tough because of low oil prices, and Daleel Petroleum faces these same issues. Because of this, our current strategy focuses on optimizing and fine-tuning our operations because we cannot stop moving forward; we have to ensure every cent we spend is efficient and effective. This situation is a challenge, but at the same time presents us with opportunities to review our business plan and further optimize our operations to determine the most effective way forward for the business. All our projects must be reviewed and optimized. The “easy oil“ in Daleel has fewer prospects, and we are now facing the challenge of extracting marginal oil in a cost-effective way. Some small trials to exploit marginal oil reserves are ongoing and expected to add more value to Daleel's portfolio if successful and cost-effective. As a prudent operator in Oman, we are not slowing down our exploration and drilling activities because we have to be ready for the future.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have been in Oman for 34 years and have operations in various locations across the country. In terms of production levels, we have grown considerably from the 1980s, when we started Block 9, which has boosted our growth enormously. Block 53 has also been paramount to our growth; it produced around 8,000bpd when it first started operating and in just a few years has produced 15 times that amount. It is currently the largest producing field in the country. That is the block where we generate steam as well as operate a water treatment plant that is among the largest mechanical vapor compression plants in the world. Our gross production across all blocks in 2016 was around 250,000bpd, while our company's share amounts to 96,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day. What's more, we signed an agreement for Block 62 several years ago and have carried out extensive exploration activity there. It has a challenging geology and a remote location in terms of proximity to infrastructure, but we are making good progress all the same.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The two challenges we faced in 2017 were to bring the Khazzan project on stream safely and maintain our estimated cost for the project; I am pleased to say we did both. Not only were we able to deliver the project a few months ahead of time, but we also completed under the expected budget. The total capacity of the Khazzan project is one billion cubic feet of gas per day. We are gradually ramping up and increasing production to the planned capacity sometime in 2018. Besides Khazzan, Ghazeer is also coming up. We have other projects that parts of BP are considering, such as a downstream project based in Duqm in conjunction with the Oman Oil Company (OOC) and come on stream in 2023 or 2024. We are also active in petrochemical licensing; we have a technology licensing agreement with Oman International Petrochemical Industries Company (OMPET), where we will provide technology for a project in Sohar. It is proprietary technology, and we will be involved in training the OMPET staff to support commissioning, ensuring we continue to share BP's knowledge and expertise.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>PASI is a social insurance organization established in 1992 as a part of a government initiative to diversify the economy and encourage the Omani youth to work in the private sector. We currently cover around 231,000 Omanis working in the private as well as informal sector, which includes self-employed individuals and Omanis working abroad. We started the extension of coverage geographically, meaning that we initially began in Oman and then moved abroad. The extension was also vertical in the sense that we kept adding social risks to cover. We started with old age and disabilities back in 1992, but a few years later we established a second scheme, which involves occupational diseases and work injuries. The last phase includes self-employed individuals. Since we're facing the biggest youth bulge in our history, the country faces a challenge in creating jobs for this generation. This is one reason why the government wants to push younger generations toward entrepreneurship and setting up SMEs.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>At the macro level, we split our own horizon between personal lines, projects, and corporate insurance solutions. Since 2012, the Omani insurance market has grown at around 6.8% CAGR, and in the same period Vision Insurance has grown by around 12.5%, so we are growing faster than the market. This was achieved through Vision's differentiation from competitors and will be sustained. In any insurance company, the suite of products and services is similar; everybody talks about the same thing. However, Vision tries to differentiate itself in the way it packages those solutions and projects its competence to customer solutions for specific needs. This has translated into Vision creating its own capacities for certain segments, giving the company an edge over competitors.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>This is a market we have been in for over 50 years, so its importance cannot be understated. We have been consistently profitable, work closely with regulators, and have seen every risk in Oman that one can see. We have played an important role in the country's progress and have every intention to continue to do so whilst growing a franchise in the Middle East and Oman. Capital requirements are increasing, and one can foresee greater sophistication in terms of future solvency regimes being considered by regulators. For insurers, there are undoubtedly opportunities to increase pricing adequacy and techniques, along with the space for a more active risk management approach to operate as a partnership between risk carriers and clients seeking to manage costs and protect their businesses.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have the highest growth rate of any insurance company in Oman. Our shareholder, Ominvest, is strong and with its capital we have been able to reach our growth goals organically without resorting to mergers. Recently, we acquired a Third-Party Administrator in UAE, which is a strategic investment that will benefit the company in the long term with our own claims processing capability for better customer service and improve profitability by having more control on claims management. There might be acquisitions in the future, but for now the company is well capitalized and growing. That being said, it is not only a matter of capitalization; our growth comes from innovation, not only in technology but also in our portfolio, as we are constantly introducing new products. We have a firm understanding of the market and know what our customers and the industry want. We also aim for a perfect balance in pricing that does not overcharge but allows us to remain profitable.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The regulations for Islamic banking came into effect in 2013, when Oman was virtually a new market for Islamic banking. Since then, two entirely Islamic banks have been created and six local banks have opened Islamic windows. It has grown quickly and accounts for 10% of the banking business as a whole in the country. While we find customers willing to borrow Islamically, there is less tendency to deposit Islamically. That is because the “profit rates“ are estimated, which is a constraint for some of the institutional depositors; they prefer to be 100% sure about what their deposited funds will generate. Consequently, the liquidity situation is currently quite competitive in the Islamic banking segment and this is something that we all have to collectively work on. However our experience has been positive, with our Islamic banking division contributing circa 25% of our bottom line last year. Our plans for 2018 will be business as usual. Our track record of double-digit growth in recent years might be tempered slightly; however, we will continue to invest in people, products, and delivery channels. Hopefully, some of the liquidity measures will feed through and support continued economic growth and diversification within Oman.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important goals when we were setting up operations was to ensure healthy growth and sustainability in Oman's banking sector. We have accomplished this by transforming ourselves into a financial institution that provides dynamic products and services to our customers. Over the years, Bank Sohar has stood out from the competition because we have adopted a unique approach to banking that combines excellence and innovation with stellar service, product diversity, speed, and technological competence. A decade on, we have experienced exponential growth, whereas no other fledgling bank in the past had survived in a fiercely competitive market without joining forces with another institution. For 2018 we continue to stay focused on our core strength in corporate banking and endeavor to increase our reach in retail banking. We would like to continue our investment in technology so as to improve customer experience and convenience. We will continue to provide our customers in corporate and retail banking the best-in-class products and services. There are also many opportunities in Islamic banking, of which the market has barely scratched the surface.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>BankDhofar's main strategy is to focus on customer experience. By providing the best banking experience, we will be able to build a growing loyal customer base. It will foster our business as well as ensure a great reputation in the market. With the aim of simplifying processes and speeding up processing time, we are working on the lean operating model for the organization. All these factors contribute to building an excellent customer experience. Additionally, we have been working on strengthening our brand presence, following a comprehensive study of the bank over five years, aiming to be the leading brand in Oman. As a result, BankDhofar's brand is well recognized and spread all across Oman, including airports, which are Oman's gateway to the world. On the other hand, stemming from our belief that our employees are ambassadors of our brand, BankDhofar has developed programs and projects that fall within the transformation journey “Together 2020.“ The bank continued to innovate staff learning and development programs across all business functions. Individual and team performance and contributions have resulted in achieving consistent overall performance that has been recognized locally, regionally, and internationally, winning a number of prestigious awards.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In retail the biggest demand is for money—there is rising demand for additional personal debt. We have chosen to not play in the “mass“ space. We do not believe it is sensible when the economy is feeling the input of lower oil prices and people's jobs are at risk to be loaning them money for 10 years. If our premier clients are interested in borrowing, then we are interested in discussing their needs with them. Credit cards are another focus as is wealth management. The retail banking sector is not that sophisticated but what is interesting in retail is that technology is driving a lot of the products here. We have seen a significant fall in volumes across our own branch counters in the past few years, even though our customer numbers are flat. Customers are just using the branches less. We are looking to redefine what a branch is used for and make our branches more welcoming and retail-like. On the wholesale side, the biggest issue at the moment is liquidity. Some companies are experiencing payment delays for the work that has been done. Customers need liquidity and to manage their cash flows better, for which we can offer a fantastic cash management program for them. It has been voted the top cash management platform in the country for each of the last five years.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We came to Oman as a fully fledged Islamic bank since our strategy was based largely on the fact that Islamic banking was well developed in the region. We developed our niche by being the most sharia-compliant bank and built our brand and portfolio based on this strength. Our sharia board members are all well-known and highly respected names in the business. After we established ourselves as the first sharia-compliant bank, we decided to bring this option to the masses and have been expanding ever since. This is a core strategy that has allowed us to position ourselves effectively. We also approached the government in an effort to work with it because the government of Oman plays a vital role in the economy. We also directed our attention to pension funds as well as corporate clients. We work with local SMEs and try to provide sharia-compliant products for all business people in the country. Additionally, we tried to work as quickly as possible in terms of digitizing channels and interfaces for interacting with our bank. We were able to implement mobile and internet banking early on, allowing us to effectively compete with more traditional banks, adding substantial value to our position.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our involvement in green and renewable energy started in 2008, and we were one of the first institutions to publish a study that essentially mapped the overall potential for renewable energy in Oman. We used it to kick start larger initiatives. However, we have been disappointed that not much has been done on a country-wide level to promote renewable energy. Nevertheless, in the past year, we have been able to unlock that potential, and the government has been accommodating in providing us with guidance on what we can work on and what policies are needed to fill the void that was created in the past. Thus, we have used this to pursue a number of projects. We are in the assessment phase of a large solar project; on a smaller scale, we are working on a residential photovoltaic (PV) project, where customers will be allowed to install small-scale PV solar installations in their households and possibly benefit from selling excess capacity back to the grid. On the energy efficiency side, we have completed our data-gathering framework and now are able to provide guidance to the government based on empirical data on possible policy measures for energy efficiency.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>For decades, the Sultanate has distinguished itself as an innovator in the oil and gas sector, which is why stakeholders in Oman were keen to partner with us and begin harnessing the power of renewable energy for heavy oil extraction. The strong support we received from our partners at Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) offered us a foundation to grow and apply our solar enhanced oil recovery (EOR) solution at scale. The current climate of low oil prices highlights the need for cost savings, especially for oil-based economies, and solar EOR offers a unique method that was proven and developed in Oman and is now scaling globally. When oil prices are low, producers focus on cost reduction. At a typical heavy oilfield, 60-80% of operating cost is fuel purchase for steam generation. GlassPoint can provide steam for less than the cost of steam made by natural gas and other fuels. By doing so, we can help lower operating costs and help make Oman oil production more economical and sustainable. Using solar steam is a viable alternative to steam made from natural gas that will make a real impact on the future of oil production and is already transforming the energy landscape here.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Renewables are the future, and either solar or wind energy could be a savior for our peak electricity planning. RAECO is starting to gear ourselves up in that direction. We are working to optimize the cost of energy and maximize the use of renewables. We have signed up with Masdar in the UAE to develop the Dhofar Wind Project, a 50-MW wind farm, which is currently in the mobilization phase. Construction will take two years, and we expect the project to be operational by the end of 2019. It will contribute to environmental protection and save 110,000 tons of CO2 emissions. RAECO is the first mover when it comes to solar energy as well. We initiated the first project in the country for solar called Al Mazyonah in 2015, and since then it has been generating through a PPP and power purchase agreement (PPA); we procure per kilowatt hour from it. For Dhofar, we will operate the wind farm and sell the electricity to the grid. We are also looking at villages and considering how we could use solar power. We seek to reposition the company to become an expert in renewable energy.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Bauer is currently the only company worldwide that closes within its service portfolio the entire water cycle as we are capable of locating, extracting, treating, and delivering water to whoever needs it. We are in remediation and treatment of polluted water, mainly industrial wastewater, with a focus on the oil and gas industry. However, in the future we will also focus on the manufacturing and mining industry with their waste and wastewater. We are focused on the country's biggest client, PDO, which entrusted us in 2009 with a 20-year design BOT project to treat 45,000cbm per day of produced water in the oil field in Nimr. This plant has been extended several times and at the moment we treat 115,000cbm of polluted water every day. There is water reuse here for minor things such as washing cars, irrigation of green areas, and others. Industrial wastewater effluent can be reused for certain purposes such as irrigation. However, we are in a different cultural and religious environment and must be aware of that.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The Sultan started talking about water from his first day in 1970. At every occasion he mentions water, for example, in the context of agriculture, drinking water, and the discovery of major new aquifers. Now in Oman, we also have desalination and treatment plants for water. Whenever there is a shortage of water, we turn to desalination and use treated water. There are four new desalination plants under construction in Barka, Sohar, Sur, and Salalah. Three more are coming up in 2017-2018 in Musandam, Sharqiyah, and Duqm. Some of them will be combined with electricity plants while others will just be for desalination. In terms of sewage treatment plants, all this work has been shifted from the Ministry of Regional Municipalities to Haya Sewage Treatment Company, a national company. Haya will operate and maintain all sewage treatment plants in the country and will upgrade some. There will also be numerous megaprojects involving wastewater treatment coming up.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As far as wastewater is concerned, it is a utility business. There are various aspects to this. One is the treatment of that waste. Number two would be the recycling of that waste, so there are a number of processes where we first treat and then recycle. For example, most countries are going for a zero discharge concept, meaning that not a single drop of water should be wasted, and this is also the main concept in Oman. For that, the government in Oman has invested in agencies like Haya. Haya has plants that first organize wasteful treatment and then utilize this treated water for irrigation, washing, flushing, and more. Once the water is treated, there are two primary outputs; one is solid sludge and the other is treated water. As the population grows, the percentage of waste also increases; therefore, this is an industry that is continuously growing—like electricity, water, and food, as the population grows, so too does industry. The environment is a key issue today, and the government is spending a great deal to raise awareness, bring in modern technology, and improve the efficiency of plants.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Water is one of the most important strategic areas for the future of the country, and desalination is a technology, similar to air-conditioning, that this region cannot exist without. The mission of MEDRC is to find solutions to fresh water scarcity. Our focus is thus on environmentally sustainable desalination and ways of providing increased water supplies to the country and region. In the long term, it just is not viable to burn massive amounts of fossil fuels to desalinate water. Desalination is incredibly expensive and uses a huge amount of energy. We need to find different ways to do it; we have done research on minimizing the energy requirement, and supporting solar-, wind-, and even nuclear-powered desalination. We have researched large-scale plants right down to small-scale plants used by farmers. We work with all the major plants, not just in Oman, but also in the GCC. We hold many training programs on how to take the environment right into the center of the process and minimize the energy requirement, the carbon footprint, and the environmental impact of all this work.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Pak Oman is a joint venture between the government of Oman and the government of Pakistan. It was founded in 2001 when His Majesty visited Pakistan. Oman and Pakistan have a long history of fruitful relationships, and a significant number of the Omani population originates from Pakistan. Both countries are also emerging markets with strong potential for economic growth; Both economies have, as a whole, done well over the last 20-30 years. The company was set up with capital of USD100 million; currently our assets are almost USD400 million, and we regularly pay dividends. To date, between USD400-500 million worth of investment has gone from Oman to Pakistan, and this is in addition to our own firm's book of assets. The Chairman of Pak Oman is also the Chairman of the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD). We are working closely to determine how we can bring Pakistani companies into Oman. There are many opportunities that we want to capitalize on. It is an ongoing process, and we plan to hold a Duqm roadshow in Pakistan as well. In the coming years, there will be a great deal of business activity in Oman, especially in the free zones. Duqm is a great example, and firms from many countries are keen to invest there.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our challenges were to bring the Khazzan project on stream safely and to maintain the cost we estimated for the project; I am pleased to say we did both. Not only were we able to deliver the project a few months ahead of time, but we also completed under the expected budget. The total capacity of the Khazzan project is 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. We are gradually ramping up and increasing production up to the planned capacity sometime in 2018. In terms of our people, Omanization is an important part of our business; it is about the knowledge transfer, where we build the capabilities of our employees and contractors. Approximately 40% of our staff is made up of people entering the workforce for the first time. We ensure we transfer skills and knowledge from our more experience colleagues, whether Omani or expatriates. By the end of 2017, we will reach our target of 70% of Omanization. We will also have Omanis working outside of Oman in other BP locations around the world. There, they also gain experience. They deal with other cultures, learn alternative ways of doing things, and benefit from best practices. It is all about cultural and information exchanges as well as development.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a local bank that is 94% Omanized, and we are locally quoted. The distinction that we, as a local bank, have as compared to the other local banks is that we also have the capabilities to pull in our overseas colleagues to help on particular types of business where we need specialized advice that is not available in Oman. Other banks can attempt to deliver that expertise; however, they have to engage with an overseas third-party resource. We have been here longer than anyone else and know the market well. We are focused on the upper end of the retail segment: people with more money and more deposits and investments. In the wholesale space, we have done a great deal of work in terms of helping bring foreign investors into the country, and we bank over 300 multinational subsidiaries here. We also provide advice to different government ministries, including the Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Ministry of Finance. Islamic banking is becoming more relevant, and it will be interesting to see how it develops in Oman in the future. HSBC is not interested at the moment in starting Islamic banking in Oman. We have a sukuk operation based in Dubai that is the number-one team in terms of leading sovereign and corporate sukuk deals.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The main focus is on supporting both students graduating from higher education institutes and SMEs in developing their own businesses rather than looking for jobs within the government sector. The Research Council has initiated several Innovation Assistance Programs and participated in the establishment of venture capital funds. However, our most important contribution is the National Innovation Strategy because of its role as a linking platform. Most of our effort goes into creating synergy among our target actors, rather than having their efforts be scattered and duplicated. For now, we are in the early stages of development, and there is a great deal of learning to be done, especially in regards to stabilizing the system. Sometimes we launch programs as pilots to assess their success rate without much risk involved. For example, with IPM, we now have incubators that provide guidance and support and a platform to help entrepreneurs enter the market with as little risk as possible.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We support SMEs and help them by providing financial support, and we have different schemes to accomplish that. Generally it is through a loan, equity, or bill-discounting scheme. Currently, we offer up to OMR200,000 (USD519,600) in loans and are considering increasing the size of investment per SME. We also provide post-finance services for SMEs to ensure they grow and sustain in the market. Every year we provide financial support to an average of 12 SMEs, and in 2016 we financially supported 17. The sectors with the most SME growth are trading, services, and manufacturing. We seek to increase the number of manufacturing SMEs as the manufacturing sector provides more support for economic growth. We expect a greater percentage of goods being manufactured locally using local resources to be exported regionally or internationally. Trading is the exact opposite; everything is brought in from foreign markets and sold on the local market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>NBC is one of the elements of the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Oman. We are a mixed-use facility and incubator. Approximately 90% of new businesses fail in the first year and incubators help to reduce this rate. NBC was created to be a working place for new start-ups. We provide them with training, coaching, mentoring, and facilities to work from. They graduate from our program when the idea becomes a small business, with four or five employees and stable revenue. As far as NBC is concerned, we are looking to be sustainable as an incubator and want to continue working with our partners and to do more work outside of Muscat over the next five years. We do not want to depend 100% on government funding. We build good relationships with partners and can provide many other services. We advise many companies and work with them, so it is a win-win situation for us all.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our first effort involved providing training in colleges, not just about how to be an entrepreneur, but more importantly, changing the mindset. We started in four colleges, expanded to nine and then 15, and are currently in 25 colleges. At the end of 2017 we will be in 30, and by the end of 2018, we will be a national program in every college in the country. The program will also be rolled out in selected schools in due course. The fund is a public-private partnership, and our shareholders have capitalized OMR100 million (USD259 million). We are allowed to borrow thrice our capital, so theoretically there is USD1 billion available to lend to SMEs, since the availability of money is the biggest challenge for SMEs. The other part is to stimulate entrepreneurship, and for that, we receive grants under the offset program. Developing, supporting, financing entrepreneurs, and helping them to succeed in their business are how we expect to reach our target.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our clients are mostly individuals, though we also assist corporations. We are specialized as asset managers for families and individuals and, because this is a business based on confidence, we are focused on building a close relationship with our clients. We have been in the market for 41 years, and our clients know our history and values. Our purpose is to advise and make the best decisions for our clients taking into consideration their objectives and needs. Mercado de Valores also has the capacity and experience to help protect foreign investors' interests in Costa Rica. We can provide an analysis of their needs and investments related to their sector of interest and help companies get established in the country. If they require financial advice they can count on us to understand and find the best alternatives.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, we have been growing 20% annually, and our core business includes intensive financial analysis, managing and advising our client portfolios, and managing investment funds. Our financial and economic analysis department is one of the firm's major strengths. We feed information to our clients, and that, along with our personalized advisory services, has become a key differentiator for Acobo. Our core business vertebrae are real estate investment funds and brokerage services. We also have a small fiduciary company that complements our clients' core business. Many of our clients are concerned with inheritance issues, and this fiduciary company manages those operations. The rest of the market has started to focus on real estate investment funds and has overlooked financial funds. Right now, we are doing something different; we have started to regionalize our fund. We see ourselves as a regional company, and by the second half of 2018, we will hopefully be trading in every Central American country.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Costa Rica does not have any natural resources that afford the start-up industry supplemental support from those revenues. This has forced Costa Rica to think big. However, the government is not focused on creating the conditions for start-ups, like it did for other economic aspects in the 1980s and 1990s. It also needs to maintain its focus on the future because this is done via innovation, which is through start-up entrepreneurs. The next government in 2018 will have the major challenge of going back to the drawing board to create the conditions for the next motor of growth for the country. It must develop a roadmap for the future as it relates to innovation. In addition, we must address the issue of supply in our universities and schools. The worst-case scenario is that Costa Rica remains in this nirvana of Pura Vida.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have a stock market seat, and we offer the traditional range of investments in the liquidity markets. In 1990, we founded a funds management company and since then offered some traditional vanilla funds. In 2000, we set up an investment banking unit, which is where we see the biggest opportunities for development and creativity. In investment banking, we can be creative and develop our market and our future. In the long term, we will have new ventures in the securities segment. Aldesa has started a new company called Aldesa Securitization Company that will change the industry with new offerings. Companies will consider the possibility of issuing securities. Initially, we expect the market to grow USD100 million each year. Aldesa will also continue in the energy sector, as this is a great opportunity for us. We will develop and finance renewable energy for housing through a package of technological products in a new type of investment vehicle.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The university started in 1936 as School of Commerce Castro Carazo. At the end of the 19th century, the Minister of Education, Mauro Fernandez, carried out a reform to democratize education, as we only had at that time a few schools and a pontifical university attended by the elite. That reform focused on improving elementary schools, while also building four high schools, closing the pontifical university, and organizing a polytechnic higher education institution. However, the dream of building a polytechnic did not take place, so in 1936 Miguel Angel Castro Carazo created this school to provide more, higher education opportunities. He also created a network for distance education in collaboration with the post office system in Costa Rica, local governments, and the church. In 1996, the School of Commerce Castro Carazo was transformed into a private university. We are proud of and faithful to our roots, and are growing wings to fly into an innovative future and meet the demands of society with more agility.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There is a soft revolution going on in the world called the internationalization of higher education. While there have been certain initiatives, like Education City in Dubai, they have grouped overseas universities together. Out of 2,600 American universities, my research shows only 75 have one or more overseas campuses that offer degrees. These are institutions that understand the importance and power of education across frontiers. Education may be the best chance we have at liberty, peace, justice, and economic development on a grand scale. The hope does not lie in armies or even diplomats; it lies in teachers, schools, and education. Promerica Group has always had an educational vision. If an institution is able to educate for creativity, innovation, and problem solving, rather than drill-and-kill and memorization, then it is helping to nurture the kinds of minds that can deal with the issues that the future will call for.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Un the QS University Rankings published in mid-2017, we made a tremendous leap and moved up approximately 60 positions in the global rankings. This is due to many factors. One is that Universidad de Costa Rica does a great deal of international networking in order to be present at important scientific and academic endeavors. The university has become extremely competent at research and works with many universities in the world at the same level. Second, we have made many investments to improve and expand our infrastructure. This will be dedicated not only to conducting more classes, but also improving our laboratories and equipment to be on par with widely acknowledged universities around the world. These are the key factors that have translated into our excellent reputation. We also have a strong commitment to entrepreneurship. We have an agency called the University Agency for the Management of Entrepreneurship (AUGE) that is making a concerted effort to impart both hard and soft skills to our students and faculty members.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In the 1970s, the only university in Costa Rica was the Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), which was only able to receive 800 new students a year, despite much higher demand. Each year many young people could not get into college, a problem that caused family issues and an educational crisis. During this time, I was a teacher at UCR, where I had worked for 30 years. We were trying to convince the UCR to increase its number of admissions. Unfortunately, it was not possible. It got so bad that a group of parents called us and asked if it was possible to start a private university in Costa Rica. Our answer was yes, but how would we overcome the legal, social, political, and financial barriers? It took some time as we only had 18 people. When the government approved the foundations law, we knew this was our chance to create the university, and thus we founded the Universidad Autónoma de Centroamérica. It was not easy, but we did it.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>ULatina was created 25 years ago. It was created by a family with a vision of being present not only in the Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM), but in provincial and rural zones. Its founders, the Salas family, set it up as a university that covered all areas of knowledge. It began operations with five educational faculties, but now has six, plus a post-graduate international center. We have seven regional facilities in Guanacaste, Santa Cruz, Cañas, and Liberia. In the Caribbean area, we have facilities in Guápiles and in Perez Zeledon. We also have other satellite locations in Ciudad Neily and Grecia. Santa Cruz, Guápiles, and Perez Zeledon are the largest rural operations. In GAM, we have campuses at Heredia and San Pedro, and a post-grade international center in Torre Mercedes Building in Paseo Colón. We plan to open a facility at San Carlos area in the medium term, since it is an emerging area and has a great need for quality educational services in certain specific knowledge areas.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Laboratorios Zepol is a family company and still 100% Costa Rican owned. This is important to the way we have done business over the years since my grandfather opened his pharmacy in 1936. During this time, there was a shortage of medicine, and people sought natural remedies. This is how his product, Zepol Topical Balsamic Ointment, became popular. In 1950, he founded this company. My father became the general manager 30 years later with a modern leadership vision that has driven us to where we are today. He began exporting and globalizing our company and our products. The standardization of quality was important to him. A few years later, we made a huge investment in our production plant with clean rooms that met international quality standards, which was an innovative move for us and for Costa Rica. We were, at the time, the only pharmaceutical company with the ISO-9001 certification in Central America. It was an important step for us, but it was just the beginning.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, Pfizer chose Costa Rica to set up its financial services center aimed at centralizing and standardizing processes for the different markets where Pfizer operates. Thanks to local talent, the operation of this center expanded in 2016 and its current team of 250 colleagues serves 29 territories in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, as well as the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, and 18 European markets. Costa Rica is an important country for Pfizer's regional operations, because from here we manage our operations for the entire Central American and Caribbean region. These operations include marketing, finance, human resources, regulatory affairs, corporate affairs, and medical, among others. We are proud of the activities and initiatives that we carry out in Costa Rica. They complement our business operations to enhance the healthcare system, increase access to our medicines, and find sustainable solutions to current and future healthcare challenges.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Before we founded Farmanova, I used to work as an international executive for Pfizer and later decided to start a new development in pharmaceuticals. At that time, the distribution and wholesaling of pharmaceuticals in Costa Rica was in the hands of three large companies. Therefore, we started Farmanova, which had to be fed with co-distributions as opposed to exclusive distributions. We represented a new strategy by dividing one exclusive distribution into two. We started as co-distributers of main international companies; it was a successful new approach that the market was happy with. This meant new opportunities for credit and price competition, which made for a more dynamic and growing market. We later saw how the generic market was emerging and decided to create a new platform called Intermed, oriented to the development of the generic market and over-the-counter (OTC) products. We realized some of those companies were not only involved in the human market but also in the animal health veterinary market and decided to initiate a new business in animal health called Copeco.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We set up the business with the idea of Central America and Panama as a whole; however, when we started in Costa Rica, we stayed here because there is transparency when dealing with the government, which at the time was not the case in other Central American countries. The exception was Panama, though it later came up with regulations that were counterproductive to our work. We have sold to Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Panama in the past; now, we are concentrating on going back out again. At this point, we will probably enter Nicaragua and Honduras first. In Costa Rica, the largest purchaser of pharmaceutical products is Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS). In other countries, the private market is mostly larger than the public market. The coverage in Costa Rica with CCSS is much more extensive than the coverage in other countries. Medication and healthcare are guaranteed by the Costa Rican constitution. Even visitors who are injured are covered under CCSS, which is not the case in other countries.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Ticofrut's 30th anniversary will be in 2018. Its founder had the vision to develop primarily orange plantations in the northern region of Costa Rica and process oranges into different types of products, such as concentrate, single-strength juice, and several others. He started in 1988 by developing farms in the San Carlos region and in the county of Los Chiles, which borders Nicaragua. Over these 30 years, the company has transformed significantly. We all knew, at that time, that Costa Rica was a base to grow oranges, but not in commercially sizable operations. However, with that the development of a state-of-the-art processing facility, oranges can be processed and meet the quality and safety specs of international customers. In general, we process our product mainly into frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ), which ultimately ends up in the US and is supplied to the Coca-Cola Company, our main customer internationally. Coca-Cola has only three suppliers on a worldwide basis for orange concentrate and one of those is Ticofrut. We also have additional customers in the US and Europe and ship a significant volume of orange pulp to China. In terms of our orange products, we have the US, Europe, and the Asian market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The company was founded in 1973 originally as a sardine producer. However, five years later an opportunity arose to start producing tuna because it was a source of cheap protein and a good supplement. From 1976-1978, Costa Rica went through a crisis, and the company wanted to offer an inexpensive product, and tuna was ideal for that purpose. In 2002, we inaugurated our new production facility in Puntarenas, specifically in Barranca. It was a modern and state-of-the-art 25,000-sqm plant that replaced a 7,000-sqm facility in Cocal. This new plant allowed us to expand into the international market, and we started exporting to the US, Europe, and even Asia. We continued to grow and are currently one of the largest companies in Latin America—no doubt the largest in Central America—in the tuna business. In 2005, we acquired Tesoro del Mar, which at that time was the second-largest tuna producing company. In 2012, we decided it was time for the company to innovate and participate in different types of businesses, and we changed our name from Sardimar to Alimentos Prosalud. We started working aggressively on innovation and on our own R&amp;D department. Now, we sell rice, pesto chicken, and many other innovative products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We started with mango, which is the most favorite tropical fruit. Nowadays we process all tropical fruits such as papaya, banana, melons and fruit mixes with berries, but the star has been pineapples. It has become so important that we hardly process other fruits now. We have been processing pineapples 24/7 to become more efficient, and freeze them with IQF technology in just six minutes the same day they are harvested. This is how the flavor remains the best. The majority of our product goes to industry. Their requirements are stricter because our product turns into a raw material for pastries, yogurt, ice cream, and packaged industries. We do very little retail, perhaps just 3%, as the packing of frozen fruit blends is a business of its own, and most of it is done in the US and Europe. They source different fruits from all over the world, keep inventory, and deliver, as retailers demand it under the super market private brands. At La Paz, we supply this packers, wholesale distributors, and food servicers. This is how we give people the opportunity to eat sweet, freshly frozen pineapple all over the world.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company started 40 years ago in Venezuela. Our primary market was the lower and middle class, for whom we built apartments and houses. In 2011, the government intervened in our company and took control of it before removing us from its corporate governance. Following this, one of our partners in Venezuela, the Finol family, who had a lot of experience in Costa Rica, invited us to participate in a construction opportunity there. Once we entered the market, we realized that we had to work hard due to harsh competition, but were able to live our life freely and in peace. My father and uncle decided to start the company here in Costa Rica; at first, we started out in a 6sqm office. Leaving a country with a large demand for real estate for a smaller, more competitive market, we soon realized that we needed to focus on promoting a product that offered better quality and attainable prices.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We always try to be different. For example, apartments in Heredia were small, and we decided to do something we call homes located in buildings for a different market that values space. We then decided to expand because there was a great deal of competition in Heredia, so we then went to Alajuela. We have pioneered the best possible project at the lowest possible price; in terms of price per sqm, we have a huge advantage over our competitors. For the Alajuela market, we have given amenities a lot of thought. We also invested in space for social events with full connectivity, while always keeping in mind how amenities affect the monthly fees. It is key for us to keep these as low as possible; however, it is also a priority to ensure that condos and common areas have the best wireless connection possible. This is something people greatly appreciate. We work with several companies to provide this service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Argo was born as a real estate consulting company but evolved to become a real estate developer in 2015 and is focused on the Rohrmoser area in San José, with local and international investors. There are two large investor groups, some from Spain and some local. We have also participated internationally as consultants in Panama, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Spain, and Ecuador. There has been an important evolution, in particular with the construction of high-rise buildings. There were no such buildings in Costa Rica before; this trend was mainly realized in the last five years. High-rise construction is the main business now, to which demand is oriented—though at a slower rate than supply. In some market segments, there is an oversupply. Mobility is the main urban challenge right now because San José completely lacks an efficient modern public transportation system. As a result, we focus our developments in zones where people do not need to use a car to get around.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We started about 17 years ago. In the late 1990s, my father used to work in the textile business and started building warehouses for our products, then decided to sell and lease the warehouses when he realized the construction of a building for a department store made more profit than other areas and thus switched to real estate. In 2002, we joined forces with a partner who had experience in the construction sector in Miami and Colombia, and together we built offices and condominiums in Escazu. We also started doing some projects in Miami between 2003 and 2007, but when the crisis hit in 2007, we closed our business there and focused on Costa Rica. That is when we decided to split up, and since 2007 we have been a family-owned company developing several businesses in the country. We started with high-rise condominiums, something Costa Ricans were unaccustomed at the time for their expense, but have now come to see as normal.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Fomento Urbano is one of the oldest development companies in the residential sector, though it actually got started by accident. The company was created by four Costa Rican families, three of which were in the textile industry. These three partners bought a piece of land and wanted to build a new textile company. When they started doing reviews of the land they realized that they had a problem; the zoning of the land they bought was only for residential development. They had already made the purchase, so needed to decide upon an alternative. Thus they decided to start building houses. It is funny because this became a critical part of their business. Before long they had the goal of bringing excellent housing to all Costa Ricans. They focused on the middle class and got buildings permits in Tibás, Moravia, Heredia, and San Pedro. Over the years, the company has built more than 8,000 houses.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Although Central American economies are small, they are growing every year by 3-5%. In Central America, there are two different zones, the north and south triangles. ArcelorMittal saw an opportunity to buy the only producer in the south triangle in 2008 from Pujol Group. At the time, it was the only asset available in the region, and the owners were willing to do business. The strategy was to maintain a presence in every part of the world, and in that sense Costa Rica has a strategic position. From here, we can ship material to countries such as Panama, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, and Nicaragua—the main economies in the zone. The high level of education was also taken in consideration. We have also taken advantage of the construction boom whose investments have mostly been made by the private sector.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>AMCO was founded in January in 2000 as a construction company mainly focused on infrastructure projects such as pipe installation, pavement, and everything related to exterior works for residential and commercial projects. In 2009, we began to produce and sell premixed concrete. This project was initially created for our own consumption because of a shortage during the economic bonanza. However, some of our construction clients then started to approach us to supply them with materials, so we decided to transform our business and create an independent line for supplying materials to our clients. We did not foresee the effects of the economic crisis of that year, but were considering whether to continue with this business or not. We decided to continue; thankfully we were well received by the market and since then have had sustained growth.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a consulting company; we design and support through construction dealing and construction administration through site inspection. The approach at that time was to integrate into a single office for all services related to design and construction. In 2001, we were awarded with a project for Intel in Guadalajara. This marked an evolution for the company in two senses. First, it gave us an inclination toward industrial projects that we have maintained until today. Second, it provided us with a lot of knowledge on how to deal with first-world engineering and design. These types of projects were extremely intensive in requirements and procedures as well as technical capabilities. At the same time, we were able to apply all this knowledge for other clients.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Aluma has a presence in more than 30 countries around the world and is divided into five different divisions. Costa Rica was one of the first countries in the region where Aluma began its operations. We rent and sell construction equipment and have three divisions in Costa Rica. First, the engineering division, which provides forming and shoring for construction. We also sell our equipment, although rental is our core business. We also have the mechanical equipment division and offer generators and certain compact equipment. The third division in Costa Rica is the environmental division, with portable toilets for rental. We rent for all types of industry and economic activities; however, we are basically focused on construction, agriculture, and industrial operations. We also rent portable toilets for special events such as concerts or trade fairs.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We were pioneers in the private sector because previously there had only been the state-run telecom and electric company, ICE. It is the pioneer in all geo-technical work as a whole, while in the private sector there were no formal contractors in this area. In the beginning, it was hard to enter this market because we had to explain to clients what we could do, our technology, and the reasons and benefits of using such a system. In 2005, our first formal competitor entered the market. We have to compete against traditional competitors at the global level. In 2017, and looking to 2018, the market has matured, and our competitors are improving so we have to be open to more technical solutions. At the current level of maturity in the market, we seek to make another revolution in the market.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>This year is our 60th anniversary. Throughout the years, Edica has been an important contractor for the government. A lot of the important work has passed through us, starting with the Children's Hospital, the Juan Santamarí­a International Airport, the headquarters of Banco Nacional, the headquarters of Bank of Costa Rica, the ICE building in La Sabana, and more recently the Jade Museum. We have also done a lot of work for Recope and the full fire protection systems in both airports. The government has been a good client for us. Throughout the years, we have grown. At present, we have an office in Nicaragua, which opened in 2016. We are also opening another business within the construction sector. We have an area of real estate development as well. We have grown, expanded, and created new businesses, which is what Edica does. The most iconic project we are currently working on for the government is the Convention Center.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We began in 1983 as a small operation of four people with little capital. We started with houses and eventually picked up small projects building houses for well-known people and small businesses. It was not until we started in hotels that we began to cross into larger businesses, specifically Costa Rica Marriott and Real Intercontinental. We thought the construction of houses and hotels was more or less the same; however, we soon discovered the processes were quite different. The transformation was a positive experience. That was the first jump, and the next big milestone was working for Intel, which chose us as a general contractor for its plant in Costa Rica. That was a major change for us, not only because it was a large project, but also because of the culture of that company. Intel produced a ripple effect in Costa Rica and our company in terms of safety, which influenced us considerably.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Globalvia has been in Costa Rica for a long time. In 2013, we got a concession contract for Route 27 that had been first assigned in 2000. The contract for Route 27 is strategic for the company and one of the best we have. It is also particularly strategic for the country, connecting the north region and tourist areas, as well as allowing the growth of Greater Metropolitan Area (GAM) and the new industrial area along the route. It makes great sense for us to have an urban portion of the route with high levels of traffic and to connect urban areas with a seaport. Moreover, because of good conditions here, there is potential to generate other business opportunities. Infrastructure projects are in general hard to get off the ground because of costs, but when the concession model started in Latin America around 20 years ago, it allowed public-private partnerships to generate new sources of financing. This happened in Costa Rica as well.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Tek Experts started almost seven years ago in Sofia, Bulgaria; the Costa Rica office was set up six years ago. It started off slow in the beginning because we had to establish the operation and ramp up the team. However, the company rapidly grew to 200 people by the time I joined Tek Experts in January 2014. Since then, the number of employees has grown to 750 today. Since December 2016, we have been recruiting 45-50 people per month. We are close to 1,700 people globally, and Costa Rica is our largest operation, both employee-wise and in terms of business volume. We manage more than 40% of our global cases, and all done by Costa Rican staff. Our services started with software support at a technical level. We interacted mainly with IT departments and people that handled apps, not users. However, we have evolved since then. Even though our core business is still B2B corporate software support, we have also implemented professional services, customer services, account management, pre-sales, and software configuration.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our main partners are HP Inc., Microsoft, and Zebra, and our vision is to be our customers' trusted IT advisor. We do hardware, software, services, and outsourcing, where we have 80 people. Five years ago, we also got into the cloud business with the Codisa Data Center. For 25 years, CMA was a hardware-oriented company, after which we decided to become a service-oriented company. Traditionally, about 80% of our business was in hardware and 20% in services. Services now make up 60% of our total business, and just 40% hardware. We are a recognized cloud provider in the region, winning the award for Best Cloud in Latin America in Las Vegas in 2016. So we are leading the cloud wave with Codisa, while also selling infrastructure to our main customers, including big government entities. About 40% of our sales are to the public sector, the remaining 60% to the private sector and finance.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a 15-year-old company that represents SAP with a local presence in five countries: Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Chile, and Mexico. We do software development for three vertical industries and export our software to over 15 countries in South America, Central America, the Caribbean, as well as the Middle East. We have over 500 customers mainly throughout Latin America with our vertical solutions through SAP. I have been a member of the Global Partner Executive Council since 2013. I am one of the 10 partners around the world who is a member of the advisory council to SAP. Costa Rica is a great place to do business even though the country is small. Doing business in Latin America is somewhat difficult compared to the US and Europe; in Latin America everyone wants their own system, implementation, pace, and flavor. Standard implementations do not work as easily as they do in larger and more sophisticated countries that adopt best practices.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Something that VMware has specifically identified in Costa Rica is its talent. The Costa Rican has no fear to challenge the status quo, which is important for us. The other important aspect is its “pura vida“ culture, which has something energetic and full of collaboration and participation between people. These are some of the reasons VMware got to know Costa Rica beyond the standard reasons regarding its location within the Americas, proximity to the US, and base for off-shore operations, etc. It is easy to sell the concept of talent here; the moment people step off the plane, they realize the benefit of Costa Rican culture and what people do. Employee motivation is also important, and productivity is measured depending on what role an employee has. Many of our roles are based on deliverables, on which we measure productivity through several successful metrics.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are focused on electromechanical assemblies. We mostly do magnetics and winding assemblies, such as electric motors, resolvers, synchros, and solenoids, cable harnesses, and various electromechanical connection devices that are used in a variety of high-end applications. Our business is 70% aerospace. Many industries relate; therefore, we have a lot of assemblies that are used in the energy sector as well as the medical sector. We have an ambitious goal of growing and doubling our sales in the next three years. The way we see ourselves doing that is by managing the supply chain of materials and services that used to be provided by our customers. Thanks to the aerospace cluster initiative, we are now able to use local suppliers for parts that we had to buy in other countries, and we also get to interact much more with universities and government agencies in developing capabilities and promoting Costa Rica. The cluster has also made it much easier to interact with larger corporations looking for products and services. Aside from promotion, we also use our strength in numbers to consolidate quality certification initiatives and organize seminars in areas specific to our industry. The cluster also makes us more attractive for FDI.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Costa Rica has been particularly important for L3, especially in terms of costs. There are areas where the country needs to improve, as there are some costs that have grown significantly, such as electricity. Power is too expensive nowadays. We have to work hard on how to reduce costs on power, and infrastructure needs to improve as well. Costa Rica is still attractive, however. The capability of the people to learn is excellent here, so the country always has the latest technology. If the local workforce could not adapt or did not have the proper experience and knowledge then we probably would not be here. We want to continue transferring more of our products and technology here, as we are always in competition. Market margins are small, so building the products in Costa Rica makes us more competitive, with more options to sell to more people. This is why we continue to aggressively transfer new products to Costa Rica. The facility here in Costa Rica is critical to the corporation, and we increase competitiveness with our products. Our customers mainly come in the form of telecommunications in the government sector and commercial sector. We supply modules that go on antennas or government equipment for telecommunications, for example. These are high-end and sophisticated products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Avionyx is an AS-9100 certified software engineering services company. In the aerospace industry, particularly commercial aerospace industry, one cannot develop, manufacture, or operate any equipment without license and certification from FAA or the relevant certifying entity. The software development process is extremely critical. The planes may look the same in the last few decades, but they are different on the inside. The biggest change came from the fly-by-wire concept. Aircrafts are truly a network of equipment and everything is digital, which has brought a major change to the industry. It increased the importance of software because software controls the behavior of the operations of all the equipment. I would like to see more aerospace companies as Costa Rica has a great deal to offer in that regard. Costa Rica does not have an aerospace background and when we came here the owner brought over several experienced engineers; however, now Costa Rica hosts the company's only engineering facility. The engineering schools in Costa Rica are great, and we can do much more. At this point, we are one of the few companies that are on the engineering and product development side. We are excited about all the possibilities and Procomer has done a great job promoting Costa Rica as an aerospace destination.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are the number-one insurance agency with the largest premium billings for INS. Our target market is not corporations, but mainly individuals. We cater to over 130,000 clients in Costa Rica, mainly individual customers. We have about 130 insurance agents throughout the country and with their experience we ensure our customers receive the best service and advice. Our client profile is different from other insurance intermediaries that cater to large corporations. Indeed, we cover individual clients seeking products like healthcare, home insurance, vehicles, and Riesgos del Trabajo. Our advantage is that Costa Ricans buy insurance through word of the mouth, and we come highly recommended. We are leaders in service and technology, and our human capital has great expertise. Our employees are also in a continuous process of training and learning about the changing needs of the market. We assume risks and objectively explain to our clients why INS offers the best products.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In the initial years, due to the lack of an independent sales force, we worked together with non-traditional insurance distribution channels, providing an experienced and efficient insurance platform to fill market needs for quality low-cost insurance, making coverage available to consumers who traditionally did not have access to insurance products. Since most insurance coverage was already developed, we simplified, packaged, and made it easy and affordable to purchase personal line products. We developed joint ventures with financial institutions such as banks, cooperatives, financing companies, credit cards, and large retail stores for market insurance products. Since Costa Rica has a higher purchasing power compared to most of Central American countries, and from the lack of competition previous to the market opening in 2008, the state-owned insurance company had been passive in this segment, leaving market demand unsatisfied for affordable insurance products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a multiline insurance with over 75% of market share. We are in two fields that are obligatory and that the competition has not entered. We have SMEs, corporations, and individuals. We cover all areas of insurance; half of our business is composed of personal insurance and the other half is general insurance, which includes damages, vehicles, and so forth. We are balanced and consider ourselves a multiline insurer, since we are in all areas of coverage. The business of insurance is based on protection and trust. We pay out around USD2 million every working day for compensations. We speak with solid numbers, and that makes the difference. We are making efforts to improve our service. We are focused on improving service, prices, and financial support; therefore, we have the elements to continue growing and being leaders of this business. We will continue to be the biggest; however, we aim to be the most efficient and provide the best service.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In the last year, the market has grown around 30%. Costa Rica is a small country. We have a saying here that the best market is one's own neighbor. There is more capacity, more equal rates, and lower prices. In addition, SUGESE has pushed hard to increase the level of knowledge for the people of Costa Rica. Costa Rica had a low reserve of income regarding insurance, which is improving every year. People are learning what having coverage really means and where it can be developed, not just for cars, but for health and homes as well. Latin American companies believe strongly in their way of doing things, and when a foreign company comes in, it is tough for them to immediately get on board. This has increased premiums, though not the number of policies. It is important to know how many new policies have been released in a year. SUGESE has compiled all the information right from the start.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have received the best bank in Costa Rica award for the last two years and expect to receive it for the third time in 2017. We have achieved systematic growth by improving the organization of our institution and making it stronger through financial solidity. We have focused on growing credit directed to different sectors of the country, generating development. This solidity is reflected on the distribution of credit in different activities; about 30% goes to housing and 25% is development banking for SMEs. Having a balance of risk and business has given us good results; in 2016, we had the best results in our history, not only in terms of profit, but also in efficiency and ROI. Our growth of profit against the previous year was almost 45%. At Banco Nacional, we have 2.5 million clients with our different products. Following our strategic plan launched in 2016, one of the main strategies has been to bring solidity to our financial institution. This allows us to experience considerable growth in our commercial division and greater financial solidity. In 2016, our credit growth was 12%, and in 2017 we expect to grow at a similar rate.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>One of the bank's missions is to protect workers. We have a pension operator, stock exchange, investment fund company, and, for the last six years, an insurance marketing agency. We belong to Costa Rica's working population. Workers are represented through a national assembly of workers where the bank's plans and strategies are defined. The working population is also represented at the national assembly via unions, community development associations, solidarity associations, and various professional associations. Around 40% of our loan portfolio is personal credit and seeks to satisfy workers' consumption needs. The remaining 60%, which is the main activity of our bank, is oriented toward social and development banking, where we finance housing for the medium to low-income sector. On the business side, we focus on loans for micro enterprises and SMEs. 90% of our business clients are from the SME sector. The business that is growing rapidly is social and development banking, which are aligned with our mission. We dedicate 70% of our profits to grow our business while the other 30% is oriented on social plans. Those social programs are not free; they just have lower interest rates. We offer loans without requiring a premium-starting fee.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>2016 was marked by international banks pulling out from the local market. This left us with many new opportunities in the market and was the reason why we grew significantly in 2016. In addition, smaller banks were having troubles, and Promérica took advantage of this situation as well. This year is different for Promérica and the country, and we will not grow at the same rate as 2016, though we will still be on a growth trajectory. Currently, we still operate in the same markets where we saw growth several years ago; we are still successful in the SME space. In addition, 25% of our assets are credit cards, which is a profitable business. In terms of liabilities, we have changed a little; private banking is a great source of funds. However, it is a little expensive, and we, thus, started to move on to institutional funding and DDA markets. We have invested a large sum of money on electronics solutions, such as internet banking and mobile banking, and are moving in that direction, as we want to bring down our costs in order to be in the larger corporations market.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The main driver of green energy technologies is cost. The second is the environment. Even in Costa Rica, cost is still primary. Costa Rica is the cleanest energy producing country in the world with nearly 95% coming from renewable sources; however, the cost of that energy is high. The solar panel is transforming this industry in dramatic ways because it allows us to generate energy where it is needed and to customize energy generation conveniently. We have a scalable, no-transport required energy technology with no moving parts and a lifespan of 25-30 years. Phase I is telling the consumer that there is an option and that option is transformative. We model every one of our locations, custom designing the system for the client. Our main target is the commercial industrial sector. Toyota, Banco Promerica, and Country Day School are a few of our clients. Interestingly, only a year ago it was illegal to install panels in Costa Rica and we are looking at an industry that has truly been operational for a single year.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Yuxta started working in energy efficiency in Central America, with a strong focus on Costa Rica. It quickly evolved into a solar photovoltaic energy producing company. Then we expanded into Colombia, and some projects in Mexico will start operations soon. Our name derives from the word juxtaposition, embodying the union of our three pillars and their social, environmental, and economic impact. We have 71 active projects, with spectacular results. We reduce operation costs to our clients and improved efficiency savings in their operation. The commercial and industrial market is growing and is currently our largest segment. The residential market is not that viable because of the way the legislation was structured in Costa Rica; it has a high fixed cost. The cheapest way to save energy is to inform consumers on how they can efficiently use it. Close to 30% of the energy spent in the world is wasted energy, because people lack the necessary information about its correct use or are using inefficient equipment.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our goal is to be solar facilitators; therefore, we have to maximize savings. Our reason for being is to maximize savings to the client. We do this through experience. We have the largest engineering and financial team in solar energy in the region. We have regional economies of scale. If we only focus on the Costa Rican market, it is impossible to achieve that. The market is relatively small, and we need to be in all of Central America to play in the big leagues. That leverage reflects the value proposition, and the client can see all our projects and compare. This is not a one-time sale; it is a long-term relationship. We want to make solar energy easy. What we offer is savings, and that comes from design, engineering, procurement, construction, operational maintenance, and finance. Business owners want savings, and they want to say that they have solar energy. However, they do not understand how it works or how they have to maintain it. We integrate everything that the market demands.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>ACOPE was created in 1990 when Costa Rica legalized private energy generation. At the time, this activity was dominated by a monopoly controlled by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE). ACOPE gathers renewable energy producers in Costa Rica. We are a business association that collaborates and interacts with government institutions. Our function is union and representation. We also have some activities oriented to renewable energy promotion and education. There are many opportunities to invest in the sector. Not everything is easy; investors must understand the legislation for private generation and its restrictions and take into account that Costa Rica is a great place to invest from a long-term perspective. We have restrictions on project sizing and how to participate in the market. Investment opportunities will be the future, and investors must be ready to respond to future tenders. There is a small solar project as well. It is incredible that Costa Rica does not have more solar-developed projects, and this could be an area of growth.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Having no military has unquestionably contributed to Costa Rica's success as the money was instead invested in developing one of the strengths of Costa Rica, its people and talent, which have attracted many of the companies that have fueled the economy in the last 10-15 years. There is also a sense of equality, and this has helped create a large middle class with access to free education up to high school as well as public universities, which are regarded among the best in the country. Costa Rica traditionally has been in competition for FDI with its closest neighbors; however, if we look at the sectors that have been an engine for growth, particularly those operating on the free trade zone regime, then competition has always been within a larger territory. For example, 10-15 years ago, Costa Rica was competing with Panama, El Salvador and other Latin American countries for companies looking to set up shared service centers; however, in the last five years Costa Rica has been competing not only against other Latin American countries but also against low-cost locations in the US and Europe.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Philip Morris is in the middle of a transformation journey to build our future on smoke-free products. The mindset of Costa Rica is very much about sustainability and is proud of it. It is an example to the world in many areas such as renewable energy, health, education, and the way it takes care of the environment. That by itself is a great base to bring these new alternatives and one of the things we aspire to is for Costa Rica to be one of the first smoke-free societies. Choosing Costa Rica as our headquarters for the region was institutional because many multinationals are based here to cover Central America and the Caribbean, depending on the setup. Institutions are quite strong relative to the Latin American neighborhood, which brings confidence, stability, and the rule of law. This is clear compared to other countries and even though on a cost basis it is not the cheapest place in Central America the other things are stronger in the overall equation.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been here since 1920. As the Coca-Cola Company produces locally in every country through franchise bottlers, that makes us one of the most important partners in any country in terms of employment. We are embedded and invested in Costa Rica, having been here almost a century. Costa Rica is our headquarter hub for our Latin Center region from which we manage 31 countries, including the Caribbean, Central America, and the northern part of South America. Costa Rica, also offer us highly skilled bilingual talent. Furthermore, our concentration plant, from where we export to the Caribbean, Central America, and other countries, is also proudly located in Costa Rica since 1962. From a large import/export perspective, we focus on local production. We make more of an impact to the local economy. We try to procure all our core ingredients locally; hence, our impact for Costa Rica is truly felt here. Our broader business and the entire value chain starts with growers, who grow what we procure, such as sugar cane.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In terms of human capital in Costa Rica, we have attracted global attention for how competent and capable our employees are. International foreign investors and companies are setting up in the country and entering new industries for that reason. People do have to be properly trained; we have a great base from where we start, with capable people who are intelligent and well educated. We direct some employees to our interesting training programs that we want certain personnel to complete. Also, a large part of the training is done on the job. We make sure our employees get the basics right through our formal course and are also beside them during their work. We work strongly on objectives, and have provided several programs that will allow our employees to develop strongly toward those objectives. Additionally, we have formed partnerships with several universities in Costa Rica. We have a program called Unilever en tu Clase, where top leaders of the organizations go to universities and work with students to make cases that are real-world examples.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Deloitte has been present for 50 years in the Costa Rican market. Deloitte was the first services consultancy company in the country. We also manage the Central America region from here with our 500 collaborators. In 2016, Costa Rica captured close to 45% of the investments that were made in the entire region related to shared services centers. Costa Rica is an already consolidated services provider in sectors such as traditional exporting for manufacturing, agricultural, tourism, and others. The secret here is the people, the human resources. The truth is that as a country Costa Rica has been investing almost 8% of its GDP on education. We do not have an army. Costa Rica is a stable country, with no major political upheavals. These are all what we offer, besides the commitment with the environmental conservation. Costa Rica being 28th in the Social Progress Index is an objective indicator, and it is meritorious that with our GDP we were rated in the Social Progress Index in a level well above our respective GDP.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Before, it was easier to operate and there were not as many regulations; however, now, everything has evolved. It has been difficult to educate the market as people change their views of what private security is. Private security has become an important part of everyone's operations. We have electronic security to help monitor someone's place. We add much more to the bottom line, which people truly take into account. Now, security is becoming an integral part of business operations. Companies take us more seriously; public opinion is still a little behind what we want to project, though this is changing. The Ministry of Public Security wants to eliminate firearms from private security and has asked us to present a report on the need to use firearms in all our security posts. Certain clients welcome it, while others are up in arms about it and do not understand. People in other countries are not armed, though they have the infrastructure to call for those who are; we are not at that level. The infrastructure needs to be in place in order to replace, face, and repel those who want to do harm. The country needs to do something about the requirements for armed and non-armed guards.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Costa Rica, like anywhere else in the world, faces serious security challenges. We are the only security company in Latin America with ISO 9000, OSHA 18000, and in the short term, BASC certifications. The idea is to have all three, which is a unique way of working here. We sell electronic management products such as cameras and other surveillance devices. The market is moving more toward technology because equipment never sleeps. We invest once in security and do not need to invest again and again, as one might do with security guards. Over the long term, it is cheaper than having other types of security or security guards. However, there will always be a need to have a combination of both; equipment cannot move or take action. The government's reforms will certainly help us. Fortunately, we do all of the right procedures and process management. We work eight hours a day, and this is the reason why we are at times more expensive compared to others. The new reform will ban all weapons, and as of May 2017, we destroyed every gun we had in the office. We use 100% technology now. The risks in this sector are extremely high and it is a difficult industry to work in; with any luck, the new reforms will push informal companies out.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The security guard market will change in the mid term; simply having security guards is no longer sustainable. Paying for one guard 24 hours a day every month is expensive, and companies no longer want to do it. We looked for a way to change our services and decided to replace guards with technology, which reduces costs for our customers. This is what we now do from our operation centers all around the world. Where we used to have 10 guards, we now just have three or four; the rest is done through technology. We currently do tour guards, supervise the location, remote video, surveillance, alarm systems, and even remote access control for gated communities. We were the first security company to sell security solutions in Costa Rica. We offer our customers guards, cameras, mobile, and GPS, all in one solution. We used to be more expensive than other companies, because of our unique solutions. However, now that we have proven that our security solutions are effective, other companies have started to do what we do and prices have become competitive. We are still a few years ahead of the market in security solutions, however. Two things are happening: the cost of guards is high, and new taxes are on the way.<br></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The EATP is a regional tourism platform within the East African Community (EAC), with an apex body made up of each of the tourism private sector agencies from member states, such as the Tanzania Tourism Confederation, and similar representatives from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi. In addition to the apex body, we have included two other associations: the hospitality sector and tour operator associations. The idea behind the EATP was to create a vehicle for brainstorming ideas about tourism that can then filter into the EAC decision-making process in general. Promoting links between Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Burundi in the tourism sector has been vital for all nations to promote intra and inter-regional tourism, share experiences, overcome challenges, monitor their progress, and refine their industries. Currently all five EAC member states more or less promote similar natural wildlife resources—beaches, lakes, mountains, and culture in general. However, we still have differentiations in these products. There some strong products like the Serengeti, Ngorongoro, Kilimanjaro, and Zanzibar in Tanzania; a unique gorilla experience in Rwanda; and the Masai Mara in Kenya, which are stand out products and will continue to be promoted individually. Long term, the idea is to create a packaged product with an integrated marketing strategy.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Zanzibar has a rich culture and history; this alone should be attraction enough to visit the region. We have one of the oldest histories in East Africa, dating back to the Stone Age. That said, we will always remain primarily a beach destination, and we cannot change that, nor should we try to. However, it is important to diversify the message we put out there to attract different crowds. Zanzibar has never been hugely well known for its MICE offerings, though in the past five years we have seen some significant improvements on this front. Events on the island are given a higher profile—from film festivals, which have been around here for the last 15 years or so, to food and music events, which are on the rise—and we see the tourism community placing considerable focus on this front. Strategically, we at Destination Zanzibar seek to promote tourism from the GCC. This is the region to which we are more directly connected, as it is just a five-hour flight from almost any GCC city to Zanzibar. While there are a few direct flights connecting Zanzibar with Paris or London, there are direct links with airlines such as Qatar Airways and Oman Air, or from destinations such as Dubai. This has increased the possibility of bringing in more tourists, including business tourists.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>You could describe the tourism industry in Zanzibar as mature, although for the right sort of investors, not yet entirely saturated.  There are still areas opening up in Zanzibar that have potential for investors in tourism properties, and these help local employment providing the staff, goods, and services necessary for their function. For example, there is certainly space in the market for smaller properties and owner-managed places, in particular private houses and villas. We have seen trends starting to move away from large hotels, particularly with the beach extensions of the Tanzanian safari industry. My concept was to build a number of small beach houses that could accommodate 15 guests as singles, couples, or small groups of families and friends. This concept presents a contrast from the more traditional family beach resorts and hotels but is by no means the only approach.  The good thing about the way the tourism industry in Zanzibar has developed is that there is something for everyone, from local style budget beach bungalows and dorms for volunteers and students to beautifully converted town houses in Stone Town and four- and five-star holiday resorts.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We started off with four schools, and gradually we built colleges around those four schools. Now, we have several colleges including a college dedicated to ICT, with focus on cyber crime and software development. One interesting example is that of student voting; students from the University of Dodoma developed an online system to facilitate ballot collection during in-house elections. Similarly, we are trying to draw linkages with the college of Natural Mathematical Sciences and the college of ICT. We are working with private sector companies such as Statoil to boost vocational capacity development in earth sciences, in line with the foreseeable future of Tanzania's employment profile, following the LNG discoveries in country. Our ambition for the next few years is to come up with programs that go hand in hand with the private sector in terms of the industries—programs that will support the government in terms of its industrialization goals. We have already started training some of the staff in the oil and gas industry; however, we feel that is not enough and are emphasizing vocational studies. Finally, we are looking to support the agriculture sector, again in line with the government's ambitions to grow exports and value addition.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In the faculty of science and technology, we have three or four programs that are relevant to the drive for industrialization. One of these is our ICT faculty, with strong courses on offer for technicians and ICT experts. We also offer a bachelor's and master's program in environmental studies. There is one other recent course we introduced, which is a bachelor's of science in energy studies, following the need to train personnel in various energy-related spheres, not just petroleum but also renewables. We are now in the third phase of implementing practical entrepreneurism, and we are going to train our people on how to create entrepreneurial projects and then test them to see if they work, closely following the Rwandan model that has been successful. Over the next 10-15 years, we want to see OUT become a role model for higher education in the country in terms of quality and efficiency. There was a global stigma about the inferiority of distance education, but this is gradually disappearing. It provides a greater level of flexibility for the students, and ensures synchronized learning. At the moment, we are facing challenges with fairly high-cost internet in Tanzania. However, the moment we make a breakthrough with lower-cost internet, and then OUT will see its operations really taking off.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>WThrough its core mission of teaching, research, and public service, UDSM has immensely contributed to boosting education in sciences and industry-related specialties. Indeed, it is difficult, and perhaps unfair, to talk of development in science and technology, industrialization, and innovation in Tanzania without acknowledging the indispensable role that UDSM has played. Through the UDSM Vision 2061, the university realized the importance of elevating its research as a key aspect of strengthening its teaching and public service effectiveness. In 2012, as part of restructuring, a new office of the Deputy Vice Chancellor for Research was established alongside the Directorates of Research and of Public Service. We have encouraged the introduction of centers of excellence and research centers with interdisciplinary research teams to focus on specific areas. We have also innovated professorial chairs to stimulate deep thinking and debates in certain areas, again to equip talented professors with the means to really tackle some of the problems that are facing Tanzania on an economic and socio-economic level. Similarly, we have redoubled our efforts to mobilize our associates, build links, and improve collaboration. We have jointly formed the African Research Universities alongside about 15 universities in Africa with a focus on practical and problem solving research.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Although Africa has seen several years of solid economic growth, this year both the continent and the Tanzanian beer market have been under pressure. Compared to 2016, the beer market is down about 8%, with spirits even more. The fact that a beer market is in decline is typically a reflection of how an economy is faring more generally. The business community in Tanzania is concerned, as we are not seeing the levels of growth one would expect in an emerging market. However, in the mid to long term, we see positive macro economic and socio demographic parameters and are optimistic with regards to the economic development of  Tanzania in general and the beverage market in particular. Beer is a rather inelastic product, and the development of the beer market is directly related to the availability of disposable income at the consumer level. With 70% of our raw materials coming from farms in Tanzania, a growing beer market will also allow us to expand our agricultural program and further support the development of local communities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2015, we established a plan to transition Luika from a completely surface operation into a blended underground-surface mine with a view to becoming predominantly underground in the future. There is a significant amount of investment needed in infrastructure to achieve such ambitious projects. In 2016, we undertook a financial restructuring that ensured we had all the funding needed in order to deliver. In the same year, we generated USD50 million of EBITDA from USD107 million of revenue—a high margin operation. For a small company such as ours, we invested substantially at New Luika with USD55 million in capital in 2016, 10% more than our EBITDA. We encountered some problems, however, following the government's decision to delay the outstanding VAT repayments. Without those funds, we had to stop investment in exploration and the development of the Singida Project.  To save the company, Shanta had to raise equity at a deep discount to the market, which reflects the significant sovereign risk that Tanzania now represents.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We sell cloves as a raw product in small quantity and in bulk to various markets. Our top consumers are India and Singapore. Aside from this, we also process clove stems to make clove stem oil. We have a distillery in Pemba where we make various types of essential oils—eucalyptus, lemongrass, and clove leave oil—that can be used in massage therapy. For this, our biggest market is the UK, though China is on the rise. Moreover, we have launched a product of branded spices called “Zanzibar Exotic.“ This is a selection of four spices—pepper, cinnamon, chili, and cloves—in our own packaging that we sell to local hotels, shops, and airports. For now, we are not entering the European market, though this is our eventual aim. Our products are all naturally organic, which lends itself well to the European market. We are undergoing contract negotiations with an GANEFRYD company from Denmark for organic products.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Power plants are not simple things; building multi-thousand MWs of new capacity requires huge sums of investment, as well as a long time to develop and construct. One needs long-term planning in place to make it happen in the following years. In terms of power generation, there is a model that has been applied in many countries around the world. Under this system, private companies invest in power generation and then operate the plant and sell electricity to the off-takers. This means the government and off-takers do not have to commit large sums of money to build the plant. There are developers that are willing to do this, and they can offer competitive terms and run plants efficiently. The IPP model has been extremely effective in many parts of the world. Regarding Tanzania in particular, Songas stands out as a fantastic success story for Tanzania. We have been operating since 2004 and produce 180MW of electricity. Our availability over the last few years has been around 96%, and our load factor is upwards of 85%, so whenever TANESCO asks us to generate, we can deliver reliable power. We are also inexpensive; in fact, we are the cheapest thermal power plant in East Africa.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Until a few years ago, Pan African Energy was the only gas supplier in Tanzania, but there are now a couple of new entrants on the market, and another is expected to enter the gas market in the next few years. Pan African Energy has, since 2004, been operating and further developing the Songo Songo Main gas pool. There is another pool, which we do not think communicates with ours, under the northeastern side of Songo Songo Island where Ndovu Resources, a subsidiary of Aminex PLC, produces a small amount of gas. This gas passes through the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation's (TPDC's) gas processing plant on Songo Songo Island and through TPDC's Mtwara-Dar es Salaam pipeline to TANESCO's Kinyerezi and Ubungo power plants. Looking ahead, we expect the demand for gas to continue growing, mainly due to the ongoing, phased construction of the Kinyerezi power plants, which will result in the installation of several hundred megawatts of new power generation capacity over the next several years. We also expect gas demand by industries to continue growing. Recent discoveries of more gas in the Ruvuma and Ruvu basins, the latter discovery being only about 70km west of Dar es Salaam, should give everyone some comfort that gas demand in the medium term may be met from onshore and near-shore gas reserves.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We started 2016 with three assets: Burundi, the Pangani basin, and Kilosa-Kilombero. Our first asset is block D in Burundi, now conceivably closer to an export terminal following the Tanzania-Uganda pipeline approval. We requested to withdraw from Pangani back in February 2016 because there was no technical or commercial reason to continue. At Kilosa-Kilombero, we completed the technical work and were at the stage of bringing in piping and long-lead items, leaving them in storage with a view to start drilling at the end the year. However, we faced delays with permits and then we entered the rainy season and thus decided to postpone by requesting a licensing extension. We now have a 75% participating interest, with the remaining 25% being held by Tata Petrodyne Limited. The plan is to drill in October or November 2017; in the interim, we will prepare the site, which will require a fair amount of civil work. The overall prospective resources net to Swala is currently estimated at 110 million barrels. That being said, one challenge here is the disconnect between participatory organizations and the level of overlapping bureaucracies one must deal with. However, we work closely with the TPDC, which has been our ally in lobbying for solutions to some of these challenges.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Husk is one of the world's leading off-grid utilities. Tanzania is a strategically important market for expansion. We are expanding our team size rapidly in Tanzania and plan to train over 50 technicians in 2018. We provide reliable power to rural communities and businesses, entirely from renewable energy sources—24 hours a day, seven days a week—at a price they can afford. By understanding how rural customers aspired to use power, we developed an energy solution that gave them the freedom and flexibility they desired. Making this possible in every village is at the heart of everything we do. We installed our first hybrid mini-grid sites powered by a Husk proprietary system of Solar PV-Biomass Gasification system-Battery back-up in Tanzania. We are also working on installing another mini-grid site at a feverish pace. In 2018, we plan to install 10 additional hybrid mini-grid sites and will target the installation of 150 such sites in the coming five years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started the Tanzania Renewable Energy Business Incubator (TAREBI) program to develop a sustainable incubator that can actually be profitable. In 2013, we partnered with Norges Vel, a Norwegian NGO, and established a pilot program in 2014. We bring in people with micro-businesses and support them to scale up and formalize their businesses. The function of an incubator is to support businesses when they are young, when they do not have strong risk assessment capabilities, networks, or financial resources. TAREBI provides links with mentors and financial institutions, and helps when developing business plans. We work with enterprises from various renewable energy segments, including five solar businesses, one in bio-gas, and one in the production of electricity from crop waste. Because renewables are not often seen as an attractive opportunity, one of the main barriers for companies entering the renewable energy sector is funding. We are working to change this and develop these businesses.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Since 2001, a great deal has happened. The pricing of solar worldwide has changed; new technologies and business models are constantly being introduced, both small scale and large scale; and many new players have emerged. At Ensol, we have embraced this learning culture, always improving ourselves and keeping in touch with what is happening worldwide. When we started, there were only two or three other solar power companies. Today, there are hundreds, perhaps even 200, operating both locally and internationally. In order to compete in the field, we have to focus on our niche to provide our customers with the right business model tailored to each and every one. We focus on institutions: schools, health facilities, community projects, solar irrigation projects, and so on, both in the public and private sector. We also do residential, though this amounts to only 10% of our portfolio, and we are primarily involved in large-scale projects. As we grow, we also focus on strengthening our presence in solar home systems, and we want to build partnerships with other big players worldwide.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our pilot project in Mafinga takes wood industry waste, carbonizes it, and combines it with binder and other ingredients to make charcoal briquettes. Around 80-90% of the population in Dar es Salaam uses wood or charcoal to cook, which has led to illegal deforestation on a massive scale. Our plant currently has capacity to produce 30-40 tons a day, meaning it barely scratches the surface of this demand; however, we are scalable, situated on a 22 acre site, with only 1.5-2 acres in use. The Mafinga area is central to Tanzania's lumber industry, with many mills in the area that currently burn their waste because they do not have a place to store it. We take their offcuts and sawdust and process these into briquettes. The gas generated from the carbonization process can be captured and used to run the furnace and the additional by-products—wood tar and wood vinegar—have many uses, as well, so it is an efficient use of a waste product. It is clearly necessary to find an alternative form of producing charcoal given that the market will not shrink. Africa produces 60% of the world's charcoal, and most of it is consumed within the continent.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The GDP growth figures in East Africa are attractive. It is a growing environment, and from a resource point of view it is under-exploited. Thus, we see a great deal of room to grow the resource base into an industrial powerhouse. Our major asset development project is the Bagamoyo Port. The project has taken more of a private investment participation route, while before we hoped to participate together with the government, now the government is confident that this project can be carried out by credible private investors. Therefore, we have put forward a comprehensive proposal and look forward to a positive response from the government in the coming weeks and months. We continue to look at other opportunities in the country, although our ticket size for investment tends to be quite large. At any one time in a deal flow, there are at least three to four opportunities that we are looking at. However, for one reason or another, we have not made any investments yet. In the meantime, Bagamoyo is a large project, and we do maintain focus on that and also expect the project to generate a number of other investment opportunities within the free zone. The Bagamoyo project will, therefore, be a perfect fit with Tanzania's objectives to spearhead industrialization.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our main activity is our work on the Tanzania integrated LNG development, based on three deep water blocks offshore, where dry gas has been found. Two of the blocks are operated by Shell and one by Statoil, and we will have a joint LNG onshore processing plant in Lindi, in Southern Tanzania. From here, LNG will be exported, and processed gas will be supplied to the domestic market. Unlike the oil discoveries of Tanzania's neighbors, such as Uganda and Kenya, which are relatively easy and fast to develop and bring to market, Tanzania's natural gas find is much more complex, and will lead to a much longer-term project. We are great at developing large and highly complex projects just like Tanzania's integrated LNG project; therefore, we are well aware that this is a long game. Once this project gets off the ground, further developments will be unlocked, particularly in domestic gas and further exploration. Shell is a much-diversified company and also has a “new energies“ arm, which is interested in Tanzania in terms of renewables, since we see considerable potential too on that front. In summary, we want to be here for the long term and succeed, which means there is work to do in the short term to make that happen.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Tanzania has an advantageous location. Dar es Salaam is one of a few major ports on the east side of Africa; more than that, it is also an entry point to the hinterland, bordering many countries, and a good few landlocked ones. This allows us to plan strategically for expansion, and the introduction of the company and its products to other countries in the region. The existence in Tanzania of the raw material we needed was also an important factor. Finally, there is the relative safety and stability of this market to consider, especially when compared to other countries in the region. Our intention over the next couple of years is to increase exports to 30% of our overall portfolio. We see ourselves increasing capacity in the future, and improving the skills of our people. We will invest in people and technology, and educate the market to use our products in the right way. This is why we have our school here where we offer training courses in construction. To date, Knauf has invested a total of around USD17 million in Tanzania, not an insubstantial amount. We came to Tanzania to invest and remain as a Tanzanian company. We are preparing young Tanzanians to be the next generation of the company.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Agah Group is divided into three arms: a brokerage (Agah Brokerage Firm), an investment consulting (Ava-e-Agah Company), and a financial technology firm (Asa). The main reason for our enviable position among brokers in Iran is the fact that we make investments in different sectors. In particular, our investments in IT and fintech infrastructure have been extremely beneficial for us. We have an exclusive online trading platform, a tailored solution that has helped us move above the competition. The knowledge and awareness about capital markets in Iran is underdeveloped, and there is a lack of education and information about the financial industry in general. We are the market leader in training and educating people on the Iranian capital markets. To date there have been a few requests from foreign financial institutions to come to Iran and establish their own operations here. We always tell them that they need a powerful regulated local partner. Doing business in Iran, like every other place, has its own sets of rules and considerations. Companies need people who understand the language of doing business here. Also they have to gain access to the vast network of business connections in the country. Having the right domestic partner who knows the international literature not only saves them countless hours of time, but also decreases their setup costs.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our strategy is not to take a margin of the market, but to expand the market itself. This is also the strategy of the Securities and Exchange Organization (SEO). The Iranian capital market consists of three parts: the mercantile or commodities market, securities and OTC, and energy. In each market we have a plan. In the commodities market, we plan to provide the products that have the potential to be in the exchange market. We are also trying to use the new instruments that are provided by the SEO to expand the futures market. We focus on gathering our innovations in the IT sector and also in training our clients. We have workshops to train our clients in buying and selling securities on the exchange market, and we also have platforms to teach them how to use future contracts. In commodities, we want to show them export commodities such as steel, petrochemical products, and agricultural products. After the lifting of sanctions, many clients came to Iran to negotiate contracts, but there are some limitations. We are trying to find solutions to facilitate investment in Iran. The country has export advantages and most clients are investment companies that are here to buy the export products like petrochemical and oil products. We are establishing three foreign offices to attract investors to buy securities.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are 107 brokers in Iran, and our place is fluctuating between one and 10. We are specialized in block trading in Iran. When entities want to trade large amounts of shares, or sometimes significant stakes in a company, we broker the transaction. Next to this, we are active in asset management and have a mutual fund, a fixed-income fund, a market-making fund, and a charity fund. We are also working on the development of electronic trading modules, and will launch this new part of the company in a few months. We also have some new products in our portfolio management. Even though the number of brokers and competition is extremely high, there is little interest in mergers and acquisitions at this moment. Behgozin Brokerage is part of the Mostazafan Foundation, together with another firm named Sina Brokerage. We work on the stock exchange, while Sina Brokerage works on the commodities exchange. We are planning a merger with Sina Brokerage. Other mergers or acquisitions could be on the table for the future. I see increased appetite in foreign investors, but we have some technical problems such as in transferring money through the banking system. Foreign investors need to adapt to the Iranian market, and we in Iran need to match the systems and standardize our activities, which takes time.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Doha Festival City is difficult to categorize. Essentially, we are an entertainment and leisure destination that includes a large retail component. The type of entertainment we provide is diversified, and that is what differentiates us from all the other primarily retail malls. We have innovative attractions such as the first snow park in Qatar and the first Angry Birds theme park in the world. We also have two other unique theme parks: Virtuocity, a physical gaming theme park, and Juniverse, which is based on an edutainment concept where children combine entertainment with education in a unique setting. It is set on a space station in the year 2030 when Qatar will have realized its National Vision. It is a fantastic concept that ties in well with the Qatari community's vision and the whole tourism drive here.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>United Developers' owners saw an opportunity to build the next quantum leap in retail developments in Lusail. With their experience traveling throughout the world, they all agreed that Paris and in particular the Place Vendí´me represented the epicenter of fashion, luxury, and retail. Therefore, bringing a little bit of Paris to Arabia was the idea that they initially developed for the project. However, the effort was to not be a literal translation of Paris, so we did a lot of studies with Parisian architects to understand the language of Paris across the spectrum of time. That led us to develop a language with the appropriate proportions, sizes, and presentation to be adapted to Qatar. Subsequently, we took this idea on a roadshow to Europe where we met the majority of the luxury brands in Paris, Milan, Dubai, and Cannes to get their opinion about the project and got incredibly positive feedback.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Alhazm project itself came from Doha. Everything is done in-house, including the design, planning, and management of the project, through our companies Al Emadi Enterprises, Stones, Fire, Solar, and Etisaq. Regarding partnerships with international brands and restaurants, we aim to be very strong and selective. We feel there is a shortage of fine dining in Doha outside of the luxury hotels. What's more, many of the brands in Doha have already been here for a while and are virtually the same. Nothing is different. Malls are malls everywhere you go; the layouts might be different but that is all. That is why when it comes to the F&amp;B companies, they want to be part of this project because it is not a mall, and it is not a food court. It is a project that everyone wants to be associated with. The expectation is that Alhazm will be the top destination in Qatar and will make our position known to everyone here and in the GCC.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our motive is not to be competitive in the retail sector. Our ambition and focus are to bring a whole new experience to Qatar, one that the region has yet to experience. We want to be unique and stand out in every manner possible; for that we have incorporated fascinating ideas and brought in new concepts to be implemented for the first time ever in the region. The rooftop lounge will have a wide range of dining options under the sky alongside a dancing water fountain that will enthrall guests. The old souq is another traditional feature that will give the mall an ancient medieval feeling. Our strategy is to bring in a wide variety of shopping offers and make Tawar Mall a groundbreaking shopping destination. To do so, we are bringing in over 300 retail units, of which more than 60 are renowned flagship stores from around the world entering Qatar for the first time.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>QIS is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. Back in 1977, the school started as a joint venture between the Griffin family and its current owner, Sheikh Khalid bin Ali bin Ahmed Al-Thani's family. The running of the school has been British ever since it began as a nursery. It grew from a small villa to a purpose-built school campus for 1,900 students. Our biggest strength is the quality of teaching, thanks to our rigorous selection of staff. It is also a family-friendly school; we are now dealing with second-generation students, which brings an added dimension to the relationships within the school community. Our mantra is that “learning comes first,“ and our dedicated staff's passion for learning and the enjoyment of our students make QIS a happy school. Our accreditation reflects our philosophy that learning never ends. The worst thing that can happen to anyone in their profession is to become stale and think that they do not need to continue developing. In this sense, our OLEVI accreditation offers a variety of training opportunities that we can use with all staff to further develop and enhance their skills as facilitators of learning. We work constantly with our teachers on training and development and always strive to better ourselves and practices.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, the RGS was approached by a number of potential partners around the world. However, what was being presented did not align with our international strategy. Al Qamra Holding had a different proposition to what a lot of UK independent schools experience when they go overseas. The chairman wanted to contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030 and suggested the formation of a partnership in order to bring our expertise and quality of education to Qatar. This is really what the RGS was looking for: a genuine partnership that was not simply based on bringing our name to the GCC. Qatar's overall education sector is still in its infancy, which was another attraction for us to provide a higher standard of education. With over 500 years' history of education in the UK, we will be able to realize the vision of the chairman, which is to be the best school in Qatar and, eventually, the region. With the academic and curriculum support from the RGS in the UK and the facilities and resources we have in Qatar, we will be able to realize this.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Bellevue Education is a UK-based education group with 15 schools in the UK and one in Switzerland that formed a joint venture with Qatar to create the Swiss International School of Qatar (SISQ). Qatar was looking to open a Swiss school, and Bellevue Education has a reputable school in Switzerland called Surval Montreux, which was the basis of this partnership. Several years ago, an agreement was reached to build the school, after which Qatar would hand it over to Bellevue Education to run it using the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum. We aim to be a truly international school with a broad education across the spectrum that includes plenty of local Qatari families, as well as other Arab families and foreign communities. There will be around a 40% Arab, 60% non-Arab students split in order to protect English as the language of the playground, which is crucial to the success of the school. When we opened in January 2017 we had a total of 29 children of 12 different nationalities. We currently have 250 children registered to join us in September 2017 of 43 nationalities. Likewise, our 35 staff members, the majority of which have IB teaching experience, are from all over the world, as SISQ is going through the accreditation process.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We offer degrees in four of the engineering disciplines that are offered on our main campus: petroleum, chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineering. At the branch campus, we have six programs in total, because we also have a science program to teach courses associated with engineering degrees, in addition to a liberal arts program. We also offer a master's degree in chemical engineering. We are proud to have strong ties with HBKU. We collaborate with HBKU in helping teach some undergraduate computer engineering programs. We are also working together on their executive programs, with some of our faculty teaching them. However, we also collaborate a lot with HBKU in a variety of different research programs and projects. We are currently working on a dual PhD. program in chemical engineering on our side and sustainable systems on their side, so that graduates would receive one degree from Texas A&amp;M and the other from HBKU.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We were sought out by the Qatar Foundation (QF) after a global search for a top-tier educational institution with which to partner.  At our first commencement, HH Sheikha Moza bint Nasser stated there was a strong correlation between her vision of the QF's development and the field of design. We opened a branch campus in Qatar in 1998 because it offered a unique opportunity to expand our reach and further our vision to be a premier urban, public research university distinguished by its commitment to the success of a diverse student body, research, and discovery and to the global engagement of students, faculty, and staff that transforms lives and communities. As Her Highness attested at our 10th anniversary, the partnership between VCU and the QF is a special cornerstone of the QF. We were invited because we are the number one public school of arts in the US, and many more have now followed us to Qatar.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been busy this past year at Stenden. We are currently the only provider of tourism and hospitality management and education programs in Qatar. We also have international business and management studies programs and offer business administration bachelor's degrees. We currently have 350 students. About 40% of our students are Qatari and 60% are foreigners or children of expats living here. Over the past year, we tried to improve the quality of our academic programs by introducing a new quality assurance mechanism by adding a few tools to satisfy our stakeholders, and the positive results are being seen now. We have done a lot of research, even though we are not a major research university. We also established a center for business research, which currently organizes seminars for the academic community in Doha. Beyond that, we have also begun the process of building a new campus, which we will move to in three years.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We care about creating the professionals that will work in the public or private sectors, bring our cultural heritage to life, and lay the foundations of a wider cultural heritage industry that blends into the wider tourism offering that Qatar is developing as part of its economic diversification program. The two masters' programs we offer are library and information studies and museum and gallery practice. The first is about creating the physical infrastructure through which knowledge is shared. Essentially, it is about knowledge management and how you use, and harvest, information available in the form of books or electronic information in a manner that is made readily accessible for the professionals to consume. It is about creating an infrastructure of high quality professionals who are able to project and communicate the value of cultural heritage, and culture in general, to the local population who are extremely interested in heritage and identity. It is also to increase the number of visitors who come to Qatar.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>What distinguishes CIS is the unique approach it offers for Islamic studies. CIS represents a major shift away from the traditionalist way and methods, adopted by conventional universities. We have been offering Islamic studies within the framework of the social sciences and the interdisciplinary nature of the sciences. Another distinguishing feature is the language of instruction. We are one of the few bilingual Islamic colleges, in both English and Arabic. The concentrations of Qur'anic Studies and Fiqh are offered in Arabic, while the rest in English. We combine modern methodologies with the Islamic heart and spirit. As the first homegrown faculty within the Qatar Foundation, CIS offers postgraduate studies in Islamic disciplines to Qatari students, as well as an international student body. In addition, CIS is also an integral part of Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU). We work to assist in the mission of transforming Qatar into a knowledge-based society and to make this country a leader in science and research in contemporary Islamic studies.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>PORR has a long history of over 145 years' experience in the field of construction. It is one of the leading contractors in Austria and the oldest company registered on the Austrian stock exchange. We had Middle Eastern operations until the 1970s, completing several railway projects in countries like Iran. However, our projects worldwide range from building construction to civil engineering, energy, traffic, and tunnel construction, right through to environmental engineering and project development. We decided to come back to the region in 2011 and enter the GCC emerging markets by opening an office in Qatar. Our success in the region has been based on strategic partnerships with local companies. PORR has a great deal of expertise from 120 years in tunneling and railway construction, having completed major projects such as the Vienna Metro. Being awarded the Green Line of Doha Metro was a major international milestone for PORR—the largest contract in its history, valued at USD2.2 billion. We formed a joint venture with two regional partners and brought in our experience in tunneling, which was the driving factor to get this project awarded. We are supporting Qatar as it inches closer to achieving its National Vision 2030.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>ECG is an Egyptian-based company founded in Cairo in 1969 as an international consultancy. Today, we are ranked 100th among design consultants worldwide according to the Engineering News Record (ENR). We have permanent offices in 13 countries. We work all over the Middle East, as well as in Europe and Asia as far as Uzbekistan, the US, and Africa. We cover all the different engineering disciplines, from master planning up to detailed design. We have worked on more than 20 airports across the world, including the Cairo and Alexandria airports. We have also done major infrastructure work such as water and wastewater treatment plants, not to mention hospitals, hotels, towers, and sports facilities. ECG has been in Qatar since 2002 and has completed more than 140 projects here, such as the Lekhwiya Sport Stadium in Doha. We are also part of the 2022 FIFA World Cup scheme under the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy. Under this we are building 65 football training pitches for the World Cup and the master plan for Aspire Zone II, which covers over 1 million sqm. We are also working on the energy centers for three of the stadiums, including major infrastructure components.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Hill International has been in Qatar since 2004, when the country started to have a competitive construction industry. In that period, The Pearl and other iconic buildings in Doha were being built. As a group present in 47 countries, we typically enter a market when it already has a developed construction market, as we are a project management consultant generally involved in complex projects. We are among the top players in Qatar's construction sector and have been involved in every single major project considered iconic. Our scope of services covers all projects from inception until delivery handover, and we are involved in every sector except oil and gas. We handle infrastructure, residential, and commercial projects. In our 12 years in Qatar, we have been involved in 40 projects. We are providing project management services to the green line of the Doha Metro, with 100 staff, and to the Lusail Light Railway Transit System (LRT) in a more project oversight scope. For the latter, we are focusing on the project management functions such as planning and contracts, bringing in top senior people to macro-manage overall project implementation. In the case of Lusail City, we have received many requests to be part of some of its developments, most of them in the commercial and hospitality sectors.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Contraco is a local grade “A“ main contractor established over 50 years ago and has been in the construction business since 1990. During this time, we have contributed to the development of infrastructure across a wide range of sectors. In regard to commercial developments, we built the first mall in Qatar, which has now been transformed into a ministerial building, as well as the Royal Plaza Mall. In the healthcare industry, we built the first private hospital in Qatar, Al Ahli Hospital. As a result of our joint venture with Austria's Vamid Engineering, we were able to deliver the hospital ready to be opened, with all the medical equipment and even the training for the client's employees. When it comes to sport facilities, we completed two football stadiums, each with a capacity of 25,000 people, and two multipurpose sport halls with capacity for 3,500 spectators. In 1996, we completed the Qatar Foundation's first project, which was a senior school. We also built the Liberal Arts &amp; Science Building in partnership with a local contractor.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>SASCO Group is a business conglomerate of 33 companies, the activities of which expand across every construction-related field. We have a contracting division subdivided into steel works, granite and marble, carpentry, GRC, landscaping, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP). Our other divisions cover trading, electrical works, building materials, and door automation systems (Dorspec). Additionally, we have a fully integrated glass-processing division (Dallas Glass) and a specialized cladding division (Alubond, Ecofaçade, Specialized Cladding). SASCO is specialized in providing solutions in the façade industry. Moreover, the Imperial Trading Contracting Company (ITCC) is the backbone of our business—a certified grade-A contractor that takes responsibility for executing large-scale projects. We provide every solution for the construction industry and are committed to delivering high-quality products using European brands. SASCO is the exclusive supplier for many European brands in the Qatari market. This has transformed our reputation in the construction sector into one of the best fully integrated conglomerates.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Hassanesco was established in 1976 in Qatar as a grade-A contractor. We have experience in residential and commercial construction for both private and government clients. Projects like commercial and residential high-rises, administrative compounds, and private upscale housing and villas are in our portfolio, although we also have a wide expertise in schools and training facilities. The population of Qatar will certainly increase in the long term, especially with the 2022 FIFA World Cup. We are a key player in the development of infrastructure in the country. In this regard, we established our own material supply lines and support structures. We have two ready-mix concrete plants, a cement block factory, and fabrication shops for both carpentry and aluminum materials. Besides the construction market, we have other divisions that complement our portfolio, such as travel agency services, wood trading, infrastructure management, and a car service center.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to support the reputation of Hamad International Airport (HIA) and its economic output via our services delivery. Regarding HIA's expansion plan, it has always been a part of FMM's vision to enter into an agreement to enlarge airport services. We strongly believe that our worldwide expertise as well as our three years' experience in the local market will support FMM to anticipate and fulfill the needs of an increasing number of passengers. FMM's aim is to become a leading provider of total facilities management in Qatar by means of best-in-class practices and our strong reputation. To support this vision we are working to expand our activities in sectors like transport, plants, sports facilities, and hospitals. In the last two years, we have developed a solid pipeline of submissions for clients such as Qatar Petroleum, the Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy, Hamad Medical Corporation, and various ministries.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We created Eulen Middle East in February 2016 since we were already working in the UAE and Qatar had many opportunities. We have extensive experience in ports, cruise terminals, and airports. We are aware of the new projects planned in Qatar, and our intention is to bid for them and use all our experience to become providers of these services. We are hopeful that our extensive experience will enable us to become one of the main players in these contracts. With regard to the different sectors, we are starting to provide services in shopping centers, but we can also do so in any business segment. We have extensive experience in the hospitality, industrial, health, and telecommunications sectors, among others. Our scope covers security in addition to facility management. Our strategy in the Middle East is to grow gradually and focus on Qatar and the UAE.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are not too many major players in Qatar's FM sector, and we have a full portfolio of integrated facilities management and can provide maintenance, energy , subcontractor, and asset management. In 2011, we were awarded FM provisions for all infrastructure and services for Lusail Marina Phase 1A, which is part of Lusail City, and for eight high-end restaurants. In 2013, we were awarded FM services for the Al Faisal Tower and Dareen Tower as well as a five-year contract to provide total FM services for Al Jazi Real Estate properties. Eventually, every sector will need to outsource their FM services and will need FM providers to cater to their needs. The retail sector needs FM provisions immediately, as well as the governmental, commercial, and education sectors. Between Qatar Luxury, Ali Bin Ali Group, and other major retailers, we have around 100 retail shops. Last April, we were awarded total FM services for Lagoona Mall.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Mawaqif is a joint services company between Qatar's Diar and France's Indigo, which specializes in the design and operation of car parks and parking facilities. The combination of Indigo's international experience and our local knowledge in operating car parks positions us as the leader in the market. According to our agreement with Msheireb Properties to manage parking facilities at Downtown Doha, we will operate over 10,000 parking spots over six basement levels. The Downtown Doha car park will be one of the largest car parks worldwide, with 22 access ramps and more than 70 payment points. There is no other parking operator in the country that can take on a project of this magnitude. As it is located in the heart of the city, it will be a multipurpose car park for residents, offices, or nearby museums. This facility marks a milestone in our Qatari operations, and we are proud to have been selected to operate it.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We entered the market 15 years ago without physically being in Qatar. The GCC is an expat-dominated region, and at that time, we had our first clients in the oil and gas and transport sectors. Our clients in the expat community requested we provide coverage in countries like Qatar, the UAE, and Oman. Our client base has been gradually expanding over the last five years because our contribution to the market is relatively unique. We are the only global insurance company in Qatar that can provide cover in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. When I arrived in Qatar in 2009, SEHA was supposed to be launched soon. However, it was not launched until 2013 in a phased approach, until it was finally cancelled in 2015. This process raised awareness in the market for medical and health insurance, which helped us to grow our business. Therefore, any further government insurance plan will have a positive impact on the awareness and ultimately on demand, and Allianz Worldwide Care is well positioned to capture a portion of the market. Regarding the new insurance scheme, I think there might be an announcement before the end of 2017 when it comes to cover for Qataris, and it will be rolled out to the whole population in further phases.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>MetLife was one of the first insurance companies to be established in Qatar, and we have contributed significantly to the growth of the life insurance market here. We focus on providing a sophisticated set of benefits and excellent customer service in line with global standards. MetLife has built a reputation for delivering market-leading financial solutions that can be tailored to meet the unique savings and protection needs of individuals, families, and businesses of all sizes. We currently operate in the individual life, accident and health, and employee benefits segments. With the recent changes in the insurance landscape and the commitment of the government toward its Vision 2030, all these segments are expected to grow. We look forward to partnering with the government as it designs a replacement scheme now that the National Health Insurance Company's SEHA scheme has been eliminated. Qatar offers great potential for healthcare insurance, and multinational companies like us are able to bring in best practices from around the world to benefit Qatar's residents. We also look forward to well-designed insurance regulations. Such rules written in consultation with industry experts can underpin and drive long-term sustainable growth for the sector. In this regard, we would like to commend the Qatar Central Bank for issuing the executive regulations and engaging the industry in dialog.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Daman UAE and Munich Health have been jointly developing a presence within the region for a long time, and in 2010 we decided that Qatar should be part of this development. We outlined a business plan and market strategy, and officially started operations in 2013. At that time, Qatar was a small but incrementally growing health insurance market. The prospective reforms to introduce compulsory health insurance was boosting the segment, so these were the key motivations to enter the market. We have recently had strong development, doubling our membership since I arrived to the company in July 2015. The team has done a great job in creating the fundamentals of this company in Qatar. From my understanding, the Qatar National Vision 2030 states that mandatory health insurance will be introduced for the entire population. As Qatar is one of the world's fastest-developing countries and wants to be seen as a role model for the rest of the world, the introduction of mandatory health insurance makes a great deal of sense. It means securing access to healthcare and ensuring its quality, equity, and affordability. SEHA was a good initiative to start with, but I do not expect that we will see any development during 2017 for the new scheme.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There has been some tightening of liquidity in Qatar's banking sector given the effect of lower oil prices on the economy. However, the Commercial Bank has always maintained a conservative loan-to-deposit ratio and we are also diversifying in other areas of banking such as overseas deposits. In line with our strategic reshaping plan to build sustainable earnings, we raised our CET1 Capital through a successful QAR1.5-billion rights issue in January 2017, which demonstrates the confidence investors and shareholders have in our strategy and approach. This, together with an asset revaluation of over QAR1 billion, will help ensure our CET1 Capital is well above the regulatory minimum required by the Qatar Central Bank. With the Qatari economy being one of the strongest in the GCC, the overall picture for the banking sector is healthy. The government has sizeable stakes in most of the local banks and can support the sector in case of future economic challenges, which always sits high on rating agencies' minds. There are many banks in Qatar relative to the size of the market and the potential three-bank merger is part of a consolidation trend throughout the world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The country has a positive risk rating based on expected continued strong growth performance, high levels of wealth, planned reforms, and a comparatively lower vulnerability to the oil price. These factors cleared the way for debt issuance to raise reserves and give more leeway in spending. The country remains steadfast in its investment in infrastructure projects and will continue to deliver on the major projects such as Doha Metro, Hamad Port, and upgrades to a large number of roads. I do believe that structural reforms are at the top of the agenda in Qatar. Greater efficiency in the public sector has been a focus and resulted in a number of activities that will improve productivity over the longer term. The recent announcement of the merger of RasGas and Qatargas is significant and will most likely be the beginning of similar events in future. Other larger public offices have seen restructuring and operational effectiveness for the improved use of resources. The introduction of VAT is a significant step in the right direction. There is a great deal to consider in order to optimize the economic potential of the country and the wider region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our international offices are meant for building relationships with other countries. Over the years, we have built up a network of offices that support global trade, which has helped us in building equities around the international arena. Therefore, Doha Bank is well known in Europe and Asia because we have had a physical presence for a long time. We are well established in financial capitals like Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Our presence is required to source the relationship between Qatar and the world and support trade finance. There is an evident financial stability in Qatar, if we look at the main indicators. We have a projected growth of 3.4%, according to the IMF. Having said that, with 17 banks operating in the market, the exercises of industry consolidation such as market acquisitions, absorptions, or mergers are a logical fit. We will have interesting opportunities for business consolidation with the changing dynamics of the global market. This is why three banks are merging in Qatar, and there could be more to come. The shareholders want to see a sustainable performance. It is an opportunity that everyone has to look at objectively, as it is logical and sensible.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We were invited by the Qatar Foundation to become its first European partner and to become the first member to join the Qatar Foundation Management and Research Center. HEC Paris has two degree programs that contribute to the development of the country in terms of Qatarization, complying with the country's development pillars and educating future leaders. Among our graduates is the CEO of Qatar Foundation itself. Partnering with Qatar Foundation was a great opportunity for both HEC Paris and Qatar. We feel honored to contribute to the sustained development of Qatar. Of our 252 graduates, 185 are Qatari nationals, and, of this year's intake so far, 90% is self-funded. There has been a shift from being sponsored to being self-financing. There is an understanding that HEC Paris is not only about career advancement, but also about personal development. We are not a business or a company, but an institution that helps people grow and develop. At the same time, we have worked closely with companies to train their employees and managers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In the past three to five years, entrepreneurship has become a buzzword. Five years ago, the Qatari SME sector was below the regional average by almost 20%, but is now growing quickly. We focus on a younger cohort of Qataris and embed these ideas in their mindsets. Entrepreneurship is often unknown as a concept amongst students, or they have many misconceptions. The key, though, is starting this process as early as possible. We now start from elementary school and embed these entrepreneurial ideas in students of six and seven. We start at a young age, and the education continues to develop until the student is old enough to transform that idea into an actual business. This is when we seek the help of different partners like the Qatar Development Bank (QDB), the Qatar Business Incubation Center (QBIC), or the Qatar Science &amp; Technology Park (QSTP), which are all part of this process. They have created a system out of scratch to develop and support entrepreneurs, and over the last five years things have changed dramatically here.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are seven schools under the Qatar Foundation's umbrella, and in 2013, we saw a need for a professional development center for its teachers. However, we subsequently realized we needed to be open to all schools in Qatar. We started cooperating with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, which has its own professional development center. We started a pilot this year with 65 teachers, and in 2018 we will run programs on a regular basis. Those programs are based on 10-hour module ranging from teaching and learning English, mathematics, and early childhood. For the Arabic module, we use certified trainers from the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. There are almost 14,000 teachers in Qatar, and our objective is to train more than 1,000 teachers per annum in these specific areas. We aim to create a collaborative framework where the teaching community discusses innovative ideas, applies them in the classroom, and comes back to analyze the results. We often invite speakers and trainers to discuss innovative learning methods with schools.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>QFBA is the education arm of Qatar's financial sector. Our main purpose is to invest in human capital, one of the most important pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030. In the manufacturing industry, the equipment is the asset; and in the real estate sector, the land and property are the assets. However, in the financial industry intellectual people are the assets. Therefore, we are investing in people with a focus on the financial sector. We are raising the capability of those who are working in the industry, thereby improving the internal capacity of the financial institutions in Qatar. We offer training, coaching, certifications, as well as consultations to the industry and people operating on it.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been successful in malls, which is the best performing segment of our portfolio, by offering our own concept. We understand the market well and know how to combine items to serve the customer best. We do not fall into the trap of opening stores everywhere; we choose several malls and focus on them. We will wait until all of the malls under construction have opened and will decide which other malls to pursue next. We reduced the number of stores we planned to open to analyze the market and select the most successful destinations. There is no winning formula; each mall has its charm, and either the store works or it does not. Our focus will not be in continuing with small monobrand stores. The shopping of the future is moving toward e-commerce, so when it comes to physical presence our plans are to move to multi-brand stores. That underpins store concepts with shoppers' experiences. To be successful at the retail sector a mall has to be more than just a shopping destination; it has to add experience and entertainment.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Al Sawari Holding looks at a number of factors when considering entering a new sector. We need to know what the future prospects are for that sector in terms of stability and security in Qatar and abroad. We also try to apply our vision that the selected activity has to benefit our community and the region. At the end of the day, a business will not succeed unless it adds something to the community. One new sector we decided to enter was technology. We started investing in e-commerce and opened a new company in 2016. We aim to establish a technology foundation for other businesses to build on. In this sense, e-commerce allows other companies to enter the technology sector, and we have been helping clients to establish an online presence and pursue additional means of trading. One of the reasons for moving into this sector is to promote intellectual property and a knowledge-based economy. These types of non-tangible value activities are something new for Qatar, which is still mainly a resource and physical asset-based economy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ali Bin Ali Group has been working in sync with Qatar's economic ambitions and plans since its inception in 1945. The group has always taken initiatives to calibrate its growth plans with those of the country. It began with a vision to provide quality international products and services to the people of Qatar. Today, our group is one of the largest retail and distribution companies in Qatar. Our unrivaled knowledge of the Qatari market keeps us ahead in an environment of phenomenal growth in the country. The group has evolved and grown in response to Qatar's diversifying requirements. With diverse revenue streams, Ali Bin Ali Group is now a prime example of the strategic planning that has been done in Qatar to ensure long-lasting success. All these efforts have created an unbeatable synergy with Qatar's economic progress. Qatar's recent focus on enhancing cooperation between private and public sectors has created diverse business opportunities for privately owned companies. We look for business activities that support the government's initiative to ensure future development of the country.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have many sectors, but the major one is the real estate sector, where we play an important role in Qatar and outside the country. We have diversified real estate investment opportunities; for example, in Qatar we have many real estate properties and commercial ventures. In the US, we own the Marriot Hotel in Minneapolis. We have a commercial building in the UK and also one in Paris. We are trying to expand inside and outside of the country. We have industrial sectors including three factories. For agriculture, we have many businesses, including three farms in Qatar that produce animal feed. We are working in this area with the government according to the strategic vision of Qatar to have a food security policy. We have a construction company in the process of building mini towers in The Pearl and Lusail, and two logistics and facility management companies, one in transportation and another one in the field of facility management. We have governmental contracts with two companies; one with national Qatar Cement and the other is working with primary healthcare.</p>]]></sections31>

Observers are aware that the measures and modernization efforts undertaken by the State to develop Qatar's legislative and regulatory frameworks aim to accelerate the participation of the private sector in the development process. In this context, the state has launched several initiatives aimed at facilitating the transfer of projects from the government to the private sector and encouraging this sector to participate actively in investment projects currently under development, which will serve to benefit the long-term economic performance of the State of Qatar.</p><h4>Dr. Khalid, could you give us an overview of the new PPP law that the Ministry of Economy and Commerce has drafted?</h4><p>Dr. Khalid Al-Derbasti The participation of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce in this event is in line with its efforts to bolster the contribution of the private sector in order to foster economic growth by laying the foundations for PPP projects. In this context, the government has formed the Technical Committee to Stimulate Private Sector Participation in Economic Development Projects, which will contribute to the accomplishment of the state's economic diversification policy. The committee has launched several initiatives to attract investment in vital infrastructure projects.</p><h4>What has Ashghal's experience been in partnering with the private sector, and what can be learned for further PPP projects?</h4><p>Eng. Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah From an overall perspective, Ashghal plays a major role in order to make Qatar a friendly country for PPPs. In the first two quarters of 2017, we signed more than USD1 billion worth of projects with private contractors and consultants. Today, there are many opportunities in the market to see the private sector investing more into public projects. We are exploring a number of opportunities in sewage treatment; we are pursuing a BOT with a private player to build a sewage treatment plant. By 2020, Qatar will be a hub for international investments in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Qatar will invest around USD20 billion in infrastructure in the next five to seven years. Therefore, PPP projects that were unsuccessful in the past could happen in the future. We are in talks with the Ministry of Economy and Commerce to assess in which sectors the private sector can play a larger role than today.</p><h4>How could Qatar mitigate the challenges of its land leasing regulation in order to promote project financing?</h4><p>Fahad Rashid Al-Kaabi Many improvements have been made by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce since the creation of the technical committee for the promotion of private sector engagement in economic development projects. This committee is looking for opportunities in a PPP model, and Manateq has a key role to play in this regard. We developed a creative PPP project for worker accommodation that is currently being tendered. The same model applies for building warehouses, which is an essential facility for the development of the logistics sector. In this sense, we have commissioned a USD220-million investment project called Bu Sulba Warehousing Park to Gulf Warehousing Company (GWC), a local private company. There are also three similar projects being commissioned this year. In addition, we are developing the hospitality offer in Ras Bufontas Special Economic Zone; we are looking for private investors to design and build five hotels and apartment-hotels as well as jointly finance and run them for 25 years. However, most of the projects face difficulties when local investors are looking at financing them.</p><h4>As a local private player, what are MILAHA's expectations on the new PPP law?</h4><p>Abdulrahman Essa Al-Mannai Qatar has the ambition to offer PPP opportunities across sectors that currently do not exist in the country. This requires a new regulations and the government has done a fantastic job in its development.</p><p>There have been strategic sectors earmarked for PPP opportunities such as healthcare or civil infrastructure, which can raise a great deal of interest from both local and international investors. Our expectation is that PPPs can facilitate those investments, and the key is to balance the risk and control in these projects between the public and the private sector. If those projects allow foreign investment, another critical factor is to encourage local content whether it is human capital or local supply. Unfortunately, I have seen good examples internationally of successful PPP projects where the entire local economy has been bypassed and the products and services have been brought in from overseas. For a local maritime logistics company like MILAHA, we have high expectations of seeing prospects across the logistics supply chain. The sector's contribution to the GDP is still significantly below what developed economies have; therefore, I see a great opportunity with the upcoming PPP law and we will be keen to participate in those projects.</p><h4>From an investment banking perspective, how will QNB address the financial issues mentioned by Manateq and MILAHA?</h4><p><span></span>Mira Al-Attiyah QNB is the largest lender in Qatar and the MENA region, and we will always stand behind the private sector when it comes to public projects. We played a key role in financing government infrastructure projects like Ras Bufontas, worth USD415 million, among others. As the country is putting a great deal of effort into empowering the private sector, the focus should be on private investment financing. In this regard, the private sector wants certainty surrounding cash flows. It wants to enter into a partnership and be able to repay such an investment. At QNB Capital, we play a crucial role in consulting and advising both parties to choose the right partnership model and we pay close attention to the cash flow of these projects. Furthermore, when we seek international private investment, the first question that arises is what PPP framework does Qatar have. Therefore, policies are important in this public-private relationship. The current macroeconomic environment provides the private sector with an opportunity to become further engaged with the government. This can be achieved through PPPs, but we should develop a flexible legislation that takes into consideration all partnership models, and this will ensure stability and transparency to protect the private sector.</p><h4>As Qatar's SME bank, QDB plays a key role in ensuring in-country value. What is your vision on PPPs?</h4><p><span></span>Hamad Khamis Al-Kubaisi In the context of PPP arrangements, QDB's role is to support SMEs in order to reduce the value leakage outside the country. We see a great opportunity in PPPs to empower SMEs and see them participating in national megaprojects. Our vision is to create a cluster of small suppliers that can support the main private players like MILAHA in those types of projects. We have had many success stories on this regard; for example, we introduced five SMEs into Qatar Shell's supply chain in order to create local content. Furthermore, we are in talks with the Ministry of Finance to ease SME access to public procurements. We want to engage these SMEs with the largest government entities. Therefore, in these last two years we organized an event called Moushtarayat, which aims to showcase opportunities for SMEs in major governmental projects. The objective is to prepare these SMEs to participate in those projects directly, as a subcontractor or as part of the supply chain. This would really create in-country value for Qatar.</p><h4>What are the major governmental projects that offer this cash flow certainty that the private sector seeks?</h4><p><span></span>Abdulrahman Essa Al-Mannai Some projects and sectors are risk controlled for the private sector because they are being supported or subsidized by the government directly or indirectly, which provides public services. There are successful examples in the electricity sector, where there is a framework put in place to provide the economic cost of providing services, and the government of Qatar has a strong financial standing making such projects bankable. In non-subsidized sectors where the government seeks to have regulatory control or develop the economy in that sector, there are other mechanisms of support like minimum throughput and off-take.</p><p><span></span>Hamad Khamis Al-Kubaisi The main challenge for small local investors is project financing. It usually becomes difficult for them to convince the banks to finance their project unless they have certain assets and a strong financial history that can support them. QDB is encouraging other banks by providing them with guarantees through Al Dhameen program. Besides, QDB also directly finances many types of projects.</p><p><span></span>Eng. Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah We have been applying the BOT model in must-have projects within sectors like power generation for years, and it has been successful. We have also worked in partnership with Exxon Mobil and Qatar Shell in oil and gas projects and all of them were guaranteed. However, some projects with a risk factor have been challenging in the past and we now try to make them less risky for BOT. Qatar is moving to a more diversified economy-driven country and this opens the doors to investors. In this sense, I would like to emphasize that PPP projects are essential for the economic growth of the country, but that does not mean that we do not have the cash flow to finance our projects. Even when the oil price was USD20 per barrel, Qatar invested heavily in infrastructure. Ashghal's budget has not been reduced, even in times of budget deficit. PPPs will support the private sector and the overall economic development of the country to make it self-sustainable besides oil and gas prices fluctuation.</p><p><span></span>Fahad Rashid Al-Kaabi The private sector should be more proactive when it comes to projects that will generate revenue coming from the public community. I want to a see more creativity coming from the public sector to engage the government. At Manateq we are happy to listen and explore opportunities in specific sectors. The government will support them, and the public will pay for these services. It should not be always the government paying for these services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>With the ever-growing need to support existing operations and with the advice of clients and officials, Chiyoda Almana was established in 2008 by Chiyoda Corporation and a local Qatari partner, Almana Trading Company. From Chiyoda's long experience in this market, we can say that Qatar has one of the most secured and promising business markets in the Middle East and even in the world. The market competition is not easy and all companies need to grow their competencies and efficiency with a flexible strategy to accommodate market changes. This makes market players develop innovative and effective solutions and prompts new technologies with full adherence to safety, environmental and social responsibilities. I would advise any foreign company approaching the Qatar market to work very hard in transparency to obtain clients' trust and to maintain this trust by every possible effort. Most of contractors do what we call “hit and away“ business; they come in for a major project, complete it, and leave. With Chiyoda, it is different—we take over the post-completion services for our client. Any foreign company that wants to do business here should consider having a local operations center within the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>SAP established its presence in MENA with a first office in Dubai covering MENA. In 2011, we established an office in Doha as part of the plan of SAP to better support the market of Qatar. Today all the SAP personnel are based permanently in the country. Being a global organization we have the privilege to engage SAP resources from the large pool of talent of SAP according to the needs of our clients. In Qatar, we primarily started supporting oil and gas companies. Qatar Petroleum was an SAP customer even before we launched our office in the country. Since we established SAP in Qatar our presence took this relationship to the next level. We have a framework agreement with the government of Qatar. We started by supporting the entities of Mawared on HR and we are currently enhancing the agreement including an enhanced portfolio of SAP solutions. SAP is supporting the Qatar National Vision 2030. One of the pillars for achieving the goals of Qatar is digital transformation. The government is already on a digital route with several digital services for the citizens of Qatar. SAP can take it to a deeper and broader level.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As a business, we are deeply committed to the country and enormously proud of our successful history operating as the holder of Qatar's second public mobile and fixed telecommunications networks and services license. Fully in line with Qatar's 2030 National Vision, Vodafone Qatar is committed to providing innovative services and solutions designed to further develop the telecommunications sector as the country progresses toward its vision of becoming a knowledge-based economy. In addition, our extensive experience and expertise in fixed, mobility, IoT, cloud solutions, big data, and analytics mean we are ideally placed to address many of the urban challenges that are evident in a rapidly developing economy and market like Qatar and to support the vital delivery of public services efficiently, securely, and cost effectively. In addition, we will further invest in fixed-line activities targeting opportunities in public and private investments in major new real estate developments such as Msheireb Downtown, Lusail City, and The Pearl-Qatar, and infrastructure projects such as the new seaport and Hamad International Airport. We believe these offer real scope for our enterprise business and fixed-line services.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>As a Lebanese company, it was a normal step to expand toward the GCC. We come from Lebanon, where the facility management (FM) mentality is not mature. When we moved to the UAE, we saw a well-established market, but Qatar is not the same. There is a tendency here toward a more mature market from the consultants' intervention when it comes to tendering, bidding, and the specifications in the tenders. However, it is not that mature when it comes to execution and the mentality to outsource. There are many construction projects and, therefore, FM opportunities in Qatar. We have a full portfolio of integrated FM and are able to provide maintenance, energy management, subcontractor management, and asset management. In 2011, we were awarded FM provisions for all infrastructure and services for Lusail Marina Phase 1A and for eight high-end restaurants. In 2013, we were awarded FM services for Al Faisal Tower and Dareen Tower as well as a five-year contract to provide total FM services for Al Jazi Real Estate properties. Additionally, we have two projects with Msheireb Properties and around 100 retail shops. Last April, we were awarded total FM services for Lagoona Mall.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Qatar's fast development in industrial and civil infrastructure naturally put the country on Tekfen's radar for expansion in the Gulf. This strategic decision led Tekfen to sign its first contract in Qatar in 2005 for a pipeline project, an area the company rightfully boasts with six decades of know-how. Owing to good project performance and gradually developing mutual trust, Tekfen has since been present in Qatar catering to a wide array of areas from industry to infrastructure and civic works. Tekfen can offer what Qatar needs in order to achieve its National Vision 2030. As a reliable partner in contracting since 2005, we have completed projects from pipelines to industrial plants and motorways totaling USD2.4 billion for the most prominent and demanding clients like Ashghal, PEO, QAPCO, and Qatar Petroleum. We have been recently awarded the Al-Khor Expressway and Al Thumama Stadium projects, solid demonstration that the most respected institutions and the Qatari government know and trust us as a contractor. It is a source of great pride for Tekfen to be seen as a partner in the journey toward the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>]]></sections41>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities do you foresee for local companies in Qatar?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Tobias Ellwood </strong>The UK is home to cutting-edge innovators and world-leading products and services. In 2016 over 600 UK companies were operating in Qatar, and I hope that number will rise as a result of both the 2022 FIFA World Cup preparations and Qatar's 2030 National Vision. Qatar's economic diversification brings with it more opportunities for UK companies in the country, which will help build stronger economies for both our countries for generations to come.</p><p><strong>Teodor Meleşcanu </strong>The context of Qatar's path to diversification offers the private sector in both countries many opportunities, such as in the food industry, focusing on the concept of food security, a priority in the development strategy of the Gulf countries. I would also include tourism, through the exchange of tourism and health treatment packages between main tour operators in Romania and Qatar. Construction also offers opportunities, taking into account the quality of Romanian manpower at convenient prices, in addition to the use of modern technologies at the EU level. Other sectors include IT and cybersecurity, where our software specialists perform at elevated levels; rolling stock, taking into account our capacity to produce passenger and freight coaches, metro trains, and modern trams; waste recycling and recovery, where Romania has cutting-edge technological solutions; and energy, natural gas, and electricity, by the transfer of technology and expertise.</p><h4>Which areas of bilateral trade do you identify as having the most potential for growth?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TE </strong>The trading relationship between the UK and Qatar continues to grow. In 2015 total UK exports to Qatar totaled USD3.2 billion—a large 16% increase on the 2014 figure—while Qatar's exports to the UK doubled to USD3.3 billion. Of course the foundation of this relationship is our countries' leadership in the energy sector—Shell is the largest foreign investor in Qatar. That said, the UK continues to innovate in the sectors of cyber security, health, education, and sport—areas in which the trading relationship with Qatar goes two ways.</p><p><span></span><strong>TM</strong> Doubling the number of daily flights of Qatar Airways between Doha and Bucharest is a clear sign of the increasing cooperation relations between Romania and Qatar. In Qatar, there are more than 2,500 Romanians working in different sectors of activity such as oil and gas, construction, medical, and aviation. Moreover, the operation by Qatar Airways of two direct flights daily between Doha and Bucharest favors the exchange of tourism. The driving sectors of Romanian exports to Qatar include cars, furniture, wood, machineries, electrical appliances, rubber, articles made of cast iron and steel, textiles, garments and accessories, and optical, photographic, and cinematographic instruments. Romania imports organic chemicals and plastic materials from Qatar.</p><h4>What makes your country a great opportunity for Qatari investors and which sectors should be watched for investment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>TE </strong>We are working to make the UK the most business-friendly country in the world. We are cutting corporate tax to the lowest rate in the G7, and will reduce it even further in 2020. The UK economy is fundamentally strong in its foundations—we are the fifth-largest economy in the world and forecast steady growth until at least 2021. Many of the sectors in which we excel are directly relevant to Qatari businesses and consumers: We have four of the world's top-10 universities that many Qataris attend; London is Europe's premier center for Islamic finance; and the UK has the largest air transport system in Europe and the second-largest ports industry. The UK, with our thriving and diverse economy, is a natural destination of choice for Qatari investors.</p><p><span></span><strong>TM</strong> Romania has a market economy, and the state protects freedom of trade, fair competition, and private property rights. Among the factors that make Romania attractive to foreign investment are political and economic stability and security, its status as an EU and NATO member, its position as a gateway to the European Community's 500 million consumers, its size as the eighth-largest EU country in terms of territory and the sixth in population, its location at the crossing of three large markets (the EU, the CIS, and the Middle East), and its strategic access to the Black Sea and the Danube River. Other competitive advantages include more than 9.4 million ha of agricultural land, energy and mineral resources, human resources with high qualifications and technological expertise at competitive costs, developed transport and tourism infrastructure, high-speed internet, lower taxation (16% flat tax, 20% VAT, and 9% in food and tourism), and 72 industrial parks. There are investment opportunities, specifically in areas such as agriculture, real estate, tourism, IT, defense industry, mining, aviation, and mineral waters. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In general, Maillon Group constantly aims to introduce new experiences to the Lebanese market and export the Lebanese culinary experience to new markets. Since 2013, Maillon Group has built strong relationships with the Peruvian government and Peruvian suppliers. Today, we are part of the Peru Pisco Corporation (PPC), the biggest corporation of Pisco in Peru. The aim with the corporation is to join the forces of the biggest Pisco suppliers in order to introduce the Peruvian Pisco internationally. That being said, today, we are working on exporting all over the world our own brand of Pisco, Pisco Cinco, which is produced, distilled, and bottled in Peru. Additionally, we are working on opening a Lebanese restaurant in Peru. Besides, we are constantly looking for new opportunities outside of Lebanon with the focus of introducing Lebanese cuisine to new markets. We will be opening a Lebanese restaurant in India and South Korea, in addition to Abu Dhabi, which is still an emerging destination in terms of the development of the food and beverages sector.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The group came together by default. My late father was in property development, flour milling, import/export, and other diverse businesses, as was my grandfather. In 1976, he opened a patisserie with a French pastry chef, and it developed into a deli supermarket, with a restaurant next door. At the same time he opened a high-end French restaurant called L'Orangerie on the mezzanine floor of a complex. Ministers and leading people in Lebanese society used to dine there, and it was his prestige project. I came back to Lebanon in 1989 and opened an Italian restaurant called Spaghetteria Italiana. Then, we went into one concept or business after another. We started projects when everyone else was pessimistic. Everyone thought we were crazy. When we invested in downtown Beirut, we saw that, at the end of the day, downtown Beirut cannot be replaced.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We welcomed our first customers in Dora in 1998, and to celebrate we are preparing a full renovation of the restaurant to be completed by the end of 2017. We are looking forward to kicking off 2018 with a completely remodeled store that embodies a futuristic experience. We will be refreshing and renewing our stores. Some may also be relocated. Another important focus is the continual improvement of the quality of our products. It is essential for us to work with local suppliers both as a means of empowering local businesses and to deliver fresh, delicious, and safe local products of the highest international standards to all our beloved Lebanese communities. Our guests will experience the very best that McDonald's stores feature worldwide. Our global CEO has taken the decision to evolve the strategy from incorporating regional and local solutions to truly behaving as a global company and that includes the entire customer experience.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are putting in a whole ecosystem around us, from the internet exchange to many other services. We are opening up a box that we did not have access to, which is fiber. The installation of fiber optics is part of the 2020 strategy. The Minister of Telecommunications ultimately decided to hand out the license for the project to all companies, including Cedarcom, and the project is ongoing. The purpose of this is to provide fiber optic cables to homes or businesses. Putting in fiber is expensive; however, its benefits and longevity are clear. Today in Lebanon over half of the internet is serviced by illegal providers. They bypass the infrastructure of the government, as well as those of data providers. Typically in our business, we give 20% of revenues to the government, so consumers avoid coming to formal, legal providers because our costs will be higher. Even though the government knows who these providers are, it cannot shut them down because this will affect half the country. It has to find a replacement, and then push those people to migrate their businesses from the illegal distribution mechanism to a legal one. It is not a quick process. We hope that within a year things will change dramatically and that the implementation of fiber will remove the incentive for bypassing quality providers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In terms of percentage of sales, Lebanon is a small country for Logicom's operations. However, Lebanon has always been a good pilot for different projects. This includes launching new products, developing new channels, and evaluating new and existing business opportunities. We are a strategic office for the group. Last year, we launched our Marketplace, which is on the cloud and where we offer a special software tool as a marketplace for Lebanese software companies. It is a place where they can put their products and offerings on the cloud, and be able to sell and export their products to any part of the world. Logicom will be offering on its cloud marketplace different solutions including Microsoft, IBM cloud, Veeam, and so on. We are also looking to partner and appoint different independent software providers and vendors that are local, offering them this platform to promote and sell their software through Logicom cloud. We are supporting the economy, the country, and the local players in order to take their solutions and products outside of Lebanon and available for export. There are many software companies in Lebanon with their own in-house software that they are selling. Logicom Marketplace will allow them to sell across more than 22 countries.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are playing the role of a real value-added distributor and have a good position in the Levant market in addition to our good and hardworking team that allowed us to be stable and achieve our targets, despite all the challenges. We have made substantial investments to develop an automated cloud marketplace. We have our own marketplace, and we are a cloud service provider for Microsoft. All the vendors are pushing toward the cloud, and the cloud concept is beginning to be accepted by the market. It is going to take some time to mature, but the process has started. We think this is going to represent a good chunk of our business in 2017. The main goal is definitely to achieve the numbers and grow our business by 15% through our new business units in the cloud and cyber security. Currently, we are enabling our partners, creating awareness, and explaining the benefits for companies of using cloud services. We are also building up confidence in the market because it is important that companies trust this concept. Therefore we need the proper infrastructure: bandwidths and internet services to be in place and uninterrupted, problem-free access to the cloud at any time.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are an old company in the sense that we have been in the market for the past 60 years and are growing fast—in 2016 we grew by nearly 25% on the strength of our service. In the world of insurance in Lebanon, clients are more often than not viewed as claim numbers; that is the jargon used about them. In reality, of course, these are not numbers but individuals with needs and a specific psychology and surroundings. We want to create an uncharacteristically good service so the next time a client or broker thinks about insurance, he or she will have no choice but to think about us. That is our vision. We are meant to change the insurance industry, and we come to work every day to do that. We have created a customer service department to make sure we listen to our clients. We need to have antennas to listen to them and understand how we can improve, and in case they have a problem to know how we can fix that problem.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>GlobeMed started its operations in Lebanon in 1991 as a third-party administrator catering to the Lebanese market. Back then, the concept of third-party administration (TPA) was still new in the region, and we were the first TPA in the country. After 26 years, we proudly serve both the private and public sectors through a diversified portfolio of insurance companies and self-funded and social health insurance schemes. Our business has slowly evolved from traditional claims processing to managing healthcare benefits; currently we are shifting more toward a “managed care“ strategy aimed at helping individuals lead a healthy lifestyle and patients with chronic disease better monitor their condition. Along the way, several milestones shaped our journey in Lebanon and beyond. In 1995, GlobeMed helped insurance companies create the Perpetual Plan, one of the most famous insurance programs for individuals and families and one of the first insurance products that people could acquire for a lifetime. It marked a true milestone in the health insurance sector.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the support of Natixis Assurances France, which belongs to Banque Populaire and Caisse d'épargne in France, Adir has been a leading expert in bancassurance since 2001. This partnership and transmitted expertise has helped ADIR become the fourth-largest life insurance firm in the Lebanese market. We have spent the past years working on bancassurance on the retail rather than the corporate side. In order to be able to offer more attractive products and schemes on a corporate level, new laws must be implemented encouraging insurance industries through tax deduction and other means. Now that we have entered a new era, we hope the government will start moving in a direction that favors laws friendly to the development of the country, especially regarding the development of the insurance sector. Altogether, we have more than 50 companies in Lebanon, though in my opinion only those partnering with international companies or banks could survive in the medium term. International penetration is relatively high in Lebanon, but there is certainly room for growth.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are numerous challenges to doing business in Lebanon, from the macro level of increased regulations, to a subpar infrastructure from roads to internet, not to mention the administrative burden. Talent has been scarcer, not due to education, which remains excellent overall, but more to a lack of international exposure. This is why if you can make it in Lebanon, you can make it anywhere. I remain optimistic about the country' outlook. The country still faces major challenges in terms of growth, debt, balance of payments, governance, and infrastructure, for example. Despite the flaws, there have been positive things happening in the country.  The economy continues to be supported by the diaspora and by the know-how and entrepreneurship of its private sector. Now the government, under the president's oversight, promises to tackle pending issues to improve the day-to-day life of citizens. It has even promised major investments in infrastructure, with the support of the international community. Lebanon is still an emerging economy, which could have 8-10% growth rates. Within a few years, with public expenditures under control, the debt-to-GDP ratio could drop dramatically, and fast. The reelection of Riad Salamé, the reputed and experienced governor of the Central Bank, has reassured financial markets. As Mr Salamé likes to point out, Lebanon continues to enjoy financing rates that are half of Turkey's and a third of Egypt's.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We were established in 1929 during the era of King Faruk in Egypt. BML is a Lebanese bank but our major shareholder is Banque Misr in Egypt, which owns 92.8%. BML was first established as Banque Misr Syria and Lebanon. There were three banks at that time in Lebanon, and BMSL played a major role in the economy before and after WWII. During the era of Jamal Abdel Nasser and the problems between Egypt and Syria, the branches in Syria were nationalized and BMSL became BML, Banque Misr Liban. In 2007, BML decided to revamp and restructure. A total of 8% of the staff were women at the time I arrived. We did restructuring and we have done well since. The average age of the staff was 56 and is now 36; and our ratio of women to men is currently 48-52. We invested in our staff and IT systems, introducing the most sophisticated Oracle-based core banking system, and renovated our existing branches. We also expanded our branch network from 14 to 20 branches, with a representative office in the Ivory Coast. Our total assets are USD1.75 billion and are doing about 8-12% annually. We have been aggressive in the market and are moving ahead. We had an expansion program to go to Syria that was put on hold, but will definitely proceed when the time is convenient.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>For the sector, 2016 was a good year, and it was especially true for BLOM. Some of the negative factors in our entities abroad, such as the devaluation of the local currency in Egypt, took place during the last two months of the year, so the impact on consolidated profits when translated into USD was for a limited period of time. Therefore, the impact was small, but we had good results in many of the other entities of the group, mainly Lebanon, the UAE, and Egypt, which are the three main operations of the bank, as well as Switzerland. Lebanon had a good year in general and, of course, we had additional revenues because of the financial engineering set by the Central Bank. For many banks this gave them the opportunity to take all additional provisions required by the Central Bank, including those related to IFRS9 that will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. We are the second-largest bank by size and profits, but we have the highest profitability ratios (ROAA, ROAE) among listed banks. We have completed the acquisition of HSBC in Lebanon, which means that HSBC became 100% BLOM as of June 17, 2017, after receiving the final approval from the Central Bank of Lebanon. This will boost the balance sheet of the bank by almost USD850 million.</p>]]></sections21>

It was a political commitment and a vision rather than a scientifically determined goal. This target became a staple of the Lebanese government's commitment to renewable energy and energy efficiency. In 2010, the policy paper for the electricity sector that was developed by then-Minister of Energy Gebran Bassil and approved by the Council of Ministers reiterated its commitment to the 12% target. It also defined a few areas where the efforts should be invested in order to reach it. The 12% figure was a political vision in 2009, in 2010 it became a strategy, and today it is a realistic, achievable target. Whatever the Ministry of Energy is doing today, as part of the Lebanese government we are investing all our efforts to reach this goal. LCEC is confident we will reach this goal by 2020. The 12% target was 12% of the electricity demand when it started; today we are talking about 12% of the total energy consumed in Lebanon, which is a tougher target because it is achievable and we can do better. This is why the ministry decided to have a higher target. A major portion of the 12%, around one-quarter, will be covered by solar water heaters. Lebanon is among the top-10 countries in the world in terms of solar water heater installation. The remainder is dedicated to wind farms and in the coming weeks the government will issue the first three permits in its history to allow the private sector to produce 200MW from wind farms. Currently, the private sector is in the process of preparing proposals to build 180MW of solar farms. All this together will lead to the 12% target by 2020. A great deal has been done from 2009 to date, and we are on the right path to achieving our targets.</p><h4>How has the funding mechanism from the central bank benefited the sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Albert Khoury </strong>We have a company that works in solar PV, and 100% of the business model is through the central bank financing mechanism known as NEEREA. This is an important component in renewable energy and the entire thing came about because Germany started investing in and subsidizing renewable energy. There should always be a component of financial benefit when talking about renewable energy. This benefit in Lebanon came through the support of the ICC and the central bank, whereby they can offer a 10-12-year loan on PV system installation. The financing of a 600-kW plant was through a 10-year loan and repayments were made in six years, so companies will have positive cash flow by adopting renewable energy. If the central bank stops its subsidies, the market would go bad the next day. It is a mechanism that works and is a win-win situation for everyone in Lebanon. The 12% renewable energy target by 2020 is achievable as the numbers do add up.</p><p><span></span><strong>Dr. Fouad Zmokhol </strong>We have to agree that we have no infrastructure. In 25 years, we are one of the only countries in the world that has not constructed any infrastructure after its devastating war. We have to thus admit we cannot wait for or expect a great improvement from the public sector. We have certain positive points; however, I would be pessimistic given the complications of electricity. When we discuss renewables and sustainable energy for the private sector, it is no longer a choice. I am proud to be advisor to the board of a large company in Lebanon called ITG (Holcom Group), which is one of the largest IT companies in the Middle East. It has invested in a large building, and 30% of its electricity is generated through solar systems. This system cost USD125,000, which is small compared to the investment of the building, and was financed by the central bank for seven years with a two-year grace period. The return of investment for such a huge project was less than one and a half years. The second issue is that the price we pay as individuals or corporations for electricity in Lebanon has to be adjusted one way or the other, as the actual price is less than the real cost of power. If there is any restructuring by the private or public or by PPP, then we know we will have to raise the prices of electricity, and this is something that needs to be discussed. If there is a reform then we will have to shift to renewable energy specifically for large industry as it will be a question on a key issue. Personally, this is a huge opportunity for producers, industrialists, and anyone who might need electricity. Lebanon is a sleeping giant in this sector as there is a great deal of opportunity up for grabs.</p><h4>Salim Zeenni In terms of private generators, if the public sector does not provide the service, who will provide this service in Lebanon in a regulated way?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Karim Osseiran</strong> We have a problem with the legal framework in Lebanon, and the public sector is working with a handicap. The public sector suffers from obsolete public expenditure laws dating from the 1960s that are not compatible with the current market conditions. This is one reason why the public sector has its hands tied; however, it does not lack competence or know-how. Moreover, government-set tariffs that are imposed on the public utility Électricité du Liban (EDL) do not relate with real costs, thereby putting it in deficit, so if the public sector is given the same opportunities that the private sector is given, then the public sector will not fail.<span></span></p><p><strong>FZ</strong> We are business people, and the main difference between business people and consultants is that business people work on facts. After 25 years, the fact is that EDL is a dramatic failure. I am not discussing the people but the results, and unfortunately to date, the results prove it is a complete failure. When we talk about the private sector around the world, we know that when the private sector manages something it does so completely differently from the public sector. Of course, there was no legislature, otherwise we would not be in this state and we would not even be interested in investing a penny in it.</p><p><strong>AK</strong> The government is approaching the initiative to ask the private sector to bring the capacity. It is pushing ahead toward encouraging the private sector's involvement, and this is why it is feasible as there is awareness in the public sector that it needs to work with the private sector. I know from experience that the energy sector has to exert itself in one way or the other through the government, and the government's way ahead is through private sector distribution. Soon enough, in four to five years, it will be the private sector that will provide 80% of the generation.</p><p><strong>KO </strong>The problem is that the private sector wants to intervene and be a major player only under favorable conditions. The private sector can make its way by bending the laws because it has the know-how and capability to do it; however, the public sector cannot. There was an issue of lack of political will to give EDL enough political support to do its job. There are conditions required for the private sector to succeed. If we can maintain those conditions also for EDL, then it will succeed. Both need to have a climate of stability, security, and law enforcement, and then they will succeed.</p><h4>How would you suggest solving this problem in the short term?</h4><p><strong>KO </strong>I suggest proceeding with the IPP process with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). To date, the ministry has been under a great deal of pressure by the private sector to hand out licenses without a regulating authority, a set of tender documents, or criteria of award. The problem of the private sector in Lebanon is that it pushes and bullies to acquire licenses with terms and conditions that are not favorable to the government. When there is a transparent process under IFC rule that it is open to everyone, we can be certain there will be good technical and financial conditions. This will hopefully happen in the next period as the Ministry of Energy and Water is already negotiating with the IFC to act as a transaction advisor in the IPP procurement process.</p><h4>Is there any role for geo-thermal or other more creative energy solutions?</h4><p><strong>PEK</strong> As part of the 12%, geothermal is the smallest share, at less than 1% of the total of renewable energy. Here, we also refer to biomass or waste-to-energy and we can exchange electricity with the EDL grid through a net metering scheme; whenever there is a surplus of electricity, we lend it to EDL, and whenever we need it, we take it back. The scheme was approved by EDL in 2010, and it is currently fully operational; we encourage companies to apply for this scheme. The National Renewable Energy Action Plan, which is developed by the Ministry of Energy and Water as a public guiding document, has a detailed analysis of the costs of the different technologies, and this is how we determine our objectives and the capacity of each technology by 2020. Most technologies including solar PV, solar water heaters, wind, and biomass are lower than the costs paid by EDL so they are feasible, so we focus on these technologies. Concentrating solar power (CSP) is by far higher than the actual cost paid by EDL, and so too is geothermal. This is why we are not counting on these two technologies. According to the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, we look forward to 50MW of CSP in 2020 and are seeking a few pilot projects in geothermal.</p><h4>What is the role for innovative startups within the 12% goal?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Antoine Skayem</strong> We have been part of this entire scheme since day one. One of our clients asked us to work on water because, in 2015, we had a serious drought in Lebanon. We started using solar systems to power our smart irrigation system, which reduces electricity. By reducing water we reduce the pumping energy, thereby making another cut on the kW per hour usage. Renewable energy also involves energy efficiency as we have a great deal of waste in the country due to bad habits and old systems. Having a fresh and innovative approach will put things into a different perspective, which is what we seek to do. However, it is true that we have one of the most innovative financing mechanisms. Small projects are ignited by word-of-mouth. This mechanism takes a long time and there is a huge bottleneck from the time that we initiate a project to the time we install; sometimes it takes a year. By speeding up this process it will definitely help push to hit this target by 2020.</p><p><span></span><strong>FZ </strong>The positive side is that we do have a great deal of micro company SMEs that have been making large inroads into renewable and sustainable energy. All new buildings now have solar energy; the private sector is a huge step ahead of this.</p><p><span></span><strong>Hussam Hawwa</strong> We would like to see support of SMEs in developing new solutions in the alternative sector of renewable energy. In general, several layers of thinking must be added to such assessments. The master plan cost-recovery assessment mechanisms are generalized; if we could localize them more and integrate benefits to other sectors, this would make important changes in cost-benefit analyses of renewable energy interventions. Secondly, energy sector development in Lebanon has been purely profit and nation-centric, and the potential is great for improving decentralized loops at the municipal level, considering the various recent achievements and potentials of municipalities for implementing green technologies.  If we can think about encouraging PPPs at the more local level and integrating the benefits of other cross-cutting sectors, then it could entail lucrative development in terms of sustainability and would be much more interesting environmentally where other non-monetary costs on the environment and health are detailed. Lastly, there is a great deal of goodwill but not enough resources in terms of improving know-how, design, and follow-up; this is where the private sector and universities can have real added value. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The goal of Microsoft is to create strong partnerships. We have around 200 partners in different segments, from those that sell to large companies to channel distributors that cater to medium and small-sized clients. Additionally, we have many partners who are experts in solutions and particular technologies that deliver specific services to clients. Our efforts open new opportunities and possibilities for these partners, generating more jobs and employment. The other side of our contribution is what we bring from Lebanon to the international organization. Microsoft Lebanon is a great source of talent within MENA. One of the company's strategies is to hire right after graduation to have a young pool of new recruits. We start recruiting them when they are finishing their undergraduate programs in computer science and engineering, business, and MBAs. We get them through a training process, then through an accelerated path. We hope we can contribute further to the development of the country by increasing employability and empowering the public sector.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Citi Lebanon was the first Citi branch to open in the Middle East back in 1955; although we closed in 1987 due to the civil war, we reopened in early 1996. Citi's presence in Lebanon is part of our global footprint, which nearly reaches 100 countries. Our presence in Lebanon is part of our Institutional Client Group (ICG) focusing on our target market relationships. Secondly, we support Lebanese companies that want to expand regionally into places like Africa, the Gulf, or Europe, where Citi has an extensive country presence. This has an important impact because a lot of companies have outgrown the economy in Lebanon, so for them to be able to continue growing they must expand abroad. Thirdly, Citi is a major correspondent for the largest banks in Lebanon and gives them access to international markets. Fourth, Citi has acted as lead manager on a multitude of bond issuances for the Government of the Lebanese Republic, most recently for USD3.8 billion in 2015.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Allianz SNA is 54 years old and now the number-one company in Lebanon for life and non-life insurance. We have a balanced portfolio with 50% in the former and 50% in the latter. We consistently exceed our objectives and the level of growth in the market here. Overall we are happy with the performance of Allianz SNA, our leading position in the market, and our profitability. We offer all lines of products for both corporate and retail customer segments through multi-distribution channels. We also have our own sales force, working with a large number of brokers as well as with banks and through the internet. Our strategy is to be accessible in all the ways our customers want to interact with us. In terms of the importance of the region to the Allianz Group, there are three main markets for us in the Middle East region. Lebanon is one, and the other two are Saudi Arabia and Egypt.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Technology and innovation are a major focus for Maersk and have also been included in the line's strategy. Digitalization is a big word for Maersk now and is where the company is moving. In general, the industry is behind on this part when we consider shipping lines, which are relatively traditional and far behind. For Maersk, we are a few steps ahead of any other line in terms of digitalization. However, the plan includes the consideration that we are still at the beginning of our roadmap. Eventually we have to think about the future, which does include digitalization. As for the port, considering Lebanon's market size, the Beirut Port is capable of meeting the demand. There were plans to extend the terminal; however, the project did not go through for several reasons. We might face some challenges in terms of terminal capacity, especially when things start moving in Syria, which will definitely demand a lot of cargo coming in.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The building and opening of Dubai Healthcare City was an advantage to hospitals as it helped increase and promote medical tourism and healthcare services in the Emirate, giving the entire sector international recognition. Rather than competition negatively affecting our hospital, the construction of Sharjah Healthcare City will raise the profile of the Emirate and the sophistication of our services. The completion of Sharjah Healthcare City will promote organic business growth, healthy competition, and a better, larger, and more developed market. It is vital to continuously evolve in every business and encourage innovation to drive change. We work tirelessly to improve the well being of our patients through constantly bettering healthcare delivery, population health management, and technological capacity. Last year we invested AED35 million (USD9.5 million) in expanding and updating the technological capacity of our operating theaters. We also invested AED8 million (USD2.2 million) in a new CT scan machine and AED10 million (USD2.7 million) in the ER department.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Healthcare is developing rapidly here and the population of the UAE is growing. Also, with Expo 2020 coming, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is emphasizing that healthcare education should be a top priority. There is a need for more facilities and Sharjah Healthcare City will help to provide excellent healthcare services. We believe Al Qassimi Hospital is going to be partners with the Sharjah Healthcare City, and that is going to be our main objective through the MoH. From a personal perspective, I would love to have my center be the best cardiac center in the region. There are also many organizations that want us to outsource some of our services to them. We have had several investors who would like to take on our cardiac center project and outsource it, and the MOH also has this tendency. There are a lot of opportunities for PPPs in the healthcare sector, and that would definitely be a win-win for everyone.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Aster DM's new hospital in Sharjah is our largest facility in the UAE. It is a large investment in the Medcare brand and targets the wealthier portion of the population. The only facilities catering to this segment were ones like the Al-Zahra hospital, which has 165 beds. There are many people who work in Dubai and live in Sharjah, so it made sense to expand our capacity. It started as a multi-specialty hospital and is required to enter a new city and the two-year plan is to build centers of excellence within each department. This is how we typically operate. We start building a primary network first and then open a hospital for referrals, or we build a general hospital and from there we build centers of excellence from the departments. We have the launch of an Aster hospital in Sharjah, which is expected to take place in 2017 or 2018.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have recently expanded the facilities, and we are upgrading departments, such as cardiac for major heart surgeries, as well as revamping our existing medical infrastructure. Operations in our radiology department are getting completely revamped as well. More and more community-based centers are coming up in the region. Overall, this is great and will certainly complement us. We have tertiary care, and the new hospitals will be limited to primary or secondary care. We are geared to take on extremely complex cases. We have not had to refer any patients to other hospitals for the last two years because we have the facilities and expertise to manage the complexities. As for the specialization of hospitals, Sharjah needs everything under one roof, similar to Dubai. The MoH currently governs us. We see more public and private partnerships. It is also encouraging us as a group in terms of the new things that we are coming up with.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In the past, we were a GCC-centric company; however, after the Arab Spring we reoriented ourselves toward Africa and CIS. The Middle East is no longer our forte, even though we are based here. Today, we are in 47 countries worldwide and cover almost all of Africa, CIS, and Russia, and are now making inroads into the Asian market. Our products are manufactured in Sharjah and distributed all over the world. Sharjah is a great manufacturing hub, and our five plants here have performed well over the years. The Emirate provides an environment that is conducive to manufacturing, and if you are in a technology-based manufacturing company, there is no better place. Our industry is not a labor-intensive one, and we have always made efforts to leverage technology and be as efficient as possible. We will be the first company in Sharjah to put up a plant run on solar, which will be operational by YE2017.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The Pacio Group started in 2011 with only seven employees. We now have over 100 staff, and the company has experienced tremendous growth over the last five years. We currently hold 60-70% of market share. All the leading jewelers, such as Damas, Malabar, Kalyan, Joyalukas, and Jawahara, along with smaller businesses, depend on us because our service, prices, and quality are a cut above the rest. These are the three pillars we believe in and which we never compromise. The evidence is in our reputation and the level of trust in the market. There is a balance we have been working to strike between providing quality while being mindful of price. One of the ways we have reduced our production costs was by mechanizing as many processes as possible. Originally, our facility was labor intensive, with carpenters cutting and working with the materials by hand. We have since replaced much of this manual work with automated machinery, including CNC router engraving machines, laser machines, grooving machines for making boxes, and a variety of other small machines.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>InMarco was started over 30 years ago in Mumbai, India. While a large part of our operations is still in Maharashtra, one of our major milestones was bringing an extensive amount of operations to Sharjah. Another was when we started using eco-friendly materials in our supply chain and introducing the specialized, eco-friendly gasket into the market in 2016. This attracted a large volume of business as our gaskets are widely used in the oil and gas sector and by most of the major energy companies in the GCC. Directly and indirectly everything goes into this sector. While our customers vary, from contractors and subcontractors to agents appointed by the subcontractors, they always represent some faction of oil and gas. About 80% of our turnover goes to oil and gas, and the remaining 20% goes into other sectors such as construction or the municipality. We do not do produce gaskets for automobiles. On a separate note, one of the main reasons that we compete with top companies from Europe and Korea is because we are non-asbestos and deliver in quality.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>As the market conditions were evolving recently, we decided to set up a distillation unit to operate as a mini-refinery to produce petroleum and solvent specialty products after receiving approvals from the Hamriyah Free Zone Authority. The plant currently holds a production capacity of 144,000 tons per annum, and we are expecting to reach at least 70% of production capacity by the next year. In the coming years, we expect to reach 85-90% capacity. We have separated plant operations into two categories. One is producing solvent specialty products to be used in various industries, including paints and coating, printing, fertilizer, water treatments and oil field among others. The other unit will be dedicated for producing petroleum products. By doing this, we aim to develop our core competencies with right positioning. We plan to sell our products locally and export to countries in South Asia, MENA, and Africa. Because we depend on the GCC for supply sources, we decided to set up the manufacturing unit in Hamriyah Free Zone. Storage is an integral part of any production or refining unit because without a storage backup we cannot help refining activities. In terms of logistics support, we have excellent infrastructure, and the market is well matured. Hamriyah Free Zone is the right strategic location.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Due to the insufficient tank storage at our sister company, McGraw Global, we created a new facility called Hazel International and are currently building 30 new tanks for this company at an investment of USD127 million. We will use these new tanks to store our own products and other companies' products as well, operating as a third-party storage facility. Our new tank terminal will be ready in September 2017 and will be able to store any product from petrochemicals to gas, oil, and bitumen. The terminal also has tanker loading, drumming, and process distillation/refinery facilities. Our terminal is suitable for both petrochemical and petroleum products, no one else has this capability here; they do either one or the other but not both. These facilities clubbed with refining capability make us an indomitable force. The Hamriyah Free Zone in Sharjah also provides us with many advantages. In addition to the zero import and export duties, there is more room in Sharjah than in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. Also, our main customers are the paint manufacturing companies, and they are located in Sharjah.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are a USD3.2-billion top-line global company, and 80% of this comes from our operations in the UAE. Our total storage is about 1 million cbm and a large part of it is in Fujairah, where we can hold 412,000cbm. Then we have two terminals in Hamriyah with a combined capacity of about 250,000cbm and another 250,000 in Gujarat, India. About 20% of the storage is given to third-party customers while 30% is used by our in-house trading company for our own use. Part of this is used for physical bunkering supplies for fueling ships in all the UAE ports. We also have a refining unit here in the Hamriyah Free Zone that does about 5,000bpd of refining. With the terminal that we built in Sharjah we are now one of the largest terminal players in the Emirate. In terms of technological sophistication in Sharjah, we are the most modern and efficient privately owned terminals. In Fujairah as well, we have one of the largest and most sophisticated terminals among several large players occupying that port. In terms of market share, we again focus on the local market following our recent expansion into the global one.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>GE has been in the country a long time, and we have done something different from an investment point of view, from tapping oil resources and helping different regions gain access to electricity, supporting aviation and the air force, to improving the healthcare system and, finally, establishing an advanced manufacturing and innovation ecosystem. In 2012, GE launched what we referred to as Project Kingdom, which was a commitment to invest USD1 billion to support the economy by successfully undertaking localization projects in human capability development, manufacturing, and innovation. When Saudi Vision 2030 was announced, we had been working on various investment initiatives for a few months and GE was the first company to support the vision by making a number of large announcements about a month later. At GE, we work with stakeholders to make sure that all the vision's areas are supported.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We came to Saudi Arabia more than 30 years ago and started by opening a factory in Yanbu in the royal commission area, producing three segments of paint. We then moved from the royal commission area to other factories in Jeddah and then to Dammam and Riyadh. We have offices and warehouses all around the country. We have more than 500 employees on the production line. Our Saudization level is between 40 and 45% in the company, and we are committed to it. Part of the company vision includes involving the local community in our business. We believe in long-term hires and investment in the local community. We started the educational part a long time ago, even before the government started the Saudization program. We involved university students and gave interior design opportunities in our activities developing candidates for the future. In Saudi Arabia, we have three major factories: Dammam, Jeddah, and Yanbu. We have around seven distribution warehouses and more than 500 distribution channels and staff everywhere.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been active in Saudi Arabia for nearly 90 years. With approximately 2,000 employees, the majority of whom are local, we are a highly skilled organization and long-term partner to the Kingdom. Over the past few years we have been focusing on developing new industries in Saudi Arabia, and that includes strengthening the manufacturing bases of our customers and suppliers. We succeeded in manufacturing the first “Made in KSA“ gas turbine at the Siemens Dammam Energy Hub, and delivered it to one of the most iconic power plant projects in the southern region of Jazan. It was an endeavor that we initiated with our partners some years ago, and during that time, we trained and developed a strong Saudi workforce that built this unique engineering masterpiece, here in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi Arabia. With the announcement of Vision 2030, we succeeded in delivering the first Made in KSA gas turbine; since then we delivered five more from our factory. Siemens is proud to be the first to bring this specific gas turbine technology to the country.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Starting with the ethics and values we hold at Cisco in Saudi Arabia, we are renowned for putting our customers first and making sure that we practice what we preach. It is all part of the DNA of our organization and our team. Competing with integrity and responsibly is a fundamental value that is embedded in all of our employees. Cisco today is privileged to have a unique memorandum of understanding, as witnessed by HH Prince Mohammed bin Salman, being the key national digitization partner of the country. Reaching this point did not happen overnight; it has taken many years to foster and maintain a close, enduring working relationship that is based on trust, confidence, and our ability to deliver sustained value. The consultative role we have in our partnership with the Saudi government is based on our long-standing collaboration with Saudi businesses and public-sector entities, organizations, and stakeholders. It also reflects the value we add to the community and the technological ecosystem of the Kingdom at large.</p>]]></sections31>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the specific sectors that are of interest to you?</h4><p><strong>MOHAMMED AL MUSHARREKH </strong>When we first started promoting Sharjah in 2012, we commissioned an economic study with an international consultant and interviewed several government and private sector entities in Sharjah. We found that Sharjah has a lot of opportunities across many different sectors, but the highest returns on investment and value added are in tourism, logistics and transportation, healthcare, renewable energy, and the environment. Since then, we have identified education and light manufacturing as new sectors where we foresee growth. Sharjah is well known as the manufacturing hub of the UAE, and we represent around 35% of the total manufacturing in the UAE. We would like to expand on this and use the resources we have in the different free zones and industrial zones further to promote this sector. The objective is to support HH Sheikh Sultan's vision for a sustainable and diversified economy, and Invest in Sharjah helps investors discover the many opportunities these sectors have to offer.</p><h4>What makes Sharjah's value proposition unique in those sectors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AHMED BIN SAED </strong>Sharjah is a very good place to do business, and doing business in the UAE in general is famously easy. The social aspect differentiates itself from the other Emirates. People mistake it for being a conservative Emirate; however, it is more of a family-friendly location. Proof of that is that we have people living in Sharjah and working in the other Emirates. We want a knowledge-based sustainable economy. We are the industrial hub; we have the leading environmental agency in the region. We have a lot of educational institutes, and one of the leading in the region is the American University of Sharjah. The list goes on. Culture, education, and a knowledge-based economy are things that the other Emirates lack compared to Sharjah.</p><h4>Where do you see the most export demand for Sharjah?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAHA MANSOR AL ZAROONI </strong>Our biggest export customer is Saudi Arabia, but we are still seeking new markets in East Africa and Russia. We look to Africa because it is now booming, and there are 150 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda.</p><h4>What opportunities are there in the environmental sector for potential foreign investors?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MMAZ</strong> When it comes to renewable energy and recycling, Sharjah is taking the lead in the region with the Sharjah Environment Company. It is expanding every day and has opened in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and is expanding into Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in the near future. It started by recycling tires and producing rubber blocks and is now into transforming waste into energy. It has a joint venture with a company from the UK for a project worth AED1.3 billion (USD354 million) and has recently signed an MoU with Masdar to enhance the clean energy sector in the Emirate of Sharjah. Besides this, we have the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority, with which we are working to attract more companies that would like to produce clean energy. In Sharjah, we have power purchase agreements that lend investors plots of land, who then produce clean energy through wind or solar that the government will buy. We have a good number of opportunities in the renewable energy and environment sector; this is the future. The strategy of the government of the UAE is toward a diversified economy—one that no longer depends on oil—and we are getting there.</p><h4>What type of activity do you see from a licensing perspective and are there renewable energy inquiries?</h4><p><span></span><strong>ABS </strong>We are preparing our human capital for the new paradigm shift and developments that are emerging, regardless of whether they are technical or ideological. There are many R&amp;D firms in various fields of expertise flocking to Sharjah. Investing in human capital will take a company a long way, and the success of Sharjah is a testament to this nation's investment in developing the skills needed by the industries it hosts. Many people still perceive the Emirates as oil-reliant economies; however, the reality is that the majority of investments are in construction or technology, or bringing in new ideas such as business consultancies into the Emirate. In addition, the Emirate also provides more investment opportunities for public-private partnerships.</p><h4>Is human resource building the responsibility of the public sector or the private sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAM </strong>The government and private sector are both responsible for building human capacity and moving the whole UAE toward sustainability and resilience. The first batch of renewable energy engineers just graduated from Sharjah University, which added renewable energy engineering to its specialties. This illustrates how the government of Sharjah and the UAE is keen to develop and strengthen this sector by providing graduates with positions in both government and private entities to ensure investors find the right vocational skills in the local talent pool. People typically capitalize on providing services; however, today, with the rapid pace of technological developments, we need our human resources to have know-how and expertise. It is a collective effort to keep up-to-date, and the responsibility lies with institutes or organizations reinvesting in their workforce. On the other hand, we have educational institutes that have the full support of His Highness the Ruler of the Emirate of Sharjah. As an Emirate, we have 5,000 new graduates per annum and that figure is growing, which is an indicator that investors can depend on for their productivity and profitability.</p><h4>Invest in Sharjah has emerged as a distinct entity. Can you tell us the motivation behind that?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAM </strong>We launched the Invest in Sharjah brand as part of the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq) to send a clear message to the international community and foreign investors that Sharjah is keen to attract more investors, whether to free zones, the mainland, or specific projects in the Emirate. We have several interesting projects coming in which Invest in Sharjah will play a major role in attracting investments. We have the new Research, Technology, and Innovation Park, which is part of the American University of Sharjah. We have the new publishing free zone and the new healthcare city free zone, as well as the new media free zone, which now offers media-related licenses­—a welcome addition to the Sharjah economy. We have several interesting developments, and Shurooq has many projects that will be launched in 2017, mainly in the tourism sector with several hotels in the eastern area and a new development that will be opened soon. Specifically, it is the first traditional five-star hotel in the Emirate of Sharjah, which is part of our Heart of Sharjah project. By launching the Invest in Sharjah brand, Sharjah will be seen more in the international arena as a preferred destination for foreign investors.</p><h4>Can you talk about how your institutions communicate and coordinate with each other?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MAM</strong> When any trade license in Sharjah is issued, one will see the Invest in Sharjah brand, creating awareness and synergies between the private and public sectors. Whenever it deals with any company, it will send its trade license, and the Invest in Sharjah logo accompanies that. The same initiative was taken by Air Arabia, the official airline of the Emirate of Sharjah. We collaborated with it and put the Invest in Sharjah logo on the planes themselves. These planes fly to three continents. Air Arabia has a base in Morocco, and from there, flies to most of Europe; from Sharjah, flights connect to the Indian continent, most of the Arab world, Europe, Moscow, and different CIS countries. The private sector and the Emirate of Sharjah are helping us, and we look forward to working with Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) and Sharjah Exports Development Center. Whenever someone exports to a foreign country, they have to get a certificate of origin. So our next project in the promotion of the Invest in Sharjah brand will be putting the SCCI logo on its certificates of origin. Besides promoting the brand, we do different seminars promoting Sharjah locally and internationally. We also have a concept called Sharjah Business Roundtable, which we held with the Arab world, China, the US, the UK, and the Netherlands. Through the roundtable we promote Sharjah generally and invite speakers from Sharjah Economic Development Department, the free zones, and SCCI to share their experiences of Sharjah. The same thing is being done internationally through Sharjah Day, which we launched in London and where we go collectively to promote Sharjah internationally. Within the government of Sharjah, we have strong relationships with a commitment to achieving the best results for the Emirate. We work closely to enhance and build on relations, while bridging local government departments and private sector enterprises with international investors.</p><p><span></span><strong>MMA</strong>Z We have built a great vision in 2015 with Invest in Sharjah, and we also have the electronic membership renewal and certificate for the Economic Development Department. So there is collaboration between the government to promote Sharjah and show that all of the departments here work together. When we go for trade missions or exhibitions, we do so in collaboration with Invest in Sharjah or free zones. We went to Russia in 2017 and had Hamriyah Free Zone with us; when we went to Kenya and Uganda in 2015, we were accompanied by Invest in Sharjah.</p><h4>What are your main challenges and priorities in the medium term?</h4><p><span></span><strong>MMAZ </strong>The number-one priority is to educate ourselves. We have great leaders who believe in and empower us, but we need to educate ourselves thoroughly.</p><p><span></span>MAM There are many opportunities, and our main goal is to facilitate and enhance the process of doing business in the Emirate of Sharjah in collaboration with the relevant government departments and authorities. We would like to make the environment for doing business in the Emirate of Sharjah easier, more attractive to foreign investors, and also to make Sharjah one of the best-known destinations when it comes to doing business, like Singapore, for example.</p><p><span></span><strong>ABS </strong>We work collectively as a group of entities that are directly involved in the investment climate, the business sector, and business development. At times we need to go to entities such as SEWA or the municipalities and bring them on board. We need to invite them and involve them in the process so that they can be proactive as opposed to being reactive. That latency trying to initiate a project when these people are not involved in the initial stages can hinder it in the later stages. We can eliminate and shatter all these barriers by involving all these entities and showing them the value of what they do on a day-to-day basis. At the end of the day, we need to educate and enlighten ourselves. Our efforts in this sector involve many roles to be able to improve the quality of life in Sharjah and the UAE in general. What we do is add value, and our ultimate goal is not to increase money; the priority is to improve the quality of life in the UAE and place a high value on human capital and UAE citizens. By involving all these people in the process, we ultimately work better, become more efficient and productive, exchange knowledge, and serve our goal of improving the standard of living in the UAE, especially in Sharjah. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Humanity's greatest challenge today is to provide every human being with the prospect of a life in dignity and prosperity without destroying our planet along the way. This is a herculean task. To achieve this, a great transformation of our societies and economies will be necessary. And for that transformation, there can be no single global master plan, as nobody can have all the answers. Instead, the great transformation depends on creativity and leadership on all levels, and on countless bottom-up innovations from within society, from businesses and citizens. That being said, our efforts will not bear fruit without government commitment at the highest and systemic level. For example, we need prices that finally tell the truth about the ecological costs of products—for example through a functioning pricing mechanism for carbon emissions. And only governments can provide the necessary legal-political frameworks for doing this. Most importantly, no single country, no matter how powerful it may be, will be able to implement truly sustainable policies alone and without paying consideration to the needs of other countries. Global problems such as climate change, terrorism, and migration patterns require global solutions. This is why it was a truly historical moment when all 193 member states of the UN agreed on the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. The biggest challenge today is to translate it into concrete political action.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>It is potentially easier to convince people in the UAE of the need to conserve water than it is to convince people in Ireland. In Ireland, rainfall is plentiful but it does not fall in the right places and must be recycled. Wastewater and polluted water then have to be cleaned and treated, making the whole process more expensive than most people are aware. Therefore, persuading the public that they should pay for their use of water has proven to be a politically impossible task thus far in Ireland. If you charge more for excessive use, such as the use of water, then you will drastically reduce the consumption of it. The high price encourages people to use public transport, which is part of the reason that Europe has a much better system of public transport than the US. It is a pity because without public transport you miss out on a great opportunity to physically integrate with the community. Part of the problem of modern society in the developed world is that it is increasingly becoming atomized. People are living very individually tailored lives and mistaking social media for human interaction. Technology and social media should not be something that alienates people but a platform for bringing them together, especially in efforts to collaborate when addressing the global problems facing the world today.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Almost all free zones have what is called a one-stop shop with all the different institutions involved in processing or awarding label permits, construction permits, and visas situated in one location. So for any logistics center, providing the client with an easy way to cut through all the bureaucracy is very important. Taking it to the next level and having the entire platform digitalized and automated like what has happened in the UAE is something we are working to achieve. An advantage that Panama provides is the special incentives for immigration, allowing foreigners to come in and work freely in Panama in our special economic areas. This attracts expertise and skilled workers from all over the world, which directly benefits local workers and businesses that are able to gain from their experience and insight. Knowledge transfers are very important to Panama, a small country that is still developing. Like the UAE, we also rely on expatriates to bring executive, academic, and technical skills to the country. The UAE has done this by creating an environment that embraces globalism, multiculturalism, and is business friendly. We are looking to carve out a similar niche in Latin America by offering a cluster of incentives, ranging from location to infrastructure and ease of entry.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>At RVC, we do two parallel activities: one is venture capital and the other is our strategic investment arm. We invest in three different sectors: ICT, life sciences, and renewable energies, so our staff here cannot be experts in everything. Most times we need to involve a third party that is a well-established consultancy firm. The good thing about RVC is we are owned by King Saud University, so we are not a typical venture capital firm. We are here on the campus, so there is an army of experts available to us and we always involve our faculty members and students as consultants. Riyadh Valley Company also has a responsibility to the community. We are very busy running educational workshops, training, and symposiums for faculty members and students. We educate, motivate, and let students know we are here. We want them to understand what we do and to know that we are open to doing VC deals not just internationally but locally as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We consider DTVC to be the commercial arm of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) taking up responsibilities that involve a lot of commercial dealings and a lot of potential liabilities that the university would not like to be exposed to. As part of the investment in technologies, we have invested in two early-stage technology ideas that have come out of the university research. This is what we call the pre-seed investment and it is a huge gap between the idea and what the industry actually needs. This early high-risk period is where people are typically not willing to invest and it is our role to help it grow and move forward, so that typical investors can take it from there. We have also invested in a mature technology that was a startup based on the KFUPM and MIT joint IP in Boston. We have invested in the parent company in the US and plan to work with it to create a JV here in the region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Wadi Makkah is an investment arm of Umm Al-Qura University (UQU) with the aim to contribute effectively in developing a knowledge-based economy through investment in landscape and premises owned by the university, human capital, research, intellectual property, patents, and other resources produced by several institutes, units, and colleges. So far, we have incubated and launched 10 business to business and/or business to customer startup companies. Through our startups, Wadi Makkah contributes to the manufacturing, production, and commercialization of both electronic hardware devices for smart tracking and software indoor navigation systems. Our products are currently installed in the holy mosque, more than 20 airport terminals, Dar Alhikma University, and Red Sea Mall. We have also launched a number of mobile applications, through our startup company, SoftCare, serving the market need for Hajj and Umrah and the healthcare system. A social media big data startup analytics company, Lucidya, offers a real time social media analytics engine to monitor and analyze the trends and tweets from Twitter by location and time of tweets serving governmental and business sectors.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The university was established by Royal decree in 2014. It consisted of two main branches, the girls' section, which was part of the Dammam University, and the boys' section, which was part of King Fahd University Petroleum and Minerals. There were challenges, one of which was to have a unified set of procedures. We are making a great effort to harmonize the two branches. The courses were gender-segregated; the girls' branch taught Arabic, humanities, and education-related subjects whereas the boys' branch concentrated on engineering and sciences. We are gradually introducing arts programs in the boys' section. On the other hand, we are also introducing technical subjects in the girls' section, for example computer science and administrative sciences.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have many international partnerships and have made many agreements to enhance the quality of our academic programs. Our College of Medicine has made an agreement with the College of Medicine at Manchester University to adopt its academic program, and our College of Education has made an agreement with George Washington University to present a joint PhD program. Our College of Engineering has an agreement with Pennsylvania State University for a “3+1 program,“ whereby our undergraduate students study the first three years in Taibah University and then the final year at Penn State. We are trying to have similar 3+1 programs with other international partners across different academic programs. We have a total of 28 memoranda of understanding and service contracts, such as UTM in Malaysia among others. One of our goals is to expand our pool of international partners. The first step is to achieve the national institutional accreditation from the NCAAA, which will pave the way for our future goals.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Jazan University has only been around 12 years, making it one of the newest universities in Saudi Arabia. Today we are one of the biggest in Saudi Arabia as well, with 63,000 students. But there is a great deal of work to be done with regard to our research capacity. Thus far, our research has not been at the level we want it to be. We have various publications in big medical journals, but there is still a long way to go. We are not in the highest ranks of research but have a plan to get to that level. We have three research centers that we are building up, one for medical research, one for environmental sciences, and a third one that relates to the khat plant and its various medical and other uses. Our budget of SAR10 million (USD2.67 million) is not enough to support our research initiatives, and thus we are trying to expand that budget and find other areas of funding.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We are working on the new programs in partnership with other institutions. We are starting a master's degree program with Berkeley in architecture. We are also starting some specific PhD, master's, and vocational training programs in partnership with Lancaster University. We have another partnership with Babson on entrepreneurship. We keep adding to our range of programs as we move forward because we have to be very flexible under the 2030 Vision. Dar Al Hekma University is mobilizing efforts to pass legislation that would allow us access to Zakat funds, which are charitable donations people make here every year. This would be a big deal, because billions are collected annually. So, if we became a channel for some of those funds, it would make our university more sustainable as a non-profit organization. This legislation would also help other entities that are not publicly funded at the moment.</p>]]></sections31>

We now have formed a joint strategy and program to make sure that the 20,000 or so graduates all have the best option to pursue an education, because not all of those students need to go to university, many could go to the polytechnic for their interests and needs. Hence, we filter students according to their capabilities and the needs of the region and the country in accordance with Vision 2030 and the National Plan. For example, there is no doubt that the tourism market in Taif is blooming, and it requires hospitality graduates who do not need a bachelor's degree. In 2017, we have a program transformation plan in motion for our 44 programs at our university. We have funded this ourselves and are reviewing all our programs in terms of quality standards and market needs. We are also shifting toward more online programs and also aim to increase the percentage of international students on our campus. Our aim here is to have 10% of the full-time student population be international by 2020, not to mention attract people from all over the world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2017, we received approval for the restructuring of the university's colleges. Today, we have 15 colleges, including applied medicine, science, business, humanities, and more. Currently, we have 17,000 students at Bisha University, 80% of whom are female. Our headquarters are in Bisha, but we have three branches in smaller towns in the provinces of Tathleeth, Balgarn, and Al-Namas. In the future, these branches could be new universities in their own right. A university is important for local economic development. Having a local university is also particularly important for smaller towns to increase their opportunities to access higher education. Historically, students had to go to a larger city if they wanted to go further with their education. However, now this is not the case because they have a local university in their hometown. Now, parents are much more comfortable because their daughters can go to university nearby. We strongly believe that to succeed as a new university, we have to have cooperation and innovation with other countries, especially international universities. We have signed an agreement with the Malaysian Technology University's Engineering College and will start with an exchange of students by sending 10-15 students there to do training.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Customizing curricula to meet the needs of the private sector is a huge challenge for universities because the world is changing rapidly. For instance, in computer engineering, tools and processes are changing every two or three years, it is difficult for universities to keep up at this rhythm. In any case, this happens in every sector such as health and the humanities. If we focused our education in just the latest trends in the industry, our students would be shallow and narrow-minded. Instead, we give them tools and means to become strong and broad in knowledge to learn and upgrade their skills and competences following graduation. Vision 2030 needs a workforce that higher education institutions, such King Faisal University, can provide in order to be able to implement its programs; the economy needs large numbers of skilled people in order to transform and grow. We are working to develop a professional certification instead of full curricula so students can have the knowledge and the vocational experience. This will be in connection with professional societies in finance, accounting, or project management for instance. There are certain sectors where our students get graduate degrees, based not just on the transcript but a certain set of skills they must demonstrate their knowledge of a certain set of skills.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Typically, universities establish programs to educate people and prepare them for their future lives, not for the labor market. We need 10 years to establish an academic program and get it running successfully, and trying to change this rapidly is thus difficult. Universities should prepare their students for the labor market, not only by changing the curriculum, but also by changing other programs that are presented to students outside of the curriculum in order to establish a labor culture and awareness among the students for the market and the soft skills required. The top priority for us is preparing the soft skills that are needed in the labor market rather than modifying the academic curriculum given that the market is not that static. We have to prepare our students to look at the opportunities in the private sector and enter the specialties that are most in need in the market. We initiated a program to help our graduates get jobs through training, both during their time in university and after graduation. We have programs for graduates and they can attend training courses free of charge. We have built an ecosystem for graduates and this year one of the programs the government granted us is a job accelerator that will help people get on track with jobs and prepare them.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of things that can be done to support the industry. First and foremost is making it easier to do business. Regulations must be clear, transparent, and widely disseminated. Local industry could also be given a fast track through the registration process, especially in terms of registering new medicines. In the past, local medicine had some support in terms of the registration of new products, but that has disappeared. Timing is a vital factor for us, and if we were to get more support in this area, business could be greatly improved. Localization projects could also be given more support. Incentive structures aimed at bringing multinational manufacturing to the area should be designed. Real incentives and real commitments are key. Buying more from local companies is not a new idea. The time is ripe to begin giving real support to this notion, and a lot can be done to ensure that it succeeds.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In Saudi Arabia around 75-80% of pharmaceutical products are imported, and most locally produced medications are general and do not fulfill the country's growing demand or enhance pharmaceutical security. So the vision was to start producing specialty and advanced pharmaceuticals locally. We have a pharmaceutical manufacturing complex being built over four phases. Last year we started constructing the first plant, which will be dedicated for oncology products like targeted therapies, hormonal, and chemotherapy because there is none in the region. The second plant will be for parental nutritional products, the third plant will be for biosimilars, and the fourth will mainly be for life-saving medications. Most of these manufacturing facilities are niche, and most of the products are not produced locally in the GCC. Our aim is to localize the technology, not just import medications. We also need to transfer the knowledge to coming generations and establish a competitive pharmaceutical industry hub in the country led by trained Saudi pharmacists.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The pharmacy practice in the region has witnessed great progress over the past years.  Previously, pharmacists' role centered around dispensing medications in accordance with a prescription and providing a final check to ensure accurate delivery of medications to patients. While pharmacists receive training in preventive care, health and wellness, and patient education, they have traditionally leveraged their clinical knowledge to review drug prescriptions and to prevent inappropriate dosing and minimize drug abuses. In the last decade, we have seen a great shift in the role of pharmacists, which now entails more direct patient care, such as primary care and disease management services.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>AJA Pharmaceutical Industries Company's facility in Hail was inaugurated in November 2015. Since then many pharmaceutical companies have showed interest in partnering with AJA Pharma through different business models, including contract manufacturing and licensing. We expect this business to show positive growth in the coming three to five years. Through GMP accreditation and approvals from major regulatory authorities, in addition to the granted GMP certificate from Saudi FDA in 2016, we expect AJA Pharma to be positioned as one of the leading manufacturers of pharmaceutical products in the MENA region. AJA Pharma's portfolio is based on a market knowledge approach, which takes into consideration market demand and captures opportunities for the top healthcare priorities and the relevant unmet needs in specific target disease areas, such as cardio-metabolic, asthma, and CNS. AJA Pharma also foresees a good business opportunity from contract manufacturing, as many multinational companies are looking for local manufacturing partners to expand their business in this potential market.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Since 1995, we as a group followed a clear five-year strategy, and our latest plan developed to be aligned with the 2030 Vision and the NTP's healthcare sector key objectives.  The private sector has an active role to play in achieving the objectives that have been set, and we are very much a part of this effort. We work very closely with the government and have a great deal of alignment and are heading in the same direction. The government has taken steps to make the role of both public and private healthcare providers more efficient and effective, and has put in place initiatives that serve as a major opportunity for Saudi Arabia to be at the forefront of healthcare globally. The sector has moved quickly to adapt to a new era and reality which is seeking to provide the nation with world class services in a more efficient and effective manner thanks to these policies. Companies across the economic spectrum have worked closely with their partners to renegotiate existing agreements and to reduce costs for health insurance and healthcare overall.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of Health (MoH), just like every governmental body in any country, cannot function efficiently unless under very special circumstances. The government for a long time kept paying a lot of money to treat people for free, but this cannot carry on forever. There is misuse; the government appoints a lot of people as part of its philosophy to do the job and eventually that will lead to the service that it offers being expensive compared to what private hospitals can offer, and with higher quality. What it decided in the end, especially with the economic situation with the low oil prices, is that it is time to change policy with the 2030 Vision. This should push insurance companies to cover everybody, which we think is the right thing to do. So, the government will create public companies to run MoH hospitals. It is a great step that the country and the people need badly, as everybody needs to have good service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia is a giant that has been sleeping. In the past, it was kind and generous to everyone, but not particularly productive. Now the country will start to produce. The reforms imply that people will have to give, and not just take. This shift in policy has provoked a shockwave to the system. Imagine a budget of USD250 billion a year that was spent as if it was the duty of the government to spend it. Now, it is being invested in infrastructure and change through the private sector. For example, the Ministry of Health budget of around USD28 billion is going to be spent through the private sector by creating partnerships, outsourcing services, and selling assets or interest in them. Why the private sector? The government cannot make decisions at the speed the private sector can, nor can it run operations as efficiently. Government policy is also working to shift more of the responsibility for the country's growth to the private sector.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The challenge in Saudi Arabia is not the lack of bed availability but rather utilization of available resources more effectively. For example, after a total knee replacement surgery in a government hospital, a patient can stay for two or three weeks compared to a four days stay in the private sector with no difference in outcome. The private sector is more cost effective, and this is why the government plans to increase private sector participation in total healthcare spending from 25 to 35% by 2020. Another challenge is fragmentation with different government institutions providing healthcare to their employees, each with its own budget. The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Defense, the National Guards, universities, and the Ministry of Interior each have their own budgets and provide healthcare service to beneficiaries which include employees and their eligible family members, which complicates the sector and results in inefficiencies. If the entire health sector came under one umbrella and these services are supervised accordingly it would benefit the country as a whole.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company was established 30 years ago when we participated in the construction of the air bases in Saudi Arabia with some international companies. Today we have developed multiple business sectors in which we work through what we call our programs. We have a program for education, one for healthcare, one for housing, and we work with the metro lines. There is so much room for growth in the GCC and Saudi Arabia. The focus is particularly placed on infrastructure right now. In Riyadh, there are more than 55 projects on different sites. Infrastructure is large scale, and we are the largest construction company in Riyadh. In the year ahead, we have the Four Seasons in Jeddah, which is one of the most unique projects in the world and is worth about USD1.2 billion. At the moment we are waiting for the building substructure contractors to finish their work on this project. Also, we are involved in both the FAST and BACS metro lines. We are expecting more projects, and we are looking at selected project in Kuwait. As for the market, you have to be prepared and focused on discovering new opportunities and know that the market will never stop rewarding innovation and hard work.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are closely following the markets as well as government agencies. We are one of the biggest water pipeline contractors in the country, and there are four big water pipeline projects that will be tendered in 2017. One of these is the Rabigh-Mecca pipeline project, another is from Arafat to Ta'if, and a third pipeline is planned for Shoibah to Mecca. The last project is for another pipeline in the Ta'if region. So, there are four good opportunities coming up. The client for all of these is the Saline Water Conservation Group (SWCC) and the total investment is more than USD2.5 billion. These will be attractive packages. These tenders are by prequalification. Our aim is to get at least one of these four water pipeline projects. This is our core business in Saudi Arabia. We are mainly doing water projects rather than oil and gas pipelines here. We have installed around 1,000km of big diameter water pipelines in Saudi Arabia to date. In addition, we are expecting several invitations and contract opportunities from Aramco over the long term, based on their 10-year plan. We are classified, by Aramco, in the top category for pipelines, infrastructure, and building construction, and we hope this will create some good opportunities that are of mutual benefit for Aramco and Yuksel.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The anticipated fastest anticipated growth in the Saudi market is the tourism industry, primarily religious tourism, which sees people coming to Mecca and Medina for Hajj and Umrah. This is the most tangible growth element we can envisage. We are managing the development of 1.4 million sqm of land next to the metro station in Jeddah, which is envisaged to be the closest mega development to the metro station. Local Jeddah residents will also utilize the development, as they will be able to park their cars, use the local transport to the Metro station, reach the holy cities, and utilize the services and facilities provided. It is a very interesting project that will be developed to an international standard over the coming few years. In 2018, we are also expecting an increase in development. This year the authorities will start imposing land taxes on un-developed “white lands" within populated areas. Impact has not yet fully hit the market; soon people will be rushing to build to avoid being taxed. This is going to create a lot of opportunities for serious developers. Anticipate in 3-4Q2018, the real demand will begin, and we are already starting to see some interest in exploring what can potentially be done with various plots.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>RAFAL has been recognized for developing unique and distinguished residential projects in Riyadh, and these projects granted RAFAL its competitiveness locally and regionally. We are exploring other considerable opportunities within the Saudi Market like the western and eastern regions of Saudi Arabia as well as the religious hospitality segment. Also, the GCC countries are definitely an interesting market, particularly Bahrain as we have been invited by a promoter in Bahrain to participate in a project. Since Bahrain seeks to improve its causeway and consolidate its two immigration points into one, this will increase the number of Saudis heading to Bahrain and thus creating more demand for real estate projects thus more development opportunities for us there.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started in land development and, after that, we realized that we had to shift our interest into residential and commercial buildings. We are always trying to figure out how to attract new consumers by studying their needs, which are constantly changing. For example, we are thinking about creating a great living community for Saudi Arabia that is not a compound, changing our main business of developing land by creating homes within gated communities. We have another compound with our sister company, but with this compound we are trying to do apartments with all the facilities included. We are operating in real estate but focusing on unique opportunities. We are pushing to be a real estate company that has a special project with the lowest competition as well as the lowest risk. We want to be the leader who capitalizes on opportunities anywhere in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Within the hospitality sector, our target market is long-stay corporate clients. When people are visiting Saudi Arabia or companies come from abroad, they typically opt for four- or five-star international brands and names, while other local furnished apartments are left to a lower segment of the market or local demand. And so we decided to fill that gap. With apartment hotels, guests get the standards and services of a hotel but enjoy a larger-sized room, kitchen, and additional facilities that are ideal for long-term stays. We have signed almost 200 deals with corporates in year one, and most of them are with companies such as airlines and retail.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When the government decided to launch the Haramain Railway between Mecca and Medina, it put its main station in a neighborhood called Al-Sulemania in Jeddah. We coordinated with the landowner and a fund to develop a large project adjacent to the station. We have the only fully developed land parcel in that area of its size, 1.4 million sqm. When the project started, the development became a valuable proposition for the landowner. It is an investment proposition that people need, and this land will deliver that to investors. Mass transport always requires property around it. The train station will require 17,000-20,000 hotel rooms within the first five years of operation. There is a section for housing as well as space serving both B2B and B2C commerce. I estimate 60% of the land development will focus on commerce and hospitality and 40% will focus on the residential market.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company was established to create a self-sufficient capability in the Kingdom for aircraft maintenance and upgrades. When the Ministry of Defense signed a contract to buy the new and technically advanced F-15SA, it also decided to upgrade the F-15S models to the F-15SA specification. The upgrade is extensive and involves changes to the forward fuselage, both wings, and other structures as well as upgrades to the avionics, hydraulics, and other systems. Furthermore, it was mandated that the fleet upgrade had to be performed locally, and we are very proud to say that we were selected to perform the program. Looking at the local defense capability, we have the infrastructure, raw materials, and national companies available to make local manufacturing possible.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We specialize in end-to-end technology services to the defense and government sectors providing our core capabilities and skills to support and deliver their IT needs. It is projected that there will be a big gap between demand and supply of local ICT professionals over the next five years where the demand will surpass the supply by 56,000 resources needed. Moreover, we have a five-year plan to localize more jobs by transferring knowledge and technology skills to create new job opportunities in Saudi Arabia. The IT sector is changing much faster than any other sector, with IT spending in Saudi Arabia to hit SAR28 billion (USD7.5 billion) in 2017. We are working on new major bids and contracts in support of the Royal Saudi Air Force and other key customers that will drive revenue growth, and focusing on enhancing the capabilities of our Saudi workforce.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>All along, Boeing had the strategy of being local in Saudi Arabia. We are part of this fabric; we always think of it as a partnership. I am excited about the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Company, a joint venture focusing on helicopter MROs that I am sure is going to be widely covered by the media; it is a really great capability being brought into the country that did not previously exist. Right now, rotorcraft components are being repaired abroad, which is expensive. We are creating jobs for Saudis and expanding with that technology and knowledge. We are thinking big; Saudi Arabia is a great partner for us, for business in both the commercial and defense sectors, and we feel that we are local. We are doing our share to build the economy while building a robust aerospace industry in the Kingdom.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>This is the right time where we need to start playing a role in helping startup companies, entrepreneurs, and innovators to start thinking of defense-related technologies, and we want to support them. We are in fact encouraging our own employees to do this very thing, to develop spin-offs that we can support and help grow in the future. If this model works, it will create a culture of creating small companies and spinning off some of the technologies that are being developed at PSATRI so we can grow a supply chain of small companies around it. We have been very active, and all of our labs have been progressing well, starting their own developments. At the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017, we started bringing those developments out of the labs and started doing deployments; we learned a lot by going to the field and integrating our systems.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>As a leading provider of military air systems, cutting-edge radar technologies, secure communications systems, and cyber security tools to Saudi Arabia, we believe Airbus is strongly positioned to support the growing needs of the Kingdom as it moves ahead on a newly charted path of economic diversification and digital transformation. Airbus has longstanding partnerships with local companies for a number of projects involving manufacturing and maintenance of sophisticated equipment, and we are convinced that this can be further extended. We anticipate that there will be a strong push toward production of components as well as demand for software engineering capabilities, enabling Saudi Arabia to establish and grow its aerospace sector locally and organically. As of today, we have over 100 Saudi nationals working for Airbus across all its divisions in Saudi and we forecast this to grow in line with our business developments.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our company was the first airline caterer in Saudi Arabia and we catered for all the airlines in the country. Then in 1980 Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) set up its own catering company and monopolized the business. In 1985, I came in and saw a gap in the market, and started catering to private jets. Then little by little, we extended our business to the Hajj and Umrah, then foreign airlines, and now we are back full circle to local carriers, again with Flynas. We currently have facilities in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Abha and have plans for further facilities in Dammam and Medina. The number of passengers will keep growing, provided we continue to expand our airports. Jeddah has a new airport, and Riyadh has just opened a fifth airport terminal. This will allow us to double our capacity to 10 million meals a year in 2017. First, we have to build the base, then from 2017-2020 we will concentrate on growing the business in preparation for our IPO in 2020.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The world is facing big changes, politically and economically. It is affecting the vision and implementation of our project because the political instability in a number of Muslim countries is not helping us to reach the targets we have set. We have started our Umrah season, and there is a great opportunity to cater to passengers who come and perform the Umrah. But, unfortunately, there have been a lot of cancellations from several countries, especially Turkey and Egypt. It is very costly for the people to come for Umrah because of the currency exchange rate. There has been greater courting of the Far East with travel packages, as well as some companies targeting the South American markets. Even though these regions are not home to many Muslims there are a number of low-cost carriers that make the flight inexpensive if they connect from Europe and Istanbul and other countries in the region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our success amongst the Gulf carriers and carriers from the region has been a positive surprise for Swissport. Competition is not totally new to Saudi Arabia, but it has been a while since there has been such a competitive environment in the Kingdom. Overall everyone benefits from this competition: passengers, airlines, and handlers. Assuming that we will be successful and meet our business goals, I expect our competition to continue growing because of the rapidly growing demand. There are large ongoing investments from new airlines and the national carrier. There is sufficient room for two strong players in the market. Our largest customers at the moment are Gulf Air, Jazeera Airways, DHL aviation, and Scoot, which is from Singapore. We recently signed two prominent carriers, Royal Jordanian and Air Arabia, and are expanding with several others. We expect our current customers to be able to grow with the new Jeddah Airport, and this will also attract new airlines.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We were issued a license in October; it took us a year to get the license done and we started a month later. This is a reflection of the changes taking place in the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), which was supportive of our aircraft operators certificate (AOC) licensing process. It provided us all the resources we needed to get things done quickly. The Kingdom has Saudia, which started 70-80 years ago and the process when it was launched would have been different so it never really went through this application process. When Sulaiman bin Abdullah Al-Hamdan took over and the management at GACA changed, it truly pushed us to help get things done. It took us pretty much a year to go from an initial approval of the idea and the concept of the airline to going through the entire process of hiring people, getting our manuals done, and then the proving flights. These are non-revenue non-commercial flights that are operated under inspection of GACA; it reviews operations and pilots for over 50 hours. All of this was completed in a year. The short duration of this process is a record for Saudi Arabia. We are the fastest airline to go from initial concept to getting the license and it took us just another month or two to begin flying.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The performance of Flynas does not come as a surprise because we have been working with a structured plan based on the economic and competitive environment for the last few years. We made our plans with the objective to turn the company to profitability by the end of 2015; the target was achieved. At the same time, GACA started reforms in the industry by gradually removing the price cap, trying to provide fair treatment among the national carriers. The result of relaxing the price cap was a massive increase in domestic flights, which reflects basically the economic theory that price caps are not good and lead to capacity shortages. Since 2015 the government has been gradually lifting the price cap and this has given us more opportunities in the market and we believe it should be completely removed as soon as possible for fair competition and improving efficiencies. The strategy that we have put into place has been the right one; we have rebranded the airline, positioning ourselves a “smart choice airline“ instead of low cost, focusing more on our customers, with our performance based on efficiency.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Diversification is one thing that has become a focus, just like any other industry. Private aviation and the general aviation sector are still considered to be a young business in Saudi Arabia and therefore a lot of development has taken place over the last five years. This is part of the life cycle of the industry and is needed to reach a more mature stage. SPA is the investment arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines in the private aviation sector. We feel our responsibility as the largest player in the market is to try and contribute more to the restructuring of the sector in the Kingdom. Our starting point was as part of the overall 2020 transformation vision of Saudi Arabian Airlines. Out of that we have developed our five-year strategic plan and that basically revolves around the integrated private aviation business model. For us integrated means four plus one, meaning five lines of business. The first arm is the charter business that we have been operating for over 30 years. We have 10 aircraft of our own, both Hawker and Falcon. We have also expanded into aircraft management, which we were not involved in before.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Leading this consortium, we, at Bechtel, have a 70-year history in the country and have worked on many of the nation's major infrastructure projects. The Riyadh Metro project truly is the pinnacle of our experience and participation. The metro is one of the largest infrastructure projects currently being built in the world. The significance of the transformation here in Riyadh will be substantial. The residents of Riyadh will no doubt benefit the most. The city is a sophisticated intersection of government institutions, iconic high-rise developments, diverse economic and business infrastructure, and a sprawling residential base. The metro will represent a way of bringing all these facets together and connecting them from a mobility standpoint. This project will weave together the city's many parts so that every aspect and sector of Riyadh can benefit. It will also boost the country's image. It will be a visible 21st century transportation link that is an international symbol of movement and development. For those within the country, it offers a huge opportunity in terms of efficiency and access. It will be incumbent on the youth of Saudi Arabia to take advantage of this mobility and the efficiencies gained from easier access to governmental and academic institutions and economic opportunity. The Riyadh Metro Project will take key components of 21st century global infrastructure and interconnect them all. Each of the three packages that make up the Riyadh Metro are in themselves megaprojects with immense challenges from a technical and logistical point of view. They are so complex that the only way to approach them is through a consortium. The need to have supply-train system, local knowledge, and global technology each necessitate a consortium structure. Bechtel's fundamental business is bringing together competency and knowledge from around the globe to take on some of the largest engineering and construction projects in the world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When the project starts operating in 2019, it will be revolutionary. This is more than just about transportation; it can change the whole behavior of the city. It will impact real estate, giving more value to the land surrounding stations. It changes neighborhoods, enhances social life, and changes the look and feel of the city overall. This is even more the case for Riyadh, because we are starting from scratch. In terms of the advantages and changes it will bring to Riyadh, it will also reduce pollution and is more efficient in terms of energy consumption. It will reduce traffic congestion, and when we add the mass bus-transit system as well, there will be a major change in Riyadh. As for challenges, we have experienced and skilled teams familiar with these kinds of jobs, so they have been able to deal with problems without major disruptions. The main problems are dealing with utilities and interfacing with stakeholders. We must also avoid disrupting traffic, which is difficult, and not disrupt water, electricity, sewage, or communication lines. We have to leave the utilities untouched while working at maximum efficiency—that is challenging.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>This is definitely one of the most important projects of this kind in the whole world. Despite the initial challenge and huge resources required, it will be a success because it is driven by a clear vision. I am from Salini Impregilo, and we specialize in managing and delivering large-scale complex infrastructure projects such as this one. We have considerable experience in projects of this kind that require not only skills and expertise but also a vision. When vision and planning are well done, the goals were always met. Another example of this is the expansion of the Panama Canal, which we were also involved in. It is common opinion that the Riyadh Metro will positively impact this city, bring better services, and make Riyadh one of the most advanced cities in the world. It will be a breakthrough for citizens and businesses in general. This metro will contribute to the achievement of the Saudi Vision 2030 goals through the promotion of metropolitan economic infrastructure. It will provide rapid and economic public transportation services by easing traffic congestion and reducing pollution by cutting the number of vehicles on city roads.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p> I have excellent contacts with South Korean, Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish, and American companies. But I need to be able to convince them to come here. I do not want to go there and strengthen their economies. I want them to come here to strengthen our economy and help solve our problem of highly qualified, unemployed people. This is a big problem in Saudi Arabia. Vision 2030 is 20 years late and should have come when oil was at USD120-150 per barrel. But we did not have the vision then. We have the vision now, because we only realize what needs to be done when it needs to be done, when things are tough. If we rely on traditional government planning, Vision 2030 will not succeed. The ones who are building, producing, creating, and working must have a very active role in it. Furthermore, education must completely change. The children of every high-ranking person go abroad from elementary school onwards, yet they are in charge of education in Saudi Arabia!</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>MESC Group was established between 1993 and 1994. Since then, MESC decided to go into a field where it adds value to the country and market and is uniquely creative. In the early 1990s, all the specialized cables here were imported into the country from Europe and the US because there were no manufacturers in Saudi Arabia. The imported supplies went mainly to the oil and gas and petrochemical industries, as well as power plants. MESC has taken on this role and decided to be a big player in this market. We have done very well positioning ourselves as the supplier of special cables in Saudi Arabia and have gained the trust of customers here, especially oil and gas clients in the region and other key accounts where specialized cables are required. Over the years, we have built up a good name and reputation based on high quality and service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We do automation for all the plants; oil, gas, electrochemical, power, and water, as well as the smaller ones. As the Saudi representative, I like to bring in new technology and launch it in the market, so must first know everything myself. Our focus is on petrochemicals, so ARAMCO of course is our first customer. Another big one is SABIC. These two companies give house loans that the private sector cannot give, and this is why most of the local guys are there. However, now that banks are giving people loans, things will change. The other issue concerns technology, as Saudi customers still believe in XYZ and do not want it to change. Some customers like to stick to old and familiar things, so this is quite challenging. We are also with small players who do not compare with SABIC and ARAMCO. Altogether, we see this country as a rich one, but in order to make that money, you have to invest in local people.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Pan Gulf was founded in the late 1970s by Fahad Al-Saja and Khaled Al-Hamdan as a steel trading business when Saudi Arabia was going through an impressive development process. The company began trading steel items and structures, but later we decided to have more products. We consider ourselves primarily a steel company because even though we no longer trade it, 90% of our investments revolve around steel. These include steel trading and fabrications, oil and gas skid manufacturing and integration, pipe manufacturing, valve manufacturing, and welding items, which are supplied through the steel industry. It started as a division, but when it became big enough, we spun it off as a separate company. In the mid-2000s, we decided to transform Pan Gulf into a holding company with multiple branches. Two years ago, we decided we needed to be more focused and concentrate on the industrial sector and provide industrial solutions. Thus, we created a sub-group called Pan Gulf Industrial Investment Company now known as PGIIC.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Pipe Systems (SPS) was established in Jeddah in 1994. We started as one factory and now we have five just in Jeddah. We have altogether five factories in phase four and one in phase five, which was our first factory. In 1994 Saudi Arabia needed a lot of infrastructure work. It did not have comprehensive sewage infrastructure, so we started manufacturing fire hydrants and ductile iron valves. Then, we opened a second factory and started doing high-density polyethylene pipes (HDPE) before expanding and opening the GRP pipe factory, making pipes from fiberglass. We expanded again and started to do manhole covers and the grating on roads. After that, we expanded by opening one more factory and started to make the pre-insulated pipes for district cooling systems in malls, such foam pipe jackets to bring the cold in without increasing temperature. In the past, our main client was the Ministry of Water. Now it is the National Water Company (NWC).</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We wanted to make the world's largest TiO2 company. We used to be number two or three in the world, before becoming a quarter owner of a major company. The combination of Tronox and the TiO2 section of Cristal led to what we might now call a match made in heaven. The two companies complement each other. We are working in many countries, such as the US, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, France, the Netherlands, the UK, and China, in addition to Saudi Arabia. However, we differ from the rest because we have mines in Australia, South Africa, and Brazil and own three slagger plants, one in Jazan in Saudi Arabia and two in South Africa. We have TiO2 plants in eight countries, which makes us fully integrated and the largest and most efficient because we use the latest technology with chloride technology. Furthermore, the cash we have on hand will maximize our investment abilities and allow the company to concentrate on profitable future business ventures.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Since Saudi International Petrochemical Company's (Sipchem) inception as a private company in 1999, we have been a growth-focused company capitalizing on the availability and competitiveness of feedstock and global market conditions. Initially we focused on key products, the first of which was methanol. This commodity is an excellent product and had a good market. The second pillar of our strategy was to introduce new products in Saudi Arabia and the region. Other than methanol, all of Sipchem's products are unique in the Middle East. We wanted to bring in new technologies and innovations, as well as build new capabilities in the region rather than just being another competitor in the market. Our board and management has been focused since day one on growth in distinctive and unique products and on having a global presence. From our inception until now we average one major plant project every 18 months, which is fast growth for our industry.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We exceeded our capacity for the first time last year with high-quality polypropylene, increasing output from 450,000 to 503,000 tons in 2016. That was accomplished after we made improvements to our manufacturing facilities. We have also managed to secure more propylene apart from what we produce at our plant. Overall, we had a positive outlook for 2016 because of the work we did solving our problems with cooling systems, fixing issues with ruptures and leakages of cooling GRP pipes, and changing to above-ground carbon-steel pipes for better observation and monitoring. These pipes run for almost 16km underground and are all different sizes, and when they are underground it is difficult to accurately assess their condition. Thus, we also put many of the pipes aboveground. In 2016, we truly overhauled our cooling systems and affected a major turnaround in our plants. Additionally, we developed and implemented a new organizational structure. In 2015, we transformed the organization into having three pillars: corporate, manufacturing, and shared services.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>JGC Gulf International was established in 2008, at a time when our management had penned an important deal with Saudi Aramco. They mutually agreed to establish Inside Kingdom Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (IKEPC). Before that, we had carried out a project for Saudi Arabia, and our headquarters and project home office have been located at our head office in Yokohama, Japan. We had the engineers and designed, procured, and constructed only in Saudi Arabia; however, we had fully executed the engineering and procurement work in our head office. We can locate our project home office in Saudi Arabia and work together with many young and capable Saudi engineers, transferring our technical expertise to them after several years. We already have over 100 Saudi staff, mostly engineers. Our main projects are with Saudi Aramco, where we are doing the construction of the terminal to transport crude from the east to the west coast in order to export the crude. The terminal is now under construction at Yanbu and is one of our biggest projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>AWJ Energy's parent company, SUMOU Holding, was established in 2007. Part of the vision behind the group was to provide the best services to the market. The group has five companies in real estate, another five in construction, two in agriculture, two in the financial sector, and one in retail, in addition to those in energy. The group's decision to go into this industry was made in early 2014, and AWJ Energy was established in January 2015. The good thing is that Saudi Arabia is expanding its activities, especially when it comes to oil and gas, because there is continuous demand for both, especially gas. What is available from international service providers in the Kingdom is not going to be enough. There is a lot of room for local companies, and there are incentives from the government to drive this business. AWJ Energy can be a high-quality service provider for oil and gas and petrochemical companies in the downstream. Even though our company is young, we are already working with big companies here in the market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2008, the market was in turmoil with the economic downturn, so organizations had a lot of liquidity issues. We thought it was a great time to penetrate the Saudi market, be more flexible, and make some acquisitions and mergers with the core businesses we were interested in getting into. Now if you have the capital and there are companies struggling with their financials because of economic issues, it is the right time to make an offer and take the business from where it stands and enhance, improve, and drive it forward. In 2008, Makamin went through a lot of cycles, both good and bad, as did every other company. It was awarded lots of projects totaling more than USD1.2 billion, plus assets. Altogether, during the period of 2008-2016, the company went through a period of gaining know-how about bringing turnkey solutions to the oil industry services field. To achieve this, we came up with four departments that we considered to be the core services and maintenance support needed by oil services organizations that work in the field.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Albilad Bank is one of the youngest banks in Saudi Arabia. Something that we like to stress is that we have the strictest sharia board, which often means we miss out on business. We are also launching the first sharia-compliant custody business in Saudi Arabia. This will help us, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. Some of the Islamic funds in the UK that want to access Saudi Arabia require a sharia-compliant custodian; that is becoming one of the main growth areas for us. It is going to become a competitive area in Saudi Arabia because the regulations are going to split the role of the fund manager from that of the custodian. That is the main business, and with Vision 2030, we are excited because we believe a large amount of business will come to investment banks, privatizations, and a focus on more institutional business, turning family companies into proper corporations and listing them on the primary and secondary market (NOMU) being set up.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Alistithmar Capital offers wide-ranging investment products and services to individuals as well as institutional clients.

In short, for an investor, we have become an all-inclusive financial services company with appealing products for all types and classes of investors.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The past two to three years have been interesting. Since 2015-2016, we have been focused on Saudi real estate and been able to conclude solid investments, mainly in defensive income generating real estate. They end up making about 7% in net returns annually; therefore, it is a solid product with a good yield, which is one way our clients are able to diversify. In the future, we see that this will be a promising line of business as well. New regulations within the Capital Market Authority will encourage and induce more investments into income-generating Saudi real estate through the real estate investment trusts that has just been announced. This will be an area of great interest to the real estate industry and to investors because it provides them diversification and access, especially for medium- and smaller-sized investors. This will continue to be a very interesting area for us from that angle.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We focus on two things: growth areas and existing management that we can rely on to drive that growth. The term growth sectors has different meanings in different economies. In Saudi Arabia, it could be demographic, retail, and consumer, while in the UAE oilfield services have been good for us. Typically, finding management talent has been a challenge in the region. We like to make investments in companies where management is well established. We have been targeting the middle segment, family-owned businesses. In some cases, even though the company is family-owned, the management will have been separated from family ownership for some time now. Those are even more attractive. Our growth changes with time. In the mid to late 2000s, the building materials sector was hot and experienced attractive growth. Today, though, we would not invest there because there was a super-cycle, and we did a lot of construction in Saudi Arabia for both infrastructure and superstructure.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The company was established in 2010 as a real estate mortgage financing company. In 2012, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) established new mortgage laws, which were exactly what the industry required and were perfectly suited in terms of regulating the market. Our focus from the onset has been on real estate, mainly mortgages for residential. We additionally do commercial lending, which also covers loans for business and commercial purposes, though residential mortgages are our core line. One of the main challenges that we face is competition from banks as the cost of borrowing for us is higher and we therefore cannot truly compete for high-end clients as they typically fulfill all the conditions, such as earnings, with banks. Instead, we actively target the middle and lower segments of society, in particular first-time buyers. They are the true beneficiaries of SAMA's regulation shift, and with the huge demand for housing in the country, are an ideal segment to tap into. Our portfolio today is a mix between different segments from a wide range of income backgrounds.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our principal goal remains unchanged: focus on reliably delivering desalinated water and electricity at the lowest possible price and continue to serve the markets we operate in. Our specific targets are to complete the many plants under construction and bring them online on time, such as the two CSP plants in Morocco, which when completed together with the phase already dispatching green electrons day and night will then become the largest CSP complex in the world. Another exciting finish will be the DEWA 200MW photovoltaic IPP plant. Saudi has a 2,000MW gas-fired power plant that will come online this year. In terms of new tenders we expect to see the first few tenders in a major program of big new renewable projects here.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Taqnia Energy seeks to be a key contributor to building a sustainable national economic sector in the field of energy. In order to achieve this end, the company has set within its main objectives the development and localization of energy-related industries and services, and made it a key part of the company's strategy. For instance, the Layla solar project (PV technology), the first solar IPP project in the Kingdom in partnership with Saudi Electricity Company and King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, aims to provide an alternative and clean source of energy for the best interests of the economy and help build a sustainable future. The solar power plant with capacity of 50MW will be connected to the grid and we will supply energy to neighboring villages. Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) is the buyer; it is the off-taker of the output of the field. We signed a PPA agreement to supply it with energy for USD0.05/kWh. SEC also provided the land for the project with a long-term lease agreement. SEC is a great partner; we are in constant contact, involving it in all stages of the project.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our work includes the construction of overhead lines, towers, and substations. This is the bread and butter of what we do. Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) is our main client; some 80% of our jobs are via the SEC. The government plans to add 5GW to the network between 2017 and 2023, which is a decent amount. We are at 60GW capacity currently and by 2030 need to double that figure to 120GW. It is in the interests of the government to turn to renewables on a large scale to benefit from economies of scale and achieve the lowest kilowatt per hour (kWh) rates of around USD0.02, which is extremely ambitious. By 2030 we seek to have 10GW added to the network, though there is a large possibility that we will go beyond that figure much sooner than anticipated. There is an abundance of empty land that can accommodate hectares of solar panels, and I foresee the speedy development of solar PV happening in Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Minerals is taking the lead in renewables, and we are working on selecting a suitable qualified international consortium to bid on the coming 300MW project. We are trying to be competitive. We have already communicated our observations about what we faced in the past to the concerned ministry representatives. If we do not see proper bidding procedures with logic requirements, we will not participate and will go back for other industry development. We developed an industrial gases project in collaboration with Sipchem, one of the largest carbon monoxide projects in the world. We produce 340,000 tons today. The ministry expects to have 9.5GW in 2023, which is unattainable unless we think outside of the box in adopting new ways of bidding and opining the sector up for new proposals. That means the ministry should not just offer bidding for one or two projects a year, because the process is unitary. If we offer only one project a year, there's no way we can meet 9.5GW. Therefore, we have to do it another way in terms of bidding</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are currently working on the National SME Strategy, a master plan that maps out what all players need to undertake to enable the SME sector. As part of the National SME Strategy, we will outline strategies for specific sectors in cooperation with the government agencies that are responsible for those sectors. We are working with the MoH for an SME health strategy, for example. Beyond SMEs, part of our mandate is to set up the venture capital sector in Saudi Arabia, which we are working on. An important enabler of that is the Fund of Funds, a SAR4 billion (USD1.1 billion) fund that is a co-investment mechanism to place a certain percentage into funds that are of national relevance for Saudi Arabia, which we are doing to enable the venture capital sector. We are also responsible for restructuring a number of existing government programs. The legal environment is another of our key tasks; we want it to enable SMEs to thrive and enable startups to flourish. There are many pockets that we need to worry about, the most important relating to the ecosystem. There are five areas of thrust for us there, including legal and government processes, funding and closing the gaps in funding, and access to market, which is basically the ability of companies with offerings to find a market for their goods.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started around 25 years ago doing stationary retail. We started with small shops and then opened other branches until we had 10 branches for retail, all in Riyadh. Then we sought to enter into wholesale. Retail is different than wholesale and once we had enough time, experience, and money, we decided to focus on wholesale as it was growing faster. We started increasing the number of branches in wholesale and reducing those in retail. Every month we would close one in retail and open a new wholesale one in another city, such as Jeddah. In the end, just 10% of our business was retail. We started to go to China to find suppliers and get wholesalers to do business with us. As we are a retail business from a small area in Riyadh, we do not have to go to different places to get our things; we bring all of those in one showroom. Also, not all the products are ours; we buy from other wholesale dealers. In that way, retailers can get 90-95% of the things they need from one same showroom. That has made us grow quickly, and we had a thriving business and customers and thus became a public joint stock company. Before that, we merged with Muhammad Rashed Alduwish Company, our competitor, and became a closed joint stock company in 2008.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Al Wafa is a family business established by my father 40 years ago. At that time, we used to have only car spare parts, batteries, and other similar products. Then by time, the company starts getting bigger and expanded more and more. We also had a chicken farm with capacity of 300,000 chicks. In addition, we owned a jewelry business in Khobar and a home appliances business in Dammam. Our main business now is government supplies, particularly in the defense sector. We are utilizing our 40 years of experience in supplying different military sectors. The company used to sell military uniforms and special equipment. The defense sector has since became one of our main business lines. Subsequently, we started looking for business opportunities in Turkey. In the last six months, we found many defense suppliers eager to work with Saudi Arabia. I am happy that we have clear targets outlined in Vision 2030 and that the government is keen to work it out. For example, in the defense sector, the government seeks within five years to have 50% of government expenditures be localized. We are working to adapt with this strategy by expanding our range of military products and services.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>GE has been in the country a long time, and we have done something different from an investment point of view, from tapping oil resources and helping different regions gain access to electricity, supporting aviation and the air force, to improving the healthcare system and, finally, establishing an advanced manufacturing and innovation ecosystem. In 2012, GE launched what we referred to as Project Kingdom, which was a commitment to invest USD1 billion to support the economy by successfully undertaking localization projects in human capability development, manufacturing, and innovation. When Saudi Vision 2030 was announced, we had been working on various investment initiatives for a few months and GE was the first company to support the vision by making a number of large announcements about a month later. At GE, we work with stakeholders to make sure that all the vision's areas are supported.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We came to Saudi Arabia more than 30 years ago and started by opening a factory in Yanbu in the royal commission area, producing three segments of paint. We then moved from the royal commission area to other factories in Jeddah and then to Dammam and Riyadh. We have offices and warehouses all around the country. We have more than 500 employees on the production line. Our Saudization level is between 40 and 45% in the company, and we are committed to it. Part of the company vision includes involving the local community in our business. We believe in long-term hires and investment in the local community. We started the educational part a long time ago, even before the government started the Saudization program. We involved university students and gave interior design opportunities in our activities developing candidates for the future. In Saudi Arabia, we have three major factories: Dammam, Jeddah, and Yanbu. We have around seven distribution warehouses and more than 500 distribution channels and staff everywhere.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are expanding and increasing our space by 10 to 15% per year, which is healthy, opening five stores a year. We opened five new stores in 2016 and expect to open a dozen by 2018, some in the country and some throughout the Gulf. We plan to increase both market share and size. We have seen a 3% decrease YoY in our old stores, but across our total operation foot traffic has increased from 29 million to 35 million visitors, mostly due to the introduction of new stores, which is a strong reason to keep opening new stores. Our return on equity has been high, at over 50%. In 2016, we opened one new store in Kuwait and the rest were in Saudi Arabia. The signs thus far lead us to believe we will have reasonable growth and increase our market share. Overall the market is getting smaller, but in 2016 Jarir took more market share, and we expect to repeat that in 2017. We should see faster growth in 2019-2020, not because of budget but because of the new base. GCC countries will form a more and more important part of that growth relative to Saudi Arabia, along with some of our other initiatives like e-commerce.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Zahid Group is a privately held organization, led by an established family whose commercial roots date back over a century. Initially, the group focused on passenger vehicles, followed by construction machinery, which represents a major business for us. Throughout the years, we continued to grow and today we are active in over 10 thriving industries. We are a Saudi organization and, to a large extent, our focus is on our investments in our country. We do have a few investments abroad. Now is the time to restructure and refocus on our core competencies and strengthen ourselves in those areas. We are proud of what Zahid Group has achieved in the past, but there is a great deal that we can still do. We want to work on developing the skills of our employees and increase the recruitment of competent nationals even further. The number of our Saudi employees continues to rise, and we are proud they represent more than one-third of our workforce across the group's companies.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The group has developed strong foundations over the past seven decades in many sectors of our economy, allowing us to position ourselves at the forefront of several of them, particularly the leasing and automotive sectors where we have played pioneering roles. I do not view Alissa Group as a family business, but rather a business that has a fiduciary duty to protect and maximize the interests of its shareholders, no matter their constitution. However, as in many Saudi companies, our corporate culture is a subset of our nation's culture, which for many decades has been based on a sense of entitlement, rather than on performance or merit. During times of reform and transformation, leaders must communicate an inspiring unifying vision which is authentic and compelling enough to win the hearts and minds of their most valuable enabling assets: their people.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Roots Group comprises about 30 subsidiaries worldwide organized under three pillars of business: commercial, industrial, and design and building solutions. The commercial division was the starting point for Roots more than 35 years ago. Today we represent some of the most recognized construction equipment and building material brands such as Bosch, Haulotte Jungheinrich, and Case Construction. We have built a strong name over many years of supplying large infrastructure projects with everything from cranes to concrete mix. In 2013, Roots sealed a joint venture deal with Ideal Standard, and in less than five years we increased sales from IDS to account for 13% of the overall commercial division revenues. In addition to working on a varied but complementary lines of products, our geographical spread has also been an important factor in our success. We are present in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, UAE, Jordan, and Nigeria across 11 markets. Our growth strategy is to expand according to forecasted needs and requirements and organically curtail economic cycles.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Service education is important to our university, and every university in Mexico has a requirement that students commit to 480 hours of social work. At our university, students do their social work in underprivileged communities because we want them to get out and experience the world outside their bubbles. The second time they get to experience the real world is through their internship or practical work, and the third is when they write their thesis. We are interested not only in academic excellence but also in training young people to become deeply involved citizens. This is one of our principal roles in Mexico's higher education. Another is to be leaders in the private education sector insofar as other private institutions look to us as an icon. We want them to be equally inspired by our model, which is a specifically Catholic model. We train our students to be future decision makers of major companies, institutions, non-profits, NGOs, and governments globally.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The model currently used by Latin American business schools is not sustainable. Right now, universities and educational institutions are out of touch with the needs of the market. Students learn from teachers and try to apply what they learn in their companies, but in reality the things learned are no longer applicable. The Universidad Panamericana is integrated with the broader economy and society, and accomplishing this by encouraging dialogue with the private sector, finding out what skills are needed, and placing students in their second and third years into work placements. There are Triple Helix projects in sectors such as energy and law that require the public, private, and educational sector to create collaborative projects. We have research in medicine, projects with law initiatives and regulations in the law school, in addition to projects with public politics in the school of government and economics.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are located in seven states in Mexico, with 11 campuses. Our mission is to integrate education with values, culture, universal vision, finding a reason for living, and the transcendence of work. For us, offering education is an opportunity to get close to youth and give them vital motivation. The six values that we encourage through our study programs are perseverance, justice, respect, honesty, solidarity, and loyalty. We do not want our students to come through UNIVA only to get a degree. In addition, we are making efforts to ensure our students are successful in their future employment. We have adjusted our academic programs to the realities of the labor market. In 2017, we held a conference with businessmen to strengthen our links. We have a council of businessmen that helps us revise our study programs.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We initiated the transformation of U-ERRE after a year of conceptualization and innovation process with a group of experts. We determined that the concept of university since the 1950s had already died; today, knowledge is a commodity and is found everywhere, due to advanced technology. That is why a university has to evolve. The most important thing about knowledge is its practical application. Therefore, the classroom must evolve into a laboratory and must be open to society. We have to develop a set of skills in our students for them to grow and flourish in life and to be able to adapt to change. Students require a particular space and architecture for them to practice these skills, and we have it. We also want our students to graduate with a geometrical thinking, because in the past the world moved in a linear way. At the end of the day, what a university needs to succeed in is to build citizenship.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The trajectory of ISEC is marked by an objective to have a constant relevance in business. The essence of ISEC has always been to ensure a true professional practice through educators with expertise and experience in their areas. The gap between the classroom and real professional life is in fact real practice and real information and is aimed at decision-makers. ISEC does not develop executives, but entrepreneurs; people with a vision to start a business. This is based on three important factors: dignifying people and considering intellectual capital as the most important part of a company; generating results; and maximizing the wealth of companies. These have always been the guiding principles of ISEC. For the next year, we will revolutionize the curricula. We want to break with the traditional model that begins with the history of each subject. We will have specialized models that will make a student capable of adapting to the forefront of business.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We grow all the agave we use. We have long since had a tradition of being agave farmers, so we understand it very well, including its growth and production. We understand that prioritizing an excellent quality of agave leads to excellent tequila. We are 100% focused on the international market, first Europe and then the US. Mexico is a difficult market due to high taxes and the diversity of offerings. Exports are different; we pay fewer taxes and can reach a broader client base. The European market is growing, and we are continuously selling more tequila there. In the US, we operate state by state. We began by focusing on California before looking at the likes of Nevada and New York.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The best business opportunities for micro companies like ours are in the international market. We have sold to the United States for over eight years and 96% percent of our production goes to that market. We have the intention to go to China, where we have started sending some products. We want to diversify our market, because even if it is growing, there will be a point at which the American market is saturated. Currently among alcoholic beverages, tequila represents 6% of the US market and will continue growing. In the US it is easier to sell bottles at USD25 to USD40. In Mexico, we cannot compete we the agave liquors that sell for far cheaper prices than any tequila, even if our quality is higher.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Many Mexican restaurants were making the switch to Mexican haute cuisine, and the trend was to focus on Mexico and Mexican cuisine, which led us to shift to producing a quintessentially Mexican drink: mezcal. Mezcal and tequila could be compared to malts and whiskies. There will always be a market for malts; however, the market for malts will never expand the way whiskies will. It will appeal to a specific niche and a specific taste, a more sophisticated market, and mezcal is similar. We are working on different types of mezcals, and the ones in the coming years will be more ensembles and blends. Mezcal is sophisticated, but the market is not yet sophisticated enough in the US.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Tequila has always been Mexican and cannot be produced anywhere but here. I see a great deal of interest in multinationals coming to Mexico. Some of them come to buy, to partner, or find business opportunities. This only opens opportunities for Mexican companies and people. This is also helping us export to further markets. If we remained small local companies, we would still be exporting to the US through small companies. I am happy that tequila is in international bars and restaurants competing with other top-notch spirits. We want to further establish another base in Europe and explore the Chinese market. We are also selling in Australia, which is a great market for us, and have recently started selling in New Zealand. We work with several distributors that help us reach new markets.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We make traditional and clean tequila, mainly with agave from the Valles area, which fortifies the flavor and aroma. When making high volumes, companies often mix agave from the Valles and Altos zones. Consumers notice a difference in the flavor of tequila made from the agave of each region. We want to distinguish ourselves from others by making tequila from the agave from this region; therefore, our customers identify us with the flavor and quality of our product. It is an important part of our business. In the past, we produced for a large number of companies, but today we only produce for two brands. These two cover about 30% of our capacity. It would be ideal to have 80% of our production for our brands and the 20% for external brands.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Mexico is extremely important. After China, Latin America is the fastest-growing region. BD Mexico represents the second-largest market in Latin America for the company after Brazil and is truly key for the corporation. We have a track record of double-digit growth in Mexico for the last three years. In the local Mexican market, we have two big segments—medical and life sciences. We are a key player in the medical segment, with medical technology that goes from small disposables, such as plastic syringes, to catheters and instruments for infection prevention. We have a whole set of solutions that help hospitals reduce communal infections. Our business is about 50% public and 50% private sector. We have a team of clinical experts who have a direct presence in the hospitals and look at their needs. Some of these hospitals are joint-commission certified and have to adopt the best practices and the latest technology. These hospitals are, thus, early adopters of our differentiated products. We build models to demonstrate that if hospitals adopt more sophisticated devices, these will help avoid other risks and allow them to discharge patients sooner, thereby reducing the overall end-to-end healthcare cost per patient. This creates greater capacity for public hospitals to treat other patients and helps achieve greater healthcare coverage.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The decision to acquire Covidien was strategic because Medtronic had a specialized legacy, focused on high-level, high-tech devices and was positioned in areas where the market has to be developed. The Covidien portfolio allowed Medtronic to expand the mission to help more people. The acquisition re-leveraged and expanded the portfolio of Medtronic and truly increased our contacts with patients. As an example, before the merger, Medtronic reached a patient every two seconds. Now our therapies improve the lives of more than two people every second. This impact influenced the company's strategy, operations, and mission. If we truly want to change and shift our approach of selling products to offering services and solutions, we have to have the breadth and depth of the portfolio to be able to do that, as well as be more relevant to hospitals. To become successful in Mexico, a company has to learn how to work with the government, because 80% of people are receiving healthcare in the public sector. In order to become partners of the public sector, we realized we needed to change the approach by working together to identify challenges and have a common understanding of the problems we are facing. In addition, we need to work to find innovative ways to make technology available within the available budgets.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Both of Integer's legacy organizations, Greatbatch and Lake Region Medical, already had operations in Mexico. Now, we are a company with multiple manufacturing sites worldwide and have a lot of duplication in our processes as a result. Since we have multiple sites doing machining, molding, and wire coiling, we are looking to optimize manufacturing to consolidate our growth. Growth is our first priority, so being in low-cost countries like Malaysia or Mexico helps us be competitive from our customers' price perspective. The other enabler for growth is performance, including on-time delivery, quality, and service, which historically our legacy operations in Mexico have provided. We ship to over 200 customers in over 40 countries from our Mexican locations. We ship over 50 million components and devices from Mexico. About 25% of our associates worldwide are Mexican, which already represents a significant segment of our business and global footprint. We have just opened 46,000sqm in Tijuana, much of which is already in operation or ready to take on future projects. We want to leverage our history with our customers and our operational excellence to drive more growth by partnering with our customers in the early stages on design and development. Mexico is our largest manufacturing country after the US.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago we started the Fibra brand with 17 hotels. From 17 hotels in 2012, today we have 85 hotels. It was impressive growth and a great opportunity to consolidate a fragmented business in Mexico. It is risky to get into one enterprise rather than get into 85 and is risky to get into a developer that a company does not know through a public holding company. Many institutional investors are not allowed to get into a real estate risk structure, and this gives us a great opportunity in a tax-efficient structure with Fibra to invest in a liquid option other than real estate, where in order to get liquidity a company has to sell the building. There is a lack of supply in the market, and there are great opportunities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We brought competition and foreign investment to this market, as around 60% of FHIPO's IPO resources came from institutional investors outside the country. This is important because it is the first time that private capital comes to fund mortgages in Mexico. One of the strongest attributions of our portfolio is that, in Mexico, the origination of Infonavit and Fovissste represents 80% of the mortgage market, and these institutions have created a sort of utility for originating and servicing mortgages. Currently, we have, in the Mexican stock market, the highest dividend yield in the country. We are a much-differentiated stock, because we are a hybrid between a bond and stock. As long as we are able to originate and monitor on a safe basis, it is a low-risk vehicle with a high dividend yield.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In the year ahead, we will focus entirely on creating value. We do not need to grow more to create value; we need to grow the NOI and dividend per share. It is not the right time to buy more properties because of the high valuation of the individual properties compared to our portfolio, so we will sell instead. If we can make a great return in developing a joint venture where we commit 20% of the equity and then put some of our staff to work for a fee to make the investment more profitable, then that is how we will create value in the coming year. We need to wait and see what happens politically between Mexico and the US. We are also exploring investments in the three main leisure markets: Riviera Maya, Riviera Nayarit, and Los Cabos. Also, in terms of joint ventures we are looking at the major cities of Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, León, and Tijuana primarily.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our investments from day one have been in industrial and retail. We have a small number of offices as part of our mixed-use properties. That has allowed us to acquire a higher quality portfolio, which creates value for our investors. We acquired 100% of the industrial properties owned by GE and about a third of the properties from another developer. This transaction was subject to us raising capital in the public markets. We held our IPO in December 2012 for USD1.1 billion, which was the largest real estate transaction in the region at that time. Combined with credit facilities from both Metlife and GE, we completed the formation transactions for around USD1.5 billion. We are the third FIBRA in Mexico and have since invested over USD2.5 billion to become one of the largest property owners in the country.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We are focusing on the states that have grown above average in the country, which is mainly in the northern corridor of the country, the Bají­o part of the west coast, and obviously, Mexico City and central Mexico. We also took into consideration the economic and trade activity. The NAFTA corridor which is Mexico City going through Bají­o and northeastern Mexico into the US is a key market for us. Tijuana has access to Asia Pacific markets, and we believe that the trade between Mexico and South America is going to explode. Finally, the transpacific corridor, which is everything that is between the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico around the Bahia area, is going to be interconnected. By asset class, we are a diversified FIBRA. We are not only invested in hotels and retail. Our focus is office space and corporate real estate, and right now, we have about 60% of our net worth coming from office buildings.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>It has been a great year. Many companies are looking for a space where they can start their facilities—and four new companies have signed on in one year. Two are starting production and two are in the process of construction. We have advanced and see dynamism in the economy. The opening of the first fire station in Interpuerto Monterrey was recently announced and will serve the companies within Interpuerto Monterrey, the municipality of Salinas Victoria and the nearby municipalities. The most active industries are automotive, food, and logistics. Despite the US elections, companies are still investing in Mexico because we have a great labor force, competitive pricing, and great logistics for exporting to North America, Europe, and Asia. We now have nine installed companies and over 300,000sqm of warehouse facilities from Japan, Korea, Mexico, and the US; the impact is starting to be more evident. There is some nervousness regarding relations with the US. But an updated NAFTA can be positive, since Mexico and the US are not only trading partners, but production partners.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I was working for a US stockbroker, Mutual of New York, which suddenly decided to close operations in Mexico after September 11. After an informal conversation with an old friend, Dario Villarreal, we decided to start our own business. Since then, our goal has been to serve corporations in real estate services and construction advisory. The only players in the market were franchises from global firms, and there was a niche for non-global platforms in order to deliver more personalized services to the industry. Between 2009 and 2011, we faced security issues in northern Mexico; hence, a number of companies decided not to open up operations, and suddenly our business went south. At the same time, there was a huge boom in automotive in central Mexico due to Japanese investments. Therefore, we started visiting Japan in 2011. Now, we go there two or three times a year, and 40% of our client base is Japanese.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We started off in 1996. Before 2008, we were part of a merger between the two largest industrial real estate companies, Prologis and AMB. Both companies have similar strategies worldwide; hence, there was a great deal of synergy created through the merger in Mexico, which was a success. Our primary focus was investors coming to Mexico who needed industrial space. Leases in Mexico are dollar-denominated, and they had good arbitrage to American valuations; therefore, it seemed attractive to take advantage of that opportunity. Prologis focused on investing in the manufacturing market along the border. The border was an active region with many foreign companies taking advantage of the location close to the US. In addition, FTAs have been a factor and facilitator, and have helped us expand and invest in that sector. After 20 years, we have one of the largest real estate portfolios in Mexico and the company has expanded geographically. We have two strategies. One is related to logistics and the other manufacturing.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our background has always been real estate related, and we have done a number of projects in residential real estate and title insurance. Around 2001, we started to see the self-storage trend as an asset class in the US, and so we looked back to Mexico, especially Mexico City, and began to understand what real estate assets did not yet exist. Self-storage was totally non-existent in Mexico. We also saw that housing has to get smaller if you want to get people to live in more downtown urban areas. That typically happens with much smaller units and smaller housing. We saw that the closer that you get to the urban areas, the more permanent demand you are able to achieve. This is a real estate-driven business, and you want to try and get your hands on the best piece of real estate you can. The value generation was going to be much better in centralized areas. To do that, we had to go vertical.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We focus on the medium- and high-level housing segments; we do not go after volume, but quality in our products. We offer a customized service; although it is true that our prices are slightly higher than the competition, which only reflects the quality of our products. We personally ensure that every client to whom we deliver a house has legal certainty of his property. In 2018, there will be a light train connecting Metepec with Mexico City, which will drive the development of the area. Prices are beginning to rise considerably, more than what we expected. A great deal of development is now coming to the area. Our projects are all located in Metepec, Toluca, and the state of México. We have, for example, Balmoral, La Joya, Puerta de Hierro, Country Club, Las Bárcenas, Palma Real, Loma Real, and the largest in Condado del Valle. In just over 30 years, we have worked on 12 residential developments, four commercial developments, and an office development, which is our next project.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Before working in real estate, I was a racecar driver. I believed that as a public figure I could influence Mexico in an important way. The way resources are distributed and the way certain decisions regarding education and government are made, seem like they could use some good influence. I believed I could change these in a positive and important way. When I realized I would not get to where I wanted by racing cars, I saw that this could be also achieved in business; I had a few good friends that trusted me and helped to get started by believing in my projects and investing in me. I created a partnership with a friend who is an architect, and we started building in Guadalajara. We did four buildings together, and we were doing big things quickly. We were one of the first high-rise builders in Guadalajara, and we ended up building what were the two tallest buildings in the city at the time.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>SARE was founded in 1968. Its founders worked hard to bring a new vision to the housing industry in Mexico and put lot of energy into creating vertical housing. This was the strong foundation for the company that carries on today. At the time of the crisis, the company was working on creating condos for the middle-income market in the metropolitan area of Mexico City. Focusing on this probably saved the company from the worst effects of the crisis. After 2001, SARE started to expand into the low-income market. They built thousands of homes in different parts of Mexico. That was the birth of a new kind of company, a company that also had projects outside of Mexico City. However, with the mortgage crisis of 2008, the company started to have some problems. But in contrast to the three biggest housing companies in Mexico, SARE did not go bankrupt. As a result of this, we are in a good position right now.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have seen a change in the institutionalization of financing and its opportunities. In the past, projects were much smaller. The sector is currently so institutionalized that it has become 40% financial; it is about finding the right financing. Projects are extremely large now. Mexico's industry has grown so much that it is comparable to the US. Fibras have boosted this growth; after Fibras came out, the sector institutionalized considerably. In the last five years, the amount of mixed-use developments have increased, following a broader trend. Cities can no longer grow; hence, vertical developments are on the rise. We invest a great deal of time on each project. Our signature is our quality and level of design; we work with the best architecture and landscaping firms. We sacrifice some of our profit to deliver high-end products. We want to have developments we would like to live in. One of the biggest challenges is finding the right land.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Another challenge for Terraforma and the industry is changing the apartment culture. In the past, there used to be large apartments; now, they are smaller. However, there are other amenities in the same building, such as a concierge, gym, shops, dry cleaning, and restaurants. This way people can do their daily routines in their living areas. We work with companies like 4S that help us do market research, so we can select the amenities our clients need according to what these companies survey. Otherwise, our change of strategy to institutionalized funding has had its pros and cons. By transforming into institutional means, we are not able to make decisions fully by ourselves. There are regulations of the funds that we have to respect in order to reduce risks for investors. Nonetheless, our management has improved considerably. Altogether, we are well positioned in the luxury segment and clients recognize our work, so our developments sell fast. Our products speak for themselves.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In our 12 years of operations, we have consolidated a solid presence in the market. We are the pioneers of virtual custody; before us, guards protected containers with a patrol truck; however, this did not truly offer a differentiator or protect merchandise. We installed GPS in our containers. If they were stolen, we could trace and recover them. We took advantage of new technologies and used them in a practical application for our operations. In just a few years, we were able to consolidate the company. We formed an association called AMESIS with companies of satellite tracing and security in 2007, of which I am vice president. Many were working on cellular technologies for vehicle alarms, but few purely on security. When I was in the government, I worked in areas of intelligence, migration research, and public security of a state. When we set up SkyAngel, we realized a GPS tracking system can also offer a service that can be used for security purposes.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Trust Group was founded in 2003 with a training and learning division to service all the companies that hire security services. Their staff and protection agents were not properly trained. Later, our clients asked us to provide security guards; hence, we created new divisions in 2005: physical security and transportation custody. With the creation of these divisions, we acquired licenses to carry arms, which is something that few security companies are able to do in Mexico. We, thus, started gaining more clients, initially by recommendations. Today, we have about 1,000 people in the organization. We have consolidated ourselves in the sector in a brief timeframe. We are not a conventional security company; we can do what other companies cannot, particularly in cases when insecurity has exceeded the company's capacity. A conventional security company with only unarmed guards cannot repel aggression. We have many success cases, such as Grupo Modelo; since we started providing our services, it has not lost a single can of beer.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The National Security Commission is a government entity that is part of the Ministry of Interior. It is focused on ensuring public security in the country and regulating private security companies. Private security, in the preventive aspect, takes on roles that were in the past limited to public security or that are new, such as cybersecurity. Therefore, the work of consultancy and developing software protection is being done by private entities. For this reason, the federal government has the National Private Security Commission to identify and regulate companies that, together with the state, offer security to those that need extra protection. The creation of this sector in Mexico had to do with the industrial security and the prevention of internal losses, starting with guards at access points of the company; later, there were protection measures around the perimeters and other areas of specialization. With globalization, Mexican companies have embarked on a dynamic of modernization and established modern schemes of protection with international firms.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Mexico represents our largest international operation and constitutes 30% of the total volume of the corporation. Our operations in Mexico embody the quality of service that Inter-Con is known for; we recognize that our success stems from strictly adhering to these high standards. Our Mexico operation is the flagship of the company. Our client base has been tremendously diverse and will continue to diversify, considering the opening up of the gas and the energy sector and the Mexican government's encouragements. The FTA between Mexico, the US, and Canada and the shared border with the US has contributed to the diversification and expansion of our client base as well. The needs of the US population in terms of agricultural products is another factor, as Mexico is one of the largest exporters of agricultural products such as tomato or avocado. In addition to these factors, I foresee a significant growth in real estate.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Formally, we have been in business for 16 years. We saw a business opportunity in supplying formal security services. We started growing, and today we cover almost the entire country with 15 business units in the security industry. 15 years ago, there were a few players in the industry each offering practically the same services: security guards. We considered proposing different private security solutions, such as technology security. We offer our clients new solutions via diverse security models. In terms of image, we have bet large on the Control brand, which has been acknowledged by Super Brands for the second year in a row. We have positioned our brand by distinguishing ourselves from competitors; our patrols cars are matt black and we have invested in our uniforms and guards' attire. Unfortunately, the industry has an image that needs improvement, which is part of our goal.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Initially, we were successfully manufacturing fashion labels that we would sell to department stores. We later decided to create our own distribution centers and build our own stores. We started doing small-scale projects as our family was already investing in real estate and found a lack of offerings in Mexico City and the wider country; there were no good shopping centers, office buildings, or residential projects. We did our first project in Masaryk called Centro, which had the first Louis Vuitton store in Mexico. It was a great success and brought in higher-end labels and restaurants. Over the years, we have developed 67 projects in five different divisions from the ground up, including hospitality facilities, industrial parks, residential buildings, shopping malls, and office buildings.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Mexico has a large deficit of new housing. The need for new homes is much larger than the supply. Catching up with demand is a slow process, because it takes a lot of time to get new land and to convert the city. The market is huge in Mexico City, but it is not easy to develop new buildings. The regulations are quite strict and you have to know the market. The price of land has also substantially increased, meaning companies have to be efficient in terms of their value chain. It is important to develop and ensure high quality designs, no matter the segment. For each project, we do an architectural contest where we invite three different architectural firms with experience in the segment to create designs. We try to always bring new ideas into the mix. We want to make things that are beautiful and transform the neighborhood and community along with the project.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been a family business for more than 30 years. We have developed high-income residential projects; however, 10 years ago, we expanded our scope to the middle-income market, as it is almost impossible to find a site that we truly like in the high-income market. We now work on more middle-income, though again unique, projects. Our largest project is called Parques Polanco, the only project in the city with nearly 1,400 apartments as well as a large park and a shopping mall. We now focus on large, mixed-use projects. We strongly believe in architectural design and work with the top architects, most of them Mexican.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We started out as homebuilders of low-income housing. We moved from Mexico City to Querétaro to start the business because Querétaro, at the time, did not have many companies in the segment. We were able to grow steadily; however, the turning point and critical factor that went into growing in those years were strategic alliances. Since the beginning, we have been big in creating joint ventures (JVs) with international companies. When we were building these low-income housing operations, we were able to partner with a US company who at that point was entering the Mexican market and we decided to create a JV with them. We were part of that JV until 2004. Then we exited and formed a new JV, this time in the industrial real estate sector, to build Parque Industrial Querétaro. This is now the largest park in Querétaro and represents around 30% of wages reported to the social security in Querétaro, as we have over 36,000 employees at the park.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The first member of the Mariscal family to come to Mexico came in the 1700s. When Mexico began expanding its road system in the 1800s, our great-great grandfather was in charge of constructing some of these. Our grandfather's generation founded Marhnos in 1954. The company focused on building hotels, and Marhnos built many of the original buildings in Acapulco. The most high-profile project the company worked on in its first chapter (1954-1974) was the American Embassy building in Mexico City in 1963. After this, the US became an important client for us because we built the consulates in Guadalajara, Tijuana, and Monterrey. We also built the embassies in Guatemala and El Salvador. The US government is an example of the kind of client we like to form a close and lasting relationship with.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>It has been a successful year. Over the last three years, we have been able to double our top line results while quadrupling our bottom line. In 2017, we will reach almost USD200 million in revenue in Mexico. The quality of the last year is reflected in all our market segments: air, land, and sea. We have also added some country logistics and new business segments like customs brokerage and project cargo. Apart from the growth in our traditional business segments, we have been gaining market share in these two new segments. The Mexican market is still growing, though perhaps not at the pace we might wish for. For us, the major factor has been capturing market share, because we have already outgrown the market in all segments. We have also been able to do this without reducing margins—and typically it is one or the other. In this case, we have grown and maintained the same level of profitability.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>GRUPO AMPM just turned 26, and are thus still in our first generation as a firm. The idea to set up GRUPO AMPM came right after I finished my studies at the Panamerican University. We saw the need to improve delivery times and the quality of services in the logistics sector in Mexico. On top of that, we saw that prices were too expensive for these services. I initially proposed to the university rector that we create a messaging and logistics area within the institution, but he suggested that I set up my own company instead. We began by offering the same service at the same price as our competitor, the Mexican Postal Service, but delivering twice as fast as them. We saw many customers initially opting for the postal service, but after hearing good feedback and recommendations, they ended up switching to Grupo AMPM. Technologies were not as developed as now, and handwritten letters were still one of the main means of communication. Thanks to our fast services, our customers grew—and so did we.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our services are focused on providing solutions for the delivery and distribution of e-commerce merchandise to large cities that have serious problems with traffic. That makes us a fundamental element in the innovation of urban logistics. The core mission of Paquete LIT is to provide each and every client with fast and flexible solutions adapted to individuals' specific needs. AeroXpress is our most innovative service, as it offers the user same-day delivery from one city to another. After 72 years of history in transport, our group of companies has found a solution for urgent service, helping us lead in logistics and distribution at the national and international level. Paquete LIT has a clear growth plan aimed a growing hand-in hand with the growth of e-commerce and focusing on growing with our clients who require high standards of punctuality and excellence in distribution and urban logistics.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Dextra was established in 1997 as part of a large corporation called the Pulsar Group with the purpose of providing software development engineering for emerging technology companies in Silicon Valley. In 2003, an investor and I took over the company, which was in bad shape as a result of the dot com implosion; however, we have since acquired valuable experience and strong talent along the way that has helped us gain momentum with larger companies in the telecom sector. Nokia, at the time, was the world leader in the phone market, but did not have any relevant third-party Symbian expertise in the Americas, the operating system then used in those phones. We started working with it on Symbian engineering and grew with Nokia, who outsourced its chips to Texas Instruments. We then worked with Texas Instruments as well and also started growing with Hewlett Packard in its Global Delivery Center in Guadalajara. Right now, we are focused on the US market, with 80% of our revenue coming from US-based engagements.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dimension Data was founded more than 30 years ago in Johannesburg, South Africa, dedicated to the sale of solutions in the information and communications industry through important partners like Cisco. We started to expand into other countries in Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Today, we have a direct presence in almost 60 countries and have partnerships in over 120 to support our clients. Six years ago, the company was bought by NTT, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world and based in Japan, whose customer solutions and global markets we now complement. From the beginning to the end of a project, we are able to cover everything our global clients need. About 50% of our business comes from international clients because we can provide worldwide solutions. Some are centralized and require us to fulfill everything in the same way across the world. Finally, there are domestic clients that are typically large enterprise and government institutions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>When it was set up 32 years ago, CompuSoluciones only did consultancy software development and training. We did not sell hardware or software; however, over time we found an opportunity for software and training and thus CompuSoluciones became a value-added reseller for ICT. From the beginning, we were selling to end-users, and HP subsequently approached us. HP in Mexico had an operation but could not go to all the resellers it was reaching. It invited us to adopt some resellers within Guadalajara. We decided to close the end-user initiatives and distribute everything through resellers, becoming a value-added distributor. We thus managed to grow significantly in value-added distribution and now have a strong growing operation. In general, the ICT market is in constant evolution. In 1989, there were no cell phones, mobile computers, or internet. Since the sector is in constant evolution our work is extremely exciting. New technologies are being introduced almost every day.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The software trend in Mexico is positive compared to other countries, because it adjusts well when crises arrive. Different industries are trying to do more with less, and the only way you can do that is to simplify; once you simplify, you try to change processes and, later, to automate. Software has been helped as an industry because cost pressures are high, the political costs are uncertain, and now that we are 18 months away from changing presidents, everybody is struggling, and there is uncertainty. We are trying to do as much as possible with the government for the next four months because then we have to switch to the private sector and better adjust to the government's change. BMC is a company that helps other companies become digital in every way, starting from the multi-cloud environment, which is our core and our heart. After that, we can branch out into different parts, such as security, big data management, and mobile, for example.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We got our start in Guadalajara as a bit of a coincidence. Guadalajara is a startup center because there are industries related to electronics, such as HP, IBM, Kodak, and Motorola. When electronics came to Guadalajara a different type of people arrived. People were more open to global thinking because these companies sold worldwide. That started to change the entrepreneur system here because a lot of companies started to sell something to these global IT manufacturing companies like IBM. Then more universities such as Tech de Monterrey arrived, and we had a much larger number of professionals, especially in regard to engineering. Our premise getting started was simple: online accountancy software. Now, 33 years after the creation of the first company, we have an ecosystem including myself. We have almost a million clients and hope to reach that level by the end of this year. We have a huge network with 250 major distributors and 3,000 associates.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>My business partner and I established Sferea eight years ago. When we started, we were trying to develop video games for consoles—an ambitious goal. We started doing advert gaming, which is a mixture between games and advertising and worked with Grey Group, an international marketing agency. We also created some video games with Hasbro, one of our first customers. The problem with this type of work for marketing agencies is that their budgets are very limited. Then, we worked with Televisa making mobile games for subscribers based on telenovelas. We switched from the video game to the mobile market. We also began creating games in partnership with some global brands.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Elotevisual was created over 14 years ago. I was living in Granada, Spain, and working for a design agency, and clients would occasionally ask me for my business card to do freelance work. I designed some business cards that only bore my name, before thinking I should create a name for my business so that people could recognize me even if doing freelancing. That is when Elotevisual came into being. In Spain, I gave this name a slogan: Elotevisual—designs with Mexican taste, which is representative of my work. I came back to Mexico in 2002 and it was here that I started to polish this idea. We work mainly with the pharmaceutical industry, with companies such as Takeda, AstraZeneca, Abbot, Pfizer, Sanofi, Farmasa Schwabe, and Novo Nordisk. We have also worked with other clients from different industries, such as Cinemex, Cinepolis, Bombardier, and Herdez. We have been trying to diversify our work since some clients categorize us as a pharmaceutical design company, a label we want to avoid.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>I founded Ironbit with three other partners in 2005. We started working with customized systems for our clients. In 2007, we shifted our focus to new technologies, starting with mobile applications. BlackBerry was our best partner at the time. We developed mobile applications for them. We were developing mobile applications even before the first iPhone was launched on the market. We worked with Android and iOS and moved with the market. In 2009, we got involved in another new technology called cloud computing, which is now commonplace. We worked on the first implementation in Latin America for Microsoft's Windows Azure, which is their cloud computing platform technology. We started to grow rapidly, almost 30% YoY, covering these new technologies for numerous corporations in Mexico.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Istarted working at Procter &amp; Gamble in the statistics area for its market research and consumer knowledge department. I left Procter &amp; Gamble but continued as a consultant. I had a partner who was excellent with computers and at programming, and the two of us were focused on business and statistical models. We stopped working with Procter &amp; Gamble at one point due to budget cuts. Since we had a lot of spare time, we started developing mobile applications, making some for Palm, Nokia, and Blackberry, including Java-based Blackberries. We hit gold in 2008 when the iPhone came onto the market. We were the only ones developing applications here. We developed the first two Mexican applications for the app store, which were El Universal and Milenio, two very important newspapers in Mexico. By then, we already had Procter &amp; Gamble and El Universal in our portfolio. Other interested companies started to contact us. We started developing apps for media and content delivery applications, and did work for some of the most important media companies in Mexico.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company was founded by two brothers in 1994. They started making standard carbide end mills before developing their people. They were capable of making both standard and special tools. GyG has one of the most competitive structures in terms of people and processes for designing special tools. We are one of the few Mexican firms, if not the only one, capable of developing integrated projects. Once we know our customers' needs, we design the process, manufacture, and supply of the tools they require. We started as a small factory for standard tools before going into special tools; now we integrate projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Kaeser is a third-generation, privately owned company that will turn 100 in two years. We started operations in Mexico in 1995 and have been growing ever since. Our strategy is to develop the most efficient and least expensive compressed air system on the market. This does not mean the lowest-priced compressors, but the lowest cost of ownership; the ownership of our equipment service is an important factor, but energy consumption also represents around 70% of the total cost of ownership, which is where we make a difference in the field. When we started, we had 13 employees, and it was a small operation. Our global philosophy of Kaeser is to reinvest whatever profits we make back into that country. We have grown from a 250sqm warehouse to more than 5,000sqm, making it clear that Kaeser is investing for the long term. We have offices in Mexico City, Guadalajara, San Luis Potosí­, Chihuahua, and Mérida, in addition to dealers in the rest of the country.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We mainly manufacture for agribusinesses, including agriculture and cattle farming, mostly in terms of infrastructure. In the agricultural sector, we sell products for grape cultivation, protection against diseases, and climatology, among others. For cattle farming, we sell barnyards, fences, water tanks, and so on. There are about eight business groups that lead the state of Sonora and are expanding into others. For us, these eight large groups are as important as all the small businesses, and we work with all of them. Every business is different, and we have to assist them accordingly.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>ProAutomation was founded in 2007 when I was in a period of transition. There was a major opportunity in the marketplace to provide engineering solutions, and I wanted to offer the market turnkey solutions. In the beginning, it was difficult, as the global recession struck in 2008 and 2009 and hit the automotive industry particularly hard. However, we persevered and kept our nose to the grindstone, and in 2010 we received our first large contract. Since then, we have grown every year, often doubling our YoY growth and worked on projects across the world. Our workforce has also doubled and now has over 70 staff members. In 2016, we had USD6 million in revenue; we should pass USD10 million in 2017. Our client base is driven by friendship and networking. Our networking operations truly started to flourish when my partner Mark Marchand joined the company in 2013. His background is in robotics supervision and engineering, and we were able to leverage his relationships and know-how to exponentially grow in the last three years.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are four basic elements that Mexico has been presenting as its major credentials to investors. The first and foremost is location. This is key, because of the ability to easily export to the US and Canada, as well as the Latin American market. Second is the network of trade agreements that we have. Mexico has agreements around the globe and enjoys free trade with more than 40 countries. And the ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would also offer huge benefits. Third is our robust world-class supplier base. We have a tremendous supplier base that is the number one supplier of auto parts for the US market today. We are also the fifth-largest producer of auto parts in the world and the seventh-largest producer of vehicles. Finally, Mexico has world-class human resources when it comes to technicians and engineers. These all make Mexico attractive to foreign investors.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are the second to do so after Mastretta. Not many entrepreneurs go into this business, certainly not in Mexico. My family background is all in the automotive on my father's side. The latter not only raced cars, but also designed and constructed them. All the members of my mother's family are artists. Therefore, my brother and I started a company in 2007 as a design and engineering consultancy, but really aimed to make sports cars in the future. We were lucky to have the partners, team, and capital ready to start Vuhl 05 in 2010. We programmed a three-year development project in three different stages to ensure we could have this car launched worldwide in that timeframe. In 2013, we launched the car in the UK and in 2014 decided to homologate the car in several places, starting with Mexico and the UK.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our chairman and CEO are individuals who are driving ideas and ambitions. Today, Volvo is based on idea pools; people are stepping up and challenging and criticizing if they feel it is necessary. We are not afraid to speak our minds, and ideas and initiatives are incentivized. Our design team was given free rein and the financial backing to design its dream car, which is how our new product line with the S90 and XC90 was created. In addition, Volvo came up with the idea of a whole product line with one engine and one gearbox. Swedish engineers had never been given the opportunity to think outside the box during the Ford ownership, but now they were. As a result, they created something unique. That is an example of how a company can be transformed: by turning it upside down, giving people the freedom and the opportunities to speak, and investing money.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Hyundai is now well positioned for a market like Mexico in many ways. It has the right design and style that Mexican consumers seek. It is refreshing and modern; we call it modern premium. Our cars are well equipped and have great audio navigation capabilities. Our vehicles come with a five-year warranty, which is better than the great majority of players in the market. We also establish a strong after-sales process, so customers can come back to the dealership and experience great customer service. Our parts fill rate is 98%, one of the best in the market. Moreover, we have a strong partnership with Bancomer and have been able to supply great credit capabilities to consumers. In 2016, our market share in credit operation was 53%, which is extremely high. We also expanded quickly and now have 50 dealerships nationwide. Mexico is the 12th or 13th market in domestic sales, which was not always the case. This market has a great opportunity for expansion.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Since the beginning, Honda Motors has had a culture of localizing production where we have demand. Under this philosophy, we started the business in Mexico in 1985, when we established Honda de Mexico. First, we started the mass production of motorcycles in 1987 and subsequently added other businesses before beginning mass automobile production in 1995 at our factory in Guadalajara. Now, we have another factory in Celaya to reinforce local and global production. We have another factory in Guadalajara, so when we had a project to establish another factory in Mexico, the first priority was property at a good price. We were not able to find it initially so we looked countrywide. Another important aspect was logistics, meaning that railway and road connections were a key factor. We have many young associates around 22-23 with high levels of passion and confidence in México. Once we conduct training to impart great skills, there will be competitive associates worldwide.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company has grown tremendously; 13 years ago, our revenue was USD200 million and is now USD5.4 billion; we were in two countries and now are in 37. We have been creating a global company, process-, talent-, and cultural-wise, while also creating a single company from a group of companies that we acquired. A second highlight is the transformation of our product line; we have focused on growing what we call the downstream. People know Mexichem as a chemical company; over 50% of our revenues are products that are sold downstream in hardware stores and construction companies. Finally, as a chemical producer, we want to be the most cost efficient. We have also been building a plant in Texas, the largest investment in our history. After four years of construction it recently began operations, making Mexichem one of the most cost efficient PVC producers in the world. Abroad, the response to our being a Mexican company has been mixed. This was a cultural encounter that forced us to be better than other companies. We have worked a great deal on the way we do business; we publish our code of ethics on our website; we publish our results in dollars; we report to the Mexican Stock Exchange in dollars, and we manage it like any other multinational firm. We base our results on three pillars: financial, environmental, and social.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started this company in 1998 as a paper merchant. As the years went by, paper was still a good business; however, we started to see its demise coming and began looking for new opportunities where we could use the skills that we had acquired selling paper. The chemical distribution business has a lot of overlap in terms of how to handle working capital, provide credit, and deal with large overseas suppliers. At the end of 2005, we partnered with Mexichem and bought Dermet, a publicly traded chemicals distributor that was in financial distress. We spent a couple of years turning it around and then ended the partnership with Mexichem. Since then, we have continued growing through acquisitions to cover different segments and countries. Our most recent acquisition was Conjunto LAR, a home care and personal care products supplier. Before that we acquired Coremal, a Brazilian distribution company. Our strategy has always been to diversify. Our five largest customers represent less than 6% of our sales, and our five largest products represent less than 10% of sales. That has really allowed us to survive peaks and ebbs in the market. Among the challenges we face, exchange rates have been the hardest. You start to deal with a whole new risk, particularly with Brazil. Another is the ability to navigate strange environments.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our chief characteristic as a company is our ability to innovate the most and develops auxiliary products for construction, our business line. We have three specialized labs with skilled people and have 240 products that are diversified. The idea is that a construction project can find all chemical and related products with us. We produce paint, texturized finishing, polyurethane glue for floors, and elastic sealers; we also have paints especially designed to prevent fires from causing buildings to collapse, for example. We are the only ones in the field that have this much innovation; this is the spinal cord of our company. We have patents for some of these products, especially for those that can be copied easily. In terms of competitive advantages, we have come out with new technologies and products that have been well received all over the world, such as the elastic sealants with a latex base. We are in contact with construction firms, installers, and distributors and have a training center in which we teach people who are going to do the construction how to obtain better results in their projects, whatever type of construction it is. This gives us prestige. We have 20 distribution centers, each of which has 100-200 distributors or installers, so our customers can access products easily and rapidly.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>After Spain, Mexico is the most important country in terms of energy. We are now operating five projects in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. We have a project operating in Nuevo Leon. We have also El Cortijo under construction and Puerto Libertad, while Sonora is in a preliminary stage. We have evolved very much. We used to be a company that had vertically integrated the production of wind generators, but sold this company. We were specialists in EPC. We stay with our know-how, which is the development of renewable energy projects. In the future, we will be present in tenders and try to win projects. In the last 10 years, we have built projects of 812MW. We are capable of starting an average of 100MW every year. Going step by step we are able to fulfill the needs of every project. In our experience, we have learned that it is difficult to take on large projects because of the current conditions of infrastructure, the size of the country, and the complexity of projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>AMDEE started out just as a group of developers of new projects who were seeking to structure, together with the government, the legal and regulatory framework for the sector. Once this was completed, we started working to attract investment and develop the supply and network. Now, with many wind projects built and others under construction, we are attracting new colleagues from different sectors, including investors, financial institutions, service providers, environmental, legal, and technical consultants, and manufacturers. AMDEE works on the development and growth of the wind power industry in Mexico, but this has many challenges. We have nearly 100 members today and the needs of our group have evolved over time. We have also seen a remarkable evolution in wind power technology since our establishment. Wind technology has advanced to cope with the lower wind profiles found in many Mexican states and it has become extremely competitive, despite the low cost of natural gas as an energy source.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The energy business is the most strategic for us currently. We seek to do many projects with Pemex. The things it asks for, however, are tough for us. We are not a huge company. We do investments; however, the bonus it was seeking was USD26-28 million. We are not that large yet to be in such business. Instead, we are looking toward solar. We have already hired people to work in that area, although we are still a little skeptical. If we want this project to work, it depends on certain cells; if we can sell the cells to the market, it can work. We are looking into it a great deal. If we consider the three projects we are bidding on now, the investment could reach around USD150 million. The Argentina project is also requiring an investment of around USD140 million. Thus, I do not believe we really have space to invest in too many other areas. The day-to-day business is doing well and growing.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Iberdrola has bet on Mexico for the long term; we seek to establish lasting agreements with the countries that we are based in, which include Brazil, the US, the UK, and Mexico. We have been here for almost 19 years and were the first and largest client of CFE, the Mexican power utility, in generating electricity for CFE; it is still our best customer. We produce electricity and 80% of what we produce is for CFE. The mix is changing and with the open market now we sell more electricity to the open market with the idea of being the largest producer in the private sector. We are now the largest producer from the private sector. We generate around 15% of total electricity, which means 20 million Mexicans benefit from the electricity being generated by Iberdrola. Over the past few years, Mexico has changed significantly; however, what has not changed is the stability of the country and the long-term growth that we have seen in the internal market.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>AES was the first independent power producer (IPP) in Mexico. We arrived in 1997, winning the first auction for a private company, for our plant in Merida. Since then, we acquired two other projects in 2007, two plants under the self-supply regime which supply power to Cemex and Peñoles. We have been around for 15 years now and we are redefining our strategy to grow our portfolio in Mexico. We are focusing our efforts in three growth drivers. The first is conventional natural gas power, which includes co-generation plants and combined cycles. The second is renewables, which is key for us, and renewables are complemented with our patented product in energy storage, the large batteries that we have worldwide and that we are now trying to bring to Mexico. Renewables are mainly wind and solar. The third driver is our small-scale LNG facilities. We intend to put up small-scale LNG production facilities to distribute to key segments of the industrial sector. We want to speed up the creation of a greener world.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The possibility of continued growth goes in line with financial education. Today, financial companies, no matter if they are banks or insurance companies, have been much more proactive in creating awareness on the fact that insurance products are not an expense but a necessary investment, one which ultimately helps an individual avoid patrimonial loss. The factors for growth in the coming years, for Bupa specifically, are the upcoming generations. One of the areas where Bupa is relevant, and successful in Mexico and globally, is that we have a clear mission; we promote longer, healthier, and happier lives, and provide major medical insurance locally, and internationally, such is the case for Bupa Global major medical insurance. The average age of our customers is a little over 40, but we now need to look into the individuals under the age of 40, and digital tools represent an important way to talk to this segment of the population. Financial education, focusing on important issues such as health, being present in the new generation's lives, and speaking their same language are all important factors. Around 30% of people are under the age of 21 and this gives us a glimpse of the estimated 20 million people that will turn 21 in the coming years, giving us a great glimpse of the potential that is out there for Bupa.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When we started in Mexico, the penetration of the insurance market, according to the GDP, was 1.8%. Today, we have 2.4% penetration, demonstrating the growth of insurance. For Zurich, what we pursue currently in Mexico is to bring knowledge to the market and to make Mexicans aware of the risks they have in the country. We want them to learn how to mitigate these risks for them and their families. For Zurich, Mexico was a good opportunity to come to Latin America and to Mexico. In the last eight to 10 years, more than 60 million people have gone from poverty to entering the middle class. This country is growing fast in terms of people with purchasing power. We are trying to show Mexicans how to mitigate risks related to the economy, climate factors, and crime. Zurich was active in international business and international companies with insurance needs for many countries at the same time. However, we did not have products and distribution channels for retail. Considering this huge growth of the middle class, the best tool to prevent this entry-level middle class from returning to poverty is insurance. We started with six branches in the country and fewer than 100 independent agents working for Zurich. In 2017, we will finish with over 80 branches in the country and close to 5,000 agents.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Sura makes a great effort to recognize and cater to the uniqueness of every market, though all under the same company DNA. The company has relentless focus on internal talent and its people as well as its clients. It does not only look at quarterly results, but has a solid long-term vision, preparing the future of the company, preparing for innovations in markets, in economics, in technology, and so on. The Mexican market is the second largest in Latin America, while also being one of the least- penetrated markets; there is a great deal of potential to grow. We have focused on what we believe is the most important fields and products for this market. Insurance companies have to work together to change people's perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge of insurance. That is what we need to focus on now, and when market penetration is up and insurance is where it needs to be, we can be concerned about market share and how we perform relative to our rivals. Also, there are few agents, only three agents per 10,000 people. Importing the SURA model out of Colombia, we seek to make the insurance business more appealing, especially for younger people. We need to be more aligned with market needs and generate not products but solutions. Regulations, meanwhile, also need to be up to date.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We created Exitus Capital to provide financing to SMEs and developed a completely electronic system that had never been used before. Our customers have to meet with our sales staff just once; then we give credit and collect payments from them electronically. Customers authorize us to go into their accounts once a month to deduct our pre-authorized amount. We are the first and leading company applying this approach. This form of on-going credit contract with Exitus Credit is convenient for retired people, who do not want to go into a bank branch to reorganize their finances every month. We developed our own independent electronic collection system.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Started Financiera Contigo in 2010 after selling several companies involved in SME and payroll loans. I saw an opportunity in micro-finance to set up a company that could benefit all its stakeholders; our mission is to change the lives of our employees, clients, shareholders, and suppliers. Regardless of the size of the other companies we have in our loan portfolio, the size of the market we were attending to was small and not aligned with the values I grew up with. In the micro-finance sector, I found the opportunity to create a company that did this.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>SOFOMs can be split into two areas. The first types are those that receive institutional funding and are mostly regulated. In our case, we are regulated in terms of capitalization according to BASEL III, which covers outstanding loans and corporate governance. On the other hand, some SOFOMs put in their own capital and want non-performing loans. Those SOFOMs should not be regulated because they are risking their own money, not government or public money. SOFOMs are important because there are only 40 or 50 banks in Mexico and they cannot cover all the financing demands. We need to professionalize the supply; therefore, we can meet the demand.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In-Credit is a 100% Mexican company and it has grown from strength to strength on an annual basis. Our main focus is to exceed our customers' expectations in terms of customer service. We focus specifically on leasing and auto-finance for high-end vehicles. For us, customer service is critical in terms of having a quick response time, making a great credit decision for customers, and, once the customer is in our system, giving them easy access to our customer service representatives, which is outsourced as a strategy in order to have a proper technology and to service customers satisfactorily.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Despite being created as an arm of our real estate firm, Economí­zate is now stronger in payroll loans. In 2016, after a year and a half of preparation, we were audited by PwC, obtaining a positive qualification, and we received a 10/10 qualification by CONDUSEF. We had 200 customers in 2016 and our goal for 2017 is to double this number. The idea behind payroll loans is to contact companies and offer them financing for their employees, with these companies responsible for the repayment of loans. This translates into an employment benefit that simultaneously helps us reduce risks and creates a healthy credit collocation.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Mexico City already has an advanced lighting infrastructure. We are working with the city to develop ways for them to utilize the systems they have in the most efficient, effective, and productive ways. For example, during breast cancer awareness month the city could turn its monuments pink. The city now has the freedom to utilize its technology in a creative way while simultaneously getting important messages to the public. We have entered a new era, and we are no longer just selling basic lighting products; we design and implement complete lighting systems that add value and quality to consumers' lives. Mexico has more Philips Lighting manufacturing sites than any country in Latin America. We have four large facilities and over 4,000 employees. We have a large plant in Tijuana, two plants in Chihuahua, and our newest plant is near Monterrey. With these four factories we develop all the lighting portfolios across the Americas. Though most of these facilities' output is exported to the US, we serve Mexico and Latin America.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are several things that set Mexico apart from the rest of the world. In Honeywell there is a group of countries denominated as high-growth regions. Mexico is in the top five along with China, India, Brazil, and Russia. One of the most exciting things about Mexico is its diverse economic base. Automotive is where manufacturing really took off, but it has since spread into aerospace and other sectors. This diversity gives the country less of a risk profile and more of an opportunity and growth profile. As Mexico develops its infrastructure and education, we will see much more growth in the southern areas, which could be a profitable area of investment and could lead to real, sustainable development. One of the first places we entered in the Mexican market was Tijuana but we have presence in cities like Chihuahua, Ciudad Juarez, San Luis Potosi, Mexicali, Monterrey, and Mexico City.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Masisa is part of a company that has a strong presence in Latin American operations. We arrived in Mexico in 2001. In the beginning, it was difficult to introduce our materials in Mexico, as the way construction was being done was different than it is now. We were the first to introduce Chilean technology and promote the use of such products. Of the countries where MASISA has operations, Mexico is number one. We are extremely happy that our board of directors has confidence in us and has invested in Mexico while our competitors were investing in other countries such as Brazil and Chile. The economic situation in Mexico, despite certain macroeconomic issues, is the most important in the region. The trade balance is negative because Mexico imports a great deal of furniture from other countries like China and the US. With such an investment MASISA Mexico seeks to promote the local industry and generate jobs. It is also important to give local designers who can introduce Mexican design an opportunity.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>PepsiCo has grown alongside Mexican families for more than 100 years, which illustrates just how important the Mexican market has been for us. Throughout the years, we have grown through acquisitions at both a global and domestic level. We operate under a multi-category business that has been around for many years. Our portfolio is composed of many of the country's most-loved brands nationwide like Sabritas, Quaker, Gamesa, and Sonric's. We have a great deal of respect from our consumers and are extremely proud to be close to Mexican families. We have a huge agriculture footprint in Mexico, being an agro-industrial company, and have great partners working with us in order to develop, not only new and better products, but also providing access to quality agricultural programs. I visit our farms every single year to talk to our suppliers and partners, and this brings us close to where our products are coming from. Agro has a huge growth potential here in Mexico.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Mexico has different contributions to the company strategy between sales and revenues. Mexico is one of the top countries for Schneider Electric for many reasons. We employ more than 9,000 people in the country and have 12 facilities that are primarily focused on products for both export and parts for the local market. Mexico has demonstrated a high level of quality and engagement with world-class manufacturing since 1994. The footprint for Schneider in Mexico has increased significantly in this timeframe in terms of manufacturing; we also have close to 300 engineers working for Schneider in Monterrey in our R&amp;D center. This center has the latest R&amp;D technology and is why Schneider continues to invest in Mexico, as it has proven to be a country that provides value for the investment and growth that we have experienced in terms of sales, employees, and exports.

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We started exporting semi-processed fabric to the US in 1986, before NAFTA. We were growing faster than the domestic market could absorb and had two choices: to pause our growth or export to foreign markets. We tried to look for markets in Central American and the Caribbean; however, they were too small and informal, which is why we decided to explore the US. Business was great even before NAFTA and with tariffs on fabric of 4.5-7%. Today, we have settled in that market. We have an office in New York with 20 employees and a distribution center in North Carolina with 40 people. We also acquired a Japanese company to distribute our products. In the 32 years we have been exporting, we have not had any products returned for bad quality. After NAFTA, we started producing denim. We approached Levi's, which agreed to have us produce its goods. A decade later, our American competitors began to produce clothing. We have around 20 clients in the US, four or five of which take 80% of what we export.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>By the end of 2013 we had already consolidated our position in the domestic market of Mexico and were the second-largest Mexican carrier. Since 2011 we have started an intense internationalization, and in the last two years, 100% of our growth has been in the international market. We are now in the US with new bilateral agreements flying to New York, Miami, Orlando-Sanford, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Los Angeles. All across Latin America, Mexico has bilateral agreements with different countries, and we still have to deal with the existing terms of each agreement. Guatemala was our very first international operation. We opened our first service into Guatemala and then followed with Costa Rica. We then opened a route to Bogotá and now also fly to Lima. In the Caribbean, Interjet is the leading Mexican airline covering Cuba and serves Havana, Varadero, and Santa Clara. Once tourism picks up in Cuba, this will be a huge opportunity for us.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 1999 we only had bathroom faucets and fittings and in 2010 we started building a chinaware operation and subsequently a mid-range segment for faucets and fittings as well as kitchens and closets and doors. This has been highly successful so far. In terms of international expansion, we have mainly focused on Spanish-language countries because they have a similar culture, a similar way of thinking, and similar tastes. It has been encouraging and we have found the way to enter those markets. We have a huge challenge to conquer the US and Canada, and we have a special strategy in order to get into those countries as well. At this point in time, our strategy has been to look south; however, we are starting to look north as well. We are still only focused on this continent because there are still many things to be done. It is far easier to export to the US and Canada and as long as we see a potential market to grow in we will continue to focus on this segment of America.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>At the time of our founding, my father sought to become a distributor for other companies. Our main goal at that point was to have national coverage; in those days it was important. We had to open up locations everywhere in the country and establish distribution networks because one day we would have competition and the barriers of entry would be more difficult if we only had a distribution center in Mexico City. From Mexico, we moved to Central and South America a little more than 10 years ago, and today we are in Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Peru. Recently, we just acquired a company in Canada. We started as a distribution company; however, we realized that we needed to manufacture certain products that we sell, mainly because of freight and other reasons, so we had to produce them in Mexico. We produce products under license agreements from the original designers or manufacturers, but the most important thing to is to understand the know-how of everything we build.</p>]]></sections31>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you view the integration of SMEs into international value chains, and how important is this for ProMexico?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FRANCISCO GONZALEZ DIAZ P</strong>roMexico looks for more investment to come into Mexico that will create a lasting impact. This impact is seen through suppliers and the creation of a value chain with the right certifications, talent, and products to assist companies that are investing. To do so, we have created a program called ACT, which helps suppliers develop the products companies need. We look for medium-sized Mexican companies that can integrate the supply chains of larger companies. This means we not only seek Tier 1 suppliers, which are direct suppliers, but also Tier 2 and further down. We have a methodology to identify the right suppliers with the private sector, which has had great success. For smaller companies, we have the RedExporta program, which unites smaller companies to reach a homogeneous level of product quality. We have brought companies together in order to analyze the requirements of larger companies and present proposals. This permits a more coordinated offering and allows larger companies to deal with one group, instead of dealing with multiple potential suppliers.</p><h4>What is the importance of SME development within the Mexican economy?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FGD </strong>Around 89% of production comes from SMEs; however, big companies largely focus on technological development. If these two cannot join, we will not have jobs that offer added value. This will make us less competitive globally and relegate us in terms of trade. Mexico has received much foreign investment and has set a benchmark to compete with the world. SMEs employ the most people, produce the most, and provide the most taxes; however, SMEs cannot be competitive without a clear proposal.</p><h4>What is the importance for CEEG members and Airbus to see SMEs integrate within international value chains?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FREDERIC Garcí­a</strong> The integration of local and international value chains is extremely important. Due to a wide number of FTAs, Mexico is one of the most open economies in the world. This is also a result of successive reforms, including energy and telecommunications. According to the World Bank, free trade has brought 1 billion people out of poverty in the last 20 years. This shows Mexico is on the right track, largely by integrating itself into global value chains. We believe that by 2030 Mexico could be among the top five exporters in the world. This vision necessarily implies that global companies will help Mexican SMEs enter global value chains to help us become more competitive.</p><p><span></span><strong>EDUARDO J. SOLIS </strong>According to INEGI, added-value reached over 50% in Mexican plants. However, the main Tier 1 automotive suppliers import over 85% of their goods. Tier 2 suppliers, who need high levels of certification and quality control, are not present. Mexico does have some companies that provide demanding processes, but they are not yet on the level needed by the automotive process. This integration could bring in between USD20 and USD30 billion of additional revenue. Global companies have high levels of quality and certification and are not necessarily looking to change suppliers. We cannot just enter and make them switch their leading suppliers. However, we can absolutely integrate Mexican SMEs, just as SMEs are participating outside of Mexico. This is a challenge for us all—in industry, government, and academia. </p><h4>What challenges do you face with SMEs and local providers within CEEG and Airbus?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FG </strong>Today, around 400 aerospace companies are present in Mexico, and exports topped USD6 billion in 2015. It is estimated that in the next 20 years the market for passenger planes of over 100 seats will reach USD4.5 trillion. Of this, 70% comes from suppliers. Today, Mexico is close to 5% of the global aerospace supply chain. If the private and public sector come together, we estimate this number could reach 10%, or an export potential of around USD300 billion in Mexico. The energy reform sought to bring in USD60 billion in foreign investment to Mexico, yet the aerospace supply opportunity is five times higher. However, there are challenges. Less than 15% of companies in the Mexican aerospace value chain are Mexican. We have to grow this rate to increase the country's added value manufacturing. The second challenge is compliance. Many companies float on stock exchanges, which are highly adverse to risk. If a global company finds itself involved in a corruption or social irresponsibility case in any of its markets, its stock price will be affected, even if the case is not proven. Faced with this reality, companies try to reduce risk along their entire supply chain. If new suppliers want to enter those value chains, their culture and track record of compliance must stand up to scrutiny, even before looking at their capacity or certification. The public and private sectors must help SMEs to develop their culture of compliance. This will open the doors for them to enter global supply chains and better levels of financing, not to mention develop a culture of legality and formality. </p><h4>What are the advantages for a global company in Mexico to work with local SMEs?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FGD</strong> The business development environment in Mexico allows us to aim for global benchmarks, take on best practices, and pass them on to SMEs. The advantage of having international automakers allows for the best practices to become standardized. This also brings up the need for better talent and infrastructure for companies to move up the value chain. At ProMexico, we are seeing what new materials, processes, and technologies can be used to develop Mexican companies and bring in more foreign firms. </p><h4>What are the responsibilities of the public and private sectors in training and integrating SMEs?</h4><p><span></span><strong>FGD</strong> The public sector needs to provide training and enable access to financing. Mexico created the Institute of the Entrepreneur (INADEM), which seeks to provide all the resources needed for those who want to start a business. To certify companies, ProMexico helps SMEs get certifications. We have academia, which help us to develop talent at different levels. We also have the development of technicians in universities. Moreover, we need to train corporate governance skills within companies, especially to ensure compliance.</p><p><span></span><strong>EJS</strong> The great target of our industry is to develop suppliers at the Tier 2 level. Companies do not have the certifications, training, capital, management know-how, compliance levels, technology, or clients to reach this level. It is difficult for global companies to have supplier development departments. We understand that companies are in the business of production and are not necessarily aligned with our vision of them helping increase competitiveness in Mexico by developing suppliers. The automotive industry will grow impressively in the coming years. In 2016, Mexico will produce 3.5 million, reaching 5 million vehicles by 2020. This means that the automotive boom will continue growing. There is certainly a shared responsibility between government and companies. All the programs that the federal government has created for this purpose must be directed toward large automakers and Tier 1 suppliers. We need to convince companies that there is a good opportunity with local suppliers.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>FG</strong> There must be also a shared responsibility in the creation of jobs. Free trade has exacerbated the creation of both high-skilled, high-paid jobs and low-skilled, low-paid jobs. The challenge is now to create mid-level, intermediary jobs. ProMexico published in 2015 that Mexico needs 1 million senior technicians. It is precisely SMEs who offer jobs for these people. To overcome these challenges, the Secretariat of the Economy and ProMexico invited CEEG to join the National Committee on Productivity (CNP) to help develop best practices for productivity. We specifically worked on how to help SMEs enter and progress within global supply chains. The government and companies within CEEG are now working with us to identify companies that face difficulties and help them. This targets companies that are in the supply chains but which, due to a lack of capital, processes, talent, or other factors, are at risk of dropping out or having their contracts revoked. Secondly, we want to identify the need for supplies that are not present in Mexico, so we can work with ProMexico and bring local companies with the right processes and technology. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We always engage with the local economic system. When we run our career forum in the Middle East, we have about 50 different companies attending. Every year we conduct our management consulting practicum, where MBA participants deliver projects for local companies and organizations, both public and private. These have included global corporations, local banks, emirate-level and federal agencies, etc. We have a Career Development Center that seeks partnerships and potential placements for our students across the Middle East. Another way to source these opportunities is through research projects. We have done a number of such projects where we have engaged local partners, for example our project on the UAE's aircraft manufacturing cluster involved a large number of interviews with industry here, as well as projects from our Center for Economic Growth. We have also done quite a lot of work on governance, a field in which we lead, in the Middle East and continue to develop our capabilities in this area. In 2016, we started bringing our full-time MBA students to Abu Dhabi for residential periods; we opened 45 places and received over 100 applications, proving the strong interest from MBA students in spending time in the region. The curriculum for this program included extensive engagement with local organizations and businesses, with rewarding results for both the students and the organizations that participated.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our defined strategy begins with making contact with the best secondary schools in the UAE, the US, and around the world. We present the vision of Abu Dhabi to them, what makes NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) unique, and the core assets that make us intellectually exceptional in the educational landscape. NYUAD combines the best of a liberal arts education with a multidisciplinary approach to teaching that includes a commitment to the breadth and depth of each subject matter while instilling in students a global perspective. Our students also consider what is important in the world and what decisions are most reflective of the best ethical thought; they take on the most significant actions to them, their societies, and the institutions they represent. This means they are always thinking about what it means to do good in the world, which is what a liberal arts education is all about. We started with a class of 140 students in our first year and now have around 1,100 students. Another intrinsic aspect of our student population is its extraordinary international diversity; 14% of them are Emiratis, 13% are American, and 73% come from elsewhere around the world. Part of our education model entails not just understanding the differences between people but also finding out what they have in common in order to bridge differences and find common understanding.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>During the past 10 years of Paris-Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi, we have attracted more than 900 students from 77 different nationalities around the world. We also established an alumni association to reconnect with the 250 students that graduate annually from our university. Our anniversary was a year of consolidation for our presence as the first francophone higher institution in the UAE, the quality of our programs, and the solidification of the role of our partnering institutions, Paris Descartes and Pierre et Marie Curie University. One of the features that make us an outstanding educational institution in the region is the variety of programs we offer and the great opportunities our educational background offers our graduates once they start looking for career prospects. We recently held a statistical survey to analyze where our students were residing and the labor market they belonged to. We were astonished by how diverse the results were, with our students looking for career opportunities in different sectors. Moreover, we were happily surprised by the amount of entrepreneurs that Sorbonne Abu Dhabi has graduated. We also promote different initiatives between France and the UAE to take the entrepreneurial capacities of our students to the highest level.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have seen many of our milestones materializing over the course of this year. During 2015, we focused on becoming a leading hospital in critical care for children and set up a level-three unit for this, which was ultimately our greatest achievement over the past two years. Since the government has placed healthcare at the top of its priorities, a handful of experts have taken up the responsibility of making it work for everybody. In line with this, we have also streamlined our revenue management system and have developed our IT infrastructure in such a way that we are in line with the needs of the insurance industry. We have electronic systems and databases in place that tell parties how, who, and when to pay for a patient's treatment. We also acquired another 120-bed hospital to cater for mothers and children and will certainly serve the people of the UAE well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The UAE is becoming more innovative and creative. There has been large investment in education, entrepreneurship, and new talent. In that sense, R&amp;D will become a critical part of the country's future by contributing enormously to its economic development and will complement its core economic areas. The targets stipulated by Vision 2030 are slowly being achieved, and steadily most companies and institutions have embarked on creating a competitive business environment for all. VPS is no stranger to this long-term vision and we are happy to be contributing to this goal from our own field of activity. We are contributing to the development of R&amp;D in the country by moving out from the conventional hospital base into the manufacturing industry for the healthcare sector, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and into the manufacturing of oncology medicines, which show great potential. We have also become an IT-based hospital, which will put us in great stead for the future.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are currently managing three projects simultaneously that we aim to open in the next two years. The first is a 240,000sqm day surgery center in Al Reem Island, the largest of its kind in the Middle East with 82 clinics and over a thousand employees, which will open in April 2017. In May 2017, we will start the Burjeel Royal Hospital in Al Ain, a 100-bed facility that will serve as a cornerstone for our coverage of this part of Abu Dhabi. The third project is the Burjeel Medical City, which is set to open in May 2018. Once completed, it will feature the largest oncology hospital in the MENA region. With cancer rates increasing, we decided to take a bold step in battling this disease through four linear accelerators and access to gamma ray therapy, CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery system, brachytherapy, and bone marrow transplants that will turn this center into the number-one oncology hospital in the Middle East.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Being part of Mubadala's network of healthcare providers, we are committed to meeting the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 of satisfying patients' needs in the country by expanding our offerings. This involves recruiting top international talent, fostering a patient-centered approach to every condition we treat, and providing our physicians and specialists with the necessary tools, technologies, and processes to treat patients in house. From an R&amp;D standpoint, we have received approval for our human subject research by the Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD), and we currently have three studies underway. Innovation and channeling our experience is key for the development of Healthpoint. This is also the reason we are partnering with some of the world's finest institutions, such as Children's National Medical Center in the US, Wooridul Spine Centre in South Korea, and Manchester City Football Club in UK, as it allows us to share and transfer knowledge between international experts and our very own physicians. In order to deliver the best possible patient care we have formed collaborative relationships with a number of world-leading health organizations, including the other providers within the Mubadala network; Imperial College London Diabetes Centre (ICLDC) and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, as well as international institutions such as the Children's National Medical Center</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We had a busy year on a number of fronts. First of all, we grew and expanded physically by adding 100 beds to our hospital, bringing the number to 250. We have also greatly increased the capacity of our outpatient and ambulatory services, and have almost tripled the number of patients we see through the year. We are well known for our cardiovascular excellence, with 22 years of experience as leaders in this field. Since then we have introduced new treatments that go from robotic heart surgery for blockages of heart vessels, coronary by-pass surgery, and also for the treatment of valve disease. We also have a sophisticated treatment for all kinds of arrhythmia, including implanting wireless pacemakers to regulate the heartbeat, which are much simpler and safer. We also provide catheter-based interventions for patients too sick to undergo heart surgery. In other areas, we have also introduced unique treatments such as a 24-hour monitoring epilepsy treatment and the 24/7 treatment of strokes through a specialized center based in Abu Dhabi. We have substantially improved the outcomes of the patients through our advanced services that can remove blood clots from the brain and help stroke victims to recover better and faster, and can often be a life saving intervention.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>At ICLDC, research and public awareness go hand in hand. We feel that there are factors other than obesity that cause diabetes in the native population. The research we do seeks to discover why this is the case. Given the link between diabetes and obesity, we also study the causes behind the exponential growth of obesity in the region.  As our understanding of the condition improves, we get progressively better at adapting treatments to suit our patients' individual needs. Through our research, we know that the health challenges are due to the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles typical in hot climates, unhealthy food choices, high levels of comfort owing to the country's rapid development, as well as traditional and cultural barriers towards exercise. Our public health awareness campaigns seek to counter these trends. When it comes to diabetes prevention, our message is simple: sticking to a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy body weight, and adopting regular exercise can prevent, manage, and, in some cases, even reverse diabetes. For over 10 years, we have engaged the Abu Dhabi community and the UAE as part of the region's longest public health awareness campaign on the impact of diabetes on quality of life—Diabetes. Knowledge. Action.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Management of wastewater is a critical component for Abu Dhabi and it is a critical part of Vision 2030. The pumping station in the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Program in Abu Dhabi is our biggest project in the UAE and the one into which we channeled most of our resources in the region. The most significant area of accomplishment for us was on-site performance. Because of our productivity and progress on-site in 2016, we were able to test the pump as early as 2017. This pumping station is the most scientific and economic solution for sustainable reuse of wastewater in Abu Dhabi. The collection and treatment of water made possible by this pump will save millions of gallons of water that will in turn be reused for irrigation. The previous pump station will be dismantled, and all current wastewater retrieving mechanisms in Abu Dhabi will be consolidated into this single 40km tunnel. From here, the wastewater travels to the Wahtba facility, where it can be treated and eventually reused for irrigation. In the 21st century, water is proving to be one of the most expensive and sought-after commodities. The ability to reuse this water is very important from a financial perspective as well as an ecological and sustainability one.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Pivot brings a quality of product and a timeliness to contracts that our competitors do not. We insist upon clarity in the planning stages. For example, when we receive tender contracts there are always discrepancies between the drawings, specifications, and estimations. Because of this, our estimation department is extremely thorough and comprehensive in order to avoid confusion during these preliminary communications. Our estimation department requires the most documents and specifications of any contracting company because we need to thoroughly understand the project and have a clear communication route between our client and us. Also in our estimations, we try to price as accurately as possible. Building and sharing this vision with the client before we begin construction is essential. We must have shared objectives and goals to ensure that our delivery is properly timed and the clients' expectations are accurate. This is what we have based our reputation on, what we believe to be our biggest asset, and is something we are not willing to compromise on. Currently, we are evaluating a project where a client desires a duration of 16 months' construction but we know this is not possible and the project will take 24 months. Rather than mislead or lie to the client we are pragmatic in our assessments and honest in communicating this to them, essentially saving them money in avoiding overtime or extended fees.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The UAE as a whole has done well considering the economic pressures. However, there are distinct differences between various parts of the UAE. We see more private sector involvement in Dubai and more public spending in Abu Dhabi. Oil prices and regional instability have less economic impact when the private sector is more involved. Dubai's economy has kept going, although perhaps at a slower pace. In contrast, Abu Dhabi has continued to invest in more strategic long-term areas led by the public sector. This has led to different growth levels between the two emirates. Generally for the industry, 2016 was tough and challenging; the market still remains soft and competitive. We are seeing some of the second- and third-tier competitors disappearing because of unrealistic pricing. In the particular case of AECOM, we did well in 2016, although we see 2017 being more challenging as opportunities decline across the region. There are some factors that will stimulate the sector, such as Dubai Expo 2020, which is attracting a lot of foreign investment. When we benchmark ourselves against our competitors, we are doing fine compared to other players. Taking everything into consideration, we will take a cautious approach in 2017.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have a two-level approach to the market by serving a commercial client base, while also catering for the needs of the community. We operate a strong public service base in the northern part of the country and, through our partnership with the Ministry of Interior we operate at a Federal level with a network that spreads across the country. On the commercial side, we have a client base that includes; YasMarina Circuit, Etihad Airlines, Abu Dhabi Airport, and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. Moving forward we are looking to expand our commercial partnerships, Zayed Sports City, where we will provide emergency medical service to at least 100 events this year, and World Sports to support the ITU World Triathlon event in Abu Dhabi. We also started offering patient transfer services in Abu Dhabi and in the five northern Emirates and are looking to expand the operation of a non-emergency air ambulance service in cooperation with our partner, Abu Dhabi Aviation. Furthermore, we will continue to look for opportunities with hospitals since we add value to them by being cost-effective and have the most modern and up-to-date ambulance fleet in the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>An inherent part of our service is to offer the highest quality care possible. It is for that reason we have partnered with the National Addiction Centre in London to help in initiating and developing different services and point out the areas of opportunity. We have signed a partnership with McLean Hospital to further develop our programs. McLean is one of the world's leading psychiatric institutions, and together, we have developed our detoxification and outpatient programs as well as some programs for our female unit. We are in the process of developing a special program for adolescents that normally get assessed in six months by the McLean team. Furthermore, we are actually using the latest medication in the market for opiates detox (suboxone) and are the first country in the Middle East to use this type of medication. The medication is crucial during the first week of a detox when the patient faces a 90% decrease in the dosage to accelerate the healing process. This is a revolutionary medicine that is transforming the outpatient process for those battling addictions. We have a new state-of-the-art facility that has been designed to handle the latest developments in the field of mental health and addiction.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>AHS has maintained its goal of being the gateway for healthcare services in Abu Dhabi. Since our inception, our target has been to enhance access to care and offer quality curative and preventive care for patients, as well as sub-specialty services in our healthcare centers. One of our recent accomplishments has been reaching our target to enhance the availability of appointments to our patients within a frame of a week for general and specialty medical services and four weeks for dental specialties, as clinically indicated. We also have a walk-in system and accept everyone because we are a frontline healthcare provider. In 2016, SEHA started an initiative called “Your appointment is tomorrow,“ which provides appointments the following day, serving to reach our healthcare provision targets. As part of enhancing AHS' service offering. We introduced dedicated specialty healthcare centers such as Oud Al Touba and Al Zafaranah Diagnostic and Screening Centers and Al Towayya and Al Mushrif Children's Specialty Centers. In addition, AHS expanded its core services across its healthcare centers to include dermatology, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, in addition to family medicine. Furthermore, two centers of excellence for dermatology were established in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, and subspecialties services, such as orthopedic, ophthalmology, ENT, psychiatry, urology, and others, were introduced in the large centers across the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We work in close collaboration with ADEC and the Ministry of Higher Education to fulfill Abu Dhabi's Vision 2020. We study all the ministry reports, ADEC reports, and those from other governmental institutions to see how we can contribute to Vision 2020, to see what market demand will be like in the future, and what changes are forecast in the economy in the coming years. We work hard to ensure all our programs are viable and realistic, and once we have that assurance, we can then submit our programs to ADEC and then to the ministry for accreditation. Our incursions into the fields of engineering, health services, education, and business, for example, represent our commitment to the government's drive for diversifying the knowledge pool of our citizens and consequently the wider economy. We have plans to develop a center for innovation and entrepreneurship, which will be an important part of our future operations, especially after our move to Masdar.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Incorporating innovation can be fairly simple. We have been using 3D printers, for example, to help with teaching methods. We look closely at all the developments happening in education but are also cautious before jumping into any new trends. We conduct extensive research and pool our collective knowledge with our peers in Europe, the US, and Southeast Asia. We also push for one-on-one interactions between teachers and students to help transfer skills and knowledge. Our main focus moving forward will be helping ADEC and the Ministry of Education to establish teacher licensing along with the professional development and the assessment methods that are required to support this initiative. This incredibly important project is geared toward making the teaching profession something that people can look up to.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In consultation with key stakeholders, ACTVET has built a flexible, responsive, and quality assured industry-led national vocational education and training system. In recognition of our progress, ACTVET became the official awarding body for the UAE in 2014, not including Dubai, in order to provide students with high-quality learning opportunities and the skills required to meet the labor market demands. Our achievements are directly linked to UAE Vision 2021 and Abu Dhabi Plan. The number of TVET institutions has increased and hence the student numbers. ACTVET has developed qualifications aligned with labor market requirements, and has increased the number of licensed training providers. In addition, the cost per student has dropped dramatically, reflecting efficiency in operation. Vocational certificates have been issued in alignment with the target of creating a diversified knowledge-based economy.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>With over 30 years of presence in Abu Dhabi, we have been able to build solid working relations with customers such as ADNOC and its group of companies, EGA, TABREED, and others. We have been involved with some significant projects in the oil and gas, mining and metallurgy, infrastructure, and power sectors. Our end-to-end solutions have greatly contributed to the country's position as an engineering and construction powerhouse. We worked with EGA (EMAL &amp; DUBAL) to help boost the aluminum and industrial sectors where plants today are among the most efficient industrial sites in the world. Our regional office in Abu Dhabi serves customers across different industries, meaning that we are strategically diversified to assist in the future development of Abu Dhabi and the region. We also have our own financial and investment arm, which supports our customers' needs to structure suitable project finance appropriate to their local requirements.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Three strategic choices in our plant setup give us a major competitive advantage. For steel production (melting), our plant uses 3x30t state-of-the-art induction furnaces from Inductotherm that gives us an annual production capacity of 400,000Mt of billets. Induction furnaces, as opposed to electric arc furnaces or blast furnaces, which are the other two major steel production routes, are far cheaper to commission and operate and are more flexible. In addition to these induction furnaces, we have installed a ladle refining furnace (LRF), which is not usually associated with induction furnace technology. Through the refining process this LRF provides us additional flexibility in the scope of grades we can produce and most importantly allows us far greater flexibility in the quality of raw material we require. Finally, considering the average quality of the domestic scrap processing capacity, ferrous scrap being our major raw material, we have invested in a full fledged scrap processing unit of 450,000Mt yearly capacity, comprising a 2,000hp automobile shredder as well as a 1,000Mt heavy duty scrap shear. These three strategic choices confer us with considerable flexibility and already show clear signs of a competitive production cost in the area in which we operate. In addition, the nominal capacity of our plant was not a random choice. It corresponds to the optimal capacity to cater for domestic and GCC needs, therefore allowing us to use close to full capacity and absorb market ups and downturns whenever they occur.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>TALEX is an extrusion company that has established itself as an exclusive provider of customized hard alloys in the aluminum business, specifically for oil and gas, automotive, and aerospace projects. Our greatest accomplishment is the strategic agreement with the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH). Together, we have developed customized hard alloys exclusively provided by TALEX and supplied our overseas customers with superior mechanical properties and corrosion resistance compared to other commercial alloys. TALEX has invested more than USD200 million in expanding its capacity and will continue to invest another USD40 million within TALEX to ultimately double its manufacturing capacity. This will mean more jobs created within TALEX and a larger business portfolio.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Penspen has been present in Abu Dhabi for 38 years, and our office here delivers services across the Middle East region and also oversees our operations in Asia Pacific. The Middle East accounts for around 30% of the company's global revenue, employs approximately 350 people, and represents one of our leading engineering and project management markets. Three years ago, Penspen started a transformation process initiated by the company's new global CEO; we revisited our mission and direction as a company and identified key markets and regions where we planned to focus on. Abu Dhabi is an important market since this is the heart of the oil and gas industry and central to Penspen's Middle East strategy.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The recent fall in oil prices proved that our strategy to diversify into a broader range of services and industry sectors was the right direction for the company. We have successfully introduced new services for power, construction, and infrastructure, as well as reinforcing our support for the core oil and gas sector with new, technology-driven services, such as our proprietary range of advanced non-destructive testing techniques. Overall, we shifted to more technical service lines in comparison to previous ones. Part of this success was in direct response to a greater emphasis on productivity than in the past. We have always been a relatively low-cost organization; however, everyone was squeezed when the price of oil fell and all our customers were seeking lower prices. We continue to win new business, but market rates are generally lower so we have to do things more cost effectively.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>ALE has been established in Abu Dhabi for around 23 years. As our main base in the Middle East, we have been able to expand into Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Iraq from here. We have permanent establishments in those areas with a regional center in Abu Dhabi. We employ around 600 people, and the major sectors we cover are heavy lifting, transportation, and engineering for oil and gas, power, and petrochemical markets in the region. Over the years, we have seen a considerable increase in market competition with a much more aggressive pricing environment; however, we have maintained our strategy of ensuring the quality of our services and our prompt delivery to stay on top of our field. As the market has tightened, there have been less projects but that has only improved the quality and value of our offering. We have grown our network of partners and reduced delay margins to the smallest possible levels.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>2015 and 2016 were tough years for us because of the drop in oil prices, changes at ADNOC, and reduced government spending. We have three primary sources of revenue in Abu Dhabi. The oil sector, which is the backbone of the national economy, is the first. The second is the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which has done especially well in recent years and is regarded as one of the best investment institutions because of its transparency, decision-making, and clean image. The third source of revenue is VAT and is much smaller than the other two. The slump in old prices forced ADNOC to reduce costs and take decisive action to rebalance the budget. Immediately, it requested subcontractors to reduce their prices by roughly 25-35%, causing some contractors to leave and others to slash workers. However, we are looking forward to tendering for major projects in 2018 and are optimistic about 2017.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The changes in ADNOC's administration and the new vision of the Abu Dhabi government have made it clear that the country wants to rise to a different level. They have embarked upon a journey that will become the new benchmark for NOCs, where capability, technology, efficiency, and selectivity will become vital when it comes to building partnerships. The new mindset in ADNOC is to re-energize the entire industry and everyone is enthusiastic about keeping up in this fast-paced environment. For BP, this has made it easier to see how we can support ADNOC with our world-class technology and expertise, as well as contribute to Abu Dhabi's vision of a sustainable and highly profitable oil industry. We have been in the country from day one and have never wavered in our commitment. We are delighted with the ADCO deal that we recently signed—a 40-year concession with ADNOC that brings our partnership to a whole new level—through which we are building a new framework for partnerships between IOCs and NOCs that will transform the industry in the region.1</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Even though we were not the first IOC to sign a partnership contract with a national UAE company, we were the first at this specific time, which caught the attention of other multinationals. The oil and gas industry is going through a rough patch, and decisions take much longer to be made. However, Abu Dhabi is a pivotal market for us, and we wanted to show that regardless of the circumstances we are here to stay through thick and thin. Moreover, ADCO's estimations project that daily production will go from 1.6 million bpd to 2 million bpd, which is totally feasible and will further strengthen our position. The change in management of ADNOC has fundamentally changed the company's approach toward the industry. These changes range from its decision-making processes to the way its investments are carried out. My projection is that we will see more alignments between NOCs and IOCs and this will ease the path for both of us to work together.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In spite of the recent downturn in the oil and gas sector, Wintershall has remained positive, adjusting its strategy to remain efficient even during a period of volatility and tailoring its investment policy to achieve its strategic targets. For example, in November 2016 we launched the Shuwaihat project, a sour gas and condensate field that we want to develop into commercial production. After drilling one well and getting encouraging results, we are planning to continue, gathering enough data about the reservoir in order to go into development planning. As a way of cutting costs and improving efficiency, we decided not to use the normal logistics track for offshore drilling; instead, we signed a contract with Abu Dhabi Ports in 2016 to allow us to build a supply base at a small port in the area. This saves us USD10 million per well, about 10% of the total project cost. We hope to be able to deliver gas to Abu Dhabi through the Shuwaihat project by 2022.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>INPEX/JODCO has been engaged in the exploration, development, and production of crude oil in Abu Dhabi in partnership with ADNOC for over 40 years. In April 2015, we acquired a 5% participation interest in the ADCO Onshore Concession, which further strengthened our ties with Abu Dhabi and ADNOC. We also have been contributing to Abu Dhabi's social infrastructure, including human resources development, education, and environmental protection. Over the 40-plus years we have operated here, we have made considerable technical contributions to the country and industry. Most recently, we announced our agreement in principle with ADNOC on the extension of the joint development of the Satah and Umm Al Dalkh offshore oil fields. Both oil fields have abundant reserves and have stably produced oil for many years based on a strong partnership between ADNOC and INPEX/JODCO. Moving forward, INPEX/JODCO will continue striving to strengthen its oil development and production activities in Abu Dhabi, as well as helping to further develop the strong relations between Abu Dhabi and Japan.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>2016 has been a wait-and-see-year for us in terms of concessions. Overall, the year was about restructuring in the oil and gas industry and the recent appointments to ADNOC's leadership completely transformed the company's strategies, leading to an impressive series of changes that will spur growth in ADNOC. For Statoil, 2016 was about continuing with our ambition in the UAE; for working on our objective of adding value to Abu Dhabi and its oil production capacities. We continued to strengthen our partnership with Masdar, with which we have jointly developed a green wind partnership in the UK. We have also been working with The Petroleum Institute by helping to develop a new laboratory for R&amp;D and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). We fully support ADNOCs prudent target of 70% EOR, which will be highly beneficial in the long run. One of the areas where Statoil can add value to Abu Dhabi is through this objective for increased oil recovery, since we have some of the highest recovery rates in the world in the world.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The new leadership at ADNOC has had a significant positive impact for Takreer and its other subsidiaries. There was a strategic plan developed with a project management office and work streams established from day one to focus on numerous areas. The objective is to deliver maximum value out of the existing assets and stretch that value as far as possible. In terms of the downstream industry, this gave us more focus on where we are, where we should be, and how to reach that level. For example, we learnt the importance of maximizing the efficiency and profitability of our assets and measuring our employee performance in a more structured way. We also have to ensure that our staff, especially UAE nationals, are continuously having their skills, talent, and capabilities built up to run our facilities properly and effectively into the future. All of this has to be done without any compromise in the integrity of our facilities or the safety of our operations, and we believe all these measures will actually add to the integrity and safety of our facilities. Overall, my assessment on the changes in ADNOC is extremely positive, and Takreer's management has welcomed it with an open mind as it will drive the industry in the right direction.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There have been many changes in ADNOC, especially after the appointment of Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber as CEO of ADNOC. The changes have contributed to redesigning the landscape of the oil industry to make it more competitive. Now we have four main pillars that we are working on: people, performance, profitability, and efficiency. We are one of the main players in the petrochemicals industry and have many challenges ahead that come from the more competitive landscape. Our strategy is to make our supply chain and value chain more sophisticated, especially regarding plastics solutions. We also need to concentrate on diversifying our solutions, which will help support the ambitions of the downstream market. After all, we are part of the downstream sector, and we need to work with the gas, refining, and petrochemicals industry to add value to every drop of oil and gas by producing plastics solutions that have a positive impact on everybody's lives. The marketing structure is also changing; more barriers have been established, especially in India and China. Therefore, we need to check every unturned stone to make a more competitive product, either by looking at the solution itself, the logistics of delivering the product, or quality of the product.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As the umbrella for all the upstream, downstream, and services work carried out in Abu Dhabi, ADNOC has a strong lead and a unified message across the companies that form the group. We all have a common set of performance objectives to follow and there will be consistency in how we set our priorities across the group. These changes are taking efficiency to a much higher level and have brought the ADNOC family together. We will keep adding rigs during 2017 and ensure that our clients are achieving their business plans and industrial targets. We acknowledge the importance of drilling efficiently and safely, and our mission is to make sure that the supply of rigs is available. We seek to finish 94 rigs in 2017, and it is crucial that during 2017 we have the people, materials, equipment, and all the support services to make sure these rigs start operation. We also have high KPI targets involving efficiency and profitability. We have reached remarkable milestones since our inception in 1972. We recently reached a total 42 million feet drilled since we began operations, which is equivalent to the earth's diameter. Moreover, we expect to graduate nearly 350 employees ready for work in the industry, all of them UAE nationals.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, the sector went through drastic changes that positively impacted the performance of NOCs in Abu Dhabi. Probably the main transformation came from ADNOC's new leadership, which projected a completely new vision based on four pillars—people, efficiency, performance, and profitability. We aligned ourselves to this strategy and that is the way in which we are operating now. For almost 40 years now, GASCO has been the leading player in the utilization of the country's vast gas resources, and we continue to put in place programs to measure and benchmark our performance to close the gap between us and best-in-class performance. Maximizing energy efficiency is one element of our strategy to meet that target because every molecule of gas that we do not burn in our processes is one more in the gas network. This includes switching off our own electricity generators, building infrastructure to import electricity from the grid, and maximizing the utilization of combined-cycle power generation at ADWEC. Another initiative is the recovery of carbon dioxide from our gas treatment facilities for use in enhanced oil recovery. The CO2 injection frees up hydrocarbon gases that are currently being used for oil field pressure maintenance.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Last year, we witnessed major transformations in the development of the oil and gas industry in Abu Dhabi. In light of the changed energy market, ADNOC and its group companies have dedicated their attention to driving efficiency, streamlining the business, aligning policies, and optimizing costs. ADCO, ADNOC's major onshore operations arm, is an important part of this. As a result of the changes across ADNOC and other sensible operational and cost optimization measures, we have significantly reduced production cost per barrel, sharpening our competitive edge and enhancing our value. All this is critical to maintain our position at the core of the economic landscape of the Emirate. At ADCO, we are embedding a performance culture, focused on profitability and efficiency that has to be embraced throughout our company and throughout all parts of the value chain. Ultimately, our people make everything happen and are pivotal enablers to ensure we are going in a unified direction that leads to progress and sustainability. Underpinning everything is our commitment to HSE and the integrity of our assets. On the environmental side, for example, we have implemented the Energy Improvement Opportunities (EIO) Program, which has enabled ADCO to achieve cumulative savings of 2,820 terrajoules in 2016 worth several million dollars.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Through AGEDI's Climate Change program, AGEDI has developed many partnerships across the region. At a local level, our main partners include AGEDI, the Abu Dhabi Municipality, the Urban Planning Council, the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Company, and Masdar. At a national level, we work closely with the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Energy, the Emirates Wildlife Society, as well as the Global Green Growth Institute. At a regional level, our partners include the United Nations Environment Programme Regional Office for West Asia (UNEP-ROWA), the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia, the Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment, and the Arabian Gulf University. Plans for 2017 include building a partnership with the Statistic Center of Abu Dhabi (SCAD) in order to make our projects more relevant to the local context as well as include a broader perspective around socio-economic data and sustainable development.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Climate change is a legacy issue, and our choices will determine and either constrain or widen the options for future generations. Climate change is a non-linear system and is highly dynamic, which is why we need to plan ahead on a global basis and at the level of countries, communities, businesses, and households. The young, current generations are the main stakeholders and will have the crucial, determining role to play; despite President Trump, addressing climate change goes beyond short-term tactics and politics. It is shocking that, despite all the scientific evidence, there is still climate change denial. Raising awareness of climate change among young people is critical to move forward, and we need to make sure it is on the agenda of all politicians and governments. In this context, the UAE is ahead of the curve, having appointed a Minister of Climate Change. Every country should have such a climate change minister because the issues and choices are all encompassing.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Tadweer's public awareness team has been working hard to educate the public about how to segregate waste. They have been visiting door-to-door and setting up awareness centers in residential areas to cultivate a sustainable waste culture. The team has been educating school children, and the students at public schools have responded well and adopted an excellent recycling culture. The public awareness team has also been conducting events at shopping malls to educate people about how they can avoid food wastage and do more recycling. Tadweer is an authority for waste management in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. We regularly interact and conduct benchmarking studies with other Emirates within UAE as well as other authorities in different countries. Bee'ah from Sharjah is one of our contracted service providers for waste collection. Abu Dhabi has demonstrated one of the best construction and demolition waste recycling facilities in the country, which is acknowledged by Ministry of Climate Change and Environment as well.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year we have achieved various milestones that have strengthened our position as a holding group. In the car dealership segment, we have launched the opening of the new Audi showroom on the road to the airport and the Porsche service center equipped with a newly installed electricity recharging station for hybrid cars. For our hospitality segment, we have expanded our contracting business line to include the construction of resorts, hence signing two deals, one for the development of the Sadiyaat Rotana Hotel and the second for Al Bateen Marina Resort. For the luxury retail sector, we have activities stretched out to Qatar and Kuwait, as well as the opening of three jewelry stores across the UAE. We take a good amount of time to evaluate a business or a sector before making such a decision. We tend to avoid making knee-jerk reactions based on sudden market fluctuations. We maintain steady and long-lasting commitments to our projects and take our decisions on the basis of providing strong and consistent trends.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We made quite a few breakthroughs during 2016 following a new strategy that we implemented a few years ago that enabled us to secure good markets for our exports for 2015 and 2016. We built on our strengths and increased our share by acquiring that of our competitors as an engine for growth. We had positive numbers as we managed to leverage the UAE's status as a global hub for trade and business, compounded by its strong port and export routes. We also extended our exporting capacities to make them one of our core businesses today. Having an upfront knowledge of how the shipping and exporting industry works has allowed us to plan the markets that we need to grow and gauge how aggressive our approach needs to be. We implemented a very aggressive strategy in 2015, and during 2016 we were able to see the results and have a footprint in most of the exporting areas. Today we have over 10 markets for every single company within our group.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Al Mazroui Group has always been a family company. We started in 1974 with a few activities in a limited array of sectors and we have grown and developed into a group of companies with operations in more than 20 different areas, ranging from trading to construction, and from industrial areas to logistics. Although we maintain our UAE footprint, we have also expanded into other GCC markets and some countries in the wider Middle East. Now we also have a number of foreign partners working and investing in the group. Over our more than 40 years of existence we have contributed to the development of Abu Dhabi as an economic center in the region, we have brought a series of high-caliber companies into the Emirate that have made the business environment here grow exponentially. Much in the way the country did, Al Mazroui Group has closely followed this diversification process to map opportunities in the most promising areas of local economic activity.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Trojan Holding has nine subsidiary companies, each of which has a core function related to construction, each with different specialties. We provide services varying from steel structures to concrete, infrastructure to mechanical, and electrical to plumbing. We work in the construction of low-rise sites and high-rise buildings. We are currently engaged in operations that include large city infrastructure, buildings, villas, and townhouses. We are involved in completing every aspect of construction as well, from cement blocks to wooden doors. We have a few projects in the UAE, in both Abu Dhabi and Dubai, as well as our first project in the UK, on the Greenwich peninsula. Furthermore, we have expanded our projects in Morocco, Jordan, Russia, Egypt, and Canada. The range of our services in these locations is diversified and highly specialized. We try to align our company's vision with Abu Dhabi Vision 2030 and are further diversifying our work in construction, residential infrastructure, highways, hospitality, education, and as many sectors as we can.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The UAE and Singapore have been partners in many areas of mutual interest. The GCC-Singapore FTA (GSFTA), which was signed in 2008 and entered into force in 2013, has had a significant role in growing the mindshare of the UAE amongst Singapore and Singapore-based businesses, and in encouraging bilateral trade and investment. The UAE and Singapore have partnered to seize the opportunities in Singapore and beyond. Under the Abu Dhabi Singapore Joint Forum (ADSJF), led by His Excellency Khaldoon Al Mubaark and myself, we agreed to embark on some collaborations that could be mutually beneficial to both the UAE and Singapore. Arising from our discussion, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has signed an MoU on Financial Technical Cooperation with the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM). We look forward to more cooperation on this front between MAS and ADGM. We also had discussions on new collaboration using IoT in smart city solutions, and discussed the ongoing and possible new collaborations in the oil and gas sector. Other than the ADSJF, our companies have also formed deep and good partnerships with UAE entities. Boustead Projects Singapore has entered into a co-investment partnership with the Emirati sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Council. The joint venture, Boustead Development Partnership, has agreed to commit SGD250 million in equity to be invested into the development and redevelopment of new industrial facilities in Singapore. We hope to see more of such collaborations in the future.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Relations between the UK and UAE are strong. They have been fortified over many years and date back over two centuries before its formation. We have rich people-to-people links and more than 100,000 British nationals are currently living in the UAE, with a further 1.5 million visiting every year. Going the other way, there were nearly 300,000 visitors to the UK from the UAE in the first nine months of 2016, a record number. We collaborate in a broad range of areas because we have shared interests. More than 5,000 UK companies operate in the UAE, supporting bilateral trade, which is currently worth around GBP13 billion a year. The UK exports more to the GCC than to China and more than twice as much as to India, and we export more to the UAE than to any other market outside Europe except the US, Japan, and China. The UAE in particular has shown great faith in the strength of the UK economy. Since the vote to leave the EU, the UAE's sovereign wealth funds have invested approximately GBP1 billion in gas distribution, offshore wind, and urban regeneration in the UK. My department has identified 217 high-value campaigns around the world where our government can help British business win significant deals over the next few years. Of those 217, 10 are in the UAE, in areas such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, creative industries, and energy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Up until recently the Middle East was an unexplored region for us. Along with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we decided to step foot here to incentivize country-to-country business exchange between the UAE and Costa Rica; we have undertaken a series of visits and have mapped the opportunities we want to explore in the region, and now we look forward to developing a fruitful relationship with the local authorities in the UAE to propel our relationship to the next level. The Emirates is the focal point to the Middle East for us; this country has an extensive business environment, sound financial strength, a unique entrepreneurial spirit, and most importantly offers a complementary relationship for us. We plan on building a comprehensive bilateral relationship inclusive of all sectors, of a dynamic trade exchange, and mutual investments with Costa Rican companies coming to the UAE, and Emirati companies investing in Costa Rica in return. We can build a relationship based on reciprocity and intend to facilitate the landing of companies from both sides.
