		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>This year marks the 25th anniversary of CFZO. How do you assess its contribution to the internationalization of Iran over this timespan?</h4><p>This is indeed the 25th year of CFZO, but we are at a turning point in our existence. In the past, Chabahar was only a free zone with the goal of providing services and infrastructure for the member societies under Chabahar. We supported employment and small businesses in the region; today, the perspective of Chabahar has truly changed. The Supreme Leader of Iran has prioritized the development of the Mokran shores, a huge project in the region. In addition, the government focuses on development of the east and south of Iran, and Chabahar lies at the crossroads of these two areas. After the lifting of sanctions, the international community can again use Chabahar to connect East Asia to CIS countries and Eastern Europe. In the future, Chabahar will be an increasingly important connection point for the entire world that will link the important markets of South and Central Asia, CIS countries, and Africa.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages over other free zones?</h4><p>The most important free zones today are all active in the Persian Gulf region. However, instability concerns have made investors change their minds and they now seek alternatives. We are the only important free zone outside the Persian Gulf region, which is an important advantage. There are certain free zones in the south of the Gulf of Oman; however, these do not have the market behind them that we have. The main advantage of Chabahar is that it is the easiest, fastest and safest way of connecting CIS countries and Afghanistan to free waters. Traders can benefit from our location and reduce the costs of transportation.</p><h4>How do you assess plans to improve land transportation routes from Chabahar?</h4><p>Due to policy changes, the focus for the development of Iran is now on the east of the country. The starting point is Chabahar, and from here connections with Turkmenistan and CIS countries to the north of Iran will be improved. The first step in infrastructural development is the port of Chabahar, which is perhaps the most vital construction project in Iran today. In the last four years the capacity of the port has increased from 2.5 million tons per year to 8.5 million tons currently. In the next 10 years it will reach 85 million tons and become the largest port in the region. The first phase is almost complete and planning is underway for the second phase. For the development of phases three to five, we are negotiating with different companies and countries. The railway link from Chabahar to Zahedan, on the border with Afghanistan, is already 20% completed, and the next step is to link this railway from Zahedan to Mashhad. The whole project will vastly reduce transportation time to CIS countries and, hence, costs. It will change the rules of the game.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We concentrate on production line development and seek to complete the chain of products in the different fields that we have focused on. SMEs that are labor and energy intensive in particular have great prospects for developing production chains in Chabahar, since we have skilled labor and cheap energy. In the next year we expect to complete production chains for petrochemicals, steel, food processing, and especially the fishing industry. Moreover, we expect to make progress with the development of hotels, housing, and entertainment facilities to attract more investors to Chabahar. Rules and regulations within free zones in Iran conform to WTO standards, and there are no adjustments that need to be done. Chabahar is a gateway to four continents and 1.5 billion consumers. Investors also get added value in the form of rebates from customs duties. Investors that export their goods to the mainland can enjoy exemption from customs duties to the added value thereof in the free zone. If they transport their goods via Chabahar they receive discounts on road tolls and cheaper fuel. One of Iran's advantages is the price of energy, and investors seeking markets in this region cannot find a better place than Chabahar in terms of costs. We also plan to develop our infrastructures through PPPs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Through which structures does ICCIMA serve its members?</h4><p>ICCIMA is the largest official organization in Iran working under the laws passed by the Iranian parliament. Currently, there are over 19 specialized commissions consisting of elites from various economic sectors who offer consultation services to the board of directors. Experts gather suggestions, plans, and issues for economic growth and offer them to the members of the board of ICCIMA. These plans will later be suggested to three main branches of Iran: parliament, the government, and judiciary. Moreover, ICCIMA has more than 200 economic formations with different fields of activity. We have an arbitration center to handle disputes among our members and also take care of international economic disputes and discussions. The formation of a public-private sector dialog council was one of the best and most innovative of our activities during the past three years. It enables dialog about the economic problems and issues of Iran, and provides a platform for suggestions that can boost Iran's economy and enhance its network of international relations. The chamber covers 34 province chambers and is an active branch of the International Chamber of Commerce. Every member of ICCIMA has an activity card that certifies the company is allowed to engage in international business activity. The main purpose of ICCIMA is to facilitate the members' activities.</p><h4>What are the main goals under the 10-Year Vision, which was proclaimed in 2009?</h4><p>One of the goals of ICCIMA is to improve its own position within the Iranian government and to boast its international standing as well. Internationally, we achieved some of our goals and will soon reach a desirable position in the international economy. As a representative of its members, the chamber is determined to pave the way for the Iranian economic structure and to prepare the appropriate climate so that its members can participate in the various economic areas. We play an effective role in enhancing domestic business competitiveness at the regional, national, and international level. In addition, we promote the economic and social status of Iranian economic activists, entrepreneurs, and ICCIMA members. We hope to improve our international business climate ranking in the near future.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the lifting of sanctions on ICCIMA and its members so far, and which sectors will particularly benefit moving forward?</h4><p>The JCPOA negotiations showed Iran's inclination to interact and have dialog. We strongly believe that all issues can be solved through negotiations. The deal brought Iran into a new international situation. The signing of JCPOA lifted a heavy block from Iran's economy and opened new gates to international interactions. We had serious banking problems before that are going to be solved soon. We have seen eye-catching progress already in the financial and transport sectors and a reduction of economic risks. After the signing of JCPOA, we received many interested foreign delegations, and their high demands created problems for us in the beginning. An important point to mention is that the international market does not only have direct economic expectations of investments in Iran. With Iran's geographical position and its penetration rate in the regional economic markets, Iran would be a great and secure path to reach other markets in the region, such as Central Asia, the Caucasus, Iraq, and some parts of India and China. We also have several huge but incomplete projects in Iran, which are seeing great enthusiasm from investors from all over the world. These projects have great potential and the government has motivational plans for them. Currently, everyone is aware that the price of energy in Iran is low and it is easy to find young and educated people. This can be counted as an attraction for investors. Geographically, Iran is located in an insecure area. Yet, it is one of the safest countries in the region and this can be an advantage to economic investors as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Kyrgyzstan and Iran this year celebrate their 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties. What is your assessment of the development of diplomatic relations between Kyrgyzstan and Iran over this time?</h4><p>Kyrgyzstan and Iran have had a close friendship, including historical and cultural ties, since ancient times, and these are a solid ground for modern Kyrgyz-Iranian relations. Iran was among the first countries in the world to officially acknowledge Kyrgyzstan's independence. Diplomatic relations between the two states were established on May 10, 1992. The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Bishkek opened on October 21, 1993, and the Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic in Tehran opened in May 1996. On May 10, 2017 Kyrgyzstan and Iran celebrated the 25th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations between the two countries. It should be acknowledged that this is a historical and significant milestone in the history of Kyrgyz-Iranian relations. Kyrgyzstan and Iran have always based their relations on fundamental principles of international law, mutual trust, and respect. The number of mutual visits on all levels have increased lately. The official visit of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic to Iran in September 2015, and the official visit of the President of Iran to the Kyrgyz Republic in December 2016, boosted further development of bilateral relations.</p><h4>The trade volume between Kyrgyzstan and Iran almost doubled in the last year. How do you reflect on this increase and on the remaining obstacles to bilateral trade?</h4><p>Trade turnover between the two states is indeed showing a growth trend. However, we are in no way satisfied with these numbers. According to our data, trade turnover in 2016 reached only USD14.78 million, while in 2015 it was USD8.14 million. These numbers are still low. At the same time, Kyrgyzstan and Iran have huge potential in terms of economic collaboration. According to our estimates, the optimal level of bilateral trade should be around USD200-300 million a year. Increasing trade turnover is on the top of the agenda of the Kyrgyz-Iranian bilateral collaboration. I would like to specifically highlight that attention is now being paid to implementing prior arrangements that were reached in the course of leaders' visits in 2015 and 2016. These visits became a strategic platform for progress regarding all Kyrgyz-Iranian relations including those in trade and economy.</p><h4>Iran and Kyrgyzstan have recently signed a MoU on intensifying the ties between the two countries and promoting trade and economic relations. In which areas do you see the greatest potential to enhance economic relations between Kyrgyzstan and Iran?</h4><p>The long-term cooperation program between the Kyrgyz Republic and Iran for 2016-2026 was adopted in Bishkek during the official visit of President Rouhani in December 2016. Kyrgyzstan has big hopes for approval of this diversified cooperation program that is a solid base for development and intensification of our bilateral relations. Within the framework of the program, the parties intend to actively cooperate in political, trade and economic, cultural, and humanitarian areas, as well as, among others, healthcare, education, tourism, and security. We are interested in implementing joint economic projects, first of all in sectors such as transport, communications, processing, agriculture, energy, food, and light, to diversify areas of collaboration between our countries. To achieve these aims the Kyrgyz-Iranian intergovernmental Commission for Trade, Economic, and Scientific Cooperation is increasing its activity, which is an important mechanism.</p><h4>How can Iran contribute to the development of the hydroelectric power sector in Kyrgyzstan?</h4><p>Hydropower is the leading segment of Kyrgyzstan's national economy, and we successfully collaborate with quite a few countries in it. As for the participation of Iranian companies in this sector, opportunities for bilateral cooperation are being studied. There is a joint Energy Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic and Iran, led by the State Committee on Industry, Energy, and Subsoil Management on the Kyrgyz side, and the Ministry of Energy on the Iranian side. The committee had its first sitting in March this year. Cooperation in the energy sector, existing energy capacities of the Kyrgyz Republic, hydropower resources, and opportunities for renewables in particular were discussed during the sitting. Currently, we are studying various energy projects  are hoping their joint implementation will begin in the near future.</p><h4>How can Kyrgyzstan and Iran work together in promoting regional stability and security?</h4><p>The modern world is facing unprecedented threats and challenges in terms of international, regional, and national safety. Kyrgyzstan is a peaceful country and is in favor of solely peaceful ways of resolving all the conflict issues—at the meeting table and guided by principles and standards of international law. The Kyrgyz Republic and Iran actively cooperate in matters of regional stability and safety within the framework of various international and regional organizations. Regarding bilateral cooperation, there is a contract and legal base between the two countries to which relevant institutions of the states refer. In general, we are satisfied with the level of bilateral cooperation in this area. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Iran performing in its efforts to develop in a way that balances global overcapacity, whilst also allowing Iran to re-enter the world market?</h4><p>Iran's full return to the global oil market has been a welcome one. The country is a founding member of OPEC, it has vast hydrocarbons potential and excellent manpower, and its production and exports will evidently be integral to the future stability of an expanding global oil market. In September 2016, I met with the Honorable President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, HE Dr. Hassan Rouhani, as well as HE Eng. Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, Iran's Minister of Petroleum. HE Dr. Rouhani told me that Iran had suffered greatly under sanctions and it was vital for the country to make up for its lost oil production, but he also underscored that OPEC has a responsibility to restore market stability, and that Iran would continue to support these endeavours. The proof of this came with the historic production adjustment decisions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC on November 30 and December 10, 2016, with Iran and HE Zanganeh playing constructive and vital roles in achieving the consensus decisions required to help bring forward oil market rebalancing and return sustainable market stability. I remain assured that Iran remains fully committed to the decisions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC countries at the end of 2016.</p><h4>Which foreign expertise and strategies would best help Iran develop a sustainable energy sector?</h4><p>Iran has the third-largest oil and the second-largest proven gas reserves in the world. It is a hydrocarbons giant, with tremendous opportunities for cooperation between Iranian companies and multinationals. How this evolves is a matter for the Iranian government and the Petroleum Ministry; however, there is no doubt than its longer-term development will depend on greater cooperation with international oil companies. I hope Iran will be able to reach agreements that satisfy all parties, one that enables Iran to expand its production and exports over time. This will not only be vital to Iran, but the global oil industry as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Employment is the most important issue of our country, and unemployment can be a major problem for our society and country. A collective effort to create jobs in the country is essential. The total number of employed people in Iran in 2013 was 21.3 million people, a figure that has now reached 23 million. In the last two years, 700,000 net jobs were created, though we are far from meeting the entire demand. The Resistive Economy Headquarters have provided loans for 17,000 industrial units. Growth in the agriculture sector was 5.9% in 2016. Non-oil goods exports reached USD32 billion in the final nine months of 2016. The final part of our commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) will be finalized on its anniversary.</p><p>We honor our commitments under the JCPOA and hope that the other side does so as well. We hope to witness economic growth in all countries, especially those we have interactions with. The result of the JCPOA is a win-win situation that is beneficial to all, and I hope all countries are able to witness its positive results in the coming years. I have no doubt the JCPOA was the largest achievement of the great Iranian nation. Negotiating with six world powers resulted in a great achievement and we reached a conclusion which no one can claim Iran lost out. Iran did not deceive the negotiation partners. We said from the first day of negotiations that this agreement would be a win-win situation.</p><p>The JCPOA has been completely implemented and executed. In the nuclear sector, we have operationalized everything we wanted; currently, we have imported 200 tons of Yellow Cake and will import another 120 tons. We have signed a contract to purchase 200 airplanes, which was impossible without the JCPOA. Purchasing airplanes does not impose expenses on the public budget of the country. The 18-year repayment of the airplane sale indicates the global community's trust in Iran.</p><p>Our enemies and opponents promoted Iranophobia, introducing Iran as a threat to the world. Today, however, countries globally acknowledge the significant role Iran plays in the region. In the resolution of the Security Council on Syria, Iran's positive role in combatting terrorism in the region was acknowledged. Today, helping Iran in its nuclear sector is on the agenda and this means that different European countries and Russia are helping us produce fuel for our reactors, as well as other nuclear sectors, which leads to growth and progress in our nuclear sector.</p><p>We have spared no effort in helping countries combat terrorism and we will continue to do so. In Yemen, Syria, and other countries that face crises, the ultimate solution is diplomacy. I hope the Astana Meeting represents a major landmark for the region. In the field of diplomacy, we have been active and are in touch with Syria, Russia, Turkey, and other countries in the region in this regard. A tripartite relation was formed between Iran, Russia, and Turkey, along with Syria, and these countries have been able to take great steps. We hope the people of Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya, and other countries that are struggling with problems will be safe and secure, and that stability will be established in the region. In general, the current conditions of the region are positive, though we have a long way to go to reach full security.</p><p>I feel deep sorrow over the terrorist attack in Turkey in December 2016. Such incidents show that terrorists have no mercy on anyone and this virus will infect everyone, unless we can confront and eliminate the virus. I am pleased we have extraordinary security in our country. I thank all the armed and security forces for the extraordinary security they have provided the Iranian nation. People should play a role in the realization of citizenship rights. We should promote unity and brotherhood instead of defamation and slander. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you introduce the BBG and its members to newcomers?</h4><p>The British Business Group Dubai &amp; Northern Emirates is proud to celebrate 30 years since its establishment. We were originally set up by a handful of business leaders from the UK who were either involved in their own businesses or had come to Dubai to represent British business in the Gulf. As one of the oldest business councils in the UAE, its purpose is to foster trade between British businesses, as well as the bilateral trade relationship between the UK and Dubai and the Northern Emirates. We are a not-for-profit membership group run by its members on a voluntary basis. The BBG helps its members to build a network of relationships that establish or advance their business in Dubai, such as lawyers, accountants, local service partners, government connections, and potential clients. This is in line with the UK government's aim to bolster and increase the trade relationship between the UK and the UAE. Therefore, we are aligned with the government, though we are a private organization that exists solely for our members.</p><h4>What makes many larger companies, as well as SMEs, choose Dubai as their regional headquarters?</h4><p>Since the inception of the UAE, Dubai's focus has been on maintaining an open and transparent market for international trade. HH Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum has created a hub from where we can reach two-thirds of the world's population within a few hours due to Dubai's connectivity in terms of transportation and communication. Dubai can be seen as the commercial and business capital of the UAE. In Abu Dhabi there are businesses coming in for defense, oil and gas, and infrastructure-related activities. The main reason Dubai is a popular business destination is the logistics sector, its ability to attract and retain quality talent from around the world, and the infrastructure being built in areas such as healthcare, communications, and transport. All these make Dubai an attractive base, particularly for international businesses, as well as start-ups.</p><h4>Many start-ups and new disruptive technology companies are moving to Dubai. Is BBG attracting new members from these sectors?</h4><p>BBG works hard to attract these innovators because we see their sectors as a main focus of the Dubai government. For us, it is not just about doing business on the ground now; it is about the future, legacy, and sustainability of business. The BBG is keen to encourage British companies in tech sectors to come here. The traditional British-Dubai link based on trade, construction, and design expertise has been strong. However, now the focus for British businesses here, which is in line with both the UK and Dubai governments' strategies, is on new service-oriented, sustainable businesses such as fintech. Post-Brexit, the focus for British businesses will shift. Only 11% of British businesses export compared to about 48% of German companies. There is an enormous potential for the UK to look beyond the European market and approach new opportunities worldwide. Asia and the Middle East will be the main focus. Both the UK and UAE governments are open to renegotiating free trade agreements. The demand for British business and expertise will continue to be strong.</p><h4>How will the UK readdress its relationship with the UAE post-Brexit?</h4><p>The UK and the UAE have had strong political ties right from the beginning of the union and there is no reason to suggest that this cannot be even stronger as we move forward. We see a great deal of excitement both here on the ground and in the UK about new trade opportunities post-Brexit. It is a matter of focusing minds on doing things in a slightly different way and being flexible and fast in some of these trade discussions and decisions. There is a visible hunger on both sides for increased trade between the UK and the UAE. Our target by 2020 is to double the current bilateral trade between the UK and UAE from the current GBP12 billion plus per annum. We aim to align our strategies with the Dubai government's key areas of focus. Green technology, Islamic finance, tech, and the medical and education sectors are set to grow enormously. Some 8.6 million people visited Dubai for tourism or business in the first half of 2017 and Dubai will exceed its 20 million visitors target by 2020.</p><h4>What challenges does Dubai present for people setting up businesses here?</h4><p>A number of our BBG members are smart, young, and entrepreneurial people with great ideas. Dubai is still an expensive market to enter. To start a business, companies have to do their licensing, have a local partner unless they are in a free zone, and acquire real estate.  There are various incubator solutions available for local Emiratis and expatriates, though a cohesive strategy is continuing to emerge. There is still work to be done in this area and the BBG works closely with Dubai FDI on this subject. We want to see even more innovation to help those start-ups and foster the idea of Dubai as a place of opportunity. There is no other city with infrastructure like it in the wider region and it continues to improve. An important challenge will be the introduction of the VAT. Foreign companies are used to the concept from their home countries; however, it will not be a simple transition because there are still a great deal of unknowns. The VAT system is coming into force on January 1, 2018; however, even now it is still not clear exactly how that plan will work. The imposition of a tax regime in some form or another is inevitable at this stage in Dubai's development. People will have to think more about how they establish their business and where the audience for their product or service actually is. However, VAT is not a retarding factor for business.</p><h4>How are you preparing your members for Expo 2020?</h4><p>The BBG has a membership of about 1,200 with a clear member-for-member mandate. It may seem a little insular; however, it means our members receive reciprocal trade within the membership, as well as our wider UK-UAE reciprocal trade focus. The committee is just in the process of putting a three-year strategic plan in place to take us through to Expo 2020 delivery. It became clear from our member-to-member engagement program that it is not just about the Expo and the opportunities leading up to it; it is also about the legacy and sustainability for our business members. The idea is to use Expo 2020 as the catalyst to Dubai being a regional center of excellence in various sectors. It is an exciting time for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[vicente-naves-ramos-ceo-frel]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which segment of the market will you prioritize in the years to come?</h4><p>We are still considering diversifying but focus on residential vertical urban developments, hotels, and commercial, namely real estate of retail spaces, offices, and mixed-use projects. We do not plan to be involved in industrial in the short or medium terms.</p><h4>What is different about the way FREL is developing malls today compared to how they were built 20 years ago?</h4><p>Most of the projects that we have in the pipeline are more office, residential, and mixed-use and not just malls. There has been a change in the way we design malls and customers seek other experiences and new things to do in a mall other than going there to buy something. Related to that, the design is changing to generate different experiences and new things for customers. For instance, in two of our malls in the Fibra, we created what we call Espacio Latino, a concept where we have a mix of different Latin American stores with artists, designers, and producers showing their different offerings including art, clothing, or fashion, all related to Latin American experiences. This will be combined with culinary experiences in a food hall featuring the different Latin American offerings. This will also be combined with different experiences that we will have, such as tequila and mezcal tasting, mariachis to play music, or tango from Argentina. It will be a great offering and experience not only for foreigners visiting Mexican cities but also for locals because we will feature a combination of Latin American products, arts, culture, traditions, and history. We want to launch the concept strongly and then replicate in other parts of the country to contribute to Mexico's world-class tourist attractions.</p><h4>Is there a growing appetite in Mexico for mixed-use developments?</h4><p>Mixed-use projects, especially in urban areas, are appealing for people because it is convenient to have different offerings close to their homes. In dense cities, such as Mexico City, it is convenient for people to be able to walk to obtain the goods and services they need on a daily basis. Grupo Frel has three projects in the area known as Uptown Polanco, a nice district already being developed with residential apartments, offices, shopping malls, restaurants, theaters, and many cultural things to see and do. Right in that area we have three projects and have also formed an agreement with other developers. We will create something unique for the country: public areas in private property. We are creating between the different projects a 1km-long pedestrian pathway that will have retail spaces along the corridor and plazas for restaurants, cafes, and so on, making it a vibrant and dynamic area of the city.</p><h4>Has the volatility of the Mexican exchange rate affected your activities in any way?</h4><p>In Mexico, we own and we manage two hotels, one in Cancún and another in Cabos. That is a great currency shield because most of the income comes in dollars and we have most of the cost in pesos. For our other projects in Mexico, the cost and revenue are both in pesos. Some of the construction materials and supply are linked to the exchange rate and we seek to sign an advance contract with a fixed price so that we have certainly on the currency side. Overall, we try to maintain our margins without increasing our prices.</p><h4>Will the earthquake affect the real estate market in Mexico?</h4><p>There are both positive and negative impacts. With some of these natural disasters, the economic outcome in the long term is positive because they incentivize investment and tend to make things move. Here in the city, some of the areas affected by the earthquake will suffer somewhat, though it will create opportunities in other areas that will spur residential and office construction. We have an oversupply of offices and part of the need created because of the problem will help with that situation. However, even in affected areas there will be opportunities because after the demolitions there will be new buildings erected while those that were not entirely damaged will be renovated.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2017 and 2018?</h4><p>I am positive about the growth opportunities. On one hand, I see the economy going well. The banks' indicators are a great predictor of the economy in general and bank results in Mexico are positive. They are growing heavily in terms of commercial loans for cars, personal loans, and mortgages. That tells me the economy is going well. On the other hand, I am also positive because of the demographic bonus, which is a window of opportunity for every country at a certain stage and this is the case for Mexico, where the active economic population is larger than the non-economic population. We will have this situation at least until 2030. I see perhaps 12-14 months where people and companies will hold back investments and consumption a little to see what happens with the NAFTA agreement and the outcome of the presidential elections. If the proposed tax reform is approved in the US, then we would have to internally review how to stay competitive to attract investment and create jobs in the country. Overall, the basics of the economy are positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[45% of residents in Oman are expatriate]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[abdullah-bin-nasser-abdullah-al-bakri-minister-manpower]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering that 45% of the Omani population is composed of expatriates, how is the MoM ensuring employment for this population, while maintaining the expected levels of Omanization?</h4><p>The Ministry of Manpower continues development of the mechanism of Omanization and replacement programs, on realistic basis, in the light of the development of the labor market in the Sultanate, through the work of the Omanization sector committees, which endeavor to provide employment opportunities in private establishments, to employ Omanis. A total of 12 sector committees led by officials from the private sector in the construction, oil and gas, selling and distribution, industry and mining, automobiles, electricity, financial brokerage and banking, transport and telecommunications, education, health, and agriculture and fisheries sectors work in this respect. The task of these committees is to draft general policies, in the light of the development of labor market, training and employment, to achieve Omanization targets and meet the private sector's requirements for manpower with its various levels, skills, and specializations. They also submit proposals for the re-structuring of the sector committees, to be chaired by specialists from the private sector and with the membership of the three production parties (government employers and employees).</p><h4>Talks were conducted in May 2017 over whether to amend Oman's labor laws; what is the current state of the Labor Law, and how will it help bolster the Omani economy?</h4><p>The labor law has reached advanced stages and the amendment of this law takes into consideration all current and expected future changes of the labor market. Work on the amendment of law is underway through a partnership and dialogue between the various production parties. The Ministry of Manpower extends remarkable efforts, to develop the services offered by its labor, technological and vocational education sectors, with the aim of developing human resources, who are the cornerstone of economic development in the country, due to their vital role in supporting the national economy and the continued growth, to realize the future visions of the Omani economy and work to meet the requirements of the 9th developmental plan (2016-2020), and its aspirations to build a modern economy based on the knowledge and the increase of production, through investing in the human cadres and utilization of their potentials and capabilities, to contribute to sustainable development.</p><h4>What new processes are being introduced by the MoM in order to offer the private sector easier, faster, and more transparent means of hiring personnel?</h4><p>The Ministry of Manpower coordinates with the private sector and endeavors to meet its actual requirement for manpower.  The Ministry`s electronic services package was meant to ensure the shift to the e-government and facilitate the provision of services offered to private sector establishments, national workforce and all beneficiaries of the Ministry's services. The new services include: electronic licensing and nomination, the salary protection system "We work" application and the employment contracts signing service. Such electronic services have reduced paper work and enabled beneficiaries of the Ministry's services to finalize about 85% of the services. The electronic services have varied and are being developed, according to the latest internationally applied technologies resulting in the development and streamlining of employment in the private sector.</p><h4>What steps are being taken between the MoM and the private sector to ensure that Omani workers are sufficiently skilled for what the economy currently demands?</h4><p>The Ministry has worked with the private sector in drafting policies and projects aimed at developing human resources, striking a balance in the labor market and ensuring its stability and linking education and vocational training with the labor market, with the purpose of developing skills and efficiency of the national manpower, to enable them to further contribute to the economic development. The curricula and specializations of the technological end vocational training have been drafted, in coordination of the private sector. The Ministry has spared no effort in introducing several initiatives with the private sector to provide thousands of employment opportunities for job seekers and ensure the stability of local workers in their jobs. Thus, it has worked towards linking the outcome of technological education with the labor market.</p><h4>Where is the MoM expected to see the greatest economic growth in the coming year? </h4><p>Since the mid-1970s, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Saeed has spoken about the reality of the Omani economy, stressing the importance of the country's wealth and the plan of investing this wealth economically and has said that “if the oil revenues are the main source of our income in the present, we realize that we have other abundant resources, which should be invested to speed up the development and progress march we desire for this country," and this prompted us to utilize the Sultanate's wealth and resources in the tourism, agriculture, fisheries, animal, and mineral sectors, which today constitute significant elements in the development of the Omani economy. Stemming from this, the concerned authorities have adopted the national program to enhance the economic diversification (Tanfeedth), which is one of the national programs resulting from the 9th five year development plan, which started in 2016 and will continue till 2020. This program mainly aims to contribute to achieving the Sultanate's economic diversification vision, which includes promising sectors such as tourism, processing industries, logistic services, fisheries wealth and mining, besides supporting capabilities such as the labor market and financing sectors. Through this program, work will continue to speed up implementation of plans in the economic diversification enhancement field, to assist and the government to utilize the best successful practices in the social and economic planning and use its budgets in value added projects, which avail permanent employment opportunities for citizens. This is in addition to achieving the set goals, programs and policies of the economic diversification in the 9th five-year development plan (2016-2020). The program also aims to draft a clear and accurate plan to increase external and domestic investments and follow up implementation of the economic diversification program. Work is underway to implement the plans and programs meant to achieve further prosperity of the Omani society and sustain economic growth, modernize the national economy and diversify its income sources and this will consequently lead to employment of more Omanis in the various economic sectors and promote the living standard in the various Omani governorates. The revenues of other sectors will come to the side of oil revenues, if not replacing them in the future. These steps will also enable the Sultanate to increase the investments allocated for income generating projects and distribute investment geographically, to benefit all parts of the country. Success of this program will ensure multiplication of the per capita income, the balance between revenues and uses and create appropriate conditions to boost the economy away from relying solely on one non-renewable source of income.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give an overview of the evolution of Wallenford since it was acquired in 2013?</h4><p>We purchased Wallenford from the government of Jamaica, which sought to divest assets in general, and we are one of the largest divestments in recent times. Purchasing Wallenford and working to transform it into an efficient coffee company has been part of our evolution since 2013. It has been four years since we got into coffee. The justification for that investment was the reputation for Blue Mountain Coffee. Everywhere around the world, people have heard of Blue Mountain Coffee, and it is described as extremely expensive and high quality, but not available. Any company would want their product to be described as excellent, expensive, and in limited supply. That underpinned the parent company's decision to enter the agriculture sector, which has generally been a difficult industry in Jamaica.</p><h4>Wallenford acquired Mavis Bank Coffee in 2016. Do you plan to further scale up the company?</h4><p>The Jamaican coffee industry is relatively small; we are talking less than USD100 million in sales. Our view is that it is possible to triple or quadruple that through developing new products. Despite our 250-year history, we took an objective look and saw all that the business focuses overwhelmingly on the sale of green wholesale coffee. If we want to turn the corner and make more money, we have to get closer to the final end product by selling more roasted coffee. Blue Mountain Coffee is similar to champagne in terms of regional production. If a farm is located outside the border of the defined region, it cannot be called Blue Mountain Coffee—it has to be sourced from a particular area in Jamaica. By definition, it is restricted, and at the same time, it is not efficient. Although a farm should have 900 trees per acre, many Blue Mountain Coffee farms have far less. There is a great deal more that could be grown on existing farms. As the largest holder of land in the Blue Mountain Coffee area, we are in the best position to lead this effort.</p><h4>What marketing activities are you engaged in to keep the business profitable?</h4><p>We supply the Starbucks Reserve line, which is sold in special stores. We have to meet strict quality, production, corporate social responsibility and environmental standards in order to supply to them. We, we have been supplying them our coffee for three years. In London, we are a key product in the Harrods coffee selection. These are some examples of the key activities we do to maintain the brand. Many Jamaicans and global drinkers of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee think of Wallenford when they think of a leading provider of high-end coffee, largely because we spend a great deal of energy differentiating our company. We have old farms running for over 200 years in some of the areas where we grow coffee, and we want to leverage that as we seek to diversify geographically. Currently, Japan buys 70% of Jamaican coffee, a reduction from almost 100% not too long ago. Japan has a special interest in Jamaican coffee, having invested in Jamaica Blue Mountain for over 50 years.. Our large coffee factory was built with Japanese financing, and they truly deserve much of the credit for helping to develop this market. When the financial crisis hit Japanese orders in 2008-09, the focus on developing new markets increased.</p><h4>Do you plan to enter any new markets in order to diversify further?</h4><p>Every day, we look for ways to sell more coffee. A further increase in China sales would be great; however, it is still not a coffee country. Still, the country is getting more interested in coffee every year, and based on the size of the market, even a 1% growth in coffee sales per year is significant. However, the problem is, even though China has a large luxury goods market, they haven't begun to latch on to premium coffee. One of the drivers of our increased exposure in China is Starbucks, which carries our coffee in their high-end Chinese stores. We are one of the most expensive brands sold by Starbucks globally and have had significant success across the world, including in China.</p><h4>Do you plan to partner with other companies to give away complementary items with your coffee to boost sales?</h4><p>No, we do not. We are a premium brand of coffee that is for people who truly enjoy and appreciate excellent coffee. We tailor our coffee to address a specific market. For example, several Michelin star Chefs drink our coffee at home, and have served it intheir restaurants. Although we are asked to produce limited edition packages bearing company names or logos, we have only agreed in the rare cases where the brand meets our strict criteria for brand association.</p><h4>What are your projects for Wallenford in 2018?</h4><p>The integration of Mavis Bank and Wallenford is huge and managing it has led us to increase our focus on efficient coffee production, and targeted branding and market positioning. They are two strong companies on their own, and we want to create efficiencies without diluting the brands or creating confusion. Some customers are Wallenford customers, and some are Mavis Bank loyalists so we focus on managing that. We are two separate names and markets; however, we can gain efficiencies on the back end in areas like accounting. A huge part of who we are is about improving farm efficiency and making coffee cultivation and transportation more manageable for farmers. We source a large amount of coffee from farmers and we need to hold them to high standards so that we can be sure the coffee we buy from them is as good as the coffee grown on our own farms. We want our farmers to earn higher incomes. If they are earning more, it increases the chance that they will maintain a high quality supply and their success will contribute to our success. We have to find the right balance between helping them to grow their crops efficiently and paying them fairly for the coffee. That plays a large role in the overall sustainability of the industry. The price we pay is always a topic of discussion. When we came into the industry, farmers were being paid about USD45 per box of coffee, and we realized that we had to adjust that once we did our own research to establish how much that box actually costs the farmer to produce. They were not being paid enough, so we began paying more. That was one of the first things we were known for when we got into coffee: paying a higher price to the farmers. We try to encourage them to use the extra money to plant and cultivate more coffee and we provide extensive farmer training to increase their likelihood of success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[datuk-chung-chee-leong-ceo-cagamas-malaysia-2017-malaysia-2017-malaysia-2017-malaysia-2017-malaysia-2017-malaysia-2017-malaysia-2017-malaysia-2017]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you brief us on the increase in issuances over 2016?</h4><p>
	In 2016, we issued a total of MYR7.4 billion, though the total purchases was MYR5.7 billion. This year, we expect to buy MYR10.5 billion and issue MYR11 billion, which is a large increase from last year. We have continued to issue in foreign currencies since the inception of our EMTN program in 2014—having issued a total of MYR7.8 billion equivalent in foreign currencies, including CNH, USD, SGD, and HKD. Thus far, sukuk issuances in foreign currency have only been done in SGD. The company has performed well, and we made profits of around MYR332 million in 2016.
</p><h4>
	How do you market your products and where does interest for these issuances come from?
</h4><p>
	Even before we established the EMTN program, we visited a number of financial centers to meet with investors and determine their needs. We continuously interact and engage with our existing investors and potential investors in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, the Middle East, Taiwan, and Japan, among other countries. We keep in close contact with them, and that allows us to close quickly an issuance. As a result, we recently concluded a public issuance of USD350 million in less than a week. We are active in branding our services abroad, and people have become more familiar with Cagamas. We have also won a number of awards in various forms, including 2016's Global Islamic Finance Advocacy Award for an Institution.
</p><h4>
	What should Malaysia do to unlock the full potential of Islamic finance?
</h4><p>
	Islamic finance is still growing in terms of the capital market. When we first started meeting with investors in Hong Kong and London, some of them did not want sukuk unless we gave them a higher yield in comparison with conventional bonds. Over the years, we have found that the acceptance of sukuk has changed, especially after the governments of the UK and Hong Kong started issuing sukuk themselves. The acceptability, awareness, and understanding of sukuk have significantly grown around the world. Unlocking the full potential of Islamic finance is about creating awareness and understanding. In Korea, Taiwan and Japan, there is a great deal of room for growth of sukuk. Within ASEAN, we can focus on Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam to build more awareness. In Malaysia, about 23-25% of all banking assets are already in Islamic finance, with a strong prominence in the housing sector, for example. With our established Islamic finance and sukuk investor niche—consisting of Islamic pension funds, Islamic banks, Islamic fund managers and takaful operators—we are able to offer sukuk more competitively than conventional bonds in the local market. This is possible since conventional investors can also buy sukuk while Islamic institutions cannot buy conventional bonds. In Malaysia, the market demand for sukuk is in fact greater. Previously, investors expected sukuk to pay a higher yield; however, in Malaysia that scenario is the reverse and we are either paying lower or equal to what we pay for conventional papers. In terms of government securities, we have Malaysian government securities (MGS) and Malaysian government investment issue (MGII). Previously in 2013-2014, foreign participation in the MGII was small, at about 1-3% in comparison to the MGS, which was about 40%. The yield for MGII was also 20-30 points higher than MGS. After the rebranding from GII to MGII and investors realized it was related to the Malaysian government, foreign participation increased significantly. It is still lower than MGS; however, it has grown significantly from to a high of 13%. This shows that the demand and awareness for sukuk has grown in terms of buying sukuk in the form of the MGII. Since the US Presidential Election, we have seen volatility in the market and foreign holdings of Malaysian government papers have also gone down overall; MGII and MGS combined are about 30%.
</p><h4>
	Cagamas is celebrating 30 years of operations in 2017. How successful have you been in terms of your socio-economic role in society in promoting house ownership?
</h4><p>
	As far as promoting home ownership is concerned, Cagamas has contributed by puchasing housing loans from financial institutions and hence, providing the much needed liquidity to the banking system to further finance house purchases. Cagamas has refinanced about two million homes since its inception. Currently we look at areas that promote economic activities such as infrastructure and the SME sector. Another area that we focus on is affordable housing. We work to see how Cagamas can play a role in promoting affordable housing. Cagamas has participated in two government schemes in terms of mortgage guarantee, such as My First Home scheme (SRP) and the Youth Housing scheme (YHS). A sister company, Cagamas SRP, provides the mortgage guarantee on such loans to the first time home buyers. This allows borrowers to borrow up to 100% of the house value. This helps some young individuals below the age of 40 who individually earn less than MYR5,000 a month or MYR10,000 in a joint household income. This scheme helps these individuals to own their first home. For the SRP scheme, there are 23 participating banks whereas the YHS is offered by Bank Simpanan Nasional. These are efforts that the government has put in place to help young individuals own houses and Cagamas plays a role in terms of providing the mortgage guarantee. We also look at the role we can play in terms of affordable housing and are working on certain ideas there.
</p><h4>
	What makes Cagamas stand out in the international market?
</h4><p>
	Cagamas continued to be accorded the international rating of A3 by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and the domestic ratings of AAA by both Malaysian Rating Corporation Berhad and RAM Rating Services Berhad. This is a testament to Cagamas' consistent track record of strong governance, robust assets quality, stable profitability and prudent risk management. In the past 30 years, there were two spikes during periods of crisis. During crises, banks usually would face a liquidity crunch and thus, would sell more loans while we also continue issuing bonds/sukuk to fund the purchases. There were adequate buyers of our papers even during crisis periods. When investors look to buy a bond/sukuk, they look at the rating, the yield, and liquidity of the papers. When investors buy a bond/sukuk, majority of them would want to keep it. That may not attract certain investors, particularly foreign investors to come in. For investors to buy a Cagamas MYR paper, they want to be sure they can exit at any point in time to sell the paper. What we have achieved is that some of our issuances are now included in some of the influential benchmark indices that investors look at, including dollar issuances and MYR issuances. Certain investors base their investment decision on the basket in the benchmark. To be within the benchmark is important in terms of creating secondary liquidity. The next thing we did was to create a dedicated pricing page in both Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. These pages show our outstanding bonds/sukuk to investors and also served as platforms for investors to obtain indicative pricing of Cagamas bonds/sukuk in the secondary market. Cagamas is the only corporation in the world that has a dedicated pricing page in Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. In 2016, we achieved MYR17.1 billion in volume in terms of secondary trading, which was more than double the MYR5.3 billion in 2015. As a result of these initiatives, foreign holdings of Cagamas papers including both bonds and sukuk increased from 0.5% in 2015 to about 8% in October 2016. However, after the US Presidential Election, there was an outflow, particularly by some banks and the foreign holdings of Cagamas bonds/sukuk is about 5-6% which is still credible.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From your side of the spectrum as a restaurant owner, what are some of the results of the reform to get Saudis active in tourism, recreation, and fine dining in their own country?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia now has a new vision for 2030 and it is aiming to reduce reliance on oil revenue and plan by 2020 to increase revenues from SAR34 billion to SAR160 billion. One of the strongest elements of this is to open tourism up and make it an income, whether that is local tourism or general tourism. A part of that is to give more chances for five-star hotels and restaurants to be available in the market with the benefits they need. Hospitality feels strong support from the government and they are trying to reduce all the government procedures if they are planning to establish a new restaurant or hotel. It is easier now and we are trying to be easier with the visas now especially when it comes to hospitality. They have also given us more space to create a more welcoming atmosphere for the customers. When you go to a restaurant with family or friends it is not just for food; it is an experience. It has to contain all the elements together; good food, good service, and atmosphere. That includes music and the possibility of live music. With Saudi Arabia's vision of 2030 and its target to reduce the Kingdom's reliance on oil revenues, along with its national transformation plan by 2020 to increase revenues from SAR34 billion to SAR160 billion, the Kingdom has given the hospitality industry the best opportunity to penetrate the local market with its support and blessing. The focal objective is to expand internal local tourism and upgrade the local experience to match state-of-the-art standards. Government support for Saudis in the hospitality industry has increased with sound regulations, ensuring excellence and transparency, which resulted in more flexibility in acquiring the required licenses and visas for manpower. The cultural change, moreover, has given us the opportunity to provide a more welcoming atmosphere to our customers, allowing their restaurant visits to be more than just food and beverage consumption, and escalate to an enriching experience of international cuisines, inspiring history, and beautiful music. The fine dinning industry is competing on different grounds with the recent changes; those who innovate the best experience will manage to capture imminent value. Therefore, we are looking into conducting various collaborations to provide live performances at our restaurants, along with featured Michelin chefs, and many other new elements to stay current in the hearts and minds of our beloved customers.</p><h4>Are there any new ventures that you are looking at for 2017?</h4><p>We are negotiating with a couple of brands to introduce to the Saudi market. When we look at the brands we do not just collect names. We try to target brands that have a history; for example, Fauchon is 168 years old. It is not just a concept of business—we are introducing a kind of history to the market here. One of the other ideas to work on is to introduce this the other way around and create a Saudi concept, presented in an elegant way like the French style that we can franchise outside the region. We are doing the study now and looking to start in London or Paris. It will be a Saudi restaurant and the way that it is presented will have a lot of weight on its success. There's always room for more! We're looking into a couple of international brands and negotiating some terms. It is pivotal to target brands that carry a strong heritage in their story, so we can enrich the local market with different cultures and experiences during the ultimate encounter. Take Fauchon for example; the brand is 168 years old, and it has evolved to a concept of impeccable heritage, rather than just a business. We also believe in our Saudi ability to play a crucial part in the international arena, hence, we are looking into creating a Saudi brand that is introduced abroad as such, and is franchised outside the region. The brand will capitalized on the Saudi cuisine, presented with high standards of excellence, like the French cuisine, and transferring our history to other countries through our culinary heritage. Cities like the London and Paris, where locals know of Saudi Arabia through the tourists only, will be the first hosts of this concept.</p><h4>What will an evolution of Saudi cuisine look like?</h4><p>The designer must be Saudi Arabian. It has to come altogether in one package that includes the design, atmosphere, and the way the dishes are presented. However, the touch and presentation is going to make the difference. Especially when it comes to Saudi and Arabic culture it is all about sharing. We are studying now and last week we did one presentation for a traditional name called Salikh. We presented it like risotto and all the people were impressed. I am not interested in opening it in Saudi; we want to brand it here and then open it abroad. Saudi Arabian cuisine must be created by Saudis! Arabic cuisine comes in a package of taste, spices, design, ambiance, and display, wrapped in a notion of “sharing." To differentiate this cuisine, immaculate presentation must be added to the mix. Currently, we are undergoing extensive trial research to perfect this notion. Last week, we presented a traditional Saudi dish called “Salig" as if it was risotto, and everyone gathered for the tasting was impressed. To succeed with such idea, we are more interested in introducing it abroad, while conceptualization and branding would be in Saudi.</p><h4>What other projects do you have in the medium term? Will you continue to focus on restaurants and dining?</h4><p>We have other investments such as in IT. I am also a local partner with IDC, which is an interior design company. It is based in Los Angeles and has an office in NC. I met my American partner whose origin is Lebanese and is now a designer; we have became good friends and local partners. We have a family business in real estate, but my passion and focus is food. I spend more time in the kitchen and we will be stronger and start a consultancy in this area because we receive a lot of calls. I used to do it a lot as a favor because there are many investors here trying to start a business. They think it is an easy business but it is complicated, and when they cannot make the next step they call me, or they contact us from the beginning with an investment idea for a restaurant but they do not know what to do. We are not constructing a consultancy and managerial department. If you have a restaurant and want management we can sign management agreements and provide the services from A to Z. We can hire staff, choose a name and location, decide on many details, like how the tables are set. The group has many investments in various industries, such as IT and interior design. I'm a local partner in IDC, which is an interior design company based in Los Angeles and has an office in NYC. My partner, who's an American with Lebanese origins, is a designer and we became friends and immediate local partners. Moreover, I'm involved with my family in real estate investment, but my true passion and focus is in food. I spend more time in the kitchen than anywhere else in my work, which paves the way to provide an industry specific consultancy. In recent times, we've been receiving many inquiries regarding our experience in this industry. I've been providing my mentorship and advice for free, relying on the needs inquired. Many entrepreneurs are interested in entering the restaurants market, but they lack the knowledge and experience, thinking that it is as easy mixing ingredients together and voilí ! We are now constructing a consultancy and management department, which will provide programs that will guide and help those interested in choosing the right brand name, hiring the right staff, understanding menu engineering, conducting a location study, managing interior operations, and creating that perfect experience.</p><h4>Do you have an IPO timeline?</h4><p>We are looking at a four- to five-year plan because the requirements are not easy. We have to have the structure of our company locked in place and not changed. It is a target and it is possible to achieve.</p><h4>Will growth come from opening many restaurants or using the consultancy business to expand the brands you own?</h4><p>I think it is going to be a mix of everything because we are going to open an office to value the company. The value of the company has to look at all the assets that it has and then the company is valued; it is better that we have it all under one umbrella. The group has a great understanding of the local market, and to maximize this knowledge, we need to look into our market share and aim at supreme strength. Therefore, the answer to your question must be a mix of both concepts, along with various innovative food related concepts. The value of the company has to look at all the assets that it has and then the company is valued; it is better that we have it all under one umbrella.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Deloitte Lebanon has experienced, over the years, a sustainable growth rate in terms of resources and managed revenues, and has continued enhancing quality and building its reputation by providing seamless and high-end professional services in most disciplines and to various economic sectors that are delivered to the market place in general and clients in particular. The firm currently enjoys a leading position in terms of reputation, size, and market recognition. During some critical periods of the country's recent history, Deloitte has been one of very few companies among those with multinational connections that continued serving the market without interruption. During that period many international firms opted to discontinue or reduce their operations, and for quite some time we remained one of very few firms with international connections serving in the market. We have continued serving our clients with the same degree of dedication and commitment. This strategy has paid off over the years and has no doubt helped to build market eminence with a strong presence and deep penetration within the business community. We continue to maintain, as a general rule, the same high level of loyalty and commitment to the market in general and our stakeholders in particular.</p><h4>When doing business, how do you evaluate Lebanon compared to the region?</h4><p>Throughout history and starting from the age of the Phoenicians, who invented the alphabet and concept of foreign trade, Lebanon has had a distinguished presence and recognition within its geography. For quite some time in modern history, it has been known as the Switzerland of the Middle East, but due to the geopolitical conflicts in the Levant region and periods of political and security instabilities, foreign investment has to some extent impacted business in or through Lebanon. Nevertheless, Beirut has always had something different and unique to offer; people, freedom, human capital, initiatives, and so on. For many years the country was a center of attraction to the missionaries who contributed to higher education. I would cite for example the American University of Beirut, which just celebrated its 150th anniversary, and the Jesuits' educational presence goes back 140 years. Lebanon has become a key source for talent and skills deployed to the region, thus becoming a critical source of foreign income that flows to the country in the absence of natural resources. Education and cultural diversity have given the country a strong competitive edge and advantage to deploy talents to the Gulf region and Africa, and many Lebanese people have reached leadership positions and achieved remarkable success. For all these reasons, Lebanon will continue to play the key role of exporting talent and skills to the region and beyond. As Lebanese people, we always have high expectations for greater opportunities and a better future, which explains the massive emigration to the West, to places such as Europe, Canada, South America, and the US, for example. As a general rule, the Lebanese diaspora, especially the last two generations, continue to maintain connections with the country, supporting families and relatives, which has been a great help to social stability and helped to a great extent the sustainability of the current business model of the country. Because of this high and non-disputable level of commitment, I personally believe that Lebanon cannot fail.</p><h4>What are the most common concerns for foreign companies that are keen to enter the Lebanese market?</h4><p>Lebanon has for many years been a point of attraction for many foreign companies. Prior to the war, which ended in early 1990s, most foreign companies' first priority was to establish a presence in Beirut, either for offshoring or to engage in domestic operations. This attention to Beirut may have diminished over the years to the benefit of other locations, due to political conflict and security instability in the country and the region. However, many foreign institutions still look at Lebanon as a place to be because of the availability of talent and resources, cultural diversity, and the foreign languages mastered by its community. Many of the foreign institutions that used to operate out of Beirut have re-located and have chosen Dubai as the place to have their regional offices; I am a strong believer that Lebanon has the ingredients and potential to attract many of these companies back. What investors need is sustainable security and reliable services in the public domain, which are progressively improving. Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, has the foundations to be attractive to foreign corporations and businesses, starting with its proximity to Europe, free trade, and a strong regulated banking system that imposes adherence and compliance on international regulations, climate, a good private education system at a reasonable and affordable cost, the availability of affordable human capital, an advanced healthcare industry, and private initiatives in various areas of business. All that it needs is to restore trust in the public service and infrastructure.</p><h4>How is Deloitte contributing to transparency at all levels of the economy?</h4><p>Promoting transparency and anti-corruption, which is a goal and should be a strategic objective for the economy to move forward, requires putting in place and formalizing the necessary and pre-requisite policies and procedures with the right authority matrix, empowering people with the right tools to measure performance and accountability, as well as applying discipline in implementation. This triggers real interaction and dialog between the private sector and the administration to restore trust, and reach a situation where the public sees concrete benefits in the services they are paying for. We as a firm contribute to promoting best practices by setting an example through rigorous procedures of ethical standards and corporate values. These factors, which have to be on the government agenda, are instrumental to fight corruption and enhance transparency over time. In today's world, upgrading a country's rating for transparency and anti-corruption and promoting business ethics are preconditions for attracting investments and foreign capital. From our side we continue promoting transparency in financial reporting, credibility, and integrity in business conduct, and these all work together in harmony as they are key for financial and social stability. Transparency and Anti-corruption form a culture that starts by introducing in the curriculum educational material on civil rights and duties, enforcing discipline in the market, and formulating tools for promoting transparency and fighting corruption. We stand strong in promoting corporate values based on best practices and standing against any activities like engaging in anti-trust and/or unethical behaviors in interactions either with the public sector or the community at large. When everybody takes a strong stance against corruption this enhances transparency in favor of diminishing illegalities. The public sector is perceived and expected to act as a preferred service provider to the community and be assessed accordingly based on performance. This goes through a journey for transparency in business conduct. It also goes along with commitment and a strong message from the top of the hierarchy alongside with the restructuring, reform, and modernization of the administration to make it more efficient and effective, which is the goal set already by the country's leadership.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>“Katara" was the historical name for Qatar's peninsula prior to the 18th century. What is the importance of this institution for the preservation of Qatari heritage and traditions?</h4><p>The message of Katara is inspired by the cultural originality and historical depth of its name. Katara was first used to indicate Qatar on Ptolemaic maps in 150 AD. The Cultural Village was built on the eastern borders to be the first to receive sunlight, just like the sun of knowledge shining over the world from the heart of Qatar. This is why we are working on providing a range of activities, events, and festivals with different forms and content. Some aim to revive the heritage of our ancestors, ancient traditions, and customs, such as the Senyar Championship and the Halal Qatar Festival, while others highlight different cultures, such as the Ecuador Festival, the ASEAN Festival, in addition to numerous exhibitions and workshops. </p><h4>How do you assess your position as a cultural hub in the Middle East?</h4><p>Katara includes a massive number of centers and societies, such as the Al-Bahie Auction House, the Qatar Fine Arts Association, Katara Art Studios, and the Youth Hobbies Center. Katara sponsors many events in line with its vision in tandem with various centers and societies. We also host many cultural events in collaboration with various embassies in Qatar, such as Roots (Latin American Festival) and the European Jazz Festival. In fact, Katara has succeeded in being a culturally attractive destination, not only in Qatar or the Gulf region, but also throughout the Middle East. </p><h4>What is the appeal of Katara's facilities for hosting international festivals and becoming a world leader in multi-cultural activities?</h4><p>Thanks to its several facilities and high quality services, Katara has successfully hosted major global events in the amphitheater, which accommodates 5,000 people. We hosted several lectures, most notably one called "Does God Exist?" by the Islamic preacher Dr. Zakir Naik, which was attended by more than 13,000 people. We also provided visitors with large screens on the waterfront of the Cultural Village. For the first time in Qatar and the Middle East, Katara hosted the fourth edition of the International Opera and Classical Music Awards Ceremony (Oscar Della Lirica). Our amphitheater was inaugurated on 2011 under the slogan, “Qatar calling for peace," and had musical performances by the renowned Greek musician Vangelis, along with a number of traditional fine art paintings by renowned artists such as Angelina Giroggio, Roberto Alagna, and Jeremy Irons. </p><h4>How are you cooperating with local academic institutions to make an impact on human capital development?</h4><p>The Cultural Village signed many agreements and MoUs with numerous universities, including CMU-Q, Qatar University, and Stenden University, in its effort to promote cooperation in the fields of education, scientific research, and community development. This also includes the provision of vocational training for university students and the exchange of professional and scientific expertise in various fields. </p><h4>What is your approach toward the MICE sector?</h4><p>As part of its tireless efforts to promote a culture of technology and attract energetic youth to develop their skills, the Cultural Village Foundation organized the Katara Tech Forum under the theme Culture of Technology, which promotes public awareness of information technology and discusses the latest developments in digital technology. The full details of the Katara Smart City Project were also revealed. Moreover, we organize various forums in different areas, including the Gulf Forum for Aquaculture and Agriculture Tourism.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What pillars will drive the growth of the tourism sector on its path to achieving 10 million annual visits by 2030?</h4><p>Qatar's National Tourism Sector Strategy (QNTSS) was launched in 2014, charting a pathway for developing the country's tourism sector through 2030. Since QNTSS was launched in 2014, tourism in Qatar has developed rapidly to become a viable economic sector and has proven capable of contributing to economic diversification on a national level. So much so that it has been designated by the country's leadership as one of the five priority sectors in the Qatar National Development Plan 2017-2022. In the process, new sub-sectors and projects have emerged, and with them an extensive group of new government and industry stakeholders. We have also refined our monitoring tools and gathered new data, which may shift our future targets and projections. While the vision behind QNTSS is to develop Qatar into a world-class tourism destination that reflects our cultural heritage, it will remain broadly the same, as the approach will be clearly articulated and focused on bringing private and public sector stakeholders together to achieve this.</p><h4>How could the recently revised tourism visa scheme promote the country as a world-class stopover destination?</h4><p>Since QNTSS launched in 2014, there have been many milestone achievements that have shaped and defined the country's tourism sector. These include major policy developments that have eased access to the country through a transparent and swift tourist visa application process, as well as the introduction of a free, 96-hour transit visa. Within just six months of its introduction, we are seeing a 40% YoY increase in stopover visitors to Qatar. </p><h4>In light of the redevelopment of Doha Port as a cruise terminal and tourist attraction, how is QTA working to boost the number of tourists?</h4><p>The 2016/2017 season witnessed a 1,000% increase in the number of passengers and 120% increase in the number of cruise ships docking in Doha. By the 2019/2020 season, port calls are expected to triple, bringing approximately 300,000 visitors to Qatar's shores aboard cruise ships.</p><h4>What are the results of the Shop Qatar program in strengthening Qatar's position as a shopping destination and promoting Made in Qatar products?</h4><p>The economic impact of the tourism sector in Qatar is becoming increasingly visible. According to the draft 2015 Qatar Tourism Satellite Account, a system approved by the UN Statistical Commission for establishing the economic impact of tourism on a country's economy, Qatar's tourism sector made a total contribution of 4.3% to the country's total GDP, representing 8.8% total contribution to the country's non-hydrocarbon GDP. The economic impact of tourism is particularly evident during the nation-wide festivals, such as Qatar Summer Festival 2016 and the inaugural shopping festival, Shop Qatar 2017, each contributing an estimated USD100 million and USD290 million to the national economy, respectively.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2017?</h4><p>Once the QNTSS's review process is complete, we will have crystallized the tourism sector's targets for 2030 and identified with a clear focus what the industry needs to deliver in order to achieve those targets, both from within the sector and those that can enable its growth. One key feature of the next chapter is that this development will be spearheaded by the private sector. This will inject new energy and ideas into tourism projects and is expected to usher in a new phase of growth for tourism and the broader economy. QTA will continue to provide guidance and support to every stakeholder and will work to ensure that it is on the path to fulfilling its role in the realization of Qatar National Vision 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess your role in positioning Qatar at the forefront of the sporting world?</h4><p>Qatar's position as a world sports hub grows stronger by the day. The country is fast emerging as the region's sporting capital. Following more than a decade of dedicated and focused investment and backing from the country's visionary leadership and the steady expansion of sports-related industries, our progress in sports development is an enormous source of national pride. AZF, along with its member organizations, is at the heart of these developments as the world's leading sports destination. Since being established, AZF has adopted a clear approach to contributing to Qatar's vibrant and growing sports economy, whilst supporting the human and economic pillars of the Qatar National Vision 2030. By 2020, AZF aims to be the worldwide reference in sports excellence. With a world-leading sports academy, logistics business, and renowned orthopedic and sports medicine hospital, we are uniquely placed to catalyze the country's sports industry. The great historical opening of the fully renovated Khalifa International Stadium that took place on May 19, 2017 is undoubted proof that AZF is leading the sports industry in Qatar. </p><h4>What are some the most important events AZF has hosted in its managed facilities during 2016?</h4><p>Aspire Zone is home to some of the finest sporting facilities and services in the world. Aspire Dome is the world's largest indoor, multi-purpose sports stadium with a seating capacity of 15,500 spread across 13 sports halls. Both here and in our other facilities and sites, including the 4,500-seat Hamad Aquatic Centre and the 88-ha Aspire Park, we host a multitude of sporting and cultural events each year. In 2016, we delivered and hosted more than 160 events. These included everything from community events to major medical conferences such as the Challenges in Football Injuries hosted by Aspetar in partnership with the FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence and ISAKOS and the 2016 ASPIRE4SPORT and Global Summit on Football Performance and Science.</p><h4>How is AZF focusing on its R&amp;D activities, and how could this impact Qatar's economic development?</h4><p>AZF's Centre of Excellence for natural sports turf research and development is working in close partnership with the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy to develop the turf that will cover the pitches at the World Cup in five years' time. Together we recently did the turf for the Khalifa International Stadium in world record time, covering 7,800sqm of turf in 13 hours and 30 minutes. Not only will our involvement in supporting the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar create an incredible sporting legacy for the country, the region, and all of Asia, but by playing our part in building stadiums like Khalifa International, we are contributing to the tournament's lasting social legacy. Khalifa International Stadium's state-of-the-art technology, such as the innovative cooling technology and regional-first stadium LED lighting, will also mean that sports can be played at the venue all year round, day or night. We are playing a key role in the development and diversification of the country's economy.</p><h4>What could be AZF's contribution to the development of projects for sports-related industries?</h4><p>In 2016, AZF signed an MoU with the Ministry of Economy and Commerce for the provision of support services to sports projects and businesses. Part of this objective is the creation of a platform for businesses to participate in the growing industry. We believe the contribution of AZF will be vital in achieving these through different global partnerships and joint ventures. The sports industry is still young, and there is a lot to be done in this promising and fast-growing field. Accordingly, we have a big plan for the coming years as AZF almost doubles its current space. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have an incredibly exciting few years ahead of us, with much to do. We have the right strategy and plan and an incredible range of skills, expertise, and capabilities on which to draw. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Sidra setting a new standard for healthcare in Qatar?</h4><p>Sidra Medical and Research Center is a groundbreaking hospital, research, and education institution, focusing on the health and well-being of children and women locally, regionally, and globally. Once fully operational, it will be the only provider of acute pediatric services in Qatar, as well as the sole tertiary center for providing maternal services involving fetal complications. Sidra will be a fully digital facility, incorporating the most advanced information technology applications in all its functions. Sidra opened its outpatient services in May 2016 with the launch of three clinics. Since then, we have launched 46 clinics and services and have cared for over 16,000 patients. We offer several unique services including the country's first women's well-being clinic dedicated to providing perinatal mental healthcare services. When fully operational, we expect to deliver 9,000-10,000 births per annum. We also launched Qatar's first child advocacy program. </p><h4>What parameters do you follow when hiring high-skilled physicians?</h4><p>We are making considerable progress in our recruitment of specialized staff including clinical and non-clinical hires. We now have over 1,500 talented doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals, medical administration, and support service staff. We are recruiting fast, and we are excited that we will be welcoming more than 2,000 new recruits over the coming months. Our talent comes from far and wide in the world, and we currently have 70 different nationalities working at Sidra. The pace and scale of expansion of our services will depend on our ability to recruit suitably qualified staff as certain very specialized staff are in short supply worldwide. Our criteria for doctors are those who are trained and qualified to recognized international standards.</p><h4>What role does research play in your long-term strategy, and what is your role within the Qatar Genome Program (QGP)?</h4><p>Sidra's research capabilities are tied to the ultimate goal of improving healthcare delivery in Qatar. And we cannot achieve this in isolation. Sidra is part of a dynamic research and education environment in Qatar; through strong national partnerships and with leading institutions around the world, we are creating an intellectual ecosystem to help advance scientific discovery through investment in medical research. Sidra's research branch aims to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases; develop early prevention, accurate diagnostic and advance therapeutics; and improve the health outcomes of the women and children of Qatar. We are competitive at an international level now, creating comprehensive Qatari genomic databases, which will form the building blocks for precision medicine, not only in Qatar, but also in the wider Middle East. The country has made significant investment in genomic and biomedical research, and Sidra is testament to that investment. Our ambition is to grow the nation's genetic and genomic offering by providing high quality services supported by cutting-edge research to improve health and well-being in Qatar. Sidra has been one of the major players from the beginning of the Qatar Genome Program (QGP) and has been actively involved in proposal development, discussions and strategic planning for the QGP. We have completed QGP's pilot phase, having sequenced 3,000 genomes, and the next phase is underway. Sidra has also put in place an end-to-end Next Generation Sequencing data analysis system in partnership with WuXi NextCode to manage and mine more sequences than any other system in the world. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Sidra is set to shortly launch an ambitious long-term strategy 2019-2024, which provides a strong foundation upon which to meet the changing needs of its patients, community, and the wider health system. The Sidra Long-Term Strategy is clinically driven, with research and education components that reinforce the development of the clinical services that make the strongest contribution toward improving the health and well-being of women and children in a sustainable way. Sidra's ambition for 2024 is to have established a strong program of translational biomedical research. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the ministry's major accomplishments after completing the National Health Strategy 2011-2016?</h4><p>Improving the health of Qatar's population is a key element of Qatar's National Strategy 2030 and the first National Health Strategy (NHS) 2011-2016 has provided the building blocks to make this a reality. Working with our main providers in healthcare—Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC), and private clinics—we have started the important shift from treatment to prevention. This first strategy enabled us to develop plans for tackling some of Qatar's most pressing health problems, including cancer, diabetes, and mental health. I am especially proud of the creation of the National Cancer Registry, as well as a national screening program for breast and bowel cancer and the opening and expansion of both primary care and specialist facilities. </p><h4>What measures is the ministry taking to increase the number of doctors in Qatar?</h4><p>Qatar's population is rapidly growing and is incredibly diverse. To meet the needs of our evolving nation, we are opening a range of new hospitals across the public health system that will increase the number of beds by 1,100. HMCs has begun the largest expansion program in its history. Four new hospitals—the Communicable Disease Center, Women's Wellness and Research Center, Ambulatory Care Center, and Qatar Rehabilitation Institute—will significantly increase capacity across our system and provide state-of-the-art environments in which our expert teams can provide care for their patients. This is being done alongside similar growth in the PHCC, where it is increasing the number of its health centers to 35 in the coming years. </p><h4>How will the healthcare industry of Qatar benefit from the first organ donation academy?</h4><p>For many people, a transplant can mean the gift of life, and making the decision to register as a donor is a personal choice. At the heart of our organ donation system is fairness and equity. We have a single, unified waiting list and have led the way in terms of support for donors and their families. In 2015, HMC performed 19 kidney transplants and six liver transplants, a jump from previous years. The number of organ transplants increased tenfold between 2009 and 2015. More than 100,000 potential donors have registered with Qatar's pioneering Organ Donor Registry, marking a major milestone for us. The academy will promote education and research in organ donation, both in Qatar and internationally. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the private sector's involvement in Qatar's healthcare industry?</h4><p>As our population continues to grow and its needs change, so too does the need for the public sector to work more collaboratively and closely with its private sector colleagues to deliver the best healthcare possible. HH Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has acknowledged this and encouraged us to work together. He said in his address at the opening of the 45th Advisory Council meeting in November 2016 that although healthcare is the responsibility of the state, it is necessary that we must “benefit from an interaction between the private and public sectors.“ In the future, the private sector will play a fundamental role in helping reduce pressure on the public sector by running hospital facilities and providing certain services. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the Ministry over the next 12 months?</h4><p>HMC is opening three new hospitals before mid-2017, and the PHCC is opening new health centers in the coming months. We will also launch two national strategies: Qatar's first Public Health Strategy and our new National Health Strategy, which covers 2017-2022. The Public Health Strategy sets a vision for “a comprehensive, dynamic and collaborative health system, working together to improve the health and prosperity of Qatar.“ The new National Health Strategy will build on the considerable work achieved as part of the NHS 2011-2016 based on three clear principles—better health, better care, and better value. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Healthcare expenditure in the UAE is just 3.5% of GDP]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[david-hadley-ceo-of-mediclinic-middle-east]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How far along is the integration of Al Noor Group into Mediclinic's structure?</h4><p>Approximately 18 months ago we acquired the Al Noor group in Abu Dhabi, making us one of the largest healthcare providers across the UAE, with facilities in Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, the Western Region, and Dubai. We spent most of the year working on that integration. There were many challenges during that phase, and due to the sudden changes within the regulatory framework. In Dubai things are going well. The economy across the UAE is not growing as it used to during the boom years of 2011-2014. Living within the constraints of the new oil price is however becoming the norm, and all government entities and businesses are realigning their business practices accordingly, but despite this all we have confidence in the future of the UAE and are thus still growing. In Dubai we opened our comprehensive cancer center in September 2016 and it has been performing ahead of expectations since opening. We are currently building a comprehensive cancer center in The Mediclinic Airport Road Hospital in Abu Dhabi too, as part of the expansion project where we will add an additional 100 in-patient beds. We are also busy with upgrade projects across most of our existing hospitals and clinics, and have recently announced that we are building a new hospital in the Western Region. In the beginning of January this year we inaugurated the Mediclinic Al Jowhara hospital in Al Ain, and it is performing well. One of the largest greenfield facilities in Dubai is starting operations next year too; it is a 180+ bed hospital on the southern side of Dubai called the Mediclinic Parkview hospital. Finally, we completed the rebranding of all the newly-acquired Al Noor facilities to Mediclinic during the last year.</p><h4>What are the differences between the regulatory framework in Abu Dhabi and Dubai?</h4><p>The role of all the players in the healthcare system is very different between the Emirates. In Dubai, the regulator, on top of setting policy, also manages the government hospitals. They are not really growing these hospitals as they want the private sector to invest and take on this responsibility, so they support the private sector and competition through policy. The payer sector is also very competitive - when mandatory health insurance was introduced in Dubai, there were initially seven providers that could provide the basic package to the market, whereas in Abu Dhabi there is just the one provider. This means that this one provider comprises two-thirds of the market. The rest of the companies are fighting for that remaining one-third, so it is not as competitive as Dubai. In Abu Dhabi, the regulator also sets policy but it does not operate the public hospitals directly and thus onus is not left to the private sector to take on this responsibility.</p><h4>What effect does medical tourism in the region have on your business?</h4><p>How the statistics are garnered for medical tourism can be misleading, as an example, emergency room visits from a normal tourist could be considered as medical tourism, so statistics need to be read in context. There is a medical tourism visa now available for healthcare specifically, but those numbers are still growing. I do however see potential for growth in the medium to long term. It is important to understand that medical tourism occurs due to one of three reasons. Firstly, the person does not have access to such services in their home countries. Secondly, the quality of facilities in the source country is not as required. And thirdly people are looking for healthcare at a cheaper price. When it comes to price the UAE cannot compete with lower income countries such as India and Thailand. But we can compete on quality and this is the area we need to focus on.</p><h4>In what areas do you see the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Whilst the healthcare spend per capita is fairly high at USD2,200 per capita it must be remembered that the UAE is a High-Income country. The expenditure on healthcare in the UAE is actually still fairly low as a percentage of the GDP at around 3.5%. That will inevitably increase over time as quality improves and less people travel abroad for their healthcare needs. Whilst around 80% of our customers are expats and whilst less than 1% of the population are over the age of 65, there is an ever-ageing population and the burden of disease is increasing with increasing prevalence of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancers. All of these factors will increase the cost of healthcare over time.</p><h4>In what GCC countries do you see more potential for expansion?</h4><p>We have expansion plans within the UAE, to other Emirates like Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, and Umm al-Quwain. We previously looked at Qatar but we anticipated that there was potential political uncertainty so did not invest. We have looked at other countries in the region such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia and there is certainly a lot of opportunity, but we are going to wait first to see how certain country specific macro factors develop.</p><h4>What are the most important trends you see coming into healthcare?</h4><p>The regulations will increase and I hope that there will be a larger focus on ethics and the subsequent cost of over utilization. Improved technology will also make a more significant impact on the services within healthcare. Artificial intelligence will be a large component of this technology and will support improved quality of care. The patient to doctor relationship will also change; we will have mobile health such as video and telephonic appointments plus wearables will become a more significant part a of healthcare monitoring.. It is important to note that these innovations whilst expensive will need to be adapted quickly. Healthcare is an exciting and an ever-changing environment and the UAE is at the forefront of these changes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[chief-tunde-j-afolabi-chairman-ceo-amni-international-petroleum-development-company]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your current gas projects and the progress of attracting project funds?</h4><p>We estimated it would cost us over USD3 billion to develop all our assets at Tubu, Okoro, and IMA fields. We have about 45 million barrels of oil in Tubu, about 45 million barrels of oil in Okoro, and 3.2 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas between Okoro and IMA. We recently went on a roadshow to get companies, financial institutions, and off takers to look at our assets and investment opportunities, where we received a positive response. We have also reached out to banks in Europe and the US, who are currently going through the due diligence process. We hope to be able to have the transaction closed before the end of the year.</p><h4>Are you currently focusing more on gas than oil?</h4><p>In Nigeria, we find gas when we are looking for oil; I do not think there is anyone who has actually gone out looking for gas in this country. It costs the same amount of money to drill a gas well as it does to drill an oil well, and globally the price of oil is perhaps twice or even triple the price of gas. Therefore, I would rather put my money into a 200 million barrel oil field than a 200 million barrel equivalent of gas. However, more often a gas reservoir has huge yields compared to oil. Most oil projects have a lifetime of five to 10 years; however, for gas it is about 25 years. Given that Nigeria has three to four times more gas than oil, companies such as ours should focus more on gas; in our discovery of gas reserves we should look to harness and monetize the gas as we go along. The government is making a requirement that when looking for oil, companies must find a solution for the gas before they are allowed to produce oil. We have too much flaring, which is like taking a pattering touch to it. This is what we have been doing with gas, which is a loss of revenue and also ruins the environment; we have serious pollution in the Niger Delta as a result of gas flaring. In Nigeria, we have power issues because we do not have gas; thus, we need to make sure we monetize the gas while also reducing environmental pollution.</p><h4>What is your current production volume?</h4><p>Our current production is about 20,000 bpd. After we conclude the ongoing developments, we will get closer to 50,000 bpd and about 700 mmscfd of gas per day. Our ultimate goal of 200,000 bpd is realizable within three to four years as we are pursuing several assets in the region as well as a prospective license in Ghana, where the field could easily yield 70,000 bpd.</p><h4>How do you see the interaction between the IOCs and the indigenous companies in developing the sector?</h4><p>I see significant requirement for development in the service sector. Close to 80% of the money we spend in the oil and gas industry goes out of the country; so if only 20% stays in the country, that is a fraction of what should stay and therefore not sustainable. We currently spend USD8 billion a year in the operations of oil and gas in Nigeria. If we could develop the service sector and keep 60% of that, that is USD5 billion that could be kept within the economy. This in turn would increase employment, work transfer skills, technology, and more. However, in the upstream, there is a great deal of cooperation right now between independent indigenous oil and gas companies and the IOCs. It is a symbiotic relationship, where IOCs do not want to lose their assets and the only people they can get to buy them are indigenous companies. There is a great relationship. In fact, 90% of IOCs are run by locals so Nigerians are the ones being trained and developed by the IOCs.</p><h4>How do you see the crisis in the Niger Delta being managed?</h4><p>The problem is that the IOCs say they have done a great deal, while the local communities say they have done nothing. I see truth in both, so it is about reaching a balance. It is difficult to take someone's asset and not leave something behind. We had communities in the Niger Delta that say that they have had better treatment from Amni than Shell, which is a great testament. One should treat people the way they want to be treated and they will respond well. We ask the community to put forward contractors and we tell them to bring a letter of credit from a known bank so that if the job they perform is not up to scratch, then the bank will repay us. The bank supervises the contract and in doing so we have brought services to the community and empowered them. The model is something that the IOCs need to consider. Indigenous companies have more onshore dealings and are more successful, not because they are Nigerians, but because they are more genuine. They will sit down together with the host communities and talk things through.</p><h4>What are your expectations in 2018?</h4><p>I can only talk about the global economy because the Nigerian economy hardly affects our operation. I hope we will be able to stabilize oil prices at between USD50 and USD60 a barrel; if we were to do that, at the very least the plans we have for 2018, which is to reach 50,000 bpd, will be achievable. For these three projects, we will be kept extremely busy for next year; 2018 will be a great year for us. We are looking at a few assets that we should be able to acquire that will allow us to look further into 2019 and 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The Saudi market is so vast and complicated market therefor; it was essential for our expertise to be comprehensively aligned with the business demand and be able to deal with our projects form the ground up to start up, this gave us the opportunity to work with more experienced local and international partners on major government projects (The insulation of diesel generators and gas turbines for building, subways, and airports), this went on until the end of the 2015 fiscal year. 2015 was the pivotal year for the company, with audacity the company established a reputation for high quality and precision, this success made the company expand and gain more business ground. Suffice it is to say that in 2015 the Zahran Holding requested Technical Development to join Zahran Holding group of companies and after a difficult negotiations we believed it was not a hasty decision but rather it was a decision with prowess, and it was in our business best interest to join such a mammoth group of companies for it is in line with our long term business plan.</p><h4>Where do you see the current state of the local construction sector?</h4><p>For the past 30 years the government was the sole supplier of electrical power for all its citizens and in charge of all related aspects of power providing from infrastructure, power generators, power grids, and connectivity to the end user. This philosophy was working when the population was 7 million, but now the game has changed, the population has increased dramatically, now it is around 30 million and expected to reach 40 to 45 million in the next 10 to 15 years. These statistics alone made the decision makers think seriously that this current practice cannot go on forever for it is very expansive, with vast areas to cover, and is far more complicated than ever. It was decided that the government should not be totally in charge and being the sole provider of electricity. In 2013 the government made the decision to invite the privet sector to join in as a partner with aim to improve services, generate income, and open a new business opportunities for the private sector and employment opportunities for young Saudi engineers and technicians. This government business oriented policy will eventually eliminate the long and bureaucratic government project budgeting and awarding decision making, these facts are an important factors for the private sector to take the initiative to align itself with the new era, I am happy to say that we are currently up and ready to accommodate these new opportunities.</p><h4>Regarding the government's Vision 2030, which aspect of the reforms do you think will impact the industry and TDC the most?</h4><p>The 2030 country vision laid the groundwork for the government new projects processes that are less bureaucratic and more transparent in addition to the privatization of some public sectors and agencies. These endless opportunities for the privet sector involvement in the country infrastructure (roads, dams, power stations, airports, and sea ports, truism hotels and resorts, railways, medical cities and industrial cities) along with the government partnership together will ensure the country a bright and promising future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mowaffaq-al-hashimy-ceo-saqifat-al-safa]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Will the real estate sector continue its downward trend or is it on course for a rationalization?</h4><p>The market has recently been affected by an issue that not many are aware of. In January 2014, there were housing loan rights laws. This law was issued so people know the terms and procedures to obtain both land and a loan to build a house. Approximately 1.4 million people applied for the land loan that the government announced. Since then, the volume of land trade and real estate overall has started to decline, because 1.4 million family heads applied and 1.15 million were accepted. These people cannot buy land or houses in order to get this loan, so this triggered a decline in the volume of trading in real estate. Every time I talk to people about this they are unaware. According to statistics I have worked on obtaining from the Ministry of Justice, the overall fall in volumes since January 2014 to today is 48.6%. Over the last five months the overall market has fallen 18.95% compared to last year. Last year it fell 25% and the year before it fell 15.6%. The overall decline from the beginning of the fall and issue of the law of land and loan has fallen 48.6%. This fall is divided into two parts: the residential market and the commercial market. The residential property market has fallen 52.6% and the commercial real estate market has fallen 40.82% meaning that it has not fallen in price, it has fallen in the volume of trade.</p><h4>So commercial has been impacted by the larger economic downturn whereas residential has been impacted by this program from 2014 with land loans?</h4><p>Yes, there is an impact on both. Some of the commercial has housing in it and I would say half of the commercial if not more includes housing because there is commercial on the ground floor and residential on the upper floors. Statistics tell that 52.8% was allocated to housing and 40% was allocated to commercial. Of the land and loan applicants, we estimate that 7-8% of them used to buy and sell property. But those people have refrained from doing so because if they do buy something they will be ineligible for the land and loan. If we want the real estate market to boost again, the government should lean up on the turn where you cannot buy a house or land during the waiting period. If they allow people to buy and sell until they get the loan, then it will be ok. When they get the loan they can either get the loan without the land or if they have not purchased anything they can get both. This will boost the market incredibly.</p><h4>Will the land tax be good for business for developers like yourself?</h4><p>Of course, we are sharpening our pencils for it. Many shopping malls, retail strips, and housing compounds will start rising. The owners of these projects will have to dispose of their land either by leasing or selling. They will have to be financed, so banks will have a big window for financing projects or people against collaterals. Some people have owned some of these parcels for 40 years and did nothing with them. They do not add value to the land and they are just keeping it there. Our children and grandchildren as well cannot own houses. They have to go farther districts to own a house. What the government is after is actually to make it fair for everyone and to create more reasonable prices.</p><h4>Could you give us a bit of a background on Darb Al-Haramain Project next to the High-speed Train Station that you are developing? </h4><p>When the government decided to launch the Haramain Railway between Mecca and Madina, it put its main station in a neighborhood called Al-Sulemania in Jeddah. We coordinated with the landowner and a fund to develop a large project adjacent to the station. The train station will require 17,000-20,000 hotel rooms within the first five years of operation. Mass transport always requires property around it. We have the only fully developed land parcel in that area of its size, 1.4 million sqm. When the project started, the development became a valuable proposition for the landowner. That is why the Fund was pursued and created, the project, and have started development. I spoke with many businessmen who want to pitch in and asked to be introduced to the project. It is an investment proposition that people need, and this land will deliver that to investors. There is a section for housing and I am sure any business type service will require B2B and B2C, which will also require residential services. I estimate 60% of the land development will be focused on commerce and hospitality and 40% will be focused on the residential market because right next to us is King Abdulaziz university and shopping malls. The area has many features and access routes to highways.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2017 and your plans for the rest of the year?</h4><p>The government may announce that it wants to go to a higher spending scheme, but I doubt that will happen because oil prices have not yet stabilized at a favorable price. Even if they do, the government has a shortage of funds that it has to compensate for. The government has great amounts of cash on hand but this is sovereign type of wealth that has to be maintained. I think it is healthy to tighten the belt and look for ways to go about excessive spending and so on. The oil prices are not rewarding and cutting off the fat was done well by the government. I doubt it will go into a spending spree before 2022. If it cancels this clause for the land and loan that the government has announced in 2014 and allows applicants to buy property and still get the land and loan, there will be a big boost in the real estate sector. We are in the core business and see things from different dimensions because we always ask questions. We want to know the reason and I have not seen any company in real estate come up with an assessment. We came up with it on our own and there is nothing convincing. The government should lean upon that clause. I am sure everything will pick up again, which should promote more construction and more products to sell.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did ISL Group decide to move into the Middle Eastern market and establish a presence in Qatar in 2007?</h4><p>The International School of London was founded in London in 1972 and became one of the first International Baccalaureate (IB) schools in the world. We were a successful yet small school looking to expand, but were having difficulties finding school sites in London; therefore, we started exploring opportunities outside the UK. Our move to Qatar was coincidental; the vice-president of Shell, an ISL parent, moved to Doha and suggested we establish an ISL school in the country. We then realized that an IB school with the international character of ISL was needed. At that time, the Supreme Education Council had started the Outstanding Schools Initiative, and we were one of the first schools selected for the program. It helped us with the legal procedures and logistics of establishing a school in the country, including providing us with a fully furnished building. Five months after signing the contract, we had 400 students in our classrooms. 10 years after getting started, we are considered one of the leading international schools in the country.</p><h4>How have you established a model of excellence in these 10 years of operations?<br></h4><p>From our perspective, offering high-quality education is valuable for both expatriates and locals. We have an international program that allows students to apply for college in every part of the world. Since we opened the school, we emphasized the fact that we were an international school that had diversity as one of its main pillars. There are 70 nationalities in our student body, with the largest group being Qataris, at 20%. Our staff also comes from over 30 countries. Therefore, we are truly multicultural and do not have one dominant ethnic group. </p><h4>How does ISL Qatar stay ahead in a very competitive and growing sector?</h4><p>One of the challenges that every international school faces in Qatar is the global war for talent—so we have an effective recruitment and retention policy. Maintaining quality is key to staying ahead of the competition. However, we believe that competition is healthy; IB programs are not suited for everybody, and it is good that there are different educational opportunities for students and their families. Nevertheless, ISL Group is looking to grow its presence in Qatar to meet increasing demand through our plans to expand our existing facilities by building a swimming pool, a theater, and more classrooms. In a slightly different approach, we launched MIEDAN, an education consulting company. </p><h4>How do you maintain cooperation with local institutions?</h4><p>We have a strong and positive longstanding relationship with the Ministry of Education and continue to explore ways of helping shape the educational landscape of the country. Over the years, we hosted many important events, such as a symposium on autism in 2012, the Alliance for International Education World Conference in 2014, and an admissions conference in 2017. We also conduct regular workshops open to teachers from other local and international schools as well as ministry representatives. Moreover, we have recently set up a partnership with an institution called Maximum Potential, which offers support for students with sensory integration dysfunction. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will move forward with our expansion plans for ISL Qatar, both in facility development and growth, as we are running at full capacity at our current site. We will also focus on developing MIEDAN. The ISL Group has maintained a conservative approach since we expanded into Qatar to ensure sustainable growth. We do not look at education as simply an investment or business opportunity. Our driving force is to make a difference in education. Our growth in the region will always stem from that mission. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Since 2013 Jamaican debt is declining]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[therese-turner-jones-gm-country-department-caribbean-group-inter-american-development-bank]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you pin down the macroeconomic landscape of Jamaica?</h4><p>The Jamaican economy has not grown substantially for 30 years. It is heavily indebted, a combination of domestic and external debt. Jamaica's financial crisis in 1997 had a massive impact on the financial landscape and economy at large (costing 45% of GDP). There are a lot of residual effects associated with that crisis, possibly mostly on the level of public debt. In recent years, notably since 2013, the debt is on a declining trajectory and the macroeconomic management of the country is much improved. This, however, does not mean that Jamaica is out of the woods as debt to GDP is still over 100%. Nevertheless, the country is on the right track. Where there is room to improve quickly is on the growth side. Jamaica's private sector is dominated by a few family-owned companies, of which some are some listed on the stock exchange. Our research on the private sector shows that there is little innovation in the country—not that some pockets do exist, but there needs to be more. For example in the manufacturing, there is room for more use of technology to augment what labor does so that productivity can increase (this is what drives growth). In the past, businesses have been protected by policies that have kept domestic productivity ratios behind those of similar countries of the same size, partly reflecting a lack of competition. Jamaica has real social challenges. Unemployment has been high for a long time, and about 33% of the young people are unemployed. Besides, there is a high migration rate so you end up with skills that are less than optimal for higher productivity. Jamaica has very low economic productivity, which is reflected in the low growth rates over the last two decades. Crime is high and Jamaica's murder rate is one of the highest in the world.</p><h4>What is the IDB focusing on? </h4><p>Our five-year country strategy began in 2016 and focuses mainly on private sector development, public sector transformation, and public financial management. Climate change, gender and crime are cross cutting themes in the strategy. We are involved on both the social and economic fronts. The IDB has been at the forefront of Jamaica's recent economic reforms, including implementing the fiscal responsibility law, public financial management and tax reform. Crucially, our social sector operations include helping Jamaica with its social safety net, specifically, the PATH program. We have been engaged in education over the years, both in school construction, but more importantly in helping the country transform its educational system and enhance its teacher quality and school curricula. The return on investment in education in Jamaica has been suboptimal. Only 30% of kids graduating high school in Jamaica are able to reach a tertiary level education, so 70% of the school leaving population is below par and require remedials training. There is a big mismatch in skills needed in the workplace and what is available in the labor market. Jamaica has a reputation for having good doctors, lawyers, and engineers but regrettably they are migrating to other countries. About 60% of the people with degrees say they want to migrate, so there is a constant brain drain; this is a big issue. We can only reduce that by improving the economy and making things more stable here.</p><h4>How do you help the government to tackle these challenges?</h4><p>We have a number of projects. For example, we are working to make the public sector more efficient by introducing e-government and streamlining processes. To do so, we finance operations for investment after providing technical assistance through grants. We have over 20 such grants in Jamaica. Right now, we have a water project that is coming to an end, mainly to reduce losses and to recover revenue for water consumption. Thanks to this program, we are replacing pipes and meters to make the system more efficient with fewer losses. We also have an energy efficiency operation to replace the lighting system in 80 public buildings and hospitals—the intent being to lower the energy costs of the public sector. Furthermore, we are working with the Government to diversify the energy mix in Jamaica. New gas infrastructure and clean energy projects are being developed in the country, are offshoots of this work. JPS, you will recall has recently built a new LNG plant in Bogue, on the north coast, and is refurbishing the Old harbor plant in Kingston to deliver natural gas (LNG). We are heavily involved in citizen security and justice (over 15 years), focused on crime prevention as well as changing the lives of at risk youth in vulnerable, low-income communities—who are generally the most common victims and perpetrators of crime. We train young people in techniques to resolve conflict without resorting to violence. The main drivers of crime are many—lack of good education, social well-being and detachment being some of the many documented factors. Poverty alone does not explain crime.</p><h4>How do you see the outlook of the economy in the short term?</h4><p>It is positive, but the private sector is moving slowly to adjust to the macro-economic environment. Recall that in the past, the Jamaican government was pumping a lot of credit into the economy by issuing bonds. Those bonds attracted very high rates of interest, thereby offering great returns to investors.. That has changed now. Interest rates have come down considerably and rather than holding government paper, investors are beginning to realize opportunities in the real sector. With declining government borrowing, and lower returns on government debt it is no longer so lucrative, so now the private sector is responding with other investments (new construction, new agri-businesses, tourism plan expansion are good examples). As for SMEs, gaining access to credit is still a challenge , but with IDB instruments including guarantees to the DBJ (Development Bank of Jamaica) to on lend. Economic growth s has started to rise and for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years they are projected to be near 2%, a rate of growth that has eluded Jamaica for many years. That said, tourism is doing well, and there are several new investments on the north coast. One issue would be to unlock the enclave nature of hotel developments in Jamaica to allow more value added to be created in Jamaica. Linkages to other sectors, including agriculture and the creative sectors. However, given the perception of and actual crime, hotels are naturally protective with their guests. As a reference for foreign exchange earnings from the tourism industry, Jamaica's remittances from abroad total 15% of GDP on an annual basis, which exceed tourism receipts. This suggests a lot of untapped potential for more to be retained in the country.</p><h4>Do you have any projects to link tourism to more local attractions?</h4><p>Not directly. It would be terrific to create downtown Kingston as an attractive spot for visitors, as the Ministry Of Tourism desires. It will require major investment in rehabilitation and security. However, the IDB has experience in downtown renewals and this would be a very exciting prospect, not only to reenergize economic opportunities for the communities of downtown but to restore life to a long lost beautiful city.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess QSTP's role in creating an environment that fosters innovation and product diversification in Qatar, while supporting private entrepreneurs on the peninsula?</h4><p>QSTP's mandate falls under the umbrella of Qatar Foundation's Research and Development wing, which has heavily invested in these types of activities and has been preparing young Qataris to enter the cycle of science, research, and technology development. Innovation means creating technologies that are useful to society. We are creating an ecosystem with people, mindsets, and processes, quadrupling investment in innovation. QSTP is helping turn the Qatar Foundation's (QF's) investments in education and technology research into useful technology products and economic opportunities. Additionally, we are supporting and training the business community to create new technologies in the Qatari market. Our role is essential to the country's transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one. The core of this vision is creating industries that bring technology products to market, and QSTP can leverage all the good work that has been done at QF in education and research to achieve this goal. </p><h4>Given your experience in Silicon Valley, what drives your strategy as QSTP's managing director?</h4><p>I am a tech start-up entrepreneur at heart. I love the game of innovation and the hard work and creativity that comes with building new technology products and bringing them to market. What I bring to the table is the understanding of the core elements and processes as they happen at innovation hubs and how the world can benefit from it. There are some fundamental ingredients that are applicable to the Qatari ecosystem, the first of which is diversity. It is crucial to bring product innovation to a market that is global in nature. The impact of innovation determines its success and is measured by how many people adopt it. In this process, working with a diverse team of people that has a broader understanding of how to appeal to a global audience is essential, and Qatar provides this ecosystem. Secondly, there has to be an innovative mindset that understands that in order to create a product you need to focus on a niche market and acknowledge the sacrifices associated with it the short term. The last crucial element is to be surrounded by an incentive structure that supports you in case of failure or delay when setting up a tech company. All of this is offered at QSTP. I am just helping our stakeholders understand that this type of talent, skill, and innovation ecosystem requires appropriate investments be made with the right processes. This is essential to successfully transform the country and see local companies that can introduce tech products to the market.</p><h4>How are you capitalizing on your state-of-the-art facilities to attract major foreign tech players?</h4><p>If we envision the world 20 years from now, when oil and gas will no longer be available, Qatar has to start providing products and services that people will be globally interested in buying. For example, generating income through exporting tech-based products and services regionally and globally. In today's world, the more innovative and technologically advanced your products and services are, the more we can demand a premium for them. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are laying the foundations for a whole range of programs. We are currently conducting several pilot projects, so my expectation for this year is to see the launch of a number of programs and analyze their results. We want to make sure we get ahead with all of these initiatives and that the community understands that the goal is to experiment with these ideas. For the few of them that create a real impact, we will double down and pursue them further. Therefore, within a year, I am hoping to have a clear understanding within our team of what the good programs are that can take us to the next step in terms of building the innovation ecosystem we all want to see in Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most recent milestones that show WCM-Q's key role in the development of medical education in Qatar?</h4><p>Weill Cornell was the first US medical school to award university degrees outside of the US by opening a branch in Qatar in 2001. Over the last three years, we have been able to achieve multiple milestones. First and foremost, a restructuring in our curriculum resulted in the integration of our two academic programs into one cohesive six-year medical education program with a single admissions process. In addition, we created a pipeline of outreach programs to get young Qataris interested in medical education. When I became WCM-Q's dean, we had one Qatari student in the class; now we have 13 out of a total of 41. In addition, almost one third of our class are long-term residents of Qatar. The rest come from neighboring countries and overseas. Moreover, we have also created an international organization called Innovations in Global Health Professions Education (IGHPE), co-founded by myself and Victor Dzau, the President of the US National Academy of Medicine. Through IGHPE, we aim to provide guidance to multiple institutions and organizations all over the world, particularly in emerging economies where there is a lack of medical education standardization. We recently organized a conference in Shanghai attended by multiple health institutions and medical schools. In 2016, we held one in Europe, and in the next few years we are considering going to South America. The final goal is to facilitate the creation of healthcare systems with international standards that are globally connected and locally relevant.</p><h4>While accomplishing your mission of training the next generation of healthcare leaders, how are you building a bridge between academia and local industry?</h4><p>We can proudly say we are an integral part of the Qatar National Vision 2030, supporting Qatar's path from a hydrocarbon-based economy to a knowledge-based society. We work closely with the Ministry of Public Health as well as with Hamad Medical Corporation and Sidra Medical and Research Center. The primary objective is to cooperate in creating workforce development models that can contribute to the advancement of the local healthcare industry. As Sidra has opened its outpatient clinic, our students are already rotating there for medical school as well as for the residency postgraduate training programs. The faculty, clinicians, and doctors who will be providing care in Sidra will mostly have our faculty appointments, so we are involved in their current staff recruitment. Moreover, we have been working with Hamad Medical Corporation for over 12 years. In 2011, we co-founded the Qatar Academic Health System, where all healthcare stakeholders in Qatar are working together to generate a positive impact on patient care, medical education, and medical research.</p><h4>How does WCM-Q respond to local health problems through its research programs? </h4><p>In cooperation with the Qatar Genome Program, we are in the process of creating a Qatari gene chip that will make genomic analysis easier to be performed. We are also conducting genomic analysis of diabetic patients in order to understand what additional risk factors the Qatari population might have in particular. However, at this time our most significant work is being conducted in the area of neurogenetic disorders, such as spina bifida and brain malformations. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the future?</h4><p>The future looks rosy for WCM-Q, and there are three areas where we will make major advances. In terms of community programs, 'Your Health First', our population health program, will be expanded into more schools and larger segments of the population. Furthermore, we will make major progress in facilitating the return of WCM graduates from their postgraduate training in the US to create Qatar's next healthcare leaders. Our third focus is to take IGHPE one step further and provide leadership to the rest of the world by using our experience in Qatar as a role model. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is QF unlocking the human, social, and economic development of Qatar and contributing to its progress through its education, science, and research programs?</h4><p>We began with a vision to provide Qatar with quality education more than two decades ago, and this vision is now being realized. Education City is a unique concept; there is no place quite like it anywhere in the world. It houses a range of world-class multidisciplinary education and research facilities, from our QF schools to our international partner universities and our homegrown, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), all in the same proximity. Together, these institutions offer high-quality education opportunities that empower and support young people from their first day of school right through to postgraduate level. But education is just the beginning of what we do. Our emphasis on research and innovation allows us to address Qatar's national priorities and grand challenges. From energy and environment to computing and biomedical research, our students, faculty, and researchers make breakthroughs every day. Away from the labs and lecture halls, our community development projects help to foster tangible social engagement opportunities and promote our country's culture and heritage. We are fortunate to partner with leading local and international organizations on many of our community initiatives.</p><h4>What is going to define your strategy as the new CEO of QF? </h4><p>As advocates of lifelong learning, we will continue to foster a culture of creativity and innovation in education that provides our future generations with the skills and knowledge that will be relevant in tomorrow's world. Our young people are emerging as highly competent problem solvers, and we will ensure we build on our innovative R&amp;D eco-system to inspire and empower them to become the entrepreneurs, researchers, and scientists of the future. We are also committed to further engaging with the wider community, including local and international stakeholders and partners, to foster social engagement and promote our country's culture and heritage.</p><h4>How would you summarize QF's main milestones in 2016?</h4><p>We celebrated many impactful projects in the last year. For example, in November 2016 we launched our educational 3D edutainment TV series “Siraj," targeting Arabic-speaking children aged two to eight, with engaging content to help them learn the Arabic alphabet in a fun way. We wanted to make Siraj available to children, parents, and teachers anytime, anywhere, so we made it available on YouTube and created our Siraj app to further enhance the learning experience with engaging interactive games. Our World Innovation Summit on Health (WISH) 2016 proved the largest summit since the initiative began in 2013, with more than 1,400 delegates from over 100 countries, including ministry-level representatives attending. The summit proved hugely successful in allowing all these stakeholders to collaborate and find cross-border solutions to global healthcare issues. In mid-2016 we launched Renad Academy, which is a school dedicated to children diagnosed with mild to moderate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The facility aims to inspire acceptance, trust, and success, and will help our students reach their full potential. Also in 2016, Qatar Foundation Research &amp; Development helped to stimulate and advance innovation across the MENA region through an MoU signed with 500 start-ups. The initiative actively helps start-ups achieve market traction and scale, using strategies mastered by tech companies in Silicon Valley.</p><h4>How is QF working toward the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage at sites like Education City?</h4><p>Preserving and sharing our local and regional culture is hugely important to us. Our “Restoration of Historic Structures Project" is now actively focused on the restoration of structures in the old Al Rayyan quarter, now within Education City. These structures, which date back to the early 20th century, serve as an important reminder of Qatar's architectural heritage. We are confident that the restoration of these structures will create a compelling attraction for visitors and give the public an understanding of the changing nature of their community. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the competitive advantage of Jamaica for BPO?</h4><p>Our company grew from seven employees in 2012 to just over 1,000 five years later. The business process outsourcing (BPO) industry is the fastest growing in Jamaica. It can provide jobs at the fastest rate and help boost the country's economy right now. The primary competitive advantage is our human capital and the fact that we are the third largest English-speaking country in the Western Hemisphere, behind the US and Canada. We have a large, educated labor pool. Jamaica has a long history in the hospitality industry. Therefore, a lot of individuals have been trained in that sales and customer service arena. In call centers, a big part of the job is customer service, and we have that in our DNA. Another aspect is the closeness to the US. Over the years, outsourcing has grown from India, the Philippines, and other parts of Asia, and then moved to Latin America. In Central and South America, English is a second language; thus, there is a huge benefit for Jamaica as English is its first language. The closeness to the US means that travel is faster. From Montego Bay, there are direct flights to all of the major cities in the US. The devaluation of the Jamaican dollar over the last five years has given us a competitive advantage globally, bringing our wage rates more in line to where they are in the Philippines. From a cost perspective, it makes Jamaica more competitive that it used to be. That is also a benefit to coming to operate here.</p><h4>How is the Business Process Industry Association supporting the industry?</h4><p>I started the Business Process Industry Association five years ago with JAMPRO. It has been something that has really benefited the industry. The government has always wanted to support the industry. However, call centers are difficult to understand unless the manager knows how to run one and the needs of the clients. Therefore, what the association did, and continues to do, was go through and be that educator to the policy makers. They want to open the doors, make it easier to do business, and make it easier to invest and bring investors to Jamaica. However, unless they have a full understanding of the demands of the industry, it is difficult to make any policy changes. The will might be there, however the want is not. The industry association has been there to hold the hand of the government to drive and steer it in the right direction to continue to make it the industry that investors would like. It is important to drop all of the barriers to entry and the process to start a business made a lot easier.</p><h4>What can the government do to make the industry even more competitive?</h4><p>The government should be investing more money into JAMPRO to market the industry. This industry is a business that is all about show and tell. It is all about what there is, what is happening today, what a business can do. The more popular we can make Jamaica's flag and name, the more influence we will have in the industry and the more successful we will be. We have the infrastructure and several fiber-optic lines running from Jamaica to the US and different parts of the world. We also have the space to develop, and there is a lot of development taking place right now. We have the human capital and the closeness to the largest market for BPO in the world.</p><h4>Will the BPO continue growing on the fast track in the coming years?</h4><p>Most certainly, and there are two reasons why. The natural transition of BPO starting in India, going to the Philippines, and coming closer to home is because people are tired of the distance they have to travel and the cost implications of traveling to those centers. Coming to Jamaica is easier for them. Shorter visits are possible and it is cheaper and faster to feel and see a business. Furthermore, the cost implications have significantly dropped, and the service delivery is far better than elsewhere. There is a lot of talk about artificial intelligence in the market, but I do not think this will kill the BPO industry by any means. I think of it as an opportunity. There are certain things, just like data entry, that are automated today. Certain aspects of the job, those that go on at lower level, can be automated through artificial intelligence.</p><h4>What are the goals and objectives of the company for the coming year?</h4><p>We have grown significantly over the last five years. We have moved from being a start-up to a medium-sized to a large-sized BPO. We have three main goals that we have continued to work on to grow our business. One is acquisition of new clients. The larger we get, the easier it is to land bigger clients and deals. Another is providing different services as we grow, going back to our existing client base and sharing additional services with them. This is a way we can further entrench ourselves in our client base. The third is acquisition of other call centers. These include medium-sized players that may have difficulty because of capital constraints or getting new business due to the size limitations. We want to bring them into our world, help them grow faster, and help ourselves grow faster.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Manufacturing contributed 21% to Jamaican GDP at its peak]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[metry-seaga-chairman-jamaica-manufacturers-association]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the manufacturing sector to Jamaica's economy?</h4><p>JMA is a 70-year-old organization that is perhaps the number one advocacy group in Jamaica. The manufacturing sector is unquestionably the most important component of our economy. At its peak, manufacturing contributed 21% to our GDP. Today, manufacturing contributes about 8.5%, which is the highest of all goods producing sectors. Manufacturing in the country employs about 80,000 people and, more importantly, it pays the most tax of any sector other than the financial sector. The multiplier effect of manufacturing is significant and we are adding value. When a manufacturer comes here, infrastructure and roots are being placed in the soil of Jamaica that are not easily shifted. We have seen many activities that have not stuck and manufacturing is a way to get people to stay here in Jamaica, spread the wealth, and demonstrate to government that our economy needs a fully-fledged manufacturing industry.</p><h4>Do Jamaican companies have a competitive advantage when it comes to exporting?</h4><p>People often ask how we can compete against exporting countries like China and the larger markets in the world. We cannot compete with everything, though we can compete with many things. I recently visited Singapore with the Jamaica Special Economic Zone Authority (JSEZA) team, as I am also the Chairman of JSEZA. Based on Jamaica's location in relation to the Americas, we play a role similar to Singapore, which sees a great deal of transshipment, which significantly helps its economy. Singapore has a local population that is similar to ours and another 3 million expatriates living there, and manufacturing contributes 21% to its GDP. Singapore manages to manufacture with no natural resources whatsoever and with a market that is as small as ours. Jamaica does not have many competitive advantages, though we do have some. Firstly, our location is a key competitive advantage. Added to this are our infrastructure and trainable workforce who speak English. We have excellent electricity supply; it may not be at the best price yet, but we are getting there and it is certainly cheaper than some other regions. We have excellent telephone, internet, and data services, along with great weather. We are innovative people. Therefore Jamaica has certain advantages and we have to choose the products we will manufacture wisely. They need to be products with competitive advantages that we will manufacture for the rest of the world.</p><h4>What programs does the JMA implement to help Jamaican companies with manufacturing?</h4><p>In most cases to be successful in manufacturing a company first needs to be successful in its home country. Therefore, we need to build capacity in our manufacturing sector. JMA works with the government to implement a new government procurement policy. In any economy, the government is the largest purchaser of goods and services. Currently, the least-cost method of procurement that we use in Jamaica does not serve us well. For example, in some cases it eliminates local companies from being the suppliers. We need the government to give local manufacturers a weighted advantage because public spending on procurement should not only be about the bottom line; it is also about building the local economy. At this point manufacturing, does not get any incentives, although we are allowed to import our raw materials free of duty and GCT once we are adding significant value and genuinely manufacturing a product. Then GCT is charged at the end. Other than that, there are no other incentives for manufacturing.</p><h4>How does JMA work with the banking sector to improve access to commercial loans for SMEs?</h4><p>When we survey our membership, especially SMEs, the three most important factors for them are financing, factory space, and procurement. JMA has put together two lines of financing, one of which is through EXIM Bank. This is financing of up to JMD1.5 million for micro-companies without any collateral, as this is sometimes where they have a problem. It is at 12%. We have also put a line together of up to JMD1 billion per company with the National Commercial Bank at 8%. The third initiative we are working on is writing to the Minister of Finance requesting a pool of funds to be made available to manufacturers through the National Development Bank of Jamaica at 5%. We hope to be successful with this in the coming months. Regarding the issue of factory space, there is a Factories Corporation of Jamaica (FCJ) that was established to deal with this. However, 85% of the FCJ's space is currently being utilized for distribution and retail. We have asked FCJ to provide us with a significant amount of space at a concessionary rate for a one-year period to help get SMEs off the ground. Then as they build up their businesses they will be able to pay the rent at normal rates. Currently FCJ rents out its space at or above market rates of around USD3.50 per sqft. This does not aid in the growth of SMEs. Our largest growing sector in JMA is the SME sector. We have over 120 new members, individuals and mostly women, who are starting small factories out of their kitchens, living rooms, and garages. They have great ideas and innovative products that are indigenous to Jamaica, such as make-up, lotions, sandals, and chocolates, where all the raw materials come from Jamaica. They seek to develop those enterprises, but are unable to grow. When they join the JMA they hope we can help them with these three areas—getting the government to buy their products, factory space, and finance.</p><h4>How do you see Jamaica's economy growing in the future and the opportunities for the manufacturing sector here?</h4><p>I am extremely optimistic; we have a great opportunity. All our economic indicators point in the right direction. Our debt to GDP is as low as it has been in a long time while the country's net international reserves are as high as they have been in a long time. Employment is up and our dollar is stable. We do not have a foreign exchange problem and our trade balance is positive. I am, therefore, confident that if we do the right thing now we have an opportunity to see Jamaica enter a different phase and look different. If Jamaica had just one of the buildings Singapore has it would mean so much for our economy. Singapore has 10,000 sizable buildings in a space that is one-15th the size of Jamaica. Whilst I am optimistic and see where we can go, it pains me to see where we are when we could be there. I fully accept that Singapore has had 40-50 uninterrupted years of strong political control, whereas Jamaica has had shifts in its political regimes and ideologies that have cost us dearly. Unless we come to the realization that we cannot allow this to cost us any more, we will go nowhere. If we can put politics behind us and get crime under control we will see investment in the country like we have never seen before.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-owen-kaluwa-country-head-world-health-organisation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your effort to reduce communicable diseases progressed in the past two years?</h4><p>When I took office in 2015, the country had already made considerable progress in dealing with communicable diseases, especially Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The progress has been continuous and considerable, though there is still a great deal to do. For example, there had been a gradual increase in the number of people with HIV put on treatment. Malaria cases have gone down considerably across all age groups. Progress continues against TB as well. We have to continue making progress in responding to these diseases if we are to attain the associated Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets. If we take HIV, for example, we hope by 2020 to have put 90% of HIV patients in the country on treatment to ensure we remain on course for ending the HIV epidemic by 2030. As of 2016, we were at 34%. This means we still have a long way to go and thus we must intensify our efforts to address communicable diseases. WHO is working with countries to develop and implement sustainable action plans for combating these diseases. These goals can only be achieved with the collaboration of all stakeholders including governments, the private sector, NGOs, the civil society, and development partners.</p><h4>Can you guide us through the WHO's guidelines on improving healthcare for mental disorders in Ghana?</h4><p>First let me start by saying that over the years, the global focus on health in low to medium-income countries has been on communicable diseases, and in many instances rightly so. However, our estimates indicate that by 2030 non-communicable diseases including mental health disorders will exceed communicable diseases in terms of burden of disease i.e. illnesses and death. WHO has developed guidelines on improving mental health, including the Global Mental Health Action Plan for 2013-2020. This has clear objectives and actions for member states to implement. In addition to that, the WHO has developed a mental health gap action program to address the gap between the magnitude of mental health disorders and the capacities of health systems for dealing with them. One of the major issues is the lack of specialized psychiatric care at district and community levels where most people live. Most of the mental health problems occur in areas with inadequate health system capacity. The program focuses on the critical interventions that can be implemented to alleviate the burden and improve care at lower levels of the health system. We want to improve training for mental health workers in the mid-lower health categories. We have various manuals and guidelines that underpin this approach. A number of countries are working to adapt these guidelines for use in their respective settings.</p><h4>What is the strategy to tackle other non-communicable diseases?</h4><p>The burden of non-communicable diseases continues to increase and yet resources available to healthcare providers from national and international partners are not expanding. Most of the international development partners are doing a great job supporting communicable diseases, but there is still a significant gap when it comes to non-communicable diseases. For cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes, WHO has developed a package of essential services which includes promotion, prevention, care, and rehabilitation. The aim is to scale-up the response to non-communicable diseases at the lower levels. This requires increased financial resources. We must focus on how we can increase domestic resource allocation to health, prioritizing health spending in budgets and forming national partnerships to leverage the capacities of the resources available beyond the health sector. The government and its partners should indeed act, but individuals must also play their part by adopting healthy lifestyles. Tobacco use, alcohol abuse, unhealthy diets, and lack of exercise are major risk factors to non-communicable diseases. Adopting healthy lifestyles helps reduce and prevent these diseases, thereby minimizing the cost of response.</p><h4>What is your assessment of malnutrition among Ghana's youth?</h4><p>The rates of stunting have improved in Ghana, though the problem of anemia continues to be a key challenge. We need to address this. The government has launched a folic acid supplementation program for adolescent girls and pregnant women, which we believe will contribute significantly to addressing the problem. Addressing malnutrition requires a combined effort from many different sectors, and there is a clear role for health, agriculture, and education sectors. It is no longer adequate for a single sector to address health or developmental issues alone. We need everyone to come together to make a difference.</p><h4>What is the best strategy to ensure health insurance gains?</h4><p>One of the major priorities of the WHO is Universal Health Coverage, i.e ensuring that all people have access to high-quality health services they need without facing financial hardship. Defining the services and health needs of people should be done, but this should come with financing mechanisms that ensure people receive the care they need. Health should be available to all as a human right. Proper strategies for financing health would allow us to do this, and national health insurance schemes like the one that has been designed for Ghana is one of the best mechanisms for ensuring that this happens. I have visited a number of districts and regions and learned that the national health insurance scheme is critical to health service delivery in Ghana. Improving the efficiency of the NHIS will result in great benefits to health service delivery. The government's current efforts to improve the scheme are extremely valuable and totally necessary in order to maximize the benefits. If we improve health service delivery, then we can improve health outcomes all across the country. Digital technology in health or ehealth will also be extremely critical in the attainment of universal health coverage, because if we are to have service available to everybody then we must reach everyone. Telemedicine, for example, would allow highly qualified specialists to provide advice and guidance for the care of patients across the country. Digital technology in health is something that we must pursue if countries are to attain Universal Health coverage.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>The government is finalizing the national medium-term development plan for health, the UN is finalizing its Sustainable Development Program for Ghana, and WHO, we are developing our country cooperation strategy for health that defines our priorities moving forward. 2018 will be a critical year to implement these in a coordinated and harmonious way in order to firmly position ourselves on the road toward achieving our health goals in relation to SDGs. Additionally, 2018 will be critical for strengthening our capacity to prevent, detect and respond in a timely manner to public health emergencies. In February 2017, we conducted a joint external evaluation of Ghana's core capacities in relation to International Health Regulations. We found a number of areas that need to be strengthened and we will be working with the government to develop a National Action Pl</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	<span class="red"></span>What value does JRE add to the market and what is your strategy for being the real estate industry leader in Qatar?
</h4><p>
	JRE is a real estate investment company that offers an extensive range of real estate solutions, from sales and leasing to marketing communications, property management, facilities management, and development management. Our offer is more engineered, institutional, and selective. These services set us apart. Our new sales center is a one-stop shop for real estate solutions and demonstrates our commitment to offering our clients a 360-degree service. Our first successful year of operations drove us forward in Qatar, the US, the UK, and Turkey.</p><h4>In 2016, JRE unveiled its flagship development, THE e18hteen. What makes this unique?</h4><p>
	THE e18hteen is a modern design masterpiece. Inspired by the historic Qatar dhow, the building was purposely created for its Lusail Marina location, with the exterior façade at the podium level designed to look like rippling water. The building's designers considered every detail, down to the sheltered principle entrance that corresponds to the direction of the area's northwesterly winds.  THE e18hteen is attractive to corporate tenants because of its 360-degree business and leisure services. Today's business tenants demand fully integrated services. In order to meet those, THE e18hteen is equipped with premium quality amenities, including the latest in high-tech office solutions and spacious luxury meeting rooms, high-end restaurants, cafés, exclusive business lounge and retail outlets, with the additional benefit of stunning views over the Arabian Gulf.</p><h4>Qatar enjoys a wide offer of hospitality and entertainment, including retail, F&amp;B, and hotels. How do you combine these features in your portfolio? </h4><p>
	All of JRE's projects are located in premier locations and are intricately designed to cater to every luxury need. For example, THE e18hteen is more than just a commercial tower. The inclusion of a gym, high-end dining options, an exclusive business lounge, and retail outlets demonstrates our dedication to offering unrivaled amenities. Similarly, The View Residence is a destination of modern living incorporating a fitness center, resort-style swimming pool, stunning views, and quality dining outlets. Jenan, located in Lusail's Marina district, stands out due to its focus on tenant wellbeing and as a fantastic investment opportunity.</p><h4>Including the UK, Turkey, and the US, what are your plans to expand internationally? </h4><p>
	Our primary focus is on the local market, which accounts for the 85% of our operations. However, our plans to grow will see JRE explore new options and avenues for clients in the international markets, which will in turn help us to diversify our portfolio and enhance our reputation as an international real estate leader. We have already made great strides elsewhere in the world and now offer sales and leasing opportunities in three major properties in the UK. Riverwalk, Chiltern Place, and The Heron includes high-end, ultra-modern residential buildings in the heart of London. In the US, we see opportunities in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles, where I know a lot of good developers. JRE has also moved into the Turkish real estate market, where we manage the Quasar &amp; Fairmont Residence Istanbul.</p><h4>What is your analysis of the current and future status of Qatar's real estate market?</h4><p>
	The Qatar real estate market is buoyant as the government of Qatar continues to invest heavily in infrastructure and mega projects, such as the new Doha Port and Qatar Rail's project, and the population continues to rapidly grow. Together, this will result in strong demand for both residential property and commercial opportunities. With construction continuing apace for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the Qatar National Vision 2030 in full swing, there will be a plethora of prospects for investors and tenants. We strongly believe Qatar will continue to be a benchmark for the regional real estate sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Msheireb Properties uphold its threefold approach of sustainability, modernity, and preservation of Qatari heritage in its projects?</h4><p>Msheireb Properties' vision is to be a pioneering development company that respects the environment, and considers Qatar's architecture, history, and culture as component parts to creating something harmonic with the landscape and heritage of the country. When Qatar first began to produce oil and gas, building designers and contractors did not take these factors into consideration. However, based on HH Sheikha Moza bint Nasser's inspiring vision, we have taken the initiative to develop our own architectural language. This is the vision that Msheireb Properties abides by. We felt our country needed to identify its own architectural language, a style that really belongs to Qatar and is made for us, buy us. At the same time, we needed to modernize designs to meet today's needs, take Qatar's architectural language into the future, and restore the uniqueness of Qatar's built environment.</p><h4>How do you assess the current development of the Msheireb Downtown Doha project?</h4><p>This is divided into four different phases, and we are pleased to have finished 80% of its completion. Phase IV has been held back due to the metro station works. However, we are making good progress and have finished the public areas, trams, parks, and parking. We have had discussions with the government about the possibility of creating our own municipal authority within Msheireb Downtown Doha, as this will allow people to interact easily within our development. At this moment in time, we are in the peak of our sales and leasing activities, with a lot of visitors coming to see the residential, retail, and commercial sites; some tenants are even doing their own fit-outs for their buildings.</p><h4>Qatar is characterized by its wide retail and hospitality offerings. What makes Msheireb Downtown Doha different?</h4><p>This is located in the heart of Doha, close to the corniche and the shops, museums, and businesses. Our location is second-to-none. The project is also state-of-the-art in every sense: a smart city with a completely climate-controlled environment, a great layout and vibrant open main square, excellent five-star hotels, including the first Mandarin Oriental hotel in the Middle East, high-end boutiques and stores, big offices and commercial spaces, the world's first 10,000-space integrated underground carpark, and great restaurants and cafes.</p><h4>How will the Msheireb Downtown Doha project affect the growth of the city?</h4><p>This will become Qatar's epicenter and break down all barriers. It will be a dynamic city where people can interact and do business, as it has everything you could hope for as a living and working space. At the same time, it will be a pilot for future smart cities. Msheireb Downtown Doha will become a real driver of transformation in Doha and the lives of its residents. Historically, Qatar has always been a place that has brought different people together; our vision is to simply develop and enhance this for the benefit of future generations. Moreover, we have developed a blueprint that could be shared among different cities around the world. Msheireb Downtown Doha is a model; we based our project on research about other smart city projects, and now Msheireb Downtown Doha is ready to be a reference point for similar projects around the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We expect Msheireb Downtown Doha to open in 2017. We are working to attract people and businesses to the project's residential, commercial, and retail areas. We have tested the market and opened Msheireb Downtown Doha's museums and public spaces to visitors. The project is gaining attention in Qatar for its uniqueness and the transformative effect it will have on the city. With Msheireb Downtown Doha coming to life this year, our ambitions are limitless. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Medgulf Construction operates in Qatar's two biggest sectors. What is your competitive position in both the oil and gas and civil construction sector?</h4><p>The Qatari market is tough, and competition is fierce. However, while we expected 2017 to be a difficult year, it has been positive so far. We surprisingly landed a number of projects in the first two weeks of 2017, which will secure work for the rest of the year. Looking back, the drop in oil prices cancelled many projects, the largest of which is Al Karaana petrochemicals project, but our work in the market before 2014 helped us navigate through these difficult times. Medgulf has an experienced workforce in the oil and gas industry; therefore, we will persist in this sector while maintaining the same level of attention to civil infrastructure.</p><h4>What is Medgulf's approach to cross-country pipelines?</h4><p>Medgulf was established as a pipeline contractor, therefore every time there is a pipeline project we bid for it aggressively. We started developing cross-country pipelines in 1975, being one of the first pipeline contractors in Qatar. So far we have built more than 80% of the pipelines in Qatar and were recently awarded a large pipeline job by Qatar Petroleum. Approximately two-and-a-half years ago, we were awarded the Dukhan Pipeline project, which will be completed this year. We are an EPC contractor and have completed a good number of projects for major clients such as Qatar Petroleum, Qatargas, RasGas, Gasal, and ORYX, among others. Furthermore, we were the main constructor of the world's largest helium plant in the Ras Laffan Industrial Complex.</p><h4>What is your strategy for strengthening your position among contractors in the region? </h4><p>Although Medgulf only operates in Qatar, our plan is to expand abroad when the market situation improves. In these 40 years, we have been operating in Qatar and have maintained a great reputation in the sectors in which we operate; we have established trusted relationships with our clients and are financially strong. We are well established on the ground, although the competition is stiff. On the other side, in the oil and gas industry we are well connected with international partners, which could help us to develop major projects, although I do not forecast any big developments in Qatar anytime soon. However, when it comes to civil infrastructure we are looking into some opportunities, whether it is stadium work, the Doha Metro, or a highway. The diversification of the Qatari economy will require contractors to also diversify their portfolios. As an example, Medgulf is currently moving into oil and gas offshore works, although we have always worked onshore.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead? </h4><p>We review our business plan annually to identify trends and chase new opportunities. For 2017, we have identified good prospects and modified our bidding strategy to match the current market requirements. We have brought in new resources with experience in civil infrastructure and restructured our company to maintain the same level of revenues we had forecasted. I expect to see new roads being built as well as drainage and sewage projects—we can definitely contribute to these. We are an A-grade contractor in roads, buildings, and infrastructure. It is hard to find a local contractor with such expertise in all three sectors. Overall, the year has started strong, as we have secured jobs that may account for 50% of our annual expectations. Therefore, if we do not meet our targets this year, we will come very close. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Qatar is home to some of the largest manmade forests in the GCC. What is Nakheel Landscapes' role in this megaproject?</h4><p>We are the landscape subcontractor that won a job with Keppel Seghers Engineering Singapore, the main contractor for the project. We won a landscape package that includes one large water pond, an irrigation network, and the planting of 95,000 trees. Around 60% of these trees are native to the area or acclimatized to desert conditions, while some of them are not indigenous but can survive in this region. Many of the trees came from our nurseries. Things are going ahead of schedule. Already, around 50,000 trees have been planted, and the remaining 45,000 will be completed by the end of March 2017. However, when it will become open to the public is something for the government to decide.</p><h4>What is Nakheel Landscapes' involvement in the challenging task of growing the turf for the World Cup pitches?</h4><p>We won the tender to design and build the Sports Turf Research &amp; Development Center for the Supreme Committee at Aspire Zone. Various types of grass, rootzone mix, drainage, and irrigation systems are being tested along with FIFA. The best combination of grass and systems to be used during the games will be selected at the end of the testing period. We completed the construction works and are now in a three-year maintenance period. For the World Cup, there is going to be a minimum of eight stadiums plus 60 or more training pitches, and each needs to be landscaped to FIFA standards. Many of our countrywide projects are now indirectly or directly linked to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><h4>What allows Nakheel Landscapes to be a pre-qualified partner to get such challenging projects?</h4><p>Firstly, we offer solid technical proposals and competitive prices. That is why we are in a position to win some of the most prestigious and challenging contracts through the proper tender process. Secondly, and more importantly than winning the job, is the execution; that is what distinguishes us. We have loyal and qualified staff in which we invest; we are getting more machinery and more technology. We are known for delivering quality works on time. Many of our clients are happy to learn we are the winner of a tender because they know that they will have an easy ride with us. These things are important factors to create stability in the company and for the human resources of the company to continue performing properly.</p><h4>Are you investing in any new technologies or developments to better execute your job?</h4><p>We continuously invest in the best and latest specialized machinery, for turf management in particular. We invested in a compost factory to produce high-quality compost from the green waste generated by our landscape maintenance activities. We invested in a nursery to grow thousands of trees and acclimatize large imported trees to prepare for the expected increase in landscape requirements.</p><h4>How else do you see Nakheel Landscapes actively promoting the environmental pillar of Qatar's national vision?</h4><p>Our company is a certified Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) service provider. We are approved to participate in the delivery of Sustainable Built Environments, also known as green buildings. We are cooperating with the Gulf Organization for Research and Development (GORD). We have tested more than 120 indigenous plants with GORD at our Shehaniya nursery. The tests have been successful, and we have selected almost 70 species to be used in sustainable landscape projects in Qatar. We have gained an advanced expertise and unique experience in the collection of seeds and propagation of desert native plants. The success of that and the compost we are making will lead to more environmentally friendly landscapes, lower construction costs, less maintenance, and less water usage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[beyond-managing]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the role of Mosanada in putting Qatar at the forefront of the cultural and sporting world?</h4><p>Mosanada is responsible for all facilities-management services of the main venues owned and operated by the Ministry of Culture and Sports. These services include planned and reactive maintenance activities, operation of equipment, minor new works, landscaping, and events support, among others. Our projects and venue support include international football events, the Qatar Open tennis tournament, and the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship, which were held at the three new purpose-built multipurpose stadiums. Mosanada has significant experience in managing sports venues in Qatar, and this knowledge will be invaluable during the lead up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup and beyond. Aligned with the Qatar National Vision 2030, sport is a major pillar of investment in Qatar, and it is our aim to promote it by having world-class facilities, managed by the region's leading provider in sports facilities management. At Mosanada we are creating something unique and trying to capitalize on this opportunity.</p><h4>What are some of Mosanada's key projects and facilities that it manages outside of the sporting sphere?</h4><p>We are also responsible for facilities management (FM) at Katara Cultural Village. Katara is the cultural hub of Qatar and routinely has events focused on cultural heritage. The site is an iconic location near the West Bay and is popular with families and visitors to Doha. This location has a selection of restaurants and retail units as well as a large amphitheatre, car parking, and a beach. Mosanada also recently secured a four-year contract with Lusail Real Estate and Development Company for managing agent services at Lusail City. This demonstrates the diversity of our offering, from a cultural hub with outdoor leisure facilities to the complexity of the infrastructure at the municipal areas of a brand new city.</p><h4>What opportunities will there be in sports facility management in the future?</h4><p>Mosanada is also responsible for the management of Aspire Zone, the biggest and most extensive sports venue in the Middle East. This location is experiencing significant organic growth as new facilities are constructed to deliver the Zone's strategic objectives including the refurbishment of Khalifa Stadium—one of several stadiums that will be used to support the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Over the next couple of years, we envisage that sports FM will transition into a new vein of delivery where the FM provider not only operates and maintains the facilities, but provides venue and event management as well. This will require specialist teams with skills ranging from FM design consultancy through operational FM delivery, event organization, and hospitality. At Mosanada, we have a longer-term aspiration to expand across the region, but for the time being, our priority is to concentrate on the local market, with a primary focus on the sports sector, where we have an overwhelming number of projects coming up.</p><h4>How is Mosanada nurturing local talent to make Qatar an FM hub in the world?</h4><p>All our projects are supported by teams of professional facilities managers and engineers. Having these high-quality specialists within our teams provides opportunities to mentor and coach new staff joining our business. Training programs allow us to develop our staff to be FM experts. In this sense, Mosanada has developed its own behavioral safety-training program, and we are the only FM business-training center in the region that is recognized by the British Institute of Facilities Management (BIFM). This enables us to train our own employees against a globally accredited professional standard. As soon as the Khalifa International Stadium project is completed, we will coordinate with BIFM and Qatar University to create a program to develop local talent in the FM sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With projects valued at USD27 billion to be delivered within the next five to seven years, what are some notable ongoing infrastructure projects for Ashghal?</h4><p>Ashghal's infrastructure investment program over the coming years includes the implementation of various nationwide infrastructure programs and building projects that are already underway. These will meet the Qatar National Vision 2030 objectives as well as support Qatar's base infrastructure, which will be capable of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup and meeting the needs for growth in the years beyond. Ashghal has two main programs allocated for roads; the first is the Expressway Program, expected to deliver approximately 800km of safe and efficient roads through the implementation of over 30 projects divided into 46 contracts. The program also includes the construction and development of an integrated infrastructure network equipped with state-of-the-art, reliable underground utilities, including storm water networks, electrical services, and intelligent transport systems. The program currently has 10 projects under construction with a total value of over USD13 billion. The second is the nationwide local area infrastructure program to develop and upgrade local roads, drainage, and new infrastructure across the country's four regions. Some of the major projects under implementation include an infrastructure development project in Bani Hajer North (Rawdat Egdaim), the Al Gharrafa Sewage Scheme, and Rawdat Abal Heeran. All our projects under the program cover the development of internal and external roads in addition to infrastructure works including a sewage network, storm water network, main irrigation networks, and street lighting. </p><h4>After recently receiving two sustainability awards, how has Ashghal worked to advance sustainable developments and green projects in Qatar?</h4><p>Ashghal remains committed to adopting best practices and high standards in environmental protection and sustainability. Intensive efforts are being undertaken by Ashghal to promote green buildings, embodying the principle of conservation of natural resources, encouraging the use of recycled materials, and promoting the efficient use of water and renewable energy. Committed to applying sustainability best practices in the built environment for current and future generations, Ashghal is implementing Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) standards in all its public buildings in Qatar, specifically in educational buildings, including schools and kindergartens, and health buildings. Ashghal has been awarded the three-star GSAS certification in design and construction. GSAS will evaluate close to 100 building projects being implemented by Ashghal, with a total area of more than half a million square meters. Ashghal's Doha North STW project is the first facility with comprehensive odor-control system to minimize the impact on the surrounding environment. The buffer zone surrounding the STW is being carefully landscaped to form a lush oasis that includes approximately 95,000 trees and picnic areas with interconnecting roads. Ashghal has taken the initiative, the first of its kind in Qatar, to grow trees over approximately 12sqkm within the buffer zone surrounding the plant. In 2016, Ashghal was granted two Sustainability Awards in health and education facilities by the Gulf Organization for Research and Development (GORD), the first performance-based system in the MENA region, developed for rating green buildings and infrastructure.</p><h4>Ashghal has announced plans to build 60-70 healthcare centers over the next 10 years. What progress has been made so far in this regard?</h4><p>In collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health, Ashghal is building a number of state-of-the-art medical centers for citizens and residents across Qatar. Our ongoing projects include four health centers in Muaither, Al Waab, Al Wajba, and Al Jamaa, all of which are achieving steady progress on schedule. In 2016, we handed over three new health centers and completed the construction and equipment of Hamad bin Khalifa Medical City Hospitals, which include the Ambulatory Care Center, the Qatar Rehabilitation Institute, and the Women's Wellness and Research Center. Ashghal also completed the construction and equipment of the new surgical building at Hamad General Hospital, as well as a communicable diseases center. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What dimension can Es'hailSat give to the economic diversification of Qatar?</h4><p>Es'hailSat was created in 2010 purely for strategic objectives. At that time, the government of Qatar thought of creating an independent satellite operator to serve Al Jazeera Media Network's needs, which was using the capacity of other regional players. Having our own operator means that our satellite operations would not be influenced by foreign political decisions and we could cater to the demands of the country's broadcasters. We bought an orbit slot and created a new satellite to compete for the MENA region with other players like Arabsat. We found a good partner in Eutelsat, a European satellite company, which helped us with the first satellite to enter into commercial service in 2013, Es'hail-1. During this time, we have built a satellite industry in Qatar, and now have the vision to become a global satellite operator and services provider.</p><h4>How is Es'hail-2 going to help you expand your reach?</h4><p>Though Es'hail-2 will still cover the MENA region like Es'hail-1, Es'hail-2 comes with advanced technology to make sure that nothing can disrupt the service that is provided through the satellite. We will use Es'hail-1 for broadcast and military purposes, and Es'hail-2 will add new communication services. Nowadays, broadcasters are looking for high density with zero disruption, which is what Es'hail-2 will be providing. Their capacity will be utilized by any broadcaster interested in transmitting in the MENA region. We will expand our services in two ways. First, we will adapt our expansion plans to the needs of the Qatari telecommunications companies. For example, in 2016 beIN Sports acquired Digiturk and is interested in expanding in the Turkish market. Following this line, last February we signed an agreement with Total TR Medya to exclusively represent Es'hailSat and market our services in Turkey. Second, we will look at the markets where satellites are at the end of their lifespans, and we will raise funds to launch a new satellite to cater to the needs of the operators. In this regard, we are looking at the Asian market in countries such as Indonesia. As we cannot build satellites all over the world, we will also enter into partnerships with existing satellite operators to cover other regions. We have a good relationship with Eutelsat and SAS, the world's largest satellite operators, and we can provide services to companies like Qatar Airways to provide entertainment on all their planes.</p><h4>How could the potential of the IT sector in Qatar be unleashed?</h4><p>Economic diversification is only viable through technology. As we diversify our economy we need to expand our market scope, and technology allows us to reach the whole MENA region. When I worked in the ICT sector, I realized the importance of creating small local companies instead of hiring the best system integrators in the world. Those sophisticated systems are expensive to maintain, so in 2008 we invested USD8 million in creating Malomatia, which started with around 10 employees. Now Malomatia has around 650 employees and it is going through an IPO with a high value. Rather than buying another company its growth was organic and of all its 650 employees are talented Qataris. This has impacted many economic sectors, such as health and education. Although it started as a small company, it is now targeting the region. This is where I see diversification happening. The government should only interfere in the market when there is a shortage, and the base for growth will come from having a competitive environment favored by the right regulation. I have worked with a lot of start-ups all my life and this gives me energy for the future. They do not only need the funding but also the right support strategically and technically. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mature-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the overall health of the telecoms sector and its key role within Qatar's ongoing economic diversification program?</h4><p>Overall, the telecoms sector is in robust health and continues to make a valuable contribution to the national economy. Market revenues in 2016 remain unchanged compared to 2015, a sign that the traditional telecommunication markets in Qatar have begun to mature. This is largely due to competitive pressures and a different population mix. However, service providers have adapted to these changes well, increasing efficiency and diversifying their revenue streams into associated activities. The fixed-line network covers almost the entire country and 99% of Qatar's households are now covered by a fiber-optic network. With a nationwide fiber-optic network, customers now enjoy a high-speed service and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and will, in the medium term, help to increase service providers' revenues and drive efficiency and innovation. In terms of economic diversification, the communications sector is the right place to start, and we need it to be a lever for growth and innovation. I would like to see two key areas of investment: the wider fixed sector to enable competition and the knowledge economy.</p><h4>How will you cater to the increasing spectrum of demands that Qatar's infrastructure plans and major events like the 2022 FIFA World Cup will require?</h4><p>Radio spectrum is a fundamental, finite, and valuable national resource and its careful management is critical to the smooth running of not only major global events taking place in Qatar such as the World Cup, but also everyday operations of telecommunications, government, aviation, security, energy, ICT, and other nationally important sectors that ultimately impact the country's GDP. Demand for radio spectrum in Qatar is high and growing every day, particularly because of the numerous advanced technologies that require new radio spectrum alongside existing technologies. We were busy last year with all matters relating to the management of frequencies in Qatar and there is rapidly growing demand for spectrum across the nation. The number of spectrum licenses issued in 2016 was up 145% from the previous year and the number of frequencies assigned also saw a significant rise in 2016 up 117% from 2015. The challenge among regulators worldwide is to find enough spectrum for future radio applications and next-generation networks such as 5G. Part of our journey to becoming a converged regulator is ensuring a consistent and converged position across all uses of the spectrum. This means constant coordination with other regulators in the GCC to ensure harmonization and a robust and effective management process.</p><h4>How does CRA develop a regulatory framework and cooperate with all stakeholders to enhance the level of cyber security in Qatar?</h4><p>We are building our institutional capabilities by developing our staff, expertise, and resources. From a regulatory perspective, we are in the process of developing ICT data privacy bylaws needed to manage the flow of stakeholders and promote security awareness. We are also in constant contact with other regulators and learning from industry leaders who have been in the field for many years about how they tackle the various challenges facing the ICT sector. We also need the cooperation and compliance of service providers and have been focused on the “socialization" of policies and regulatory frameworks through workshops and consultations.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>The outlook for the ICT sector is stable, as I do not foresee a substantial increase in revenues this year in the telecommunications sector. However, the declining contribution of hydrocarbons as a result of low oil and gas prices will mean that the ICT sector will make an increasingly important impact on GDP. Overall, CRA has made great progress toward supporting Qatar's transition to a connected digital economy and the plan is to build on the strong momentum generated in the last few years by continuing to open doors for investment, new innovations, and new business models in the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are new technological developments within logistics and supply chain management impacting operations at Aramex?</h4><p>The emerging new technologies are creating strategic opportunities for organizations to build competitive advantages in the fields of logistics and supply chain. Technology is the driver of change in our world today. Therefore, we need to focus on adopting the technological innovations we see now in the logistics industry, such as e-commerce, mobile apps, real-time package tracking, and equipment and safety monitoring. For us at Aramex, we are at the forefront of exploring and developing technological solutions that enhance overall operational efficiency. For example, we streamlined our last-mile delivery processes by allowing consumers to live-track their packages with our latest innovative courier and customer mobile apps. These apps have made delivering, tracking, payment, and rating the overall shipment experience much easier and faster. Moreover, Aramex is on a continuous journey of digital transformation to increase the overall effectiveness across all functions, and this will result in a seamless customer experience.</p><h4>The e-commerce market is expected to continue to grow in Qatar and the region. How is Aramex changing to take advantage of this e-commerce market?</h4><p>The market is projected to generate huge volumes. The e-commerce industry is a major growth driver for the courier and parcel delivery services. The increase in e-tailers in various countries around the world, as well as growing interest from Qatar residents for online shopping, opens up great opportunities for Aramex to capitalize on this market. Aramex is a leading global provider of comprehensive logistics and transportation solutions, with a presence in over 60 countries around the world. Through our continuous investments in last-mile delivery solutions and technology infrastructure, we were able to capture a significant part of the e-commerce regional and global traffic.</p><h4>Sustained low energy prices have created a challenging business environment in Qatar. How have these low prices affected Aramex, and how is Aramex adjusting to these challenges?</h4><p>Although the oil and gas industries were the primary drivers for the GCC economy for decades, Gulf countries are diversifying their economies, and a surge in industrial activities is expected in the region, as governments have prioritized diversification in their national agendas. To maintain economic and social development, Qatar is increasing non-oil revenues, and major investments in the non-hydrocarbons sector had resulted in a significant growth in these areas. With its asset-light business model, leveraging the latest technologies and its diversified product offering, Aramex can cater to the requirements of various industry segments and tap into the potential of different sectors to grow its market.</p><h4>In addition to being able to service these new infrastructure projects, how will projects like the Hamad Port improve your operations?</h4><p>Various megaprojects are currently being developed across Qatar such as Doha Metro, World Cup projects, Lusail, and numerous commercial and retail centers. These ongoing projects expand the economy and are creating various business opportunities for several industries. As for the continuous development of the transportation infrastructure, the Hamad Airport project was finalized in the previous years and, recently, Hamad Seaport became operational. In addition to those investments, the e-government projects had improved the quality of the technological and information infrastructure. All this progress has a direct impact on our operational effectiveness and eases the overall flow of goods in Qatar.</p><h4>What is your 2017 outlook for Aramex?</h4><p>There are always opportunities in alternative growth channels to offset the economic impact of oil, and, as a result of the extensive investment in Qatar's economic diversity, Aramex's Qatar market is growing sustainably, and we are keen to maintain this momentum in the future. To continue this growth, we will have to tap into diversified segments and benefit from upcoming opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the launch of a fifth taxi operator in Qatar help contribute to the development of Mowasalat's plans ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>Mowasalat aligns its goals and objectives as a key player in providing ground transport, and as we move closer toward FIFA 2022, we need to keep pace with the all-around growth in the nation. We feel this is the right time to launch the fifth taxi operator, which is another step toward demonstrating our understanding of the demand and supply situation with a view to balance this over smoothly in the next five years. Adding a new operator will help us reach the target of 7,000 taxis by 2022. Additionally, we have promoted our business by creating the Karwa app, which was 100% developed in-house and provides taxi, limousine, and special services in addition to ensuring business quality and control of our franchisees.</p><h4>How does Mowasalat encourage the use of public transport and make it more appealing for users?</h4><p>Mowasalat as a ground transport operator is a key player in contributing to Ministry of Transport and Communication's Vision to serve the community with safe, effective, environment friendly, and smart mobility systems to support economic growth and quality of life. We are one of the key stakeholders in the proposed structure of Integrated Transport Management System in executing the National Transport Master plan through various projects related to traffic demand, public transport capacity, and the development of smart city solutions. In less than a year, we have increased the number of buses to 270 and added several new prominent routes, increasing public accessibility and ridership. Although the use of private cars in Doha is extensive, public transport is a growing market segment. By the end of 2018, we will have 500 medium-size buses to feed Doha Metro stations and ferry people within a 5-10km radius. Users will be able to hop on and off between bus stops and main rail stations. In preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we will need at least 3,000 buses to cater to transport demand, which we are ready to provide. Furthermore, we supply a number of private buses catering to Qatar Tourism Authority for connecting cruise passengers to all parts of Doha. </p><h4>How has Mowasalat managed to maintain its position against tough competition from other transportation or taxi services in Qatar, such as Uber?</h4><p>Today, we are operating around 4,000 taxis with four franchise operations on board and the taxi application in place for availing our services. The sheer scale of operations positions us as a market leader, but we have been striving ahead with continuous upgrading of technology and operational efficiency in enhancing our customer service delivery. We have the Karwa app and provide the whole ecosystem to meet the demand and country's requirements. We see no threat from our competitors, as our primary focus is to maintain safe and economical taxi services in Qatar. </p><h4>What are your targets for 2017?</h4><p>2017 is a milestone year for us as it is the start of our five-year strategic plan. We had a vision to establish our own software, and this was launched in 2017. In addition, we will launch a fifth operator, increase the number of buses, and bring innovative solutions in accordance with the development of smart cities. All buses use GPS technology and are tracked by our control room through automation. The connected application will greatly help in our school bus operations, giving parents the ability to track their children. Transport companies across the world offer mass transportation services; however, we at Mowasalat will implement our strategic plans with efficiency, accuracy, and optimization, introducing innovative, capacity-boosting ideas and embracing the latest technology to revolutionize the public transport sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[OUR sees the possibility of a virtuous cycle whereby with reduced losses there is more water to distribute]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[ansord-hewitt-director-general-office-utilities-regulation-our]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your role within the Jamaican economy?</h4><p>OUR is what we call in regulatory jargon a multi-sector regulator; we regulate a number of sectors: telecommunications, electricity, water, and sewage. It is vital for OUR to operate in a way that boosts the confidence of investors, ensures that the interest of utility consumers are protected, and that there is fair and transparent decision-making consistent with the legal framework in which we operate. As a country moves to more of a market economy, it also needs to provide consumers with the assurance that someone is watching and that they are not being taken advantage of; OUR has also played that role. At the same time, we see ourselves first as a facilitator of investment, protector of the interests of the public, and an agency that is critical to the provision of an atmosphere in which the utilities may develop to become more efficient, modern, and keep pace with technology while enhancing the economic environment.</p><h4>Could you highlight the important projects in the energy sector in light of Vision 2030?</h4><p>For a long time, Jamaica has had the problem of employing predominantly old generating capacity in the electricity sector. The urgent need was therefore for the modernization of generation set and more efficient fuel conversion. It was recognized that if we could reduce the cost of electricity, then clearly Jamaica would become a more attractive place for investment and consumer welfare would increase. There was a long, winding, and dare I say noisy debate about what the source of fuel should have be. Indeed at one point we had a coal faction and an LNG faction, which presented a problem. Every time we embarked on an LNG initiative, those in support of coal would get upset and vice versa. We have had notable successes in the last few years however. In the area of renewables, OUR has had responsibility for procurement through a competitive bidding process. In the first round of the process we were looking for 115MW of capacity; however, we received just about 80MW. There were three major proposals: two wind and one solar, named Wigton, BMR wind farms, and Content Solar. That 80MW of capacity came online last year which coincided with the conversion of the fuel source for a 120MW generation plant at Bogue. Previously the plant ran on ADO and this was converted to natural gas through an initiative impelled by the OUR. The OUR took the view that that there would be significant benefit to consumers if the conversion was done. Therefore, a provision was made in the tariff in 2015 tariff review to address the capital cost associated with the conversion. In other words, we added an increment in the rate to provide financing for this conversion facility. It is now evident that as anticipated when this particular plant runs on natural gas, the fuel costs are lower and there are also environmental benefits associated with it. Interestingly, this project has become a catalyst for greater fuel diversification in Jamaica. Since then, the single buyer, JPS, has opted to use natural gas as the source for a new 190MW plant it is presently constructing and which scheduled for completion in 2019. At the same time a company called New Fortress has led the way in bringing natural gas for electricity generation to the country for the first time. New Fortress took a long-term view of the regional gas market by investing in a facility to supply the Bogue Plant and then leveraging this as its entry point into the domestic market. It constructed a modern state of the art terminal facility in Montego Ba which has the potential to serve other proximate industries such as the refrigerating business and transportation activities.</p><h4>What have been the major changes in the telecom landscape?</h4><p>Since 2000, there has been a transformation in the telecommunication and ICT sector. This has been a global trend; however, the decisions taken in the 1990s to liberalize the sector and increase competition to encourage investment was pivotal to the transformation in Jamaica. Out of that has come the transition from a monopoly, which was the situation when Cable &amp; Wireless dominated the sector, to one in which Digicell emerged as a major entity, Claro also entered the market, and there has also been the advent of Flow as a competitor. Intense competition has since ensued with some resulting consolidation, where Digicell absorbed Claro and Cable &amp; Wireless purchased Flow. So there are now two major competitors. Around 2004 Hurricane Ivan laid bare the vulnerability of Jamaica's international telecommunication links. We essentially had one submarine link cable that linked us to North America and that was severed during the hurricane. Consequently, telecommunication traffic to the island was disrupted for a couple of days. The government was therefore spurred into encouraging diversification of the external telecommunication network. The OUR was therefore directed to hold a tender for two international subsea cable licenses. Eventually, two companies succeeded and one, Columbus Communications, built alternative links. Later on there was a company going through Venezuela to Cuba and were passing Jamaica so it added more links. The result of that is that the island is now well diversified in terms of its links and has reduced its vulnerability. This has in turn given confidence to international investors. There is greater capacity in the market and telecom rates have gone down.</p><h4>What are the challenges in the water sector?</h4><p>Our major concern with water is that access still needs to be expanded; however, the National Water Commission (NWC) loses almost 70% of the water it produces. For almost a decade we have financed the NWC to help it make the network investments to reduce losses. The company has failed to move at the speed we anticipated; however, we see encouragement in certain initiatives that are underway especially in respect of the engagement of private contractor by NWC to spearhead its loss reduction effort. The OUR sees the possibility of a virtuous cycle whereby with reduced losses there is more water to distribute, more revenue to get, and the network can be further expanded and made more efficient. Notably, the OUR has also facilitated private investment in the water sector in response to government policy. Se we have about a dozen small providers who supply water and/or sewage services in designated areas. This means that if an investor decides to build houses in a particular area, but there concerns whether NWC is able to provide reliable supplies, this can be addressed by private provisioning. The other major area for opportunity in the water sector is in sewage as we do not have great sewage infrastructure and there are many pits where people dispose of effluent, which creates a problem in the water table. We need central sewage systems that work well and OUR is thus pushing the government to look at PPP arrangements for the water and sewage sector to facilitate the types of investments that will resolve these issues, increase access to sewage services, and generally improve environmental conditions. As a whole the prospects for the provision of utility services in Jamaica are great and the OUR is committed to its mission of contributing in a significant way to national development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does your most recent fleet expansion, worth more than USD18 billion, bring new improvements to Qatar Airways' operations?</h4><p>Qatar Airways prides itself on having one of the most modern fleets in the sky. Our recent order from Boeing was history in the making and representative of the trust we place within Boeing to deliver aircraft for our growing fleet, in line with meeting the needs of our ambitious network expansion plans around the world. Our 195-strong fleet of aircraft is constantly growing as we strive to expand to even more business and leisure destinations. We currently receive a new aircraft every 10-12 days; without this robust program of aircraft deliveries, we could not serve the new routes that are in our plans for 2017/18 or meet the needs of our passengers who are flying further and more often than ever before. Just in the last year, we received our 30th Boeing 787 Dreamliner, our seventh Airbus A380, and our 14th Airbus A350. During 2017/18, our growing number of more than 150 global destinations is scheduled to increase by 14 routes. Our inaugural flight to Auckland in February this year was significant as it represented a record-breaking event as the world's longest commercial flight, taking 17 hours and 30 minutes and covering a distance of 14,535km from our hub in Doha. Our network expansion and fleet development naturally work in tandem; they are interdependent and only with these two elements complementing one another can Qatar Airways continue to reach for its goal of becoming the best airline in the world.</p><h4>What was the driving force behind the decision to increase your stake in British Airways owner IAG to 20%, and what new benefits will this arrangement bring to your company?</h4><p>Qatar Airways further increased its stake in IAG from 15.67 to 20% in July 2016 due to the many synergies that exist between the airline, IAG, and its fellow member oneworld airlines. It was a direct result of the potential we believe exists in the group and our increased shareholding reflects the strength of commercial and strategic ties between the companies. Qatar Airways supports the ongoing strategy of IAG and is highly supportive of the group's management team. In terms of the benefits that this relationship will bring to Qatar Airways and its passengers, the synergies that already exist between us and the group's other oneworld member airlines will only continue to grow and expand. For example, in October 2016, Qatar Airways and British Airways expanded their existing code share agreement to include all non-stop flights operating between the UK and Doha, allowing both oneworld carriers to provide passengers with better links between the UK, Asia, Middle East, and Africa.</p><h4>How does Qatar Airways work with the Qatar Tourism Authority to raise the country's profile to prospective travelers abroad?</h4><p>Qatar Airways takes its role in helping to raise Qatar's profile to prospective travelers seriously, and in recent years we have seen Qatar establish itself as a true world-class destination for sport, entertainment, and the arts, highlighting Doha as a stopover destination to its millions of passengers. A key foundation of this progress has been a close working relationship with the Qatar Tourism Authority; most notably, Qatar Airways led an initiative to introduce a new free transit visa scheme to our passengers, providing travelers with unprecedented access to Qatar and further supporting the country's soaring tourism industry. Qatar Airways is also a key supporter and sponsor of a number of world-class sporting events based in Qatar. We recently hosted the first-ever Qatar Airways Cup, bringing our sponsored teams of FC Barcelona and Al-Ahli Football Club to Doha for the Match of Champions. We also sponsor world-class events in tennis, cycling, and squash, further enhancing Qatar's reputation as a center for world sporting events. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a primary aluminum smelter, how do you assess Qatalum's key role in supporting Qatar's industrial base?</h4><p>Qatalum has a significant role to play in the development of Qatar's industrial base. At present, 65% of Qatalum production goes to the quality-demanding automotive industry. Qatar's industrial base can benefit greatly from having high quality domestic aluminium available. I can envisage Qatar manufacturing specialized, niche products that rely on the use of the highest-quality aluminium. One of the areas currently being considered is the manufacturing of aluminium cable. Qatalum is also encouraging the use of more aluminum in the construction sector. In our R&amp;D program with Qatar University, we are trying to establish further uses for aluminum in this sector.</p><h4>Qatalum has emerged as a key regional player in the aluminum sector. What markets are you currently targeting?</h4><p>Our core business markets continue to be international, with 95% of Qatalum production currently being exported. Qatalum aluminum is ISO/TS 16949 (quality) certified, which is a prerequisite for any aluminum supplied to the automotive industry. Therefore, a particular focus for Qatalum is to achieve an increased share of the automotive industry. As of today, we have exported our products to over 450 customers in more than 50 countries around the world. Almost 50% of our production goes to Asia, 15% to Turkey, and around 12% to the US.</p><h4>How do you assess Qatar's potential to become a manufacturing hub with the expansion of its logistic capacities?</h4><p>Qatar definitely has the potential and desire to become a manufacturing hub. This potential is greatly assisted by the expansion of the logistics capacity in the country. In particular, the new state-of-the-art Hamad Port will play a key role in realizing Qatar's potential. However, better logistics is just one of the vital ingredients required toward establishing a successful and sustainable manufacturing hub.</p><h4>GCC aluminum production constitutes 10% of the total world production. Do you consider your sector one of the key economic drivers for the Gulf region?</h4><p>Whilst aluminum production is an important contributor to the economies of the Gulf, it would be accurate to say that the industry has more of an economic impact in some GCC countries then others. Nevertheless, 10% of global production is significant, and I expect this figure to grow in the next two to three years. The CEOs of the six Gulf smelters meet quarterly through the Gulf Aluminum Council, which is an excellent forum to discuss important issues such as health and safety, the environment, and corporate social responsibility. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect to see the current growth in the domestic economy to continue at over 4%. Gradual growth in domestic consumption of Qatalum products is taking place alongside further steps by local businessmen to establish a viable and competitive downstream industry. Qatalum is willing to assist and guide any new downstream aluminum initiatives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[power-of-three]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nebras Power was established in 2014 as a joint venture between three major energy players in Qatar. How did you benefit from their local expertise?</h4><p>Nebras Power is the international investment arm of three main entities in Qatar's power sector: Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC), Qatar Holding, and Qatar Petroleum International. The idea was to create a single entity that represents Qatar in the international market through investment in greenfield and brownfield energy developments, including power generation, water desalination, and water treatment projects. The three companies bring different strengths to our entity: QEWC is Qatar's main power generator and brought the know-how and capabilities for project development; Qatar Holding supports the financial structure; and Qatar Petroleum has extensive experience in gas-sourcing and loading and unloading gas. With these entities brought together under Nebras Power, Qatar is better able to invest in the international power market.</p><h4>How do you capitalize on the increasing demand for electricity and water in the Middle East?</h4><p>We focus on the Middle East for two reasons. Firstly, our shareholders and we know this region well. Secondly, most of the countries in this region apply the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model. For example, our investment in Jordan in the Shams Ma'an project, which is the largest operational solar plant in the region, sells electricity under a 20-year power purchase agreement. Furthermore, we own a stake in two gas projects in Jordan and are currently working with partners on developing another solar project. We see ourselves as a long-term investor and a strategic partner for the country where we operate.</p><h4>Recently, Nebras Power signed an MoU with Masdar to develop renewable projects in Qatar, the UAE, and other markets. How do you assess the importance of this cooperation for the development of power generation projects in the region?</h4><p>Masdar is one of the main energy players in the Middle East, and it now focuses on renewable projects. As Nebras is also a large regional developer and a semi-government entity, we share similarities, creating great room for cooperation. We can learn from each other and join forces to bid for important projects in the international markets.</p><h4>Nebras Power's international expansion plans include investing in Asia, the Americas, and Africa. How do you prepare the company to target these regions?</h4><p>First, we want to diversify geographically, as we would like to see ourselves operating in different parts of the world. Secondly, we aim to offer different energy sources in our portfolio. After three years of operations, we have a unit of almost 1.5GW under our portfolio, and our plan is to add from 800-1,000MW per annum. To do so, in December 2016 we increased our financial strength by signing a USD430 million revolving credit in a four-year loan. This will strengthen the company's capital structure and provide long-term financial flexibility. In 2016, we closed a big transaction, acquiring a 35.5% stake in Paiton Energy from Engie in a power plant in Indonesia valued at USD1.35 billion. Furthermore, North America is one of our targets for 2017 because of its high demand for electricity, relying on renewables and gas-powered plants to which we can contribute. This is also the case for Latin America, as we target certain countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. When it comes to Africa, in 2015 we signed an MoU with a Japanese company for a project in Senegal, which will use natural gas as fuel to generate electricity for the National Electricity Company of Senegal. Since the first day of our operations, Nebras Power was determined to become a major energy player in the world. We believe that with the strength of our shareholders, we will become one of the leading power generators internationally. The recent steps we have taken and the type of alliances we are building with regional and international developers help us move forward with our strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>OPEC's overarching ambition is to minimize price volatility in the market. What measures and strategies do you have in the event that the oil price drops below the USD50 band?</h4><p>Firstly, let me stress that OPEC does not have a target price. The voluntary production adjustment decisions taken in 2016 by 24 participating countries in Vienna at the 171st Ministerial Conference on November 30, 2016, and the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers on December 10, 2016, were specifically focused on bringing forward the market rebalancing, and accelerating the drawdown of the stock overhang to the five-year average. The collaborative and timely developments were taken to address the prevailing market realities, which should lead to the oil price finding its equilibrium level. In terms of volatility, we need to recognize that short-term price fluctuations caused by such issues as geopolitics, supply disruptions, economic developments, and weather are natural. Clearly, we cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. However, it is important that we differentiate between such normal fluctuations and those that can be viewed as extreme. Extreme price fluctuations are clearly not conducive to the effective functioning of the market, particularly given the long-term nature of investments in our industry.</p><h4>Qatar's oil output is slated to fall by more than 11% YoY in 2017. How well has Qatar performed in the implementation of OPEC's decision to voluntarily adjust oil production?</h4><p>Qatar is a major global energy player. While its oil production has fallen gradually in recent years, its natural gas production has continued to increase YoY. It is now a global hub for liquefied natural gas, and ideally positioned for the growing energy demand center of Asia. In terms of the implementation of the OPEC and non-OPEC decisions taken in 2016, Qatar has played an important role, as have all participating nations. To date, conformity with the decisions has been good. In the first three months of 2017, we saw overall OPEC and non-OPEC conformity rise from 86% in January to 98% in March, with our firm goal being 100% conformity.</p><h4>In January 2017, you held a meeting with Qatar's Minister of Energy &amp; Industry. How do you assess his role as OPEC's Conference President throughout a challenging 2016?</h4><p>Back in January 2017, I paid a visit to HE Dr. Mohammed bin Saleh Al-Sada to thank him personally for the great diplomatic efforts he undertook throughout 2016 as OPEC Conference President to bring OPEC and non-OPEC producers together. His judgement, guidance, and dedication in helping OPEC Member Countries agree on a production adjustment decision, and in bringing on board many non-OPEC nations, were a cornerstone of the great efforts aimed at rebalancing the market, supporting sustainable stability, and ensuring that the necessary industry investments return. His unwavering leadership in an extremely challenging 2016 went far beyond the scope of the organization and helped to positively guide producers, and the industry as a whole. His term as OPEC Conference President in 2016 will no doubt be viewed as a momentous milestone in the organization's history.</p><h4>Qatar's new Laffan Refinery formally launched operations in 1Q2017. How important is this project in the supply of petroleum products to the global market?</h4><p>The Laffan Refinery is a key part of Qatar's vision to process and add value to the field condensate produced from its Qatargas and RasGas ventures. The recent addition of the second refinery in 1Q2017 has doubled condensate refining capacity at the complex to 292,000bpd. Undoubtedly, this development will be a vital new cog in the global supply of petroleum products. The development is also in line with the principles of Qatar National Vision 2030, which aims to create a sustainable economy and advance the standard of living in Qatar. The OPEC Secretariat supports its implementation as the country looks to advance its economic, social, human, and environmental development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Qatar managed to respond to the new international competition in LNG projects with a view to maintaining its current market share in key regions, such as Asia and Europe?</h4><p>Demand for natural gas is increasing at a pace more than any other form of energy; its consumption is forecasted to be higher than any other fossil fuel. Within the natural gas sector, the LNG demand is expected to grow at a robust 4.6% average per annum until 2035, growing from 264 million tons per annum (Mtpa) in 2016 to over 600Mtpa by 2035. Hence, there is enough space for supplies to grow. Market share of LNG in international gas trade is slated to grow to more than 50% by 2035. This implies that LNG volumes will grow to about 100% of piped volumes by 2035. Therefore, new LNG projects are more complementary rather than competitive in nature considering the expanding market. As far as competitiveness and market share of Qatar LNG is concerned, it should be remembered that Qatar is driven by the long-term vision and guidance of its Emir, HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and has developed competitive-edge and first-mover advantage with respect to the cost of production. Besides this, it has a track record of excellent and reliable supply, ably supported by an efficient delivery mechanism, spread across full value chain, helping us remain competitive despite new international LNG entrants.</p><h4>With the oil and gas sector still experiencing struggles in the international market, how is the ministry is working to maximize energy efficiency in Qatar, including new exploration plans?</h4><p>The ministry has taken certain steps to maximize energy efficiency through rationalization of the price of petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel. Instead of a flat rate, the prices are indexed to oil prices on a monthly basis; for example, the price of gasoline is now QAR1.5 per liter, up from QAR1 per liter before rationalization. Subsidies have been totally eliminated. Besides price rationalization of petroleum products, Kahramaa, the power and water distribution and marketing company under the Ministry of Energy and Industry, has implemented the Tarsheed program to rationalize water and power consumption in Qatar. The scheme has significantly reduced water and power consumption, bringing energy efficiency to Qatar. Regarding new exploration plans, Qatar decided to lift the moratorium on North Field Gas Projects in 2017 and intends to produce 113 million cbm of gas in addition to the existing production, which would increase its LNG capacity from 77 million tons to more than 100 million tons. This would ensure that Qatar remains the largest LNG exporter in the world with additional LNG hitting the market between 2022 and 2024. In addition to this, Qatar plans to carry out exploration activities in a number of countries.</p><h4>A new PPP law is expected to be issued this year. What are your views on public-private cooperation in Qatar's industrial sector moving forward?</h4><p>The energy sector of Qatar already has experience with PPPs in the form of a USD3 billion water and power project at Ras Laffan and a power project in Mesaieed. The new PPP law will establish a clear legal basis for PPPs, providing a governance mechanism and approval framework. It will give confidence, certainty, and assurance to the government, investors, and lenders alike. It will help Qatar focus on achieving sustainable growth through nurturing an effective private sector. PPPs will act as a diversification enabler in National Development Strategy 2017-2022 (NDS-2) and a means of private sector-led growth. NDS-2 represents a shift in direction in that the government is moving away from being a provider of growth to becoming more of an enabler of growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In August 2016, Moody's changed Beema's outlook from stable to positive. How does this reflect on your current market position?</h4><p>Moody's upgraded our outlook due to our strong profitability and the improvement in our market position. We have a strong customer base and assistance from our shareholders, and this helped us to perform well compared to others in underwriting. We see insurance as a service; therefore, we work to deliver the service the client expects. The majority of premiums in Qatar are in the motor segment, and we have performed very well in that. We have established a good reputation in that segment, which gives us the opportunity to enhance other lines such as property, which has increased 30%. All in all, our portfolio has developed well in motor and individual lines, and we also had many renewed clients. Our market position has been expanding for the past four years, and I hope that we can continue in the same way for 2017.</p><h4>How is Beema capitalizing on the demands of the growing population of the country?</h4><p>Since I started working for Beema five years ago, I had a conservative approach in underwriting. We are the fastest-growing Islamic insurance company in Qatar. In addition to that, 70% of our 2016 profits came from underwriting and operations. As the performance has been good throughout our operations, that exemplifies the professionalism of our core business.</p><h4>What will be the key to maintaining that sustainable growth in a more competitive environment?</h4><p>We are focused on improving our service more than expanding our branch network. I am of the thought that we have to approach the consumer rather than the other way around. Therefore, we are capitalizing on technological applications. I do not want to waste an hour of my clients' time by coming to our branches and issuing a policy. It is better to approach them via mobile phone, our website Peace of Mind, or delivering at their doorstep. The quality and transparency of an insurance company becomes evident when a claim is filed, and I am glad we have succeeded in delivering what we promise. I can proudly say we are the only insurance company that approaches the client.</p><h4>What are your expectations on the benefits the new health insurance scheme will have on your operations?</h4><p>We are in talks with the authorities to understand the new regulation. The recent central bank regulation is also key, and has been fully applied. We were already applying it before the draft was released because we have a good strategy and we are over reserved in our balance sheet. This new regulation was in our favor because we are more conservative than other insurance companies, which had deficits and are now trying to recapitalize. Additionally, we have the biggest credit life portfolio in Qatar. We are holding credit life for Masraf Al Rayan, Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Barwa Bank, Al Jazeera Finance, and First Finance. Regarding the potential three-bank merger, as Masraf Al Rayan is our shareholder, we hope to benefit. Our portfolio will be bigger, especially if a new bank like the International Bank of Qatar (IBQ) converts into Islamic banking.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2017?</h4><p>We are tendering the construction of our new headquarters building in May 2017. In addition, we have a logistics area in Manateq that we are using for our salvage and storage. Furthermore, we are the only insurance company that has started doing online auctions, and so far we have sold around 360 cars. The main advantage is anyone can participate in the bid, and this feature provides wider access to buyers around the region and world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>QLM offers life and medical insurance. How have these segments changed since the National Health Insurance Company's (NHIC) Seha scheme finished at the end of 2015?</h4><p>QLM has noticed more awareness coming into the market in Qatar. Although the Seha scheme has been stopped, it did provide awareness about medical insurance, what this service entails, and its importance. NHIC faced some obstacles linked to the technical side, such as not having experience in managing a scheme like this. It was more social funding than medical insurance. If you want to offer medical insurance you need a product with benefits, a cap, terms, and limitations. The Seha scheme had no limits for medical coverage of locals even when they were using private healthcare services. When a scheme applies to government hospitals and services, you can control the cost; once you include private clinics and hospitals, they take a commercial approach, and you are not able to control costs anymore. This is why Seha was stopped; it was not managed 100% as a medical insurance scheme. Seha has had no impact whatsoever on the local insurance companies in Qatar because we were not a part of that scheme. We did not underwrite any of the risk; Seha scheme's introduction and termination was completely separate from the medical insurance industry.</p><h4>How would you gauge the popularity of life insurance in Qatar?</h4><p>Group life insurance policies are compulsory today for some of private and semi-government sectors. However, more awareness still needs to be built up in regards to individuals buying life insurance. Having said that, in Qatar, the government spends a large sum on the social sector, particularly on locals, so they do not feel the need for savings or life products. There is also the religious issue, which means some people do not agree with life products and it is up to the industry to introduce these products in the right way. It is not a regulatory issue; it is about acceptance by local people. Plus, life products are not that attractive when there is free healthcare and education from the government. Most expatriates are looking for life products, but they do not necessarily buy them in Qatar. They might take out a policy with their existing insurer in their home country.</p><h4>How does QLM act to win the confidence of customers?<br></h4><p>In terms of our medical insurance business, we have the major market share in Qatar. QLM gained this position because we were the first mover in the market with a digital platform of services, focusing on mobile applications and online services. We have our own reception areas in Qatar's major private hospitals, such as Al-Ahli and Al Emadi Hospitals, to accommodate our clients and ensure quality service. We work side by side with our clients to ensure that services are available to them in a seamless way; for QLM, it is all about the service we provide. We find we are more integrated with our clients today through mobile applications and online services. It is more about integrating with your customer base to better understand the way they live. The digital platform is also significant for increasing awareness about our life insurance products and further penetrating the market.</p><h4>How will the central bank's new regulations in 2016 affect QLM and the wider insurance sector?</h4><p>The impact will be positive. The regulators are working to support insurance companies and we can see an example of this in the banking sector, and this is similar. Now, there will be proper pricing parameters, which can be followed by all the insurance companies. The regulations are completely positive and give us more confidence to invest and develop the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[status-update]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits have recent upgrades brought to the QSE?</h4><p>We had two significant upgrades from global index benchmark providers MSCI and FTSE. The upgrade to emerging market status brings significant benefits to the market including benefits to listing companies, brokers, and investors. We are effectively the largest emerging market in the MENA region as per MSCI and FTSE. We saw capital inflow of more than USD2 billion as a result of these two upgrades. It has also opened up the Qatari market to a number of long-term global institutional investors like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and large emerging market passive investors. Our listed companies now have access to a global institutional investor base that will facilitate them in further capital raising. I would say that we still have not completely realized the full potential of becoming an emerging market given all of the uncertainty surrounding us—the wars in Syria and Yemen as well as the declining oil prices. But in short, the upgrades have really served to bolster our key measures.</p><h4>How is the QSE working to provide a diversified range of investment and trading opportunities?</h4><p>Our strategy is to provide a platform to our customers where they can trade multiple asset classes with varying trading strategies. We have been working on a number of things to improve the investment environment and to facilitate our global investors. We are developing new tools and introducing them into the market. For example, in the past year we have introduced the LP, which is the liquidity provision. We also introduced margin trading and are planning to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the first quarter of 2017. There are few things that still need to be implemented, like regulated covered short selling, securities lending and borrowing, and omnibus accounts. One of our achievements last year was that we managed to list Qatar First Bank. We are also working with a number of family-owned companies to bring them to market. There are a few in the pipeline with potentially two IPOs in the first quarter of 2017.</p><h4>How is the QSE supporting SME development?</h4><p>We recognize the importance of SMEs and their contribution to the market and GDP. Most of these companies are family-owned companies that are trying to grow, and their growth potential is much faster than other sectors. Therefore, it is important to provide them with financing opportunities and the ability to access business and sector expertise. QSE offers all of these opportunities. There is also an opportunity for SMEs to network with potential foreign partners through the stock exchange. Most of the employment in Qatar comes from these SMEs, and we are therefore trying to assist them in as many ways as we can. SMEs often play an integral role in the smooth operation of some of Qatar's largest companies, and we are, therefore, highly focused on ensuring these businesses are given the opportunity to thrive.</p><h4>What drives the creation of new products like the capital markets for SMEs and the new ETFs you have unveiled?</h4><p>The idea is to provide our customers with tools to diversify their portfolios via investment opportunities at QSE. We are working on SMEs, equity and commodity ETFs, real estate investment traded funds (REITs), and other tools like covered short selling and securities lending and borrowing to unlock liquidity and allow it to flow into different asset classes. We are working within the framework of Qatar National Vision 2030, and this is the guiding light for many of our initiatives. We are trying to create a modern economy, and that means the QSE needs to facilitate a vibrant, efficient financial market. We understand what the market needs to achieve this development, and we are trying to facilitate its transformation. Our expertise in capital markets also directs our program and product development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which segments currently offer the most potential for Ahlibank?</h4><p>Retail banking continues to be an area of focus, because under the new capital regulations it is where there is an advantage over capital deployment. However, to be honest, growth remains on the commercial banking side of our business. We are close to the business community and have been scoring high in terms of winning opportunities. Regarding the sectors in Qatar's economy that have the most potential for commercial growth, we have been selectively supporting the real estate sector and then moved on to infrastructure; however, we always maintain close ties with commercial trade, capital expenditure, and related businesses.</p><h4>What new initiatives do you have to push the trade side of the business?</h4><p>We have invested in the trade finance department in terms of advising and training customers how to operate across borders using their letters of credit rules and other tools. We play a major part with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and are active in terms of advising the business community of Qatar about the valuable role played by the ICC. The primary motive is to voice our opinion and advise on the new rules, which Qatar should and will play in cross-border trade. The ICC is a great and important element of this.</p><h4>How have your e-payment channel products impacted operations?</h4><p>It takes time for these products to take off. It is gradually growing; we wish that it grew further and faster but there is competition from everywhere. We actually made previous investments in the local payment gateway, which is called Q-Pay, developed by the Qatar Central Bank (QCB). We made the past investment, and QCB just upgraded it so we have a good pipeline in providing services to businesses to help them with their customer offerings. These businesses need to upgrade their websites in order to get this additional payment capability, but they have now taken over and we have put in local and international names and they are happy with it. It is a tangible, growing business, in which we are leaders. </p><h4>What is Ahlibank doing to protect its customers with cyber security initiatives?</h4><p>During the Cyber Security Convention, we released two films, on internet security and phishing, on the website and through WhatsApp for our customers. It is awareness not just internally but also externally, and we continue to advise and send messages to customers to make them aware of it. We are the first, if not the only, bank that asked for certification, which is good to have in cyber security. All the banks are audited by QCB. There are bound to be gaps that need to be closed and we are working on ISO certifications. We do not stop as the risk is too high.</p><h4>How has the upgrade in the FTSE with Qatar's position affected Ahlibank?</h4><p>Many shareholders like to buy and hold rather than trade with it; hence, our liquidity in shares is limited in terms of where other banks are. It does add liquidity to the market in the event our shares are traded more, and as we grow and our shareholder base expands, it will have a positive effect.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Ahlibank and the banking sector in Qatar in 2017?</h4><p>I look at 2017 with caution. If we continue looking at quality and efficiencies in operations to select opportunities then we will be fine in 2017. We might not, as a banking industry, record the levels of the good days, but it is all about sustainability rather than big swings and that is what we are aiming for. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess QDB's contribution to the growth of the private sector and SME development in Qatar during your 20-year history?</h4><p>Since our establishment in 1997, we have been at the forefront of these efforts. We have worked with thousands of Qatari entrepreneurs and enterprises, we have provided investment and guidance to brand-new start-ups and well-established corporations, and have built a reputation for identifying promising investment opportunities. Today, QDB is the centerpiece of achieving Qatar National Vision 2030. To promote the private sector, we locally extend wide-ranging financial and non-financial support to entrepreneurs across a myriad of industries—the development organization runs a series of initiatives to promote an entrepreneurial spirit in the citizenry to create private start-ups on an ongoing basis. Our development schemes, such as the eco-friendly Jahiz I and Jahiz II initiatives, have empowered local SMEs that are operating across a diverse range of industries, including chemicals, electronics, plastics, and wood materials as well as food and beverages.</p><h4>Since the bank diversified its focus and raised its capital in 2008, have you aligned your financing strategy with the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>At QDB, we hold our national priorities central to all of our endeavors. We segmented the private sector along categories that are most vital for Qatar's diversification agenda, and we assist these sectors through both financial and non-financial services as well as providing other development-related assistance on behalf of the government. Currently, the seven sectors we focus on are projected to have an overall positive impact on the social and economic standard of living in Qatar: agriculture, education, fisheries, healthcare, industrial sector, livestock, and tourism.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the Al Dhameen program in the private sector's growth?</h4><p>Al Dhameen Program—our partial loan guarantee scheme—is at the forefront of our private-sector development strategy. In doing so, Al Dhameen encourages banks to finance SMEs by covering a part of the risk. The partner banks consider the financing application according to their own lending policies and, when they feel the need for a guarantee, will apply to QDB and advise the client accordingly. Both existing companies as well as qualifying start-ups are eligible for assistance under the Al Dhameen program. Al Dhameen has contributed to an ever-evolving Qatari private sector, with USD100 million worth of guarantees made available to over 110 SMEs in 2016.</p><h4>How does the MA'AN initiative to support entrepreneurs represent the importance of human capital development for the overall economic growth of the country?</h4><p>To understand this initiative, it is important to remember His Highness the Amir's address at the 45th session of the Advisory Council, when he said, “Qatar deserves the best from its children.“ This has been the impetus for trilateral partnership between QDB, Qatar Chamber, and Qatar University as well as the driving force behind our joint initiative, MA'AN. Through this program, we seek to provide the youth of Qatar a platform to develop its creative entrepreneurial ideas, empower local entrepreneurs, and provide financial and technical support, as well as assist entrepreneurs at Qatar University to go global. Every great company starts with an idea, but ideas need nurturing and support to flourish. This is why QDB is highly keen on fostering creative ideas and enabling individuals to turn their ambitions into real projects.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>To date, we are heartened by the achievements of Qatari SMEs. Moving forward, our success will lie in our ability to embrace the fast pace of development in the world of technology, strengthen our connectivity with one another and the markets around us, and truly immerse ourselves in the digital age. In the days to come, embracing its national responsibility, QDB will continue to empower the nation's citizens to tap into the latest wave of economic globalization and evolve Qatar's economy as outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2017-2022.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Being the largest lender to the Qatari government, what is your strategy to support the country's path toward the 2022 FIFA World Cup?</h4><p>Qatar is witnessing a strong investment drive to diversify its economy, and hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022 provides a key milestone toward that end. To support the country's efforts, QNB has focused its financing on four key areas: utilities, transport, real estate, and FIFA World Cup infrastructure. In utilities, we have continued our active involvement in financing key projects such as water and sewage networks. In transport, we were involved in vessel and aircraft financing for prime shipping and transport companies. In real estate, we have seen continued demand for residential projects and hospitality, helping Qatar reach the 60,000 hotel rooms targeted for 2022. Gearing up for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we have participated in many projects, including roads, stadiums, and infrastructure.</p><h4>How do you assess the results of QNB's acquisition of Turkey's Finansbank, and how will this acquisition further increase trade between Turkey and Qatar?</h4><p>This transaction is a significant milestone in QNB Group's strategy of international expansion. With the addition of Turkey as a new market and one of the leading Turkish banks to its network, QNB Group further extends its international presence and will be able to increasingly benefit from the rapid development of trade and the strengthening of economic ties between Turkey and the Middle East in general, as well as between Qatar and Turkey in particular, taking into consideration the historic relations both countries enjoy. This also reflects QNB Group's confidence in the long-term prospects of the financial sector and economy of Turkey.</p><h4>As there is mismatch between the growth of lending and deposits in Qatar, do you have intentions to tap the debt and equity markets in 2017, particularly in Asia?</h4><p>The slowdown in asset growth means we have greater ability to be more opportunistic when it comes to issuing further debt. We have a large and stable liquidity buffer, with our wholesale funding made up from a diverse mix of deposits, structured deposits, CDs, and EMTN issuance. We use these tools to optimally manage any asset/liability mismatches arising from local market conditions. In the debt market, we will remain opportunistic, with no fixed-issuance targets. The maintenance of strong liquidity allows us to only access the market when it is beneficial to do so. We are looking at new niche markets, such as Pro-Bond, Kangaroo, Panda-EUR, and CHF, to see if they make economic sense. As for the equity market, this really depends on the capital requirements or further plans for acquisition; as of now we are adequate on the capital requirements.</p><h4>How do you assess the overall health of the banking sector in Qatar, and what factors drive bank mergers?</h4><p>The Qatari banking system is healthy. It has grown strongly in size in recent years, without compromising its profitability. We expect this trend to continue going forward. We foresee robust growth in the size of the banking system, partly driven by Qatar's strong investment spending program. And we expect this growth to be healthy, with profits also projected to grow to new highs. Underpinning this healthy growth is the strong capital position, high-asset quality, and efficient cost structure of Qatari banks.</p><h4>What are your business expectations and your economic outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Regarding credit growth, we expect a fiscal deficit around 2% of GDP in 2017, leading to continued demand for loans from the government. When it comes to liquidity, the higher oil prices should slow the withdrawal of government deposits, which declined by 11.1% year on year in December 2016. At the same time, I expect private sector deposits to grow based on high population growth. This growth was 0.9% in December 2016 compared to 9.1% a year earlier. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy for financing the fiscal deficit in 2017?</h4><p>According to the latest economic outlook published by Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics (MDPS), the fiscal balance may turn out to be deficit in 2016. The situation is likely to continue in the next two years, though at moderate levels. Financing the expected lower revenue flows from oil and gas sector has to meet through a combination of higher non-oil revenue and debt financing. As part of the fiscal consolidation strategies, efforts are in place to improve the revenue stream. In 2015, water and electricity tariffs increased, while gasoline prices increased in 2016. In addition, the government has introduced a pricing mechanism to revise fuel prices on a periodical basis. Coordinated efforts are also in place at the regional level to draft a proper policy design for tax reforms. As regards to debt financing, Qatar has already taken advantage of its strong economic fundamentals reflected by the stable credit rating provided by international rating agencies through issuance of sovereign bonds in the international market in 2016. Further, the domestic bond market has also been explored as part of fiscal balancing. In 2016, bonds worth USD4.7 billion have been issued, where more than one-fourth of the debt was of sukuk issuance. Out of the total issuance of domestic bonds, USD2.2 billion worth of bonds maps the same amount of bonds matured during 2016. Needless to say, QCB has been involved in the development of the government debt market even when the government has surplus funds. Thus, the issuance of government bonds and sukuk within the banking sector largely reflects the measures taken for the development of the government debt market for liquidity management.</p><h4>What factors drive bank mergers, and how do you see this trend evolving in the region?</h4><p>Bank mergers have their advantages and disadvantages. In general, merger talks are initiated when the banks involved expect the value of the combined entity to improve after the merger. When the operating environment becomes challenging for a large number of smaller banks, the shareholders initiate talks of mergers to maximize benefits through reduction of corporate risks and enhancement of earnings. The combined entity can optimize their efficiency in utilization of resources to build a stronger financial institution with solid financial position and liquidity. Consolidation can reduce operational costs and thereby enhance profits. However, there are downside risks also. Excess resources under the control of one entity may adversely affect the pricing. </p><h4>What are the main challenges that need to be addressed?</h4><p>In April 2016, QCB issued new insurance instructions; these instructions were benchmarked taking into consideration the IAIS insurance core principles, the regional and international best practices, and the current local market situation. The instructions cover all insurance supervisory issues, starting from licensing a company to the process of runoff. It deals with prudential returns, investment concentration, risk management framework, and conduct of business. Further, regulatory instructions regarding corporate governance taking into consideration commercial companies' law and QMFA regulations were also issued last year. In addition, instructions for transitional arrangements for existing insurance companies have also been issued to assist in smooth transition from a non-regulated market to a well-regulated one. QCB law requires insurance companies to get approval for all insurance policies. To supplement the regulatory instructions on insurance companies, draft instructions for insurance intermediaries and jobs related to insurance—actuaries, loss adjusters, and insurance specialists—are currently under public consultation. Thus, we aim to strengthen the insurance intermediaries market by raising the minimum capital requirement and prudential requirement. These requirements also assist weak intermediaries to exit the market, helping to raise the quality of existing intermediaries. Overall, the regulations, instructions, and transitional arrangements are expected to improve the soundness and strength of existing insurance companies and assist in attracting new entrants to the insurance market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will Qatar Cool be involved in further infrastructural development in Qatar?</h4><p>Growth in terms of establishing new districts in Qatar is coming close to a slowdown. The market is going into a consolidation phase, where we potentially look at our growth in terms of acquisitions and consolidation. We see development through potential acquisitions and on the fringe of developments. There will not be a new Lusail or a new The Pearl, but there will be new districts established as the country expands and the economy grows. We have substantial experience; we have been in the market for a long time and have a presence internationally in terms of identity. Therefore, it makes sense that the country should look at Qatar Cool as a company champion to be presented globally. With Qatar Cool we have created a national champion that is able to compete beyond the borders of Qatar. However, we need to be bigger than we are today. Currently we service the two biggest districts in Qatar, and we have to work with the government to regulate high-density areas that could potentially be zoned as district cooling. We are talking with government entities to advocate the benefits of district cooling so that they can work in assessing the landscape within Qatar as to where district cooling makes sense. There are specific zones that are high density but use conventional cooling, which is much more costly and inefficient.</p><h4>Will you consider further international expansion within the foreseeable future?</h4><p>We have always pushed to explore possible expansions beyond the borders of Qatar. We will stick to district cooling; we are experts in our field and can add value to every development that exists. However, our current priority is Qatar; district cooling is much more viable here than in many other places. If we were going beyond, we would have already capitalized as much as we could within the region itself. In other regions of the world like Asia, the scale of projects in other places is often much smaller. We could potentially invest in those areas, but it would require a great deal of effort for a marginal impact; whereas in this region, we know the lay of the land and understand the environment and cultural norms, so it is easy for us to access those markets.</p><h4>As 70% of the generated electricity in the Middle East is used for air conditioning purposes, how important is it to focus on efficiency and energy saving?</h4><p>Our prime existence is energy efficiency. At the front end of energy production, efficiency produces substantial savings because it is offset by a reduction in electricity. As of today, we have saved the country over 1 billion kWH of electricity, which is the equivalent of reducing over 600 million tons of CO2. In addition, initiatives like Tarsheed have had a huge impact on energy efficiency because it does not mandate through regulations on specific individuals. Having utilities for free sometimes encourages bad behavior. Tarsheed woke people up, establishing that water and energy are important for us. We have shown that through signing an MoU with KAHRAMAA to support Tarsheed and its objectives. We play a key role because energy and the environment are important, not only for Qatar's sustainability, but also for its existence in the long run. We have also signed an MoU with the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI) to study the oxidization of sewer fluid. We also have 20 initiatives with universities and companies on specific projects, signing MoUs with numerous entities. If we aggregate all the companies that are working on this, it will make a dent in terms of starting a trend toward meeting the 2030 national goals, which outline protecting the environment and spurring social development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As this is the first year of operations for the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, what lines will delineate your strategy in both areas?</h4><p>Municipal and environmental affairs are closely related. The Ministry of Municipality and Environment wants to beautify our cities, provide services to the population, and oversee land use and urban and infrastructure planning. At the same time, we have to reflect environmental and agricultural considerations in our activities. This means making sure land is used correctly without damaging Qatar's natural resources. Moreover, the environment and green practices are important for keeping the city clean, for example through recycling, building, and industrial waste. Environmental controls for emissions standards and diseases are also under our jurisdiction. We have a laboratory for monitoring the factories' emissions, as Qatar is a strong producer of petrochemicals</p><h4>What are the ministry's plans for developing the concept of smart cities across Qatar?</h4><p>Parks should be vibrant places for their surrounding community areas. Within this approach, the Ministry of Municipality and Environment is working on the development of 60 public smart parks. We are installing electronic services, such as free internet access and special smart colored lighting, while some of them will even have cinemas. The parks will host festivities, celebrations, and social events where families and friends can gather. Additionally, we have chosen some of the parks to host traditional Qatari houses to preserve our heritage. All in all, the parks will be designed in such a way that they serve the population. In terms of wider smart cities initiatives, we are working on more advanced navigation systems that give information while driving, and there will be more direct information sent by public bodies to individuals about issues affecting daily life.</p><h4>How are you cooperating with private developers on the urban planning of new areas built to cater to the demands of a growing population?</h4><p>Besides the residential and commercial areas, there will be 20 civic centers within the city of Doha. These quarters will be equipped with gardens, markets, and other public services. They will include residential developments for Qataris and expatriates built around metro exits. In addition, there are the Msheireb and Al Dafna downtown areas as well as Lusail City. Our inspectors and engineers ensure developers respect the urban plan and the environment, as well as install the facilities that every neighborhood needs. Furthermore, we have the intention to develop three new cities outside Doha with their own administrative services, industrial areas, schools, hospitals, and other public services: Al Khor, Al-Shahaniya, and Al Wakrah. We need to take the pressure off Doha's residential and commercial areas; therefore, each new city will have its own downtown with a different focus. Al Wakrah will be more industrial because it is near the port and airport. Al Khor will have some sea and land developments and will feature more agricultural projects. Finally, Al-Shahaniya will be connected with livestock activities.</p><h4>What role does the ministry play in promoting sustainable and green developments?</h4><p>The ministry is responsible for waste management and we intend to create energy from waste. Our target is to have approximately 400MW from waste treatment and recycling. Our other responsibility, together with Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA) and Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC), is to allocate land for solar plants to produce 200MW of solar energy. Qatar already has fertilizer-generated energy, and we are creating new farms for energy created underground by tree roots. We focus on how Qatar can deal with its waste products through 100% recycling and 100% energy reuse while minimizing its emissions. We request companies that come here to operate with zero waste and zero emissions. We are also working on improving our waste collection methods to be underground in the new development quarters. We will implement a special collection program that includes advanced sorting of various types of waste products so that it is easier to recycle these materials. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess QBIC's role in the development of the private sector, which can pave the way for a more diversified economy in Qatar?</h4><p>The Qatari government is keen on developing and heavily investing in the private sector, as in the long run this diversification will benefit the Qatari economy. This is also the vision of our founder, the Qatar Development Bank (QDB); it strives to diversify the market by supporting and creating a strong SME sector. QBIC supports that vision by providing incubation opportunities. We support innovative start-ups and provide them with the tools that they need in order to grow their businesses. QBIC's goal is to foster innovative ideas and help create the next business leaders of the country. Since our establishment three years ago, we have become one of the largest incubation centers in the region, and we have been focusing on incubating local start-ups from a variety of different sectors. We are aligning our strategy with the Qatar National Vision 2030; therefore, we are focusing on specifically targeted sectors. For example, we have partnered with the Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) to set up a specialized incubator, QBIC Tourism, which focuses on incubating start-ups in the tourism sector. We have also partnered with Ooredoo Qatar to set up the specialized incubator Digital and Beyond, which focuses on incubating start-ups with digital solutions.</p><h4>How is QBIC creating the future leading companies of Qatar?</h4><p>Since its creation, QBIC has incubated more than 60 companies. Some of them have already graduated and are now successful ventures, while others are in the process of development and growth. The great thing about this initiative is that we expose entrepreneurs to influencers and investors in the private sector. The government and the private sector both partner with our incubatees to develop major projects in technology, retail, luxury, tourism, and a variety of other sectors.</p><h4>How do you cooperate with foreign counterparts and connect your incubatees with international partners?</h4><p>We recently traveled to France and met with different incubators. We signed an MoU with Paris &amp; Co., which is now focusing on the tourism sector. It seeks to invest in Qatari start-ups to help them set up their businesses in Paris. Moreover, we also signed an MoU with the Korean Startup Association (KSTAR) to establish mutually beneficial relationships. This MoU has provided a unique chance for 11 Korean and Qatari start-ups to pitch their businesses for prospective Qatari investors during the seventh Demo Day. Our main focus is to promote local entrepreneurship, and we are open to boosting partnerships between local start-ups and foreign incubators and investors. We aim to always welcome international companies and urge them to get involved in the market, meet start-ups, and develop and invest in partnerships with local ventures.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Every year we tweak and improve our programs' tactics in order to better benefit our entrepreneurs in this fast-paced changing economy. In addition, we will continue to enhance our current specialized incubators, QBIC Tourism and QBIC Digital and Beyond. We always look to expand and add to our scope, and are currently looking into more specific sectors that we could create specialized incubators for. We will look out for opportunities that will help us narrow down the sectors that we would like to focus on. We will continue to analyze the market in order to predict future trends and create opportunities for startups in those sectors. We are also currently working with universities in Qatar for R&amp;D purposes. Moreover, we will continue hosting our speaker series, which takes place every few months with seasoned industry professionals who share their expertise and knowledge with our entrepreneurs. And finally, we urge our entrepreneurs to evaluate our programs and give us feedback on how they have benefited and what more we can do. We will continue to measure, learn, and improve all we have to offer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the substantial differences between the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2011-2016 and the NDS 2017-2022?</h4><p>The NDS 2017-2022 includes new priorities and faces different challenges, most notably in light of lower energy prices. However, it coincides with conditions more appropriate than the previous ones in terms of capacities, acquired expertise, and learned lessons. In addition, there is an obvious commitment of the State of Qatar to invest in these conditions positively via intensifying efforts to confront the challenges, in conformity with HH the Amir's Advisory Council Speech last November 2016. The NDS 2017-2022 will be less in size but more focused in terms of the number of results and goals planned to be implemented than the first NDS 2011-2016. Overall, there will be a focus on the most pressing and vital objectives in the next period.</p><h4>What is MDPS' role in providing data on which future 2022 FIFA World Cup plans are based?</h4><p>The State of Qatar implements multiple infrastructure-related projects in preparation to the host many regional and international events, most notably the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Consequently, the statistical figures provided by the MDPS via censuses, surveys, and administrative registers are considered instrumental in the conduct and implementation of the plans of these development projects. It is noteworthy that there is ongoing cooperation between the MDPS and the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy via a technical team that provides data on the population, demographic characteristics, and residences, especially the places where the 2022 FIFA World Cup stadiums and public facilities are located. In addition, there is data on the number of hotels and residential units, including their capacity. The technical team tackles a set of surveys and studies, which the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy intends to implement in terms of tickets and housing prices.</p><h4>What types of statistics are more sought after by businessmen and investors in Qatar?</h4><p>The stimulus of the private sector and its competitiveness require development data that stand as a guide for investors to provide logistical needs and catalytic legislation, simplify procedures, and grant further pieces of land. The supply of data facilitates the private sector's and investors' access to the most productive sectors, such as the food industry, tourism, IT and knowledge, renewables, and culture and sport facilities management. It also helps to identify private-sector controlling mechanisms, mainly its quality services and products in respect of government projects. In this regard, the MDPS conducts a quarterly survey called the Business Confidence Index, in which it provides significant data and indicators on the government and private sectors in terms of production and exportation and the difficulties they confront. The survey findings, released within the areas of “Development Indicators" and “Confidence Indicators," are published on our website.</p><h4>What is the MDPS' initial plan for the census in 2020?</h4><p>The MDPS developed an initial plan to conduct an online census in 2020, which will substantially reduce the cost of such projects. As a result, fieldwork that needs over 3,500 staff will be spared. Furthermore, data will be obtained from administrative registers available in the different government bodies and address directories. These registers will be supported by data available from sub-registers. The census preparation phase started by discussing the census-related concepts and statistical evidence, which focused on the United Nations Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses. The GCC Statistical Center organized this panel discussion to prepare for the implementation of the unified census registration project at GCC level in 2020. The second phase, which will be implemented in 2017, features field visits to data providers and access to administrative registers in order to ascertain their suitability for census purposes. The third phase, which will be carried out in 2018, includes the conduct of an all-embracing assessment of quality and comprehensiveness of data to detect the register's flaws, and develop appropriate solutions accordingly by relying on the successful practices in this domain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Etmar evolve as a pioneer company in terms of integrating the value-added side of dates?</h4><p>Etmar Dates Est. was established in 1999, following my purchase of Etmar Est., I start a new era to the company by diversifying the business of the company and focused on different sectors. We do not sell dates locally only, but we started approaching overseas market. Locally, we concentrated on date's unique backing using our specialized in-house designers until we have been ranked as the best dates company in Saudi Arabia for packing either in wooden or carton boxes. Our clients mostly are corporation but include government and semi-governmental organizations, all Saudi embassies and consulates around the world, banks, mega companies, airlines, insurance companies, telecom companies, and luxury hotels. We are not a wholesale provider, to the point where we tailor a specific customers packing regardless of the dates types. We also work closely with our clients to tailor their specific gifts with a unique packing with dates as the national treasure rather than sending plain dates only. Most of our five-star hotels are using our products in their lobbies as the local tradition also in the hotel's rooms along with encouraging the chefs to use our dates in their meals, especially within their deserts. We are so proud that we encourage the big hospitals such as the biggest local hospital Sulaiman Al-Habib hospital (six hospitals within KSA and Dubai) to use our products in the lab and in the meals for their patients. Last year, McDonalds with their very restrictive rules, we were able to gain and win their trust to use our dates.</p><h4>Do you hope that going forward you can expand on the commercial side?</h4><p>Further to our plans on diversifying and expansion of our business, on the domestic strategy, we have startedto expand in the wholesale sector through the mega hypermarkets and supermarkets stores, which is one of our goals for 2017. We are working now with specific government organizations to capitalize on marketing the dates as number one tradition products in Saudi Arabia both locally and further abroadfor exporting purposes. Nowadays, the Saudi Business Council with the US, Turkey, and Russia will work together to plan &amp; strategize the exports plans. We started approaching the concept to merge the gifts with dates especially with the VIP customers. For international strategies we have started to join and support the Ministry of Trade and Saudi Export Development Authority on all the business trips to market the Saudi Arabia Industries in our case, part of which on last year we visited more than 10 countries: Russia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey which helped in securing several deals with some of these countries to import dates along with strategizing with our customers especially Europe on the best way to market the dates as a unique product.Furthermore, we are on the final stage to sign an agreement with a US partner we are also going to sign a contract to start a branch in Texas with a new company called Saudi Dates, which we have just established. All the exports are going to be under the name Saudi Dates.</p><h4>What are your main export markets?</h4><p>The GCC and also soon we are going to finalize our branch with our partner in the US. We have a negotiation now with Spain, Italy, and Germany in Turkey as well to distribute dates in a unique way out of the traditional methodology. Recently we have being approached by some clients asking us for huge quantities of dates, but they do not care about quality as they only focus on price which we did refuse since this is not our target as we are conservative about Saudi dates as a brand to protect the image of Saudi Arabia quality and moreover our name (Etmar and Saudi Dates Co.) in the market. Saudi Arabia has more than 400 kinds of dates across the region, and according to the Saudi Arabia 2030 Vision, the government and officials here are organizing the dates distributions and planting certain kinds within the kingdom for each region for control and quality purposes.  </p><h4>Are you optimistic about 2017 and beyond?</h4><p>When it comes to our business, we are positive about 2017. Especially during Ramadan either locally or internationally,we have a lot of deals. Meanwhile, we are further looking forward inworking with a potential partners worldwide with partners who appreciates the date business. We try our best to educateour partners before we sign any Contract or Agreement with them especially Western Europe and the US. We appreciate the continuous assistance from the US-Saudi Business Council in finding partners and distributers within the US and further educate us in the regulations to export dates there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since the establishment of Al Sulaiti Law Firm in 2002, what developments made you a major player in the local market?</h4><p>Throughout these years, many important factors contributed to the development of the law firm, one of them is finding the right team with enthusiasm, commitment and passion for the field. Our firm includes lawyers from five countries, including Egypt, France, Italy, and the US. Our educational and experiential diversity allows us to quickly bridge the gap between our clients' legal traditions and the rules and procedures of Qatar. Moreover, we are able to work comfortably with contracts governed by foreign law. The cultural aspect of our diversity is distinctly important. Our foreign clients often arrive in Qatar with a time-is-money mentality. They are often best served by, and most comfortable working with, a lawyer who shares their predisposition. Upgrading the tools we use to execute the job, internal organization systems and programs used by other leading law firm's help with the organizational structure of the firm that enables us to deliver the best services to our clients. At the end of every term, we come together as one team and critically analyze our development strategies, this is essential to our improvement process. Working as a team makes this process easier as we are able to assess different methods, new ideas and approaches we can learn to take, and new challenges we can begin to tackle as one team.</p><h4>What is Al Sulaiti's approach in maintaining strong and firm relation with its clients?</h4><p>Understanding our clients' needs and making them our own is a major part of our lawyer-client relationship. Each case is dealt with in the utmost detail and delicacy; making the case our own is an essential attribute to succeed in pleasing the client. Communication is the core of a strong lawyer-client relationship; it enables the lawyer to understand the client's business, which is the key to our success. Being involved in the business as if we are a member of the team enables us to deliver the best legal services. Exceeding your client's expectations by over delivering  is a strategy that works better than over promising and not fulfilling the client's needs; presenting your clients with the best services brings back more clients.</p><h4>How do you assess the importance of being the first Qatari Law firm to pledge to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)?</h4><p>All organizations around the world are accountable to run a responsible and sustainable business for the benefit of our organizations, people, community, and the world as a whole. A law firm is a legal service provider, and to provide the best services, we must have a clear understanding of the clients' needs, the community we live in, and our pledge and respect for the law. In the same way in which the law and our community have been a great benefit to us, we must give back to these core pillars of society by making it our responsibility to be more involved in the promotion of worthy change through our corporate responsibility policy. Our corporate responsibility not only includes the UNGC's 10 principles, but also upholds our devotion to making the Qatar National Vision 2030 possible. With Qatar being an ever-evolving landscape, we pride ourselves in being involved and watching all that was just a plan become a reality. The honorable State has been through remarkable positive change and development. Our vision makes it our responsibility not only as a business, but also empowers us to be a responsible business that gives back to the community, education, and the environment.</p><h4>What are your aspirations for Qatar in 2017?</h4><p>Al Sulaiti Law Firm is proud to support the Qatari vision for 2030. We have our role in this vision by supporting investment institutions and companies through providing them the best legal services and taking our corporate responsibility initiative seriously, and by supporting the environmental, educational, and humanitarian aspects of the vision. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the role of family-owned businesses like yours in the diversification of the Qatari economy?</h4><p>Qatar has enjoyed rapid success, and the role of the family in Qatari business is paramount to this success. We have weathered the storm of globalization and commercialization of business by returning to our roots in developing a business through our family. The company was created and handed down to my brothers, and I am sure we will continue the tradition by handing over the business to our sons. The ability to have this fresh generation of minds has only helped to benefit the business while ensuring the success of our family and strengthening our family bond. The diversification of the Qatari economy has been rapid and heavily influenced by external involvement, so to be able to oversee a cyclical business evolution from a family perspective is something that we cherish and is also a good way to support young people.</p><h4>In a context of low oil prices, how have you shifted your focus to industrial areas other than gas?</h4><p>Low oil prices have had devastating effects throughout the global industry, but everyone must adjust, not just in Qatar. We have spent a greater deal of time observing rather than reacting immediately. Knowledge is the key to dealing with such changes, and in order to adapt, we need to first understand what is going on, what has been successful, and what has failed to challenge the new economy. We have had to change how we integrate new business, invest, and handle our internal processes to cope with the low gas prices. But we also have not stopped advancing our business into other areas, which are experiencing continued growth. The oil and gas industry is still lucrative even with current oil prices; we just have to accept low prices as the reality and adapt to what we have.</p><h4>How are you contributing to the expansion of F&amp;B and hospitality offerings within the country?</h4><p>We are continuously looking for new and fresh concepts to bring to Qatar. When tourists come to Qatar they are not only looking for some of the incredible hospitality offerings we have, but they also enjoy seeing some familiar brands. The ability to integrate new concepts into Qatar while driving Qatari culture has been shown in some of the menus and concepts that provide Arabic fusion dishes. This has been incredibly popular, and we work diligently with global brands to create fresh dishes that have geographical tastes.</p><h4>What are your ambitions in the real estate division to continue growing your portfolio within Qatar and internationally?</h4><p>Internationally, London is a major interest to our organization. The British market continues to grow and offer opportunities that we want to continue to capitalize on. Qataris find London very appealing not only for business but also for social activities. Therefore, bringing businesses to this location will provide us with an immediate clientele. We are an organization that prides itself on providing the highest quality of service to our clients. In order to be competitive and surpass our competition we have focused on the smallest details, such as our general services, preventative and corrective maintenance, and our amenities such as a world-class pool, gym, tennis court, basketball court, 24-hour security, and children's play area.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>Multiple-year planning is essential to our business, so we are not just planning for the year ahead. The diversification of our business will continue to be a key movement in the organization as we look at alternative and non-traditional verticals such as education and community mall offerings. We want to continue to build our brand in line with Qatar National Vision 2030 and position ourselves as a prominent provider of high-quality services in Qatar and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the positive achievements of the QBA?</h4><p>The main achievement of QBA is creating a platform or think tank with the aim of exchanging ideas and raising suggestions between Qatari businessmen and entrepreneurs. We act unitedly for the benefit of developing the private sector's role in the economy and for further contributing to the growth of Qatar's economy, bridging business relations between Qatari businessmen and their counterparts internationally. We partner with similar business associations and chambers of commerce worldwide and open new markets for Qatari investors by highlighting business trends and opportunities abroad. At the same time, we receive foreign business delegations to showcase the opportunities which Doha offer. We have hosted more than 750 delegations and organized and participated in over 200 conferences so far.</p><h4>What structural reforms does QBA see as necessary for Qatar to continue to grow?</h4><p>We receive support from the Ministry of Economy and Commerce and the Prime Minister to encourage the role of the private sector in Qatar. This happens on many levels, including through regular meetings with business representatives that enable them to discuss and listen to the needs and requirements of private companies and what can be done to enhance the contribution of the private sector in the economy. Reforms and adjustments are made continuously, and we are hoping that within a few years Qatar will be a role model for economic and structural development.</p><h4>How have Al Faisal's investments in education improved the group's operations?</h4><p>As we expanded our operations across different sectors, education was one of them. We established the Gulf English School and Stenden University Qatar, in addition to an agreement with DePaul University to introduce the MBA program in Qatar. We aim to continue to be an active contributor toward the enhancement of the education system in Qatar, partnering with renowned institutions that can potentially add value to the education sector.</p><h4>What role does Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum have in promoting Qatar's national heritage?</h4><p>The museum is my hobby and passion. Before opening it to the public, I used to have personal collections displayed at my guests meeting hall. We started receiving many enquiries about the collection and requests to see the artifacts, primarily from highly informed enthusiasts both from Qatar and around the world. I, therefore, felt an obligation to make access to my collection more widely available and decided to open it to the public. The main museum opened in 1998, aiming to preserve and display different collections of art and heritage artifacts from around the world. Since then, it has continuously expanded, offering dedicated research and education facilities in addition to the artifacts. The museum has partnerships with many educational institutions, including the University of London for restoration work on some of the collection.</p><h4>What are your expectations surrounding the FIFA World Cup 2022?</h4><p>I am confident Qatar will host a superb World Cup. I also believe that after the event, Qatar will witness further development and prosperity. For the time being, we are all working to fulfill the requirements related to the infrastructure development plan and World Cup associated projects. However, after 2022 the country will benefit from all this investment and effort, the legacy of which will be a sophisticated and innovative platform that will enable us to take on new, exciting challenges. We will have advanced infrastructure, the private sector will be stronger and more developed, and there will be more qualified Qatari graduates who will have benefited from the excellent education system and will be looking to apply their knowledge and aspirations to lead the country forward. When it comes to our business, I am optimistic and excited to continue with our journey. We have several projects in the pipeline, and I look forward to all the challenges and achievements as we bring them to fruition in the year ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In Qatar National Vision 2030 (QNV2030), more emphasis is being placed on generating revenue from the non-oil and gas sectors. What impact will this have on future business opportunities for the Alfardan Group?</h4><p>Alfardan Group has always been committed to supporting the initiatives of the government and is dedicated to developing business strategies that complement the wise leadership of HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar. QNV2030 is one such example. It increasingly emphasizes the importance of cultivating the non-hydrocarbon sector to achieve a more diversified post-oil economy. As one of the oldest businesses in the country, much of our success is driven by our ability to adapt to growing trends within the local business landscape and to participate in the creation of new markets. From our humble beginnings in the pearling industry, which led to the establishment of Alfardan Jewellery, we have expanded to become the premiere choice in various industry verticals including the automotive, jewellery, exchange, property development, and hospitality industries, as well as marine services and investment markets. Diversification has always defined Alfardan Group as we continue to expand into new fields and create new benchmarks of excellence in that arena.</p><h4>How is Alfardan Properties integrating smart property developments and solutions in order to advance Doha as a smart city?</h4><p>Alfardan Properties has always been eager to adopt emerging technologies that enhance services and promote the safety, security, and overall wellbeing of tenants. We aim to transform and exceed our clients' expectations, as well as support the initiatives of the government to turn Doha into a premiere smart city. We continuously look for ways to utilize sophisticated technology to enhance our facilities based on our customers' unique needs and tastes. We are proud to say our dedication has borne fruit, as Alfardan Properties was named Smart Property Developer of the Year at the fourth Arab Future Cities Summit Qatar, held under the patronage of the Ministry of Municipality and Urban Planning. At the summit, we had a representative speak about Smart Living Solutions, to share our own experience in delivering comprehensive solutions and services as well as the tools and platforms that we utilize to remain effective while meeting our sustainability goals in support of the key indicators set by QNV2030.</p><h4>Are there any particular sectors in which Alfardan is looking to expand into or initiate development, either within Qatar or internationally?</h4><p>Alfardan Group thrives to expand and innovate within the various sectors it operates in, both in the region and beyond. In addition, Alfardan Trading Limited and Alfardan Holding are also operating in foreign markets with many strategic interests in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Turkey. We have many projects on the horizon and are eager to bring our luxury brand and quality products and services to a wider network, while remaining true to our heritage and values. Our first project outside of Qatar, Fina'a Alazaibah in Oman, has received strong and positive feedback and fueled our relentless drive to constantly diversify our business and expand interests in key industries and markets.</p><h4>What are some of your main targets for the company over the next 12 months?</h4><p>In the coming months as well as in the following years, we will continuously espouse our values of premium quality products and services to our rapidly expanding markets in various industries. We will maintain the spirit of innovation that has brought us our success and will look to venture into new markets in an effort to engage with new buyers from various demographics. We will also continue to actively participate in helping the country meet its environmental and sustainable needs by creating new products to that end. Our support for the government's long-term socio-economic programs and the vision of our wise leaders remains unwavering. We will demonstrate this commitment by steadily pursuing the best practices in the local, regional, and global landscapes to help sustain the flourishing economy of Qatar. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sez-for-efficiency]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of your two upcoming projects, Ras Bufontas and Um Alhoul, and what sectors do you target to develop within these SEZs?</h4><p>Having broken ground in 2015, we are currently working on the infrastructure and the first development phase of both zones to be completed by 2Q2018. Ras Bufontas is situated adjacent to Hamad International Airport, which is an ideal location for businesses requiring international connectivity. On the other side, Um Alhoul is adjacent to Hamad Port, which provides the perfect platform for companies specializing in the likes of petrochemicals, building materials, metals, food processing marine industry, and auto machinery, to reach the rest of the world by sea, with a central industrialized canal making for easy access to the waterfront.</p><h4>Manateq offers 100% ownership in Ras Bufontas. How do you assess the impact of this decision on the attraction of FDI into the logistics sector, and what are your plans to expand the hospitality offer within the zone?</h4><p>With the 100% ownership we are able to offer, along with the additional benefit of a dedicated personal point of contact to facilitate the registration and licensing, it makes investing much easier and more attractive. The strategic location of Ras Bufontas and the facilities' fully integrated services enable logistics companies to come in and set up their base adjacent to the airport, which reduces their transport times and costs. With public spaces and land for worker accommodation, complemented by hotels, hotel apartments, versatile office, showrooms, retail space, and residential units, which are all located by the waterfront, the zone represents a chance for investors to create a fully functional headquarters with first-class global connectivity.</p><h4>What is your strategy to turn Mesaieed Industrial Zone into the “Made in Qatar“ hub and promote the local manufacturing industry?</h4><p>There are more than 200 existing projects within Mesaieed Industrial Zone, which significantly contributes to the growth of the manufacturing industry in Qatar. Enveloping all of these projects in Mesaieed, including heavy and light industries, concrete, and storage facilities for raw materials, demonstrates the crucial role Mesaieed plays in not only promoting local industry but leveraging that position to greatly impact the continued diversification of Qatar's economy and evolution of the country into a regional hub for industrial activity and fully integrated services, keeping in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>How do you assess Qatar's position as a regional logistics hub?</h4><p>Our four logistics parks aim to create a modern environment suitable for supply and storage services, and to provide investment opportunities that will add real value to the local economy. Manateq's logistic parks are all in prime locations, with access to integrated water, electricity, and road networks, providing attractive long-term rent and lease arrangements. Manateq also sponsors four warehousing parks to complement its logistics activities, which were awarded to developers such as Barwa, which will oversee the management and operations under a BOT process for 25 years. Investors are able to see the existing infrastructure, and with the enhanced world-class transport links through increased capacity at Hamad International Airport and Hamad Port, Qatar's reputation as key player in logistics is growing rapidly.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Manateq's mission is to create a world-class business environment that enables domestic and foreign investors to deliver value-added products and services to local, regional, and international markets, and to also help drive diversification in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. We will continue to build on our expertise and market knowledge. This will help us strengthen our position as the market leader providing fully integrated investment solutions as we strive to highlight why investing in Qatar will help businesses grow and demonstrate the key contribution we are making toward the diversification of the economy. Manateq will facilitate additional commercial investment opportunities in Ras Bufontas Special Economic Zone for investors to develop retail outlets, residences, showrooms, and office space. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of Qatar Chamber's contribution to the development of the private sector?</h4><p>Our mission is to represent and defend the Qatari private sector's interests as well as to promote its activities at the local, regional, and international levels. The main functions of the chamber in the Qatari economy are to facilitate trade relations on the national and international level, attend and organize trade fairs and exhibitions, and provide contacts for legal and legislative support, among others. Besides its own roles, the Qatar Chamber is responsible for bringing in new opportunities and developing the export capacity of its members. We have to help our members solve their problems by contacting them with bodies that can find suitable solutions for obstacles while doing business. Our members also commend us for having a broad vision and being an up-to-date organization, capable of providing opportunities for its members on a global scale, and as a leading organization of the country. To achieve our goals, we are keen to build strong relations and partnerships with all authorities concerned and with our regional and international partners. Additionally, we host meetings and conferences between foreign trade delegations and Qatari businessmen about business and investment opportunities available for both sides. The chamber's contribution to the development and promotion of local private sector is a multi-faceted strategy that is based on the pillars of Qatar's National Vision 2030.</p><h4>What international activities has the chamber organized to promote Qatari businesses overseas and enhance their trade with foreign partners?</h4><p>The chamber is interested in building positive relations with all relevant private-sector bodies, whether inside or outside Qatar, in order to promote the Qatari private sector worldwide. International Chamber of Commerce Qatar is doing its best to bridge the Qatari private sector with its global counterparts. In addition, the chamber always participates in international business and investment conferences to enable Qatari businesses to display their potential, such as the Qatar-UK Business Forum, Qatar-German Economic Forum, and so on. These activities open new markets to local products and enhance their competitiveness in international markets, all while promoting Qatari trade and investments in these countries.</p><h4>Which sectors offer the most potential to sustain Qatar's economic growth in the foreseeable future?</h4><p>As part of Qatar's economic diversification strategy, there are a number of priority sectors that we focus on to attract investments. The high-value sectors that are expected to witness robust growth and provide lucrative investment opportunities include education and health, services, tourism, and industry in addition to IT, technology, and other knowledge-intensive sectors. The trade sector will also continue to be buoyant, driving growth in Qatar's economy. I am fully confident that Qatar is on the right path in achieving its National Vision 2030, which is based on economic, social, environmental, and human capital development. Qatar has around USD150 billion in investments planned to deliver its 2030 National Vision and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This is one of the most ambitious investment programs in the world. Large-scale infrastructure projects include Lusail City, the Doha Metro system, the New Port Project, and major road projects. Steady, state-centric development and economic diversification are key priorities of the country's economic development plan, and this has been reflected in many recent legal reforms and business promotion initiatives launched in the state. The Qatari government has made considerable efforts to reduce the reliance of Qatar on revenue generated from the oil and gas sector. It has invested and has encouraged increased private and foreign investment in non-energy sectors such as financial services, health, education, sport, and tourism.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>We constantly seek to innovate and run initiatives that will support relations and promote common interests. We will intensively work to change our online services. We are also preparing for a new edition of “Made in Qatar Exhibition“ in a foreign country and the third edition of “Made in China Exhibition“ in Doha. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Qatar's economic growth is projected to reach 3.4% in 2017. However, the IMF warns that ongoing public investments could overheat the economy in near term and the prospects of a further rise in US interest rates may “complicate“ efforts to bolster real economic growth. What are the main challenges the Qatari economy may face in 2017?</h4><p>In addition to spillovers from tightening monetary conditions in the US and other major economies, the rising global and regional uncertainties fueled by geopolitical and security concerns and recent political developments around the world are the most prominent challenges in 2017. These global uncertainties may continue to curb investors' appetites and put additional pressure on developmental policies in many countries, particularly MENA countries. However, I think Qatar's prudent monetary and fiscal policies enable the country to contain the repercussions of such conditions.</p><h4>As indicated by the country's non-oil growth indicators, Qatar's efforts to diversify its revenue sources away from a relaince on hydrocarbons are gaining pace. However, we have seen the trade surplus shrink during 2016, attributed to low oil and gas prices. How is the Government of Qatar working to broaden the economic base of exports to balance its trade and support economic diversification?</h4><p>Qatar's trade balance has been affected in the last couple of years due to fluctuations in energy prices and rising imports of raw materials used in our ongoing infrastructure projects. This trend, however, is also influenced by global issues. Fueled by poor economic performance and low levels of investment, global trade growth has been slowing since 2012 and trade balances in many countries around the world have deteriorated. These developments have not only challenged resource-exporting countries but also those with less reliance on raw exports although perhaps to a lesser extent. These developments do however underline the importance of Qatar's long-term vision of diversification, formulated before the down surge in energy markets. To assure the achievement of this diversification strategy, Qatar has been working hard on developing a wide range of enablers and rationalizing its investment environment so as to promote investments in different types of services and manufacturing industries. Several business-related regulations were optimized to better address the interest of all stakeholders, and a considerable improvement in the capacity and quality of infrastructure has been achieved over the past years. Qatar now has well-designed ports with considerably high capacity; a new state-of-the-art airport; several competitive logistics areas that will start functioning and supporting a wide range of businesses in the near future; and many other initiatives. These new facilities will bring considerable improvements in efficiency and competitiveness to domestic industries. Qatar's economic diversification is benefiting from an improved business environment. Service activities have been strongly supporting our external balance with increasing volumes and values of exports. In just five years, services exports increased five-fold, from USD3 billion in 2011 to USD15 billion, amounting to about 16.3% of Qatar's total exports, compared to 3.9% in 2010. We believe that with our commitment to continue these business environment improvements, supported by further enhancement of our infrastructure and services, our exports basket will grow further in size and varieties, and further enhance the diversification position of Qatar. Qatar has also recently developed the single window project for investor services, which represents one of the most important initiatives designed to develop the business environment, boost the role of the private sector, and encourage domestic and foreign investments in sectors that add value to the national economy, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>Many of our interviewees have stressed the importance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to boost investment and increase the involvement of the private sector in the national economy. What initiatives will the Government of Qatar introduce to ease public-private cooperation in funding key national projects?</h4><p>The Government of Qatar strongly believes in the importance of the private sector and the vital role it plays in our economy. While projects and regulatory reforms are intended to promote private investments in all sectors, there are a few activities that cannot be efficiently performed solely by either the government or the private sector, but rather require mutual cooperation from both sides through PPP arrangements. PPP arrangements are designed to build on the strengths of both sides to deliver efficient and competitive services. In this regard, we are working hard at developing a solid and efficient legal framework for PPP projects, which is widely recognized as a cornerstone of successful partnerships. A new PPP draft law is almost complete and the work on developing the necessary bylaws is progressing at a fast pace. Parallel to this, we are working with several line Ministries and stakeholders to identify the potential domain for PPP projects. As an initial phase, we have identified, together with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, a first batch of schools to be developed through PPP build and lease arrangements. A similar framework has been also considered for hospitals and health facilities, in cooperation with the Ministry of Public Health, to meet the increasing demands on health services. Several projects from other sectors shall be joining the list soon and possibly on a larger scale and employing different modes of PPP arrangements.</p><h4>Qatar's cabinet has approved a draft law that will allow foreign investors to provide up to 100% of the capital for a project in any sector, provided they have a Qatari services agent. How do you assess the value of this and other initiatives which the Government of Qatar is introducing to drive foreign investment?</h4><p>I think the new draft law came at the right time to help boost the pace of development of Qatar's economy. Consideration of regulatory reforms is a continuous process in order to accommodate developmental needs and the rise in potential opportunities for foreign investors. Qatar's government is committed to continuously improving the business environment and to ensuring that huge infrastructure capabilities are adequately utilized through wider participation from the domestic and foreign private sector. Foreign investment, in particular, doesn't only inject new capital and technology into the economy, hence driving economic growth, but it also strengthens the connection with international markets and enhances export opportunities.</p><h4>The Government of Qatar has repeatedly highlighted the role of SMEs in the economic development of the country as a model for future global companies and a catalyst for GDP growth. How is the State modernizing its legislations and initiatives to protect and develop such enterprises, and increase its contribution to the GDP?</h4><p>We strongly believe in the importance and potential of SMEs in supporting economic development and achieving more inclusive growth. The Ministry took several steps toward modernizing the regulatory framework to enhance the development of new and existing businesses. We have revised several rules and policies that are perceived as cumbersome and also took several measures to lower the costs of businesses including the rental costs. The upcoming logistic and economic areas will also provide considerable space for SMEs.</p><h4>Qatar expects to post a budget deficit of USD7.8 billion in 2017. What is your economic outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Given the healthy outlook for Qatar's long-term fiscal position, such a relatively small deficit should not be seen as a major source of concern. It is worth mentioning in this context however, that fiscal deficits arising from developmental expenditures should not be treated the same as those fueled by rising current expenditures, since the former is quite superior because it enhances the country's medium and long term growth capacity. I think Qatar's fiscal position will be considerably relaxed in the medium term, once major developmental projects are finalized and the country starts to benefit from the potential growth of different activities. I am very confident that our economy is on the right track. Fundamental and emerging aspects on the domestic and external fronts suggest that Qatar economy will be in a better shape this year. With an improving global energy market outlook and Qatar's additional export capacity through the newly developed Barzan gas project, fiscal concerns will further relax, hence providing a better environment for economic growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company grown to its current position and where does most of your revenue come from today?</h4><p>One major advantage we've enjoyed is being first to market. As a company, SBM can trace its roots right back to when IBM secured a foothold in the Kingdom in the late 1940s, by way of Saudi Aramco. After having been established to become IBM's local representative, SBM continued with the same commitment to excellence and innovation that made IBM a household name. SBM has always strived to provide the latest, most advanced, state-of-the-art computing technologies and solutions, consistently delivering a positive return on investment for its corporate and government clients. Now, the company is more focused than ever on providing the most customer-centric, innovative services of the highest quality. SBM is also Cisco's Gold and Largest Partner in KSA, and a Gold Partner of SAP. Our Lines of Business cover all aspects of the ICT industry thus more expertise and end-to-end solutions are available at our client's disposal. Systems and Software (S&amp;SS) within SBM is our core business and has exclusivity on distributing many of IBM products and provides a comprehensive set of skills and capabilities to assist customers with the full range of OEM, IBM Software, and IBM Hardware Product Support needs. Network Solutions and Services (NSS) is a main pillar in SBM's business in Saudi Arabia. From infrastructure, network solutions, data centers, AV, security, and more, NSS develops end-to-end solutions “design-implement-operate“ to help customers move to the latest state-of-the-art technologies. The Integrated Technology Services (ITS) provides services to enable, integrate, optimize and manage 'On Demand' business infrastructures, increasing IT business value for customers. (ITS) also includes highly skilled engineers that handle the maintenance and support for IBM Hardware and Software. The Professional Services (PS) offers high-quality advisory, consultancy, and system implementation services across the entire spectrum of information technology domains, especially in ERP and CRM, through partnerships with major corporations that specialize in these fields, such as SAP and Oracle. SBM installed Blue Gene, the world's most powerful supercomputer, for King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and recently built the most advanced Data Centers (Tier IV) designed to host the most mission-critical computer systems for (RIC) in two locations and another Tier IV Data Center for the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA). And this is how we always distinguish ourselves in the market. Merely offering a range of products just won't do, companies need to provide added value services that maximize the value of the products they sell and establish long term partnerships with clients. SBM is on partnerships with some multinational corporations, and has been even contracted to do consultation for them. Take our partnership with Mobily as an example. Soon after the telecommunications giant was established in 2005, SBM was instrumental in setting up Mobily's operations, deploying and integrating ERP, CRM, and billing systems. Within the first six months of its existence, the company's services were up and running, with the flexibility and constant innovation to cope with any future changes built right in.</p><h4>How does business from the government sector factor into your overall portfolio?</h4><p>On the government side, as internet usage exploded compared to its modest adoption in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, and online communication became a way of life, and as the Saudi society becomes ever younger and more tech-savvy, the Saudi Government realized early on that a multitude of services will need to be streamlined across the board, for a paperless environment between the client and government agency. Citizens and residents no longer had to be at a physical office and talk to an actual government officer to get their paperwork done. And that's where we come in. SBM is the go-to company to help the government implement the vast network and machine infrastructure needed to ensure that citizens and residents are able to process all of their government-related affairs from the luxury and convenience of their homes, smartphone in hand. SBM is also proud of its contribution to the financial and banking sector in the Kingdom, nonetheless, applications and systems that impacted and facilitated our lives like SADAD and SPAN. Given the nature of government work, the infrastructure needs to be implemented first before any applications can be deployed. In some cases, as SBM engages with a government agency to bring it up to date, we find that they either have weak infrastructure, wrong implementation of applications or lack of integration. SBM's role here is to make a full case assessment and provide the proper solutions and support. For example, our infrastructure mission with the Saudi Ministry of Justice was successful. SBM integrated all courts around the Kingdom into one, single network. This being the government, some certain challenges were expected, but we eventually got the project signed off. We introduced new technologies that made it easy for plaintiffs and court witnesses to submit depositions and testimonies remotely, without the need to be physically present at court — an especially vital convenience, given the Kingdom's sheer vastness, the costs involved in traveling around the country, and the extensive timeframes of the litigation process. Recently, we've worked on major projects that are part of CDSI for the General Authority for Statistics (GAStat), which is a national initiative that aims to provide statistical services and indicators in an innovative, comprehensive, and real-time way. It saves a lot of time and effort, and works as a national bank of statistical information that will be accessible and valuable to decision-makers and planners, in line with the Kingdom Vision 2030. SBM was also one of the major IT companies that worked on the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology (Etidal) recently inaugurated by Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdulaziz and US President Donald Trump.</p><h4>Is government business a key part of your growth plan in coming years?</h4><p>The formidable goals and intense timeframes of Vision 2030 necessitate that the government be involved in private business at various levels. One form of such involvement is privatization, examples of which are the aviation and health care sectors, where the government is establishing majority- or fully-owned holding companies to run service-based government institutions—such as airports and hospitals—as if they were business enterprises. And this is exactly why the answer to your question is a definitive yes! The vigor that is expected to be generated by new competition between public and private sector, and the demand for infrastructures and technologies that will result, surely will generate endless opportunities for SBM. We expect to be involved in every sector, from public services to education and defense.</p><h4>The government's plan to introduce radical reforms like the NTP calls for a great deal of technology. Will this trend boost the need for your services and hardware?</h4><p>Right now, the government is concentrating on security. We work with some ministries and other government agencies to prevent any possible cyberattacks. We have our own specialized team, among whom are certified hackers who sign certain contracts to find holes that need to be plugged.</p><h4>What are the key drivers for growth and what are your expectations for business in the coming 12 months?</h4><p>Cybersecurity, analytics, mobility, IoT, and cloud computing are expected to be key areas of growth in the short and medium terms. Many applications still need to be developed, as smartphones are no longer just a display of status and wealth. They have become essential necessities that virtually no one can do without, and people should—or even expect—to be able to do everything with their mobiles now. Not only the government, but many enterprises, are basing the entire scope of their services on mobile platforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Portugal has strong economic and cultural ties with Qatar. What is your assessment of the historic relationship between the two countries?</h4><p>Our political and diplomatic relations have traditionally been good. A few years ago, diplomatic relations between the two countries were upgraded by the reciprocal opening of respective embassies in both capitals. However, there is still room for improvement at the economic and cultural levels. Our aim is to keep reinforcing these relations, and this is a common goal. My visit and the visit of His Highness the Emir of Qatar to Portugal in July will certainly contribute to reinforcing our bilateral ties, and I am certain other positive impacts will result from the launching of direct flights between our capitals, which Qatar Airways has announced.</p><h4>As both sides express their willingness to boost trade, what are the potential areas of cooperation to be explored between Portugal and Qatar?</h4><p>In the economic area, the greatest potential for improvement lies in trade and investment. Portugal's economy is open, our conditions to attract foreign investment are competitive, and we not only offer a market of 10 million people, but also access to the largest market in the world, the European Union. Furthermore, we are ready to cooperate with Qatar in regions such as Brazil and the Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa, with which we have long historic ties and a consolidated economic presence and deep knowledge.</p><h4>Portugal almost doubled the value of its exports to Qatar in the first half of 2016 compared to the same period last year. What opportunities do you foresee for Portuguese companies in Qatar?</h4><p>In 2016, bilateral trade was only USD46 million, which represented an increase of about 15% compared to 2015. Portuguese exports of goods to Qatar increased 61% in 2016 and increased by almost 31% in the first three months of 2017. This reveals the interest of Portuguese companies in this market. In 2015, almost 250 Portuguese companies exported to Qatar. Therefore, we see a great deal of opportunities in Qatar.</p><h4>What makes Portugal an excellent opportunity for Qatari investors and what sectors are ripe for investment?</h4><p>Despite the good political relationship, the economic relations between the two countries are almost incipient. We have in place a set of institutional agreements that provide the framework for private companies to do business. However, we need to stimulate them, as there are many mutually beneficial opportunities to explore. Qatar may take advantage of the Portuguese experience in areas in which Portugal has made large investments in the recent past, such as renewable energies, construction, infrastructures, health, and environmental industries related to water, sewage, and garbage collection. Qatari investors have important stakes in EDP and Vinci Portugal, and there is a recent case of an important Qatari investment in the Portuguese touristic sector. Besides tourism, many opportunities exist, for instance, in real estate investment and urban renewal and development. Qatar may also find it interesting to consider Portugal as a platform to address markets in Europe, Latin America, or Africa. There is definitely room for many mutually beneficial partnerships between Portuguese and Qatari companies to explore business opportunities that contribute to diversify the Qatari economy. The Portuguese government is also keen to help in that effort by exchanging experiences with Qatari authorities in areas such as start-up policy, public administration modernization, or innovation policy. Lisbon has hosted last year and will host in the coming years the Web Summit, Europe's largest tech event. We expect more than 60,000 participants in November, hopefully also from Qatar.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Qatar's regional and international role in the coming years?</h4><p>Qatar has played an important role in the development and stabilization of the Gulf and the entire region. We are certain that role will continue and that Qatar will reinforce its important role worldwide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After your visit to Doha last February, how do you assess the overall health of the bilateral relationship between Turkey and Qatar?</h4><p>The Republic of Turkey has deep-rooted historical relations and shares common values with Qatar. In addition to our mutual commitment to developing our bilateral relations in every area, we also share a common vision on international and regional issues. During my most recent visit to Qatar, my dear brother His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and I had the opportunity to exchange views on bilateral and regional issues. Relations between Turkey and Qatar will grow deeper in the near future in a way that benefits both countries and the region. In fact, our mutual determination in this regard has raised relations between Turkey and Qatar to an exemplary level.</p><h4>Bilateral trade between Turkey and Qatar currently accounts for USD1.3 billion. Which areas of trade do you identify as having the most potential for growth?</h4><p>With the establishment of the High Level Strategic Committee in 2014, our relations were elevated to the level of a strategic partnership. This intergovernmental mechanism added a significant impetus to the Turkish-Qatari bilateral relationship, in so far as the committee met twice and facilitated the signing of 30 agreements. Out of these, 15 relate to our economic relations and include topics such as banking, SMEs, prevention of double taxation, health, information and communications technology, customs, and standardization, which together aim to develop our economic and trade relations. We also plan to organize a Turkey-Qatar Economic Forum in the near future. In the future, our countries aim to deepen the cooperation in trade and industry in a way that also includes the transfer of innovative technology.</p><h4>Qatar is currently preparing itself for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. What are the potential areas to be explored between Turkey and Qatar to cooperate in the development of these projects?</h4><p>Turkish companies have been undertaking various prestigious projects in Qatar such as airports, railways, metro and roads, which amounts to USD18 billion. We are prepared to provide full support to Qatar on its path to the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which will be the first time this event has been organized in a Muslim country. We were pleased to see a Turkish company awarded as one of the main contractors of Al Thumama Stadium, with a capacity for 40,000 spectators. In fact, these developments reaffirm the well-known competency of the Turkish contracting sector. I am certain Turkish contractors will continue to do important work in the Gulf region, including Qatar. In addition, the Turkish Village in Qatar, the construction of which will soon commence, will be a symbol of the cultural ties between both countries. The Turkish Village will include residences, shopping malls, schools, and hospitals and aims to reflect elements of Turkish culture and tradition with an Ottoman architectural design.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the development of bilateral relations between Turkey and the GCC for the upcoming years?</h4><p>It is important for Turkey to strengthen its bilateral and multilateral relations with GCC member states. In this framework, we have established bilateral intergovernmental mechanisms for cooperation with Gulf countries while strengthening our institutional dialog with the Council through the High-Level Strategic Dialog Mechanism. The High-Level Strategic Dialog Mechanism between Turkey and the GCC has met five times so far, most recently in Riyadh in October 2016. The next meeting will be hosted by Turkey. We aim to achieve concrete and mutually beneficial outcomes as a result of our relations with the council. Important decisions such as the reopening of the negotiations for an FTA between Turkey and the GCC and the extension of the existing Action Plan until 2018 were taken in the last meeting. We also confirmed our common position with member states regarding regional issues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[he-ahmed-bin-nasser-hamad-al-mahrizi-minister-tourism-oman]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Oman's current comparative and competitive advantages in tourism, over neighboring GCC countries?</h4><p>Oman is a competitive tourist destination with a fascinating history and culture that dates back well over 5,000 years. Our country's pristine diversified landscape that is characterized by mountains, sand dunes, and an incredible coastline, as well as its adventure activities, rich history and cultural heritage, and luxury hotels are some of its comparative and competitive advantages in tourism. The Sultanate has diverse tourism elements that mix modernity with the past, and meet the desire of tourists who look for a luxury and recreational holiday, as well as keep in mind the interests of those interested in exploring historical, cultural and archaeological landmarks. Oman is often referred to as 'true Arabia', because ancient culture has been so beautifully preserved. In the sultanate one can still find souks selling silver, frankincense and pottery, in the same way as has been customary for thousands of years. That's not all - our people have a well-deserved reputation for being amongst the world's most hospitable. Their smiling faces testify to their eagerness to share our unique culture with visitors, and most travelers to Oman will have at least one story of remarkable Omani hospitality. It is this warm, peaceful culture that has created a society that consistently ranks Oman highly on the annual Global Peace Index; and Oman has also been named the world's 9th safest tourism destination by the World Economic Forum in 2015.</p><h4>What is the Ministry of Tourism currently doing in order to attract more foreign tourists to Oman?</h4><p>The Ministry of Tourism is coordinating and collaborating with other countries within and outside the GCC to promote Oman as a unique tourist destination. The Sultanate is being promoted as a year-round destination for tourists' vis-a-vis water sports, mountain escapes and luxury hotels. We are also keenly focusing on business travelers, special interest groups, and MICE tourism. To that effect, the Ministry of Tourism has developed a long-term vision for tourism in the Sultanate, by developing a comprehensive strategy, with a clearly defined plan and implementation program. The international listing of the Sultanate as a top tourism destination in the Daily Telegraph, Harper Bazaar Arabia, CNN, Vogue, BuzzFeed and San Francisco Chronicle is a result of the Ministry's continuous efforts to promote the country internationally. The Ministry is working relentlessly to reinforce its status in the tourism industry by developing its policies and strategies to further build the sultanate's brand identity and therefore attract more tourists to the Sultanate, as per Oman Tourism Strategy 2040. Furthermore, the Ministry is actively showcasing Oman's potential as a world-class tourism destination; and our participation in major travels exhibitions such as ITB in Germany, Arab Travel Market in Dubai and World Travel Market in the UK is testimony to this. The main aim behind our marked presence in such events is to engage, discuss and seek the interest of potential travelers to visit the Sultanate and thereby bring more tourism investments into the country.</p><h4>What regions throughout the Sultanate are the most visited by foreign tourists, and how do you see this evolving in the next year(s)?</h4><p>Al Jabal Al Akhdhar (The Green Mountain) in the Wilayat of Nizwa; Jabal Shams, located in the Wilayat of Al Hamra in the Governorate of Al Dakhiliyah; Al Kasfa Spring; Wadi Bani Khalid, one of the most famous valleys of the Governorate of North Al Sharqiyah; and Wadi Dhiqah another beautiful valley that is located in the Wilayat of Quriyat are some of the most popular tourist regions in the Sultanate. Another popular and important tourist site is the Governorate of Dhofar, which is famous during the period from 21st June to 21st September each year; for a unique season called Khareef (Monsoon season). In the coming years, and as the implementation of the Oman Tourism Strategy unfolds, more places of interest will be developed according to the concept of tourism clusters, which will include a number of distinctive and uniquely Omani experiences for visitors.</p><h4>Which projects, such as the new Muscat International Airport, are expected to further boost the tourism sector in 2018?</h4><p>More than 3 million tourists visited Oman in 2016. The number of hotel establishments in the Sultanate reached 352 hotel establishments by the 1st of June. This comes as part of the Ministry's efforts to develop the hotel sector in the Sultanate, by increasing the number of hotel rooms and diversifying tourism projects, while establishing tourism facilities in the various governorates of the Sultanate. The Ministry has granted approvals for a further 81 hotel establishments that will supply the sector with 5,279 hotel rooms. These include 38 new hotels in Muscat, three new hotels in Dhofar, seven in North Batinah, and five in South Batinah, along with others throughout the Sultanate.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>As a part of its 2020 vision, with the highly anticipated RO1.85 billion Muscat International Airport expected to open at the end of this year, the Sultanate aims to attract more than five million annual visitors to the country. All the facets that make Oman a unique tourist destination — all year round, hence become equally important; as Oman has something to offer for everyone. However, in keeping with the same - our growth strategy for the tourism sector in the medium to long-term is based on the above-mentioned cluster approach and tourism experiences with an Omani touch, reflecting local culture and heritage. Oman will continue to highlight various areas such as the unique coastal area of Musandam; the Hajar Mountains; the Frankincense Trail in Salalah; Cosmopolitan culture in Muscat and adventure activities in Oman's deserts. Each area will offer accommodation, culinary experiences, transportation and other unique Omani experiences for travelers and tourists with different kinds of budgets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are the member states that participated in the ASEAN economic community (AEC) progressing in achieving the targets of becoming an economic integrated organization? </h4><p>During the first year of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the focus was on putting in place the fundamentals for effective operationalization of the AEC Blueprint 2025 through the adoption of most of the AEC sectoral work plans and the endorsement of the AEC 2025 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework that would support effective implementation of the Blueprint. The framework enhances the previous mechanism by not only tracking implementation progress but also the outcomes and impact of regional economic integration. The AEC Blueprint 2025 is accompanied by the AEC 2025 Consolidated Strategic Action Plan, which was endorsed on 6 Feb 2017 and is publically available. It comprises key action lines drawn from sectoral work plans and serves as a single reference document that will be updated periodically to inform stakeholders of the key action lines that will be implemented to pursue the ASEAN economic integration agenda from 2016 to 2025. ASEAN has also successfully achieved priority deliverables under the Chairmanship of Lao PDR in the strategic areas of trade facilitation (adoption of the ASEAN Trade Facilitation Framework), food safety (adoption of the ASEAN Food Safety Regulatory Framework), MSME development (adoption of the ASEAN Institutional Framework on Access to Finance for MSME), and tourism (adoption of the Pakse Declaration on ASEAN Roadmap for Strategic Development of Ecotourism Clusters and Tourism Corridors). Other notable achievements are the launch of the ASEAN Tariff Finder, a cost-free search engine for tariff-related information under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement and other ASEAN +1 free trade agreements as well as the full operationalization of the ASEAN Solutions for Investments, Services and Trade (ASSIST), a fully internet-based and cost-free, non-binding consultative mechanism for the expedited and effective solution of operational problems encountered by ASEAN-based enterprises on cross-border issues related to the implementation of ASEAN economic agreements.</p><h4>What sectors are being prioritized in the bid to increase cooperation between member states and their trade relationship with the wider region?<a href="http://admin.thebusinessyear.com/Article/Edit/?Id=5a0448f986b7b017f007ba8a#"></a></h4><p>In parallel with initiatives of regional economic integration such as liberalization and facilitation of trade in goods, services, and investment, close cooperation in various other sectors, such as transport, energy, information communication technology, tourism, agriculture and science and technology, has been one of the important factors leading to the successful establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community. Entering into the next decade, ASEAN will continue to pursue vigorous sectoral cooperation in all those sectors as set out in the AEC Blueprint 2025. Each sector has already identified the priority deliverables for 2017. In transport, building further on the successful realisation of ASEAN Open Skies, ASEAN Member States will continue implementation of the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASAM) with focus on strengthening air traffic management and aviation safety and security. Efforts are also prioritized to further enhance transport facilitation with the targets of completing the pilot operationalization of the ASEAN Customs Transit System (ACTS) and conclusion of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Passengers by Road Vehicles (CBTP). In ICT, the priorities are placed on the expansion of broadband to under-served areas, reducing international roaming charges and strengthening cooperation in cyber security. Work has also been started on studying the feasibility of an ASEAN Single Telecommunication Market. In energy, cooperation in 2017 is being focused on institutional strengthening for the implementation of the two energy connectivity flagship projects: the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) and the Trans-ASEAN Gas Pipeline (TAGP). Work in the area of energy efficiency (EE) aims at harmonizing EE performance standards for air conditioners and developing a Policy Roadmap for Minimum Energy Performance Standards for Lighting. In the area of food, agriculture, and forestry, ASEAN Member States are working on a number of initiatives to pursue sustainable agricultural production, enhancing product competitiveness and at the same time ensuring food safety, such as developing a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Regional Framework for Technology Development in the Agricultural Sector, Guidelines on Improving SPS Measures, Guidelines on Sustainable Forest Management, and Guidelines on Controlling the Use of Anti-Microbials in Livestock. In tourism, the Visit ASEAN@50 campaign is the main initiative with which ASEAN Member States join efforts in offering the best tourism products and services to international visitors to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of ASEAN. Cruise tourism development is another priority of ASEAN tourism cooperation. Science, technology, and innovation is another priority sector of cooperation in 2017. In order to realize the strategy of productivity-driven growth, innovation, research and development and technology commercialization as laid out in the AEC Blueprint 2025, ASEAN Member States are working on an ASEAN Declaration on Innovation for adoption by the ASEAN Leaders at the 31st ASEAN Summit in November 2017. </p><h4>What is the status of your talks regarding the EU FTA, and what are the prospects for this regional corporation? </h4><p>The economic relations between ASEAN and the EU are strong and resilient. The EU is ASEAN's third largest trading partner with two-way merchandise trade in 2015 amounting to USD228 billion, accounting for 10% of ASEAN's total trade. The EU is the largest external source of Foreign Direct Investment inflows into ASEAN, amounting to USD20 billion in 2015, or 16% of total ASEAN's FDI. Potentials exist for the growth of trade and investment between both sides and ASEAN and the EU will continue to explore initiatives to further strengthen and deepen economic relations including through conclusion of an FTA taking into account mutual benefits.</p><h4>How will The Chinese One Belt, One Road initiative compliment ASEAN's trading goals? </h4><p>ASEAN and China will continue to strengthen cooperation in the area of connectivity that will bring mutual benefits, including through capacity building and resource mobilisation for the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 (MPAC 2025), exploring ways to improve connectivity between both sides by synergizing common priorities identified in the MPAC 2025 and China's “Belt and Road“ initiative, and encourage the active involvement of relevant multilateral financial institutions, particularly Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.</p><h4>Over its 50 years, how has the organization has stayed relevant and dynamic? </h4><p>Five decades of cooperation and integration has made ASEAN one of the most successful regional organizations in the world. ASEAN works together through fostering deeper understanding, building trust and cooperating to pursue common interest in the context of diversity in full recognition of its varied but shared interests and aspirations that demonstrates its unique strength. ASEAN maintains its unity on the basis of shared commitments and collective responsibility for regional peace and prosperity, the principles of respect for national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in the internal affairs of its Member States. Decisions in ASEAN are made by consensus. This “ASEAN Way“ is to ensure that no AMS is left behind in the solutions of issues of shared concerns or interests. ASEAN's strength lies in the fact that it has been able to manage and turn a disadvantage into an advantage. To keep itself relevant and maintain it centrality in the evolving regional architecture and enhance its capability to respond effectively to unfolding complicated regional and global developments, ASEAN is implementing measures to streamline its processes and improving its working methods including updating the ASEAN Charter.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate Khoury Home's operations over the past two years?</h4><p>Khoury Home went through difficult years; however in 2015, we managed to overcome the hurdles and resume growth. In 2016, the firm had a great year with a net income growing by 10%, exceeding budget and reaching approximately USD1.4 million. In 2021, we expect Khoury Home to be cash rich, improving working capital and increasing sales to USD150 million. Since 2011, the Lebanese market has been witnessing a 10-15% yearly decrease and Khoury Home managed to retain healthy levels of sales, increasing its market share from 13% to 25%, representing a significant increase and an unprecedented one in the sector. Today, we are growing faster than any other competitor in the country. Our teams, led by a new executive committee consisting of leaders who have been with the company for several years, have been at the origin of this growth and will surely help Khoury Home continue its progress in the years to come.</p><h4>Last December, Khoury Home broke records, netting USD10 million in sales during five days around Black Friday. What strategy did you follow to achieve these results?</h4><p>Nobody can rival the kind of experience and service we offer in our showrooms. And on Black Friday, we provide the market with irresistible deals, offering huge discounts while retaining the same quality of customer service. We also sell through an online platform to increase our reach and make it more convenient for our esteemed customers. Moreover, we are developing our wholesale segment, where we distribute our brands to the Lebanese market. We are continuously working on acquiring new brands that we believe will improve our product offering. Furthermore, we are expanding into new cities, opening in Zahleh (2016) and in Tyre later in 2017. We also recently launched a new segment, La Maison by Khoury Home, that will be offering a large selection of home furniture and gifts in our biggest showrooms first, and soon in all of them.</p><h4>How do you foresee the retail sector evolving in five years in Lebanon?</h4><p>This is a difficult sector, not just in Lebanon, but worldwide. The market went down from USD600 million to USD350 million, mainly because of the Syrian and regional turmoil. Approximately 20% of our sales used to be generated in Syria. The economic situation in Lebanon today is extremely difficult with lower consumer purchasing power. For instance, a couple of years ago, consumers tended to immediately replace their defective fridge or washing machine, whereas today, they would rather fix it for a fraction of the cost. Since 2011, we used to always say every year would be the hardest year, but every year just kept getting harder than the previous one. Now, in 2017, we have a new president and government but parliament is yet to be elected, and it is a hard situation in general. Usually, I am optimistic. Hopefully, this summer, tourists will come back and people will come from the Gulf. Hopefully, the real estate sector will also pick up and a parliament will be put in place. These are all necessary because everybody is tired; businesses and business people are tired. That being said, we are in an optimal position to grasp a positive market momentum as we enjoy having the best organization, management, leadership, and quality. </p><h4>What is your main goal for the coming 12 months?</h4><p>Massive growth is our plan. We have restructured and reorganized the company into a moneymaking business, and our new management is thriving to reach new heights. We are also moving to either an IPO or a private placement operation in the near future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Le Gray, part of Campbell Gray Hotels, is a perfect combination of modernity and comfort. What sets your hotel apart from the competition?</h4><p>Individuality and understated luxury is what sets us apart. Our hotel is part of the Campbell Gray Hotels collection whose concept is based on individuality, and this includes the identity as well as the approach. We believe in understated luxury, luxury that is at the service of the guest's comfort and wellbeing without being intimidating. All our hotels are snob-free zones and this certainly includes Le Gray, Beirut, the flagship of the collection in the Middle East. Our hotel has a collection of more than 500 pieces of art handpicked by our chairman, Gordon Campbell Gray, who is an art collector. This combination sets our hotel apart and positions us as trendsetter. Le Gray is a unique hotel with a prime location delivering quality service consistently. That said, our property embraces quality and anticipates guests' needs. Consequently, the adopted strategy has succeeded in grabbing a big market share so to position us among the key players on the local market since the hotel's opening back in November 2009.</p><h4>A big emphasis on the human approach is key in this industry. How does Le Gray work to provide the best service?</h4><p>Indeed, emphasis on the human approach is key in hospitality and this is why our greatest asset is our human resources, our people. Being in hospitality has some common standards to all hotels and this certainly differs according to the rating of each. However, the difference is in how we deliver the service and how genuine and how passionate we are. The difference is in how we can be friendly and stay distant, anticipating guests' needs while staying unobtrusive. To achieve this, the work starts at the screening and recruitment stage; we believe we can teach and shape skills but cannot shape attitudes. Then, our continuous training and development process results in knowledgeable empowered professionals who adopt situational leadership with an inspiring yet motivational approach.</p><h4>Local authorities are working on several plans to bring back Gulf tourists. How do you foresee these initiatives?</h4><p>Any initiative aiming at regaining Lebanon's place on the touristic map is a great initiative. Lebanon has always been the vacation destination of the Arab world, and the Arab tourist has always felt at home here. Le Gray has about 45% Arab guests, and we are happy to see them coming back. The first quarter of the year is not a touristic period to judge properly, but we already see the demand is on the rise for the holidays.</p><h4>What do you currently identify as the main challenges of the sector?</h4><p>Security and instability have a great impact on a traveler's behavior, making last-minute bookings a trend. This affects projection. As another result of the recent political and security situation in the region, the market has became highly competitive; a matter that led to a drop in the average rate. Now despite the fact that the trend in occupancy and demand are on the rise, the average rate is still on a much slower pace and it constitutes one of the main challenges. Delivering constant quality has to be balanced with a vigilant approach toward our financial returns management—an equilibrium that should guarantee a profitable business with many happy returns.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the year ahead?<br></h4><p>This year, and mainly the beginning of the second quarter, will witness the opening of new conference and events facilities at Le Gray, Beirut. We will also inaugurate 16 more rooms and add a lobby lounge with two different entrances, one specially dedicated for pedestrians coming from Weygand Street. So this year, our efforts are dedicated to making our new facilities the venues of the year, sustaining our position as Beirut's most unique hotel. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With 55 years of partnership between Lebanon and UNESCO, what are the major areas of cooperation?</h4><p>UNESCO has had a long-standing partnership with Lebanon since the establishment of its office in 1961, with collaboration in all of the organization's areas of competence, focusing primarily on education and culture. The strong links with Ministry of Education and government agencies facilitate the implementation of UNESCO projects to achieve its goals. UNESCO's work in Lebanon has undergone dramatic shifts in nature and scope since 2011 at the outbreak of the Syrian crisis. The protracted crisis has brought about unprecedented humanitarian situations and put enormous pressure on Lebanon and its communities. In this context, UNESCO's work has primarily focused on responding to the crisis in the context of the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan through mobilizing technical and financial resources of the organization and through interventions in education, social and human sciences, communications and information, and culture to help build resilience among learners and communities. More specifically, UNESCO's work in education aims to address both the humanitarian and development aspects brought about by the crisis through bridging the learning gaps for the youth, both for Syrian refugees and vulnerable young people in host communities. UNESCO's response also targets teachers, mentors, and facilitators as well as ministries' technical officials. The crisis in Syria has created a need for specific support in education in emergencies and quality education to which UNESCO actively engages from upstream analytical, capacity building, and downstream operational levels.</p><h4>UNESCO has been working with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) in the Reaching All Children with Education (RACE) program, now in its second phase. How has UNESCO contributed to the progress of this program?<br></h4><p>As a fixed member of the RACE Executive Committee (REC), UNESCO participated in the technical subcommittee that developed the RACE II plan and results framework. UNESCO advocated for the inclusion of secondary education provision in the RACE II plan following ongoing initiatives to support formal secondary education in Lebanon. Since 2015, UNESCO remains the sole agency that covers the enrollment fees of all non-Lebanese students in public secondary schools across the country. For the 2016-17 academic year, UNESCO supported the enrollment of 3,075 non-Lebanese young girls and boys, provided school supplies through the “School in a Bag“ initiative for 5,360 Lebanese and non-Lebanese students in 40 public schools country wide, and distributed school stationery to 200 public secondary schools. In an effort to support school administrations and interactive learning, UNESCO also provided electronic equipment to a number of public secondary schools. To increase the demand for education, both formal and non-formal, UNESCO actively participates in the nationwide, MEHE-led Back-to-School campaign, alongside other UN agencies. The campaign is an ongoing, collective effort throughout the academic year and consists of outreach campaign to local and international NGOs working in the education sector. It also focuses on retention to improve education quality. UNESCO has taken the lead in outreach and retention efforts for post-basic education, filling an important gap. In an effort to help ensure that quality education is provided at the secondary level, UNESCO also delivered capacity development training for secondary school directors and teachers which aim to promote learning and social cohesion among Lebanese and non-Lebanese students. Furthermore, UNESCO strongly believes in supporting the Lebanese government in providing diversified learning pathways to all learners. Within this context, UNESCO is currently working toward completing the Non-Formal Education policy framework with MEHE. In addition, it will be kicking off the development of the Secondary Accelerated Learning Program with MEHE and the Center for Educational Research and Development (CERD). UNESCO will support CERD's technical teams to develop the program's framework, as well as the content, the training of the teachers that will deliver the program, and the pilot implementation phase in early 2018. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current status of the education system in Lebanon, and what are the ministry's ongoing plans to improve it?</h4><p>Lebanon's education system has faced, and weathered, significant challenges since the start of the Syria crisis six years ago. The student population in our public schools has almost doubled. We have had to be creative, with the help of our international partners, in finding ways to enroll many thousands of displaced children while continuing to provide a quality education for the Lebanese population. By choosing to educate Syrian students alongside their Lebanese counterparts using our schools, teachers, and curriculum, we have avoided establishing parallel, and possibly inferior, approaches for children who are already extremely vulnerable. At the same time, we have used this great challenge as a way of encouraging important international investment in education in Lebanon that will be to the benefit of generations of children to come, as well as those currently in our schools.</p><h4>You have highlighted the need to increase investment in the educational sector, even more so now with the Syrian refugee crisis affecting Lebanon's educational resources. What initiatives is the ministry taking to boost investment in the sector?</h4><p>Educating twice as many students in the public school system has a major impact on resources—from paying teachers to wear and tear on our buildings. In addition, many children are not ready, following their experiences of conflict, to immediately enter mainstream schools. We have therefore developed, and are delivering, as a ministry and through NGOs, a series of non-formal options to help students back into school. In all of this, external support and investment has been invaluable. However, six years into a crisis that shows few signs of abating, we must maintain, and even increase, external investment if we are to continue to support and improve the education we offer to all children in our system. We are therefore working to communicate ever more clearly our work to improve efficiency in our system and manage levels of risk, alongside how we are working to strengthen learning outcomes in our schools. We know these are issues that are important to donors, and it is important to us that our partnerships are productive, trust-based, and long term. At the same time, we continue to advocate the real need for increased and more stable funding for education in Lebanon to the international community.</p><h4>How are the programs RACE and RACE II progressing?</h4><p>We launched RACE II, the successor to RACE, in the summer of 2016. This is an ambitious strategy taking us to 2021 that combines response to the Syria crisis with work on long-run sector development. This is important in a situation characterized by a protracted emergency. We cannot afford to neglect the development and reform needs of our education system, even as we respond to a massive humanitarian crisis. One year on, and progress is good. In the 2016-17 academic year, we enrolled a total of 200,000 non-Lebanese students in our schools. We continued to offer non-formal alternatives, developing new offers, and building pathways back into mainstream education for the most vulnerable. We are particularly pleased that this year's Brevet results are the best in five years, and that, on average, Syrian students are learning as well as their Lebanese counterparts. And we have now agreed on a new USD204-million investment in developing the education system to the benefit of these and future generations of students with the World Bank. This work will enable us to achieve some of the more ambitious long-term objectives of RACE II, beyond simply enrolling students, which will help ensure that every child is supported in our schools to learn and achieve his or her highest potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since your appointment as the Chief Medical Officer and Director of the Medical Center, what have been your main priorities?</h4><p>AUBMC has become one of the leading healthcare organizations in Lebanon and the region by focusing on high quality patient care, research, education, and training. The pillars of the 2020 vision and strategic plan for AUBMC launched by Executive Vice President and the Dean of Faculty of Medicine at the American University of Beirut, Dr. Mohamed Sayegh, prioritize patient-centered care in an environment of research and academic achievements. For years, AUBMC has attracted not only Lebanese patients, but also patients from several neighboring countries, including Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries, in addition to North African countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria. Despite the difficult period of the Lebanese civil war, this institution has continued to provide the best quality patient care, as well as education and training in the medical field. We train some of the most prominent healthcare leaders in the industry, not only in Lebanon, but in the region as well. Since my appointment, I have been focusing on developing the infrastructure of the center, improving the productivity and efficiency of the staff, and supporting patient access to high-quality care by reducing the cost of medical services. In order to accommodate the demand for medical services at AUBMC, we have been expanding the ambulatory care and inpatient facilities. Most notably, the Academic and Clinical Center (ACC) is being constructed and will be completed by the end of 2017. We are also expanding the medical complex by constructing a new building with around 150 beds, operation rooms, and an emergency department. Also, we are developing centers of excellence in different specialties under the leadership of highly qualified staff, utilizing cutting-edge technology.</p><h4>AUBMC covers a wide range of specialties. In which areas is the center most specialized?</h4><p>At AUBMC, we put the patient's needs first. We provide primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary patient care through core competency programs and centers of excellence. Our focus has been on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurosciences, and genetic diseases. Recently, we established the Genomic Center to launch the personalized medicine programs through assessment of the biology of diseases and metabolic functions of the host to tailor treatment for patients. We also have the most advanced technology in laparoscopic surgery, which helps avoid major incisions with specific surgical procedures, and radiation therapy.</p><h4>What are the main highlights and results of your new electronic health record system?</h4><p>We are currently preparing to launch the “Epic“ clinical informatics system, a leading electronic medical records system in the US. Epic will make AUBMC one of the few paperless healthcare facilities in the region, and we plan to launch in November 2018. This system will help improve the efficiency and quality of care and reduce the likelihood of errors and risks for patients. We have recruited almost 90 additional staff who we have sent to the US for training, Additionally, we are keen on introducing the state-of-the-art Pyxis system in pharmacy services to ensure the quality of medications dispensed to customers.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2018?</h4><p>Our primary aim for the coming year is to improve specific services in core competency disciplines here at AUBMC, specifically oncology, cardiovascular, neurosciences, and specific subspecialties in surgery such as orthopedic, plastic surgery, and vascular diseases. We are also establishing an obesity and diabetes center, which will be instrumental in the prevention and control of diseases that are prevalent in the region. Moreover, we are working on establishing a center of excellence for cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and hypertension and are expanding in the areas of liver and kidney disease, including programs for transplants whenever we have an availability of organs. We are also working to develop cancer and stem cell research. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main initiatives taken so far since your appointment as Minister of Public Health? </h4><p>It is important to make sure the sector is properly regulated. We are catching up with some regulations to ensure we have an advanced position when regulating the healthcare sector in general. On the legislative and regulative side, the government plays a key role, ensuring the high quality of services for which we just set out a new strategy. Within the next three years, we plan to introduce a comprehensive healthcare insurance structure and to make sure that every individual in Lebanon is covered one way or another, whether through the ministry or other organization. Many of those who are not insured as part of the security forces funds or the national fund do not have the means to afford private health insurance. Today, all those who do not have coverage and have no means to access hospital care can come to the ministry. There are also people who would like to have this coverage, but do not fit in this group of the poorest in the country. They also prefer to have some kind of a minimum level of coverage, and we need to offer that opportunity.</p><h4>How is the ministry encouraging investment, and how would you characterize the importance of PPPs in Lebanon's health industry?</h4><p>We are the most advanced healthcare market in terms of hospitalization coverage because we cover all private hospitals. The Syrian refugee crisis has put an extra load on the system and has increased occupancy significantly, but the UNHCR funds many of these operations and admissions. However, we have managed to reach a point with the World Bank where it has opened up the opportunity for Lebanon to access concession and financing facilities. Recently, the board of the World Bank approved a USD150 million package for the health sector, which is great news. This will help us to further improve the primary and public healthcare infrastructure to serve both the local population and refugees. And this infrastructure will remain in Lebanon once the refugees leave. In spite of the stress of the added population, the country managed to stay in the highest positions of public health in terms of disease control. Medical tourism is still a major industry in Lebanon, and we are looking forward to improve in that as well. The reputation of Lebanese physicians and the quality of services is fantastic, and people from the Middle East come to Lebanon for health, particularly from Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf. As we move forward, we have many institutions and medical centers in Lebanon that are specialized in medical tourism. We are working right now to better ties with them to create special packages for tourists.</p><h4>Since Lebanon currently has a strong drug manufacturing system, what are your prospects of becoming a regional supplier of drugs?</h4><p>Becoming a hub in the region will take work; we have a small local market, admittedly. Thus manufacturing for the local market itself might not be sufficient, unless we offer major incentives and force unbalanced competition. I am against being too skewed toward imbalanced competition because it is unhealthy for the economy. However, we are encouraging local manufacturing in many ways. First, we are tightening the controls on quality thus producing the best quality under European and US standards. Secondly, we are helping the government, at all levels, to open up new markets for the registration of Lebanese drugs. We are signing an agreement with Egypt, Russia, the EU, and Arab markets to make sure that Lebanese drugs have access to international markets, which reduces cost and kick starts the local economy. As the Ministry of Public Health, our main objective is to attain the highest quality healthcare and health outcomes. Therefore, we are working to open international markets to increase results, revenues, and ultimately efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy does the group follow to maintain its leading position in the market?</h4><p>The roots of Demco Group have been and continue to be steel. For nearly a century now, Demco Steel has carefully and steadily built a strong reputation that today serves as the foundation for Demco Properties. It is the trust and credibility our name has built that distinguishes us from competitors. Our success can be attributed to the optimism we cultivate for the future of Lebanon. From the beginning, we have continually strived to invest in our homeland and make it a better place. About a year ago, we launched “Lebanon is Calling,“ a diaspora-wide campaign that was broadcast internationally and aired on CNN during the American presidential election. This ongoing campaign is a personal initiative to encourage Lebanese expatriates to return to Lebanon and invest in their home country. Together we can see to it that Lebanon reaches its full potential, which can and will be truly impressive.</p><h4>What has been the evolution of Demco's real estate division been like despite the challenging years for the sector?</h4><p>The market is definitely challenging. There is always value in crafting something different than what is already available, to attract those in search of new trends in living. By consistently evolving with changes in the market, Demco Properties has succeeded in pushing the envelope and becoming an industry pioneer. All of our flagship projects—Demco Towers, RedRock, and FortyFour—were not only meticulously designed to respond to the demand of the market, but were also built on forward-thinking principles such as clean energy and green tech. Our strategy is to create opportunity in diversity and to challenge the conventional trend of development.</p><h4>Demco Properties' portfolio today includes five projects valued at USD610 million. What projects are in the pipeline?</h4><p>We have expanded our activities overseas. Just this year we established Demco Properties USA, and I am personally optimistic about our vision for the Southern Californian market. Our team in Los Angeles is showcasing tremendous effort in bringing our latest concept to life and setting a new standard for development in California. In California, coastal advocates are seeing a serious soil erosion issue at many of the beaches. Our project proposes key partnerships with local environmental experts to implement beach restoration initiatives. These measures not only protect the coastline but also create the proper environment for native species to nest. The development itself will be powered by clean energy and eco-friendly initiatives in line with our forward-thinking philosophy to go green. Another significant development we are working on is in one of the most prominent residential areas in the suburbs of Beirut. With this project, we are creating a new typology of residences that we believe to be the future of urban living in Lebanon. Our goal is to initiate communal living and offer home ownership to a category of people who previously could not afford to own residences. Demco's “Lebanon is Calling“ mindset will be put into play by giving the everyday Lebanese citizen the opportunity to effortlessly own property in their home country.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>At Demco Properties, our priority is to encourage investment in Lebanon while boosting the real estate sector. We are also focused on our efforts in the US. Demco Steel currently holds 60% of the Lebanese market share and our target is to maintain and strengthen this positioning regardless of changing circumstances. At Demco, we believe that in anything we do we have to always put forth our best work, because when we do we can overcome adversity and achieve any goal we set. This business is very similar to racing cars. We have to make careful and calculated decisions quickly and have complete trust in our teammates. There are many parallels between the sport and running the company. I personally view all challenges as opportunities, because there is nothing that drives me more than making a “yes“ out of a “no.“ </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Building Beirut]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[building-beirut]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Solidere is simultaneously a land developer, real estate developer, property owner, property and services manager, and operator. On what main projects is the company currently working?</h4><p>Currently in Beirut, we are completing the only department store by Solidere. Renowned architect, the late Zaha Hadid, designed this project, and it should be completed in 18 months' time. We also started the Eastern Marina project that will be adjacent to the Port of Beirut and will have the capacity for about 200 boats as well as surrounding shops and restaurants. We are also about to complete the infrastructure of the new Beirut Waterfront Area. All of the streets are finished, which includes more work than meets the eye. Under the streets run sewage, rainwater pipes, and fiber optics. Even more, there are no electric wires or phone lines in the air because we have placed everything underground, meaning more than just the streets are finished at this stage.</p><h4>Solidere International will start looking for new project developments in the region from 2Q2017, with Dubai and Abu Dhabi rated among the possibilities. What are the main projects of Solidere International?</h4><p>Solidere International is doing quite well. We have just completed a major residential project in Riyadh. This project has 600 villas that are all for rent. Our policy for Solidere Beirut and Solidere International is to create rental income. This way, we will depend less on the sale of land. In Jeddah, we have a tower project that is almost completed, as well as another residential project. At present, we have projects in Ajman, in the UAE, as well. The first stage has finished, which comprises the golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, which opened recently. The surrounding villas—44 of them in total—are completed, while one of the two hotels just opened recently.</p><h4>With 23 years building Lebanon, how has Solidere contributed to the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>I cannot name every single thing we have done, but one standout is the development of first-class shopping malls. There is Beirut Souks, which has attracted international brands that would have never come to Beirut had Solidere not been here. Louis Vuitton and Chanel are some of the major names. While Solidere always contracts out our projects and it is difficult to say how many employees we have, we are creating jobs and giving opportunities, not just for workers but also architects, engineers, mechanical engineers, and more. For example, the contractor for the new marina likely employs a high number of engineers and workers, the same for the contractor for the department store or the contractor for the infrastructure projects. There is a French saying that where construction goes, everything follows, or when construction works, everything works. This includes carpenters, steel traders, cement traders, and workers. The construction sector is an important element of any economy.</p><h4>What would be your main goals and priorities for this year?</h4><p>We want to continue with our work. We hope Arab tourists will return to Lebanon because they are a major driving force of the Lebanese economy. Unfortunately, in the last few years they have not been coming. Now, however, we hope this summer will be a great one. We also hope to see the Lebanese diaspora return for extended visits. This is important for the tourism sector in Lebanon, which is a key sector as around 23% of our GDP is from the tourism industry. Lately, tourism has been down, which is why the economy has been suffering. Tourism makes things move as tourists spend money when they come here, and Solidere's redevelopment projects are a major driver of tourism, enticing tourists to come enjoy everything Beirut has to offer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Opportunities in the Challenges]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[opportunities-in-the-challenges]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main focuses over the past year?</h4><p>Planning involves many sectors of the economy, but as there was no structure for this new ministry the first thing was to study what kind of structure should be in place and how and which functions we should cater to. In general, there is a great need for planning in Lebanon. The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) is catering to part of this need, and some other planning is conducted through other ministries. But there is no political link between these planning activities, except partly through the president of the Council of Ministers. Now, we have designed a proposal to start our operations that will be presented to the Council of Ministers. The spectrum of potential operations for the ministry is large and goes from choosing some specific areas for our planning activities through to possibly creating a High Council for Planning. This would bring together all the existing planning elements and involve deciding which parts to develop further. As there is no budget, this has also been discussed with some world funds and embassies that are willing to fund specific areas. Whether to have a full Ministry of Planning again as we had in the 1970s will be a political decision in the long run.</p><h4>Is the Ministry of State for Planning Affairs looking to form partnerships with the private sector?</h4><p>There is no choice anymore in our developed world; the creation of public-private partnerships helps in the financing of some big projects and in terms of efficiency. Now, the private sector's tools are becoming more developed, and today it has access to long-term funding, which gives more flexible tools to the public and private sectors to create synergies that are important in our terms. It is important in fields such as the development of electricity resources, telecommunications, water, sewerage, ports, and even some roads. Even when talking about productive sectors like industry and industrial free zones, partnerships are important. The same is the case in the MICE sector. The private sector in Lebanon is developed and has a great deal of know-how or access to know-how. Lebanese business people have open links to the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Latin America, together with easy access and connectivity worldwide through technology, and wide-reaching connections globally through the Lebanese diaspora.</p><h4>Lebanon's economy is predicted to grow by 2.5% in 2017. What are your prospects for the country's economy for 2017 and the medium term?</h4><p>Lebanon has opportunities and challenges. The private sector and civil society is very active here. At the same time, in order to activate the economy, you need investments and for that you need political stability. In Lebanon, there is always a need for stability and security. We have had this for three years, which is a significant improvement in Lebanon. There are investments opportunities here, and there will be some decisions made about investing here now that the election of the president is done. It will be easier following the election of the president and the relative political stability as a result of that election. At the same time, there are challenges, such as the refugee problem, which is an important factor for considering economic growth and development. If we measure growth based on the increased population it is negative because of the influx of refugees. This inflow creates stress on the health and social infrastructure of the country and even on electricity and some services. Simultaneously, increased demand creates opportunities further development and new businesses. Opportunities and challenges are two sides of the same coin. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[(above)  Standard Operating Procedure]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[above-standard-operating-procedure]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the highlights of your operations over the last year?</h4><p>We were previously operating three DHL Boeing 757 Cargo Freighters to Lebanon. I am very happy to be able to say that now we are operating DHL Freighters five times per week. We also have the capability, which we have used on a number of occasions, to upgrade the aircraft to one of the three Boeing 767s based in Bahrain depending on demand. The flight operations have provided us with a direct connection into our largest Middle East hub on a schedule that ensures we can offer the latest shipment collection times while maintaining the best possible transit times, which ultimately benefits our customers. For example, we can collect a shipment in Beirut as late as 5pm and deliver it at 9am the next day to Jeddah, and do it continuously day in and day out because the operational platform was built for this purpose. In addition, we have witnessed major developments and investments in DHL's infrastructure and service in Saudi Arabia, including over EUR30 million in the three major airport facilities of Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah. The investment in network flights to Lebanon and the facilities in Saudi Arabia are just two examples of how the company continues to improve its Middle East infrastructure and positioning in our continuous focus to improve service and the overall customer experience, which is why we continue to be market leader for the MENA region. Of course, infrastructure alone is not enough. Our people are the most qualified and highly trained international specialists in the industry, and we continue to ensure that we can always support this claim with great confidence through heavy investment in training.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the results of the joint works between DHL, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and General Security?</h4><p>About two years ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in conjunction with General Security informed us of a requirement to provide Lebanese expatriates with an option that would allow them to apply for and receive their new passports more quickly. Together, we explored a number of options and in October of 2016 launched DHL FastTrack. Applicants now simply log on to the website dhlfasttrack.express, print out and pay their shipping bills, and simply take the receipts with them to their local Lebanese embassy where they submit their passport application. The project's success is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and General Security teams.</p><h4>How is the Go-Green program evolving in Lebanon and what other initiatives is DHL taking in this regard? </h4><p>The Go-Green program is one of DHL's global sustainability initiatives and provides customers around the world with the ability to transport their shipments on a carbon-neutral basis by simply selecting the option when processing their shipments. For a number of years, DHL Express Lebanon has supported Go Green by committing resources to local efforts to expand our forests. This year, the DHL Lebanon team participated in a USAID-sponsored program to plant trees in the Bekaa Valley. These are great opportunities to give back to the community, do our part for the environment, and spend time together as a team outdoors.</p><h4>What will be the main priorities and goals for DHL for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our strategy for the past few years has changed very little. Our plan is and has been for quite some time to attract, train, and retain the right people as well as focus on service quality and make sure our customers' experience with us is the best it can be. To accomplish this, we continue to invest in our people, technology, and infrastructure in good times and in bad. Investing in our people and service is what we believe will ultimately create success. Customers have expressed their approval by continuing to do more business with us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate more on your agreement with Middle East Airlines (MEA) to expand the airport? </h4><p>There is a proposed project for expansion. However, the expansion needs financing, and we are currently pursuing this issue. In 2016, the number of passengers at Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport increased to 7.6 million. However, the current halls in our airport are unable to accommodate this figure, which is why we need to expand the airport. Expansion requires financing, and this financing depends on getting the plans that we requested. A master plan was designed with the consultant Dar al Handasah. This consultancy seeks to draw up a master plan for the airport because we need the terminals to accommodate 9-12 million passengers. The studies are currently ongoing and, for this reason, I cannot predict whether the expansion will be completed soon or further in the future. As for the financing of this project, it depends on the vision of the government. Any financing needs a decision from the government. It is likely that the financing will come via partnerships with the private sector. However, as with everything in Lebanon, we need an approval from the cabinet in order to issue an acceptance from private-sector investors.</p><h4>The Cabinet has agreed to allocate USD28 million to improve security equipment at the airport. What is your strategy to improve security?</h4><p>USD28 million has been transferred by the Ministry of Finance, and we now have a tender for five projects financed by this money. First, we have a referential agreement for scanners and X-rays that will be used mainly for vehicles and stowaways. The other four tenders are to buy dual-view X-ray scanners that can detect explosives and narcotics. We will also purchase body scanners as well as bomb containers to accommodate any explosives confiscated from suspects. In addition, we will purchase dual-view X-ray scanners for inbound packages. We also have about 800 cameras that should be installed from the checkpoint of the army to the airport, including throughout the terminal. The US government has provided a car equipped with X-ray as well as a shoe scanner, in addition to pieces of security equipment. At the end of the year, our airport will have tighter security as a result of this equipment, which will improve, strengthen, and enforce security in Lebanon and create a better experience for all travelers at Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport. Besides this equipment, we have two projects that are now in progress. One is the fence, which costs about USD6.4 million. Another is a baggage handling system, which also costs about USD6.4 million.</p><h4>Turkish Airlines recently signed a cooperation agreement with MEA, which will increase the number of passengers. Besides this, what is your strategy to improve and increase the number of connections and companies operating in Lebanon?</h4><p>We have a strategy to have more airlines coming to Lebanon. We believe this contact through airlines will strengthen relationships between people. For this reason, we follow this strategy, which we believe in. Economically, this will also increase the revenues of the state, which will benefit our country. Last year the airport saw 7.6 million passengers, and I foresee the number of passengers to grow to more than 8 million in total in 2017. </p><h4>What are your main priorities and goals for the next year for the airport?</h4><p>Our goals are to improve the security and safety of the airport. We have tenders as well as two main projects that are now ongoing. All these will ensure security and safety. </p>]]></richbody0content>

However, we firmly believe in a positive future and see in every challenge we face a possible new opportunity. We have established Net Priority, a new joint venture with Priority Worldwide Services, which specializes in humanitarian aid, emergency relief, and government services. Net Priority is collaborating with most of the NGOs and providing them with the required logistics support. Also, Net Express has been established to serve the growing e-commerce business in the region. Net Critical offers premium clinical trial logistics services and is currently expanding in the MENA region through local offices and agents. Net Logistics is now centered on general freight forwarding.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Pikasso evolve and what are the achievements of the company so far?</h4><p>We had a long maturation period that lasted 14 years—from the day of the foundation in 1986 until 2000, the year we started our expansion abroad—and this happened at a regular rhythm. Our industry, the out-of-home (OOH) advertising industry, is divided into three main sectors and we operate in all of them: billboards, urban furniture, and transport advertising. The billboard segment covers every size from small to large billboards. Urban furniture includes bus shelters, city lights, and malls. Transport advertising relates to airport, metros bus, and rail advertising. Digital OOH (DOOH) is applied in all three segments. Today, Pikasso is the number-one OOH company in the Levant and North Africa with a recent expansion in West Africa. We are present in 367 cities and towns across eight countries, with a total of 13,000 faces, of which 263 are digital screens. The group employs 450 people.</p><h4>What are some of the major advertising concessions or projects Pikasso has won, and do you have any new bids in the pipeline?<br></h4><p>We have been leading the Lebanese OOH market since day one, where we have 4,500 faces throughout 203 cities and towns, and we hold the concession of most malls. The major wins in Lebanon this year consist of three new malls that were launched in June and July 2017: Spot Choueifat, Cascada Mall, and ABC Verdun. We do not have any other bids in the pipeline in Lebanon, whereas in Jordan and Algeria it is a continuous process. </p><h4>What are some of Pikasso's CSR and environmental responsibility initiatives?</h4><p>CSR is one of Pikasso's commitments to its stakeholders to conduct business in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable manner that is transparent and ethical. Being an ISO-certified OOH advertising company, we continuously seek many opportunities to serve the community and intend to make a positive contribution to the society in which we operate. Socially responsible behavior is an integral part of Pikasso's core values as we believe in the importance of “giving where we're living“. In that pursuit, Pikasso has developed the Citizen Billposter Initiative that offers free of charge advertising space to different NGOs.</p><h4>What role does innovation play at Pikasso?</h4><p>We have always been at the forefront of innovation in the OOH field. It is important for us to be and remain the number one reference in our markets, to be a role model, and to serve our clients by proposing the best-in-class OOH solutions, delivering efficient campaigns. Historically, Pikasso has installed in Lebanon the first pre-wet poster paper billboard, the first prisma Trivision, the first networks as sales concept, the first seven-day campaigns, the first aesthetic billboards, and the largest façade wall, and  we have launched the only OOH award on creativity, the Pikasso d'Or, which is now a regional event. Innovation is in our DNA. OOH advertising has evolved enormously. We have been rolling out digital screens as of 2010. Today with 70 roadside digital screens, Pikasso dominates Beirut city and the main highway to Jounieh. But the digital transformation is not about installing a screen. It is about using all the capabilities of DOOH from engagement to customer experience, from relevant and contextual advertising to time-segmented campaigns, from facial recognition to broadcasting live content. It is a whole new world.</p><h4>What are some of your main priorities?</h4><p>Our first priority is to continue the digitization of our inventory. Our second priority is to work on promoting the capabilities of DOOH mainly at the level of the planning and the concept. Our third priority is to focus on the four new markets of West Africa we just penetrated. Those will be our main focuses for 2017. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Regarding expansion, could you tell us about the agreement that you signed with the Faculty of Engineering at AUB?</h4><p>We will end 2017 with 20,000sqm of built-up area, adding an additional 2,500sqm to where we are currently. With Phase B, we are introducing new commercial blocks that will double our size to 35,000sqm by 2020. As part of our vision to create a business cluster fueling the growth of more than 10,000 creative individuals and knowing that the main challenge that most start-ups face in Lebanon is recruitment and access to talent, we decided to partner with different universities, starting with AUB and specifically the faculty of engineering and architecture. We connect third-year students with companies that we host at BDD or to companies within our partners' networks. For the companies, this provides access to talent as interns who perform well can be recruited full-time employment. From the intern position, which is the most important aspect, they get access to see what is happening in the ecosystem. Through their internships at start-ups, they will be asked to contribute to the company and have the opportunity to learn much more about the needs and innovations currently happening in the ICT sector through two months of experiential learning.</p><h4>Currently, Lebanon is home to over 200 start-ups, second only to the UAE. What is your outlook for the next five years?</h4><p>It is all about the internet and bandwidth. From my point of view, Lebanon can complement the UAE. It should not compete with the UAE because the UAE has invested a great deal in infrastructure in the last 20 years and is now positioned as a hub for most international companies. By retaining the talent in Lebanon, Lebanon can act as a production hub serving regional and international markets while the UAE can serve as a sales platform where those companies can showcase and sell their products. At the bottom line, what we need in Lebanon is super high-speed internet at affordable rates. Everyone is looking for more speed to increase his or her productivity. We have fiber optics connected, and we started rolling this out to many companies that we host at BDD. Currently the government is looking at internet prices and increasing bandwidth. Increasing the bandwidth while decreasing the cost is the one thing that must be done to make companies more competitive.</p><h4>What are the main priorities and goals for BDD over the next 12 months?</h4><p>For our development, we focus on our five pillars: community, business cluster, innovative architecture, sustainability, and work-life balance. For 2017, we see our two main focuses being our community and our business cluster. We are working on increasing the productivity and benefits that our current community enjoys by launching a new app that automates all of its needs and services. This is happening this year, and I believe it will create a seamless experience for anyone to enjoy all of the benefits that BDD can offer through their handheld phone. We are in beta-phase now, so we are testing internally. The app will allow door access, a digital secretary for visitors, payments, meeting room booking, and so on. It was subcontracted through a Lebanese start-up company. There are two phases with different features, and all the features will be finalized before the end of the year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[securing-the-digital-transformation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>RGH is a dynamic investment group with a broad portfolio of businesses. How would you evaluate RGH's operations over recent years?</h4><p>Over the last few years at <a href="http://www.rgh.com.lb/rgh/en/home#&amp;panel1-1">RGH</a>, and in light of the digital era, we have made it a key mission to focus even more on our IT and R&amp;D backlog. The company has consolidated its operations around IT, security, and R&amp;D areas, enhancing our relationships with our clients as well as our ability to respond to their needs. The development of technology in recent years has allowed us to be extremely responsive to our clients more than ever before, especially those that are in need of major digital transformations. Various government agencies in our part of the world lag behind international standards and are a little more prone to security problems and issues arising from the digitalization of governmental processes. Many government agencies are still paper-based and lack automation, which makes the lifecycle of their processes and operations much harder than they should be. Inevitably, it also negatively impacts transparency and citizen services. The best way to level this process is to utilize the technology at our disposal in order to ensure systems operate more efficiently, and hence more effectively, and in turn greatly improve the end user's experience.</p><h4>What role does RGH play in the automation processes of the government?</h4><p><a href="http://www.rgh.com.lb/rgh/en/home#&amp;panel1-1">RGH</a> plays a central role in automating governmental processes. The implementation of biometric passports is one of multiple projects that we have already completed at a local level. This initiative helped elevate Lebanon's image as international partners and citizens recognized that Lebanon was beginning to adopt the most advanced anti-fraud standards. The government can now combat terrorism and other illegal activities more effectively. This will most definitely constitute a solid platform on which the government and its agencies can build upon, creating more elaborate systems in the future. Other automation projects include biometric and electronic solutions for residence permits, work permits, driving licenses, vehicle registration cards, secure plates, and RFID stickers. This helps the government control, securitize, and electronically manage different areas of activity. This also accelerates the transition towards e-government, where digital security is a basic requirement.</p><h4>What portion of your revenue is derived from the public sector?</h4><p>The split is 70-30, with 70% being derived from the public sector. We are at almost 50-60% export as well. We export our services to the Gulf, though our real stronghold is sub-Saharan Africa. We are present in nine countries in that area of the world and service similar projects. We in fact started in sub-Saharan Africa in the early 2000s and then we returned to Lebanon to expand our operations here in 2013.</p><h4>What are RGH's services and initiatives for digital security?</h4><p>Our main offering to governments and the private sector is the ability to authenticate and identify their virtual clients, because in any digital transaction the question of identification is extremely vital. Governments and companies need to know how to ensure that a given activity or transaction is, in fact, being completed by the person in question. Authentication is a major obstacle and a major cornerstone of e-government, digital security, and digital transactions. This is where we focus our product offering and we complement this offering with a robust cyber security solution. We started developing the latter through our telecom division, which was established in 2009, and we position it as a regional integrator of choice. The operations of both subsidiaries (digital security and cybersecurity) go hand-in-hand with one another, and we are focused on providing solutions that fulfill both needs. By operating in an area that represents such a key meeting point for technologies, we are able to provide an invaluable service to governments and private firms alike. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the Minister, 500,000 new landlines will be available soon that will enable Ogero to speed up the DSL connection all over Lebanon. How is this progressing?</h4><p>What we are working on is much more transformational in nature. We called this the IMS Project because we are dismantling and decommissioning all the old technical switches that were put in place back in 1994 with limited capacity and capabilities in comparison to what we have today. This introduces the digital era of IP telephony. What we are doing is not only adding 500,000 landlines; rather, we are completely transforming the infrastructure of the fixed network into a groundbreaking platform that will allow us to welcome as many new subscribers as the market requires. Our short-term objective is to add an additional 500,000 subscribers in addition to the 1 million that we already have, and that would only be the first piece of the puzzle. Having an advanced digital environment starts with fixed-network assets, which is the IMS. Other pieces will also fall into place to establish the final, or at least the modern, infrastructure that we intend to have in Lebanon. The second phase is the fiber-to-cabinet solution, which will allow us to provide better connectivity to the end user in their homes.</p><h4>The installation of fiber optics is part of the 2020 strategy launched in July 2015. According to that plan, what is the progress of this gradual installation of fiber-optic networks?</h4><p>The first phase of the fiber optics plan was deployed before I joined Ogero, and it was dedicated to linking all of our 300 switches together through fiber optics. So far, we have deployed around 6,000km of fiber in the country. The second phase is to get closer to the subscriber by installing active cabinets. Those cabinets will position the end user closer to the switch, thus giving better access to high-speed internet. We are about to tender this project; the technical teams are putting together the documents as we speak, as well as planning the deployment of several thousand cabinets across the nation.</p><h4>How has Ogero contributed to the development of the country over the years?</h4><p>Ogero is the major infrastructure provider for Lebanon, but my team and I are constantly striving to upgrade the capabilities of our network so that the private sector can take part in infrastructure improvement, providing capacity, high-speed internet, and a resilient, stable, secure, fit-for-purpose network. We are a vital transforming force in the Lebanese economy. Many entrepreneurs are moving out of the country due to the lack of proper infrastructure. Connectivity has become essential for every start-up and every business that seeks growth. Our objective is to cater such services for all stakeholders to grow within their homeland and benefit its economy.</p><h4>What are Ogero's priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have a plan in place that will allow us to catch up with the leading economies in the region in terms of technology and telecommunications. Our main objective is to provide nationwide high-speed internet. The next milestone consists of providing heavy internet users (universities, hospitals, specialized schools, public entities, big enterprises, and so on) with fiber connectivity characterized by high capacity and bandwidth. We are also looking into expanding our data center and cloud computing capabilities to create a national cloud for Lebanon. Our proof of concept will take us to a new level of service, specifically for the ministries and the public sector. Once this proof of concept is solid, we will move to a private cloud while trying to get the framework to establish a regional cloud. With this plan in mind, we aim to establish a long-lasting strategy that can be sustained through different administrations. We have received the buy-in of all concerned entities, including previous ministers and the current government, to turn this sector into a success story. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights of the 10-year strategy for the development of the industrial sector, and how is it evolving?</h4><p>We are moving in the right direction. The government is sensitive about the question of the economy and industry. Everyone is talking about the problem and how we must solve it. We have several ways to go about this: the first is to subsidize the cost of production; the second is to adopt taxes to protect our industry; the third is to figure out how to reduce the cost of production by using gas, wind, or solar energy, or by using a new means of production in some industries; and the fourth is to enhance our exports, especially to the EU. We have had a large discussion with the EU during this period. We sent a letter about exports from Lebanon in six sectors. These include pharmaceutical, dairy, meal, textiles and clothes, spices and nuts, and the food industry. The ambiance between Europe and us is positive; we hope to soon reach a solid agreement and forge a strong partnership.</p><h4>How is the process of developing industrial clusters and parks evolving?</h4><p>We are also at a positive point in that project. We have USD10 million as a loan from the Italian government. The European Investment Bank also proffered a soft loan for a large amount. We have a discussion next week between our ministry and the European Investment Bank here in Lebanon about this. This amount being given by the Italian government gives this project a lot of credibility.</p><h4>Which sectors are growing faster than others?</h4><p>The food and cloth industries are growing the fastest. The cloth sector will be in an even better condition if the EU gives a positive response about the rules of origin. We also see improvement in the pharmaceutical industry, jewelry, IT, and electronics, software, and automatics and robotics.</p><h4>What is the level of success of the maritime exports program, implemented as a result of the closure of the Syrian border?</h4><p>Recently, we had a meeting with the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister, and the Ministers of Industry, Agriculture, and Economy. The general directors and Idal were also there. We discussed this project and we have a new program in which we are prepared to subsidize the cost of transport to naturalize the negative effect of the Syrian war on the transport of goods from Lebanon to the Gulf, Iraq, and Jordan. The program is there, and our discussion focused on the expansion of this program.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the sector in the mid term?</h4><p>GDP must be increased to USD70 billion and industry must account for around USD15 billion of this. We have a duty to face our crisis by increasing our GDP and the percentage of industry in it. Our goals and priorities for the coming years are to improve and increase exports, start the new industrial zone, and reduce the cost of energy by introducing gas and new sources of energy. There are three industrial zones, and we will prepare about another five to six. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The first oil exploration contracts are expected to be signed before the end of 2017. What strategy will LPA follow to evaluate the bids?</h4><p>After signing decrees that were pending for three and a half years, we renewed the launch of the bid round and started a new qualification round that resulted in eight new companies prequalified to bid. There are 51 companies in total, and these are classified into two categories: operator and non-operator. The operator has more skills and financial strength, i.e. total assets amounting to more than USD10 billion and experience in drilling and completing developments in 500m-deep waters. For non-operators, they should have total assets of more than USD500 million and established oil and gas production; they have to prove that they are producing because we want exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies. We currently have 13 qualified companies classified as operators while the rest are non-operators. We require a minimum of three companies to go into joint ventures to bid for one block. There should be at least one operator present among these three, and the operator will form the consortium. The individual companies forming the consortium will have to pass each other's internal controls prior to forming a consortium. The deadline to submit the bids is September 15. A month later, the LPA will assess the results, prepare its report, and send it to the minister. The decision would be taken at the level of the Council of Ministers, starting in theory on November 15. However, looking at the recent political developments with the parliamentary elections taking place in May 2018, the current government has every incentive to award the contracts before the year's end.  </p><h4>As the regulator, how does LPA provide the companies a secure environment to invest in?</h4><p>LPA has a regulatory role, though it does not regulate prices. Our role is to monitor, manage, and supervise the petroleum activities. The LPA is divided into six departments and each department is led by a department head who is also a board member, so we have six board members. For the last four years, our engagement with the companies was mostly promotional. In addition, we have worked on transparency by announcing our intent to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives (EITI). The importance of EITI is that it puts for the first time three parties on the same table: the government represented by the ministry and the LPA; the companies that will operate; and civil society, which will monitor this activity and ensure it is done correctly. This is the importance of EITI; it is a platform where these three parties can discuss. </p><h4>What specifications do you have for exploration and production-sharing agreements aimed at boosting the local economy?</h4><p>After giving the awards, these companies will need to subcontract other services, and we therefore have a model contract based on a production-sharing one in which companies will invest and then recover their production costs. If we have a solid and developed service industry in Lebanon, this cost can be re-injected into the Lebanese economy and this will even further boost our GDP and improve the oil and gas sector. We also require that local workers make up 80% of the workforce. This will be extremely challenging for us to monitor and for it to be achieved. In the event that they cannot, we can help with solutions for a period of time. </p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>We want to award the offshore blocks by the end of the year or the beginning of 2018. Our main objective for 2018-2019 is to have a commercial discovery. Once we have a commercial discovery and everything is put in place, we will then be able to start executing our medium-to-long-term plans based on the discovery size and the potential for other discoveries as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main highlights in implementing the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) for 2016-2020 thus far?</h4><p>The first NEEAP for Lebanon was developed for 2011-2015. Lebanon was the first Arab country to have its NEEAP developed, published, and adopted by the national government. In June 2015, the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) organized an evaluation session of the first NEEAP with the wide participation of different stakeholders. Based on this session, several modifications were introduced when structuring the second NEEAP for Lebanon to cover the period 2016-2020. For the latter, work has already been seriously started on four of the main initiatives, which are the building code, the minimum energy performance for home appliances, the labeling of appliances, and the pilot projects of energy efficiency in public building. For the national building code, there is a need to update the current version. Work is being done with several partners to include green buildings specifications within the national construction law. As for the minimum energy performance system (MEPS) and the labeling of home appliances, work is being carried out on several levels through the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework to analyze the different set standards and their adaptation to the Lebanese environment and to identify key appliances to include in the regulatory framework. Finally, public sector buildings are one of the largest consumers of electricity in Lebanon. This is why the NEEAP dedicated a measure for implementing energy-efficiency pilot projects in public sector buildings in order to showcase the sector's potential energy efficiency. At this stage, visits to identify the key buildings are being carried out working at the same time to procure the needed budget and financing.</p><h4>What is your outlook for alternative energy in Lebanon and the goal of doubling its share to 12% by 2020?</h4><p>Lebanon announced the goal of achieving 12% renewable energy by 2020 in 2009. This goal is mainly dependent on solar, wind, hydroelectricity, and biomass resources. The Lebanese government has issued the first licenses to produce electricity from the private sector for three wind farms in the Akkar region with a capacity of around 200MW. Moreover, the Ministry of Energy and Water has launched the request for proposals for the deployment of 12 solar farms with a capacity of between 120-180MW all over Lebanese territory. Both these projects are key milestones toward the achievement of the national target in 2020 as well as integrating the private sector into the renewable energy industry.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2017, our ministry submitted an additional plan to cover the increasing demand during the summer season that was aggravated by the inflows of the Lebanese diaspora due to the sense of stability that was created by the election of our new president. Demand was already heightened by the continual increase of displaced Syrians. Hence, it was important to prepare a plan to cover this extra demand and increase electricity supply in Lebanon. The plan relies on several pillars, starting with renewable energy projects. The second pillar was the rental of floating power production units with a capacity of 800-1,000MW and tying them to the existing grid in order to quickly boost our generation capabilities. The role of the private sector was mentioned in previous plans of the Ministry of Energy and Water and is still an important part of all our plans. In line with these efforts, we are working on the integration of power plants of 1,000MW through the Independent Power Producers (IPP) modality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon has been the pioneer of the insurance industry in MENA for more than 75 years. What main initiatives has the association taken in terms of conferences or partnerships?</h4><p>The association has been active. In May 2016, we had the General Arab Insurance Federation conference, where we had 341 insurance companies from 20 Arab countries. The conference was held here in Lebanon with about 1,400 participants. We have a lot of training courses here in the association, and next year in May we have the conference on digitalization and the future of cyber. We are always in contact with all the ministries to develop and defend the insurance sector. We have been able to create a good relationship with our regulator, the Ministry of Economy and Trade.</p><h4>How do you approach a highly saturated market?</h4><p>It is true that the market is saturated; we have 50 companies. Until now, it has been a profitable market for insurers. We have niche markets that were developed in Lebanon, one of them being microinsurance. Microinsurance is linked to microfinance, and because the segment developed a lot in Lebanon we followed the trend and ourselves established microinsurance. We are now preparing ourselves for cyber-crime insurance. We have event cancellations insurance as well; we have a lot of events in Lebanon, many of which are quite expensive, and we insure those. We have extended warranties and are always on the forefront of new insurance coverage.</p><h4>Despite having a relatively high insurance penetration rate of 3.3%, there is still work to do. How does the sector work to increase awareness?</h4><p>One thing we have been trying to do for the last couple of years is improve the image of the insurance sector in Lebanon. Worldwide, insurance companies do not have a good image, and it is the same here in Lebanon. Insurance is the second pillar of the financial sector. It is important because without insurance there is no financial security, for people, for banks, for loans, for marine, for fire, and so on. We are telling the country that we are extremely important; we process USD1.5 billion in insurance premiums, out of which we pay back USD1 billion. It is not from our money that we pay claims—we pay claims from the money people pay as a premium. We are trying to get these messages across.</p><h4>Where would you like to see the sector and the association in the future?</h4><p>We would like to see some mergers and acquisitions because we need fewer and stronger companies for the simple reason that if we want to expand abroad we need to show some capital strength. We talked about Iran, a country of 81 million people, and although we agreed that the market there was able to find solutions inside the country, it still needs to update its talents, coverage, and so on. This is why we need to have stronger companies that can take partnership shares in places such as Africa and Iran, for example. We also hope to play a major role in the reconstruction of Syria, whose war we hope will soon end. Iraq is a country where we cautiously started a business but the problem that there is not the necessary capital was not clear until now. We have the oil and gas industry coming and want this industry to be insured through an insurance pool with all the members of ACAL and to have ACAL run this pool for the entire market. Sharia-compliant insurance is also important, so we want to establish a partnership with an insurance pool in Lebanon and worldwide that will be run by ACAL. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since its founding?</h4><p>When we started the company in 1988, our main aim was to give a certain understanding and protection to our clients. We do not have any ties with any insurance companies and do not represent an agent of any insurance company. Therefore, we should be independent in order to provide our clients with free advice and free consultancy without any attachment to another insurance company. In this view, we noticed that a lot of people do not know many things about their insurance policies, so our main aim is to represent our clients with insurance companies and deal on their behalf. </p><h4>With Lebanon having one of the highest penetration rates in the region, is there still room for growth? </h4><p>There is. We have about 52 insurance companies, and they are all fighting for part of the market. They are doing this by lowering their premiums, and we do not yet have insurance companies evolving the content of their contract. Therefore, the insurance contracts should be looked at in a different way, follow the evolution of the social context we are living in, and follow a certain trend in the market, which we did not find yet in the Lebanese market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[for-worse-for-better]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led to the 60% increase in trading in 2016?</h4><p>Despite ongoing events in the region, in 2016 the BSE ended the year with a sharp improvement in the volume and value of traded instruments. This may be viewed in part as a reflection of renewed confidence in the country following positive political developments. In fact, market activity at BSE witnessed a sharp increase in trading movement in 2016. Cumulative trading during 2016 totaled 120.5 million shares valued at USD971.6 million, compared to 74.6 million shares for a value of USD628.9 million in 2015. This represents an increase of 62% and 55%, respectively, on the volume and value of shares traded.  </p><h4>How is the privatization process of BSE progressing?</h4><p>Currently, this is the most interesting topic related to BSE. We drafted the final version of the articles of association of the new company in conjunction with the Capital Market Authority and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance, which made some remarks that should be taken into consideration. Once the Council of Ministers approves the articles of association and appoints a Founders Committee (board of directors) of the new stock exchange, the process of transforming the current official bourse into a joint stock company will begin. The new board of the stock exchange will work within one year to privatize BSE by drafting the rules of privatization. It is important to mention that the Financial Market Law does not state the exact type of privatization that the bourse should go through or whether the government will hold a golden share in the new company.</p><h4>Will people be more encouraged to trade once the BSE becomes private?</h4><p>Of course, since a private company does not work like a public company. A private company will be more business oriented, promote itself, and act more vigorously to support its business. However, the privatization of the stock exchange by itself is not the only step necessary to promote and develop the financial market in Lebanon; we need a series of steps that should be done harmoniously in order to change the culture of the Lebanese businessmen and the public in general.</p><h4>How is the BSE working to increase awareness about capital markets and the benefits of trading their shares? </h4><p>The BSE Committee is trying to increase awareness about the importance of capital markets by giving attention to educational and promotional programs that aim to attract and convince medium-sized Lebanese companies to list their shares on BSE and to increase their capital through the broadening of the shareholders base by highlighting the importance and advantages of financing through the stock exchange.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the economy and the BSE going forward?</h4><p>It is my sincere hope that we will witness further progress in the Lebanese economy during 2017 that will boost BSE's activity and its reputation further.  I am confident that the election of the new president and the appointment of a new government will give boost to the Lebanese economy, mainly if followed by an election of new parliament.  However, this political improvement should be followed by real reform in all sectors in order to fight against bureaucracy and corruption. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2017?</h4><p>The BSE is currently in a transitory period as the Lebanese Parliament endorsed the new capital market law that takes into consideration the privatization of BSE. So, the major achievement for this year will be the restructuring of the national exchange and to transform it from an official institution to a joint stock company, a preliminary step before privatizing it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Banking on the best]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[banking-on-the-best]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was 2016 for SGBL's operations?</h4><p>SGBL's financial results in 2016 were among the best in recent years, largely due to the bank's loyal customer base and highly dedicated team of professionals. Total assets increased by 16% to USD19.07 billion by the end of 2016, and shareholder equity jumped by 37% to USD1.72 billion. The bank remained well capitalized, with the capital adequacy ratio reaching 18.5%, significantly above regulatory requirements. Customer deposits grew by 15.4% to USD14.59 billion at the end of 2016, reflecting a high level of confidence among depositors in the bank's financial structure and business model. Despite political uncertainty and economic challenges throughout most of the year, SGBL continued its support of the private sector and the Lebanese economy as a whole. The bank's loan portfolio increased by 7% to reach USD4.47 billion at the end of 2016, equivalent to an additional USD281 million in financing. Net profits grew by 18% to USD200.7 million during the year. </p><h4>What are the main highlights of your recent financing agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and how will your clients benefit from it?<br></h4><p>The new financing agreement between SGBL and EIB falls within the framework of a program dedicated to supporting SMEs in Lebanon. The EUR60 million-credit line granted by the EIB to SGBL will be lent to eligible SMEs looking to finance CAPEX or working capital at highly competitive rates. Our partnership with the EIB confirms our ongoing support for clients, especially SMEs, which form the backbone of the Lebanese economy. The agreement will enable our SME clients to access low-cost financing to scale up their operations and expand their workforce, thus enabling them to better compete in the local and international marketplaces. This latest credit line, which is four times the size of the previous agreement signed with the EIB in June 2012, serves as a testament to SGBL's leadership role in supporting productive sectors and driving economic growth.</p><h4>SGBL is opening a subsidiary within Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) with an initial capital of USD50 million. When is it expected to start operations?</h4><p>SGBL Group's expansion into the Gulf marks another milestone in the group's growth strategy and follows similar moves in the past into Cyprus and Jordan. The newly established, wholly owned subsidiary in the UAE will be located at the ADGM financial center, the second-largest international financial center in the UAE after the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC). SGBL Group's subsidiary will be the first bank to operate at ADGM, and is expected to launch operations soon, following the completion of the regulatory authorization process. We take pride in having received preliminary approvals in record time, thanks to our full compliance with the requirements set by supervisory authorities in Lebanon and the UAE. </p><h4>What is your vision for the economic development of Lebanon in the next year?</h4><p>Our vision for the next year includes investment in the country's transport, telecom, energy, and environmental infrastructure through PPPs to improve Lebanon's international competitiveness and promote sustainable economic growth. SGBL is committed to helping the country move forward into the next stage of development by leveraging our financial capacity and the Lebanese people's extraordinary will to progress.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2018?<br></h4><p>We take the confidence our customers place in us very seriously and are constantly looking for ways to improve their banking experience. To that end, SGBL is currently revamping the bank's technology systems and deploying advanced information platforms that enable us to offer world-class financial solutions to our diverse customer base. We are also focused on implementing a prudent domestic and regional expansion strategy that leverages SGBL's strong reputation and financial strength. Domestically, we are committed to supporting economic development across all of Lebanon. At the regional level, we are constantly on the lookout for growth opportunities, whether in new markets, market segments, or business lines. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>JTB won the 2016 Best Customer Service Award for corporate and SMEs. What strategy does the bank follow to achieve such results?</h4><p>JTB gained the trust and confidence of its clients long before the award. We have focused on differentiating JTB from the competition on a number of fronts such as in service, where our aim has been and will be to re-define service excellence. We want the name JTB to be synonymous with customer satisfaction and for JTB to become the bank of choice for households, micro, small, and medium enterprises. We have focused on market penetration, where we have embarked on a strategy to come closer to our clients and tap into new markets by opening new branches and relocating certain existing ones. Our objective is to maximize profits by capitalizing on whatever moderate economic improvement Lebanon may exhibit.</p><h4>What are the bank's plans to expand to Africa and/or Europe?</h4><p>We have a strong presence in Africa and Europe, where we have been growing confidently with existing and new clients. Our domestic presence, nevertheless, has registered a healthy growth by tapping into new markets, either through branching out physically or through our highly skilled network of relationship managers.</p><h4>JTB has an important focus on expats. How do you target this segment and the diaspora?</h4><p>A comfortable portion of the growth in the loan portfolio is attributed to the “foreign sector." The Lebanese diaspora is at the heart of our interest, particularly in Africa. We offer them tailor-made services that respond to their specific needs and wants. We also cater to their investments and their expansion needs. Recently, we started to expand our reach with that market segment in Egypt, Iraq, and Kuwait, to name a few.</p><h4>Can you please tell us more on JTB's strategy toward financial inclusion?</h4><p>Private banks should play a role in national responsibility. Having said that, JTB's innovative approach toward financial inclusion was to treat it as part of our corporate social responsibility initiative. A few years ago, JTB came up with tailor-made products and services especially designed to support underprivileged individuals, farmers, start-ups, and young people, as they are not conventionally considered as profitable in the banking sector. Those who are unbanked are generally those who do not have bank accounts, do not use banking services, or rarely or never go to a bank. The most commonly cited reason for not having an account is that accounts are too expensive and carry high commissions and fees. It is in this spirit that JTB's latest product, Save and Win, was designed.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges facing the sector?</h4><p>JTB faces and will face the same challenges that all banks in Lebanon are facing, such the overall political and security situation in the region, which adversely affected Lebanon in general, particularly banks' balance sheets and income statements. However, we are hopeful that things have taken a turn for the better domestically and regionally. Another challenge is the regulatory authorities' move to become extra conservative in dealing with credit risks. Increased costs have placed a strain on banks' net interest margins and on their attempts to increase the portfolio of interest-earning assets. The increasing regulations on commercial banks have given rise to a risky alternative as well: shadow banking.</p><h4>What are some of your main priorities for 2017?</h4><p>If we do not duly respond to customers' needs and wants, other banks will, since the cost of switching has been reduced to negligible levels. Coping with that reality requires radical thinking. Harnessing big data analytics, social media monitoring, and other new forms of insight to anticipate and respond proactively to changing customer demands are only the icing on the cake. Our capabilities must reflect our customers' changing expectations. We need to maintain a clear line of sight, speed up decision-making, and overcome institutional resistance to change. It is imperative that we shift from product-push to customer solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[among-the-seven]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the current position of Cedrus Bank in the market?</h4><p>The bank quickly secured its position as an important player, both in the private banking and investment space, as well as in commercial retail. We are improving our market share at every level. In 2016, we managed around USD1 billion in assets. We have on-balance sheet business and off-balance sheet business. In the latter we are exceeding USD1.3 billion, while the consolidated figure for the former is around USD650 million. Meanwhile, we are still pursuing our organic growth strategy and improving our delivery channels. The most important of these is digital banking, human resources, and direct sales techniques. We are also focusing on the SME market on the commercial side. We also have an inorganic growth strategy that we are pursuing actively, i.e. to acquire and grow inorganically. That is why we have raised our equity from USD120 million to around USD300 million. As for branch expansion, we now have five branches. We opened two branches in the first three months of 2017. We started the process at the end of 2016. We are opening another three branches this year. Hopefully at the end of the year, we will have eight branches. </p><h4>What are the main challenges that the Lebanese banking sector is currently facing?<br></h4><p>The market for banks, deposits, and loans in Lebanon is growing less than before. There is still interesting growth in deposits, and we have a big deposit base in Lebanon. However, growth has slowed even though it is still positive. The same goes for the loan market. Banks are competing on existing business. This makes competition, pricing, products, ideas, and services quite intense. On the other side are interest rates. The interest rate on USD in Lebanon went up, as did the cost of funding in the last five months. The balance of payment in Lebanon is not as positive as it was previously because of the geo-political situation, mainly because of oil prices. Lebanon used to rely a lot on transfers from the diaspora living in oil-producing countries. This has slowed down lately because of oil prices and the difficulties business people are facing. </p><h4>Why is Cedrus Bank a partner of choice for local and international players in Lebanon?</h4><p>Cedrus Bank understands what private banking means. Therefore, we are quick to respond to clients' requests. Whether the answer is positive or negative, we tell people why. We provide a high level of transparent service, and we are working on alternative delivery channels to lower the reliance on our branch network. This is the global trend. Financially, it is a strong bank, given that it has a large equity of USD300 million compared to its balance sheets.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2017?</h4><p>The main target is to open new branches and launch the new digital banking services we have been working on. We currently offer digital services that already exist in the market, such as third party transfers and account-to-account transfers. We are working on advanced solutions that will make the leap in the digital banking offering. We also want to launch several products targeting the SME market. But our human capital is the most important aspect for the bank. This is why we are working to establish an internal academy where we train people in everything, starting from compliance, risk, and legal issues up to business issues like different lines of private banking and commercial lending. We have a course for each subject where specialists from the bank teach the teams enrolled and are working to have Cedrus among the top seven players in the market, covering different aspects of banking. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led to such a strong year in 2016?</h4><p>There are no miracles or mysteries; the bank's figures highlight the strong performance achieved in the three main markets of the group: Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt. One ought to be careful when reading these figures because consolidated figures are normally expressed in US dollars, while the activity in our material subsidiaries abroad, mainly in Turkey and Egypt, is denominated in local currencies. Those two witnessed severe depreciations in 2016 relative to the US dollar, which has affected the translation of the real performances at the consolidated level. When the Egyptian pound and Turkish lira depreciate, the contribution to the consolidated assets and earnings translates into fewer dollars. It does not mean that the entities have not performed well; it is just a currency translation impact. Had the exchange rates of those currencies been the same as at end-December 2016 as they were as at end-December 2015, the fundamental business in both countries would have increased between 10 and 22%, outperforming in each country the growth achieved by peer banks. That supports and justifies the important results achieved. It is a combination of good performances in Turkey, Egypt, and Lebanon, despite the volatility. </p><h4>Where do you stand relative to your diversification strategy?</h4><p>Today, Egypt represents 7% and Turkey represents 25% of consolidated assets. In four years of average activity, we have succeeded in building USD11 billion of assets in Turkey, generating USD26 million of net profits after tax and provisions in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to USD69 million in 2016. Together they represent almost one-third of total assets and earnings of the group, which falls in line with the group's diversification strategy. With the regional expansion launched in 2006 aiming at achieving a balanced breakdown between Lebanon and abroad, in terms of assets and earnings we are already there. </p><h4>How are the bank's efforts to have a presence in regions such as Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa progressing?</h4><p>We are already covering Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America but without a physical presence there. We have desks for both in Lebanon, Switzerland, and France, not to mention relationship managers that have built a business portfolio of close to USD3 billion there. Those are mainly deposits or assets under management in Switzerland or some trade finance or corporate loans that are mainly granted from Paris and Beirut. When we succeed in building such an important franchise in places where we do not have a physical presence, it says quite a bit about our capacity to build material assets once we are on the ground. </p><h4>What is your vision for economic development in the country this year?</h4><p>Since the outbreak of the Arab Spring and the Syrian war, real GDP growth rates have gone down from 8-9% per annum to 1-2%, which represents a yearly forgone income of no less than 6-7% of GDP. However, things have slightly improved with the resolution of the presidential gridlock. In the case of a settlement in Syria, the favorable spillover effects on Lebanon will be significant. We believe there is room to stimulate domestic consumption and investment and more external demand from the low base of the past few years. </p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the group in Lebanon and the region?</h4><p>As the leader in the Lebanese banking sector, we have a fiduciary responsibility to give an example in terms of governance, compliance, and risk management. We are keen to maintain our leadership at each of these levels. Domestically, it still revolves around consolidating and strengthening our leadership in Lebanon with all that entails in terms of products and service offering, technology and communication investments, and governance, compliance, and risk abidance by the best practices. At the level of foreign businesses, we have clearly set market share targets for our two most material markets: Turkey and Egypt. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones of the ministry since you joined? </h4><p>Seventeen years ago, the Ministry of Finance did not have a lot in place at the institutional level. For instance, the treasury and public accounting were effectively non-existent. Today, we are close to announcing the rebuilding of 24 years of financial accounts. For the first time, Lebanon will have financial accounts as they are required by the constitution and our laws. This is an important milestone. On the other hand, we were seeing the debt grow quickly and did not have a proper debt management office. I introduced this some time ago, and now it is doing extremely well in managing the debt. We also recently had a fantastic turn out for the Eurobond issuing, and we are managing to keep interest rates within the previous range, even though these are rising all over the world. </p><h4>Lebanon has not ratified a budget since 2005. How is the proposal for the new budget evolving?</h4><p>We are now in the process of passing one. In the meantime, we have introduced a new macro fiscal unit that has quickly developed a medium term expenditure framework for Lebanon despite the absence of voted budgets. A medium-term debt strategy was also developed. Clearly, we are becoming an institution that is up to the required standards. At the policy level, we have been active, too. Of course, the governance situation in Lebanon did not help. Although it took more time than appropriate, we have managed to upgrade the legal framework in order to provide financial soundness and improved safety nets, and of course, now it looks like Lebanon is embarking on developing its infrastructure. There is a strong commitment from the president, prime minister, and the system in approving the budget. </p><h4>What is Lebanon's ability to manage its public debt?</h4><p>We have no worries and are confident that the buffers that exist within the financial sector are doing their job. Lebanon remains an attractive place for investors, and it has proven to be safe. It is clear that the level of trust in the system is high, and no investor or depositor has lost a penny in this country for many years, despite everything we have been through. </p><h4>Recently the VAT was increased, public notary fees have been doubled, and tax on cement and construction licenses have gone up. What other measures are set to come?</h4><p>The new tax measures have yet to be approved by parliament, but for the time being, there is an effort being made for the salaries and wage bill. The tax measures are discussed in parallel, and there is still room for changing some of the measures. One that has already been negotiated is the increase in VAT by 1% from 10% to 11%, but it could still be opposed. The Ministry of Finance has come up with a draft for tax measures that are much more focused on closing tax loopholes. For example, individuals in Lebanon are not taxed on capital gains. This is a tax that would eliminate a systematical bias in favor of rent, against labor and investment. Another measure is to increase the interest rate tax from 5-7%, knowing that the tax on dividends is 10%. That would introduce a fair treatment between productive investment and rent income.</p><h4>What are the main goals and priorities for the ministry for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We have a clear agenda of coming back to normal institutional work: passing a budget, continuing the public accounts reconstruction, and returning to legality. We would also like to finalize the new debt strategy in the medium term, and to have a medium term expenditure framework approved by the cabinet. We also want to promote a nationwide infrastructure program and increase tax compliance and collection. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What prompted the Central Bank to launch its financial engineering swap operation?</h4><p>The unexpected flow of Syrian refugees has strained already unstable public finances, service delivery mechanisms, infrastructure, and the environment. According to the ILO, an estimated 170,000 Lebanese have fallen into poverty, and the unemployment rate has doubled to around 20%. Overall real economic losses of around USD13 billion have been incurred thus far. The situation was also exacerbated by political paralysis. In effect, the main economic indicators, namely foreign trade, tourism, investment, and consumption, have been steadily decreasing since 2011. As a consequence, the debt-to-GDP ratio has risen to around 144%; the fiscal deficit reached 8% of GDP, aggravated by the absence of a public budget for a decade now; GDP growth has decreased from 8% in 2010 to around 2% today. </p><h4>What does this swap operation mean for the Central Bank and the economy in general?</h4><p>One of the chief objectives of the financial engineering BDL undertook was to strengthen the Central Bank's foreign currency assets. A strong balance sheet is essential to maintaining exchange and interest rate stability, which is in turn necessary to achieve sustainable economic development. After the swap operation, BDL's foreign currency assets reached a historical record, which confers stability on the Lebanese pound and on interest rates. Other objectives this scheme targeted include beefing up the capital base of banks, increasing the liquidity in local currency, improving the government debt profile by reducing the cost of borrowing, improving the balance of payments status, targeting positive inflation rate below 4%, and improving the country's rating and outlook. </p><h4>Lebanon's economic growth is projected to more than double to 2.5% in 2017. How does BDL analyze this?</h4><p>BDL's outlook for the current year is a positive one. We expect economic growth to pick up even further, with estimated growth rates of more than 2% and inflation contained below our 4% target. Moreover, the recent financial engineering scheme has had a positive impact on both the monetary and banking fronts. The balance of payments recorded a surplus of USD1.3 billion in 2016. The banking sector remains strong despite the pressing challenges that took a toll on its advancement. Its performance remains healthy and enduring: total banking activity grew by more than 9% with total bank assets exceeding USD205 billion in March 2017. Customer deposits have increased by around 8% to reach a new high of USD174 billion, with additional funds of around USD10 billion entering the banking sector. Lending activity recorded a 5.4% growth during 2016, with total credit to the private sector exceeding USD58 billion in March 2017. Our stimulus packages  have been renewed for the fourth consecutive year with an average of USD1 billion per year. </p><h4>Currently, FDI in Lebanon accounts for 6.7% of national GDP. In which sectors do you foresee the most potential?</h4><p>The Lebanese knowledge economy has been a new and important driver of economic growth, which is why BDL has focused on developing this sector by increasing the margin of funds that banks can dedicate to financing this sector and authorizing them to invest, with BDL's guarantee, up to 4% of their own funds, compared to 3% previously. After only three years, the Lebanese knowledge economy has attracted 800 start-ups, created 6,000 jobs, and increased national wealth by around USD1 billion. We expect this sector to grow by around 7-9% per year in the next three years. </p><h4>What benefits does Lebanon offer investors, and how is BDL working to attract these flows?</h4><p>BDL's efforts have been channeled in the past 20 years to building a prudent financial model, which has inspired confidence in the system. It has been dedicated to strengthening monetary policy, pushing modernization forward, achieving sustainable economic growth and financial sector stability, and fostering transparency. Our banking model itself is the main attraction for investment, with proven resilience and competitiveness over time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated you to get started in this field? </h4><p><strong>ALBERT KHOURY </strong>Power cuts are a regular feature of the energy sector in Lebanon, and for me, they presented an opportunity. In evaluating the issues of the sector, we must consider the sector as a whole. We consider distribution, transmission, and generation. It is not difficult to realize the problem is the generation aspect. In order to improve this aspect, we had to look at the resources that are available for generation in Lebanon. In terms of this, we realized there were plenty of solar and wind resources. This was in 2008. We signed an agreement with the ministry to produce a 60-MW project. The ministry wanted a long-term solution for the power cuts issue, and in order to have sustainable energy production, we believed we should focus on wind power. As of 2008, we carried out several environmental studies. In 2010, the government revealed information on the best location for wind resources. It is no secret that Lebanon has some of the best wind resources in the region. We did the research and chose this site.</p><p><span></span><strong>NOHAD I. BOUDANI</strong> The Lebanon Green Building Council started in 2008. The main mission for us at that time was to promote green buildings because at that time no one had any idea about it in Lebanon. Asking anyone 10 years ago what a green building was, they would have said the color was green. We saw that it was all about awareness. We are still trying to make people aware of green buildings, what the idea is, and why it is important. In Lebanon, we have an energy and electricity crisis, as we do not have enough production to meet consumption, which leads to cuts. They were always thinking about making more energy from fossil fuels to cope with the demand, but it is not the solution because consumption is going to increase every year unless there are better ideas and policies for energy efficiency. The solution for us at that time was to lower our consumption and add some power plants as a compromise. We also have a crisis of water due to bad management, in addition to the waste management problem. It is bizarre to have a waste problem in 2016. We also did not have an understanding of the importance of indoor air quality or what is now called the indoor environmental quality.</p><h4>What are some of your goals going forward? </h4><p><span></span><strong>AK </strong>Lebanon will play a huge role, hopefully, as an exporter of renewable energy when Syria comes back to the market. It is important for the government to fund these projects because it has a huge potential for solar and other energy sources. We have the data, information, availability, and willingness to provide the service. Syria does not have a lot of oil, but it does have wind and solar resources. Unfortunately, some countries are ahead of us, such as Turkey and Jordan. We hope the government will push hard enough from Lebanon to be aggressive in Syria and get ahead of the competition. In Lebanon, contrary to developed countries such as Spain, France, or the US, the cost of production is much lower. That makes the costs of our renewable energy services competitive. As a result, we do not require subsidies or financial incentives from the government, but we do need them to establish a proper legal framework for us to operate, including investments in the sector.</p><p><span></span><strong>NB </strong>We are working with LIBNOR, which is a Lebanese institution in charge of producing Lebanese standards, and we are part of the committee that is in charge of establishing green standards, called the TC 205. This project will take about one year to finish. This standard is going to be a big jump because we do not have a green standard here in Lebanon. First, we have to establish a standard and then make it a law. A standard is not compulsory, but the law is, so the first step is to have the standard then we will work on making it the law. We have already made green criteria into a book that is free; this was done in collaboration with several other engineers, and readers learn about technologies and ideas on how to be green. Also, one of our projects is to develop another version of ARZ rating system for new construction and to develop the green course in collaboration with the order of engineers and architects in Beirut and candidates can attend this course and will earn a certification as a green expert after succeeding an exam. We will still work with local authorities to promote green schools, streets, and roofs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Municipality of Beirut has set aside USD240 million for its 2017 budget. What is the strategy for its expenditure?</h4><p>A large portion of the budget focuses on investment projects that will have a high return for Beirut. These are split into infrastructure and environmental projects, such as increasing the number of green spaces and other services. In 2016, the municipality launched a six-year plan, in which the main highlight are a final solution for waste management. We have launched a tender for the sweeping of streets and trash collection using the latest technology, including underground bins. Sorting from the source is a major goal. This is why we will provide different colored trash bins. The tender will be due in June 2017, and we expect to have a contractor on the ground by the beginning of 2018 with new trucks, new technology, and state-of-the-art operations. From there, the waste will go to a plant to be sorted and treated before being transformed into energy.</p><h4>What are the highlights of the municipality's plan for building a waste-to-energy plant?</h4><p>This plant will provide a portion of the energy supply. Protecting the environment is also one of our biggest objectives. With this project, we have also launched a tender to plant almost 6,000 trees along the streets of Beirut. In addition, all the new infrastructure projects will instruct contractors to plant trees along the sidewalk and make provisions for bike lanes and pedestrian traffic. This will facilitate the use of pedestrian walkways and bicycles, and reduce the environmental impact of cars and motorcycles. We encourage people to walk; however, this cannot be done unless the infrastructure is present. In addition, Beirut needs to be more organized. We have already launched a tender for street and directional signs; all streets will be named and numbered, with a standard design and signs. We have more than 10 infrastructure projects this year that have already been launched—nearly a project per area per month. In June, we will launch a tender to change all the street lighting in Beirut to LED bulbs. This will save at least 50% of the electricity bill and reduce emissions. Organization, infrastructure, and environmental projects are our aims for 2017-2018.</p><h4>How are your efforts to boost partnerships between the private and public sectors progressing?</h4><p>Extremely well. The waste-to-energy plant is built on that prospect, and we will be in partnership with investors and developers to build it. We also have major projects coming up in partnership with investors and the public that will help put Beirut back on the tourism map in the region.</p><h4>What does Beirut offer to foreign investors and companies that want to establish operations in the city?</h4><p>Investors require the right infrastructure, including high-speed internet, proper communication, and management of the transportation sector, which is another large project that we are working on. We have a public transportation project for 2018 to introduce a bus system and are building bus stations. This will also be a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, inviting investors to participate. This will reduce the number of cars entering Beirut; we have 750,000 cars going in and out of Beirut every day and would like to significantly reduce that. We are also building parking garages in major key areas and at the entrances of Beirut. People can drop off their cars at the entrance to the city and enter via the bus system. This will also be a private-public partnership.</p><h4>With five years more to your mandate, what are your goals and priorities?</h4><p>Our priorities are the environment and making Beirut a healthier and friendlier environment. We are renovating and upgrading all the clinics the municipality operates. We issue medical cards for the less well off so they can receive medical treatment at a low cost. The Municipality of Beirut has strong relations with other ministries, like the Minister of the Public Sector, Power, Oil and Gas, Health, and the Environment.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you plan to achieve 12% renewable energy by 2020?</h4><p>According to the Ministry of Energy and Water, which is responsible for implementing the goal of reaching 12% of renewable energy in Lebanon by 2020, there are companies currently bidding for the selection of sites to build 200MW of wind power plants. The Ministry of Energy and Water intends to produce 180MW of solar energy by the year 2020. It is expected that the solar water heaters will be adopted over an area of no less than 1 million sqm.</p><h4>Lebanon is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. What are your expectations in this regard?</h4><p>Lebanon has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2030 as an unconditional goal and by 30% as a goal conditional on international support. The plan includes increasing the proportion of renewable energy and heating to 15% unconditionally and 20% if there is international support. We are also planning on increasing the energy efficiency ratio by 3% unconditionally and 10% conditionally. In the transport sector, our unconditional goal is to increase this 36%, or to 48% in the event of adequate international support. The plan also includes a 20% increase in the proportion of cars capable of fueling consumption. In the forestry sector, 20 million trees will be planted by 2030 to absorb carbon emissions. This number could reach 26 million if the appropriate support is available. And for the waste sector, we want to reduce this by 25%. The plan also includes treating 51% of wastewater. </p><h4>What are the key initiatives taken by the ministry to prevent another waste crisis in the country?</h4><p>The role of municipalities in the integrated management of solid waste is still crucial. The ministry issued circular No. 8/1 on November 16, 2015, concerning some guidelines on the integrated management of solid household waste to municipalities, municipal federations, and governors. This deals with the hierarchy of waste management from the reduction of waste production to reusing and recycling, energy extraction, and the rehabilitation of distorted sites. In addition to the above-mentioned technical support, the ministry is seeking financial support through grants, most recently a EU grant of EUR13 million for the Protection and Sustainable Development of Marine Resources in Lebanon project. </p><h4>How does your ministry work alongside the Ministry of Energy and Water and the Petroleum Sector Management Authority to ensure proper environmentally friendly procedures for future exploration in oil and gas?</h4><p>In 2010/2011, we prepared a strategic environmental assessment study with funding from the Ministry of Energy and Water that had a number of recommendations based on the activities proposed in the Sustainable Development of Oil and Gas in Lebanon (SUDIL) project. </p><h4>As Environment Minister, what are your main priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>I have seven priorities: first, the initiation of a transition to a circular economy starting with the integrated management of solid waste and the rehabilitation of quarry sites. Second, the protection of water resources from pollution by following up on the implementation of the road map to combat the pollution of Lake Qaraoun and the Litani river, while preparing similar plans for other rivers. Third, reversing the phenomenon of random urban extension and conserving biological diversity, starting with guidelines for the protection of mountain tops and natural areas and regulating investment in beaches, green spaces, and agricultural lands, as well as the rehabilitation of quarry sites. Fourth, continuing to stimulate climate action. Fifth, reducing the environmental impact of the crisis of displaced Syrians. Sixth, activating a system of environmental control and application of environmental laws. And finally, we must complete our National Strategy for Sustainable Development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Only Way is Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-only-way-is-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>MG Holding has been in the market for 70 years. How would you describe the evolution of the holding since then?</h4><p>MG Holding is the holding for a group of companies that are mostly fully owned subsidiaries. The group is diversified in many business sectors and geographical areas. The healthcare sector is where we started, and that company is still a family business. We are also in the telecommunications and security business, a domain in which we have several more firms. Here the main ones are Lunasat, a large system integrator company, and Guardia Systems, whose specialties are low current, IT, and security. Another telecom entity is Intrasky, in partnership with the ITG Group. Intrasky is focused on satellite communications whose footprint and areas of operation spans from Afghanistan to the Western Sahara. Aviation services in Lebanon are another aspect, with Sky Lounge Services based at Beirut International Airport. The company is also a licensed air taxi operator and does private air charters. MG Holding is also in the real estate development and contracting business with our own private and commercial development. We do many real estate investments in Lebanon in order to remain diversified. We keep most of our developments and rent them out, rather than selling. We have done large real estate development projects in Iraq and several projects in oil and gas. Our oil and gas company is based in Basra in southern Iraq and works with major IOCs. </p><h4>Is MG Holding planning to diversify into other sectors?</h4><p>Not at present. We did all our expansion work in 2012-2013. At that time, the price of oil was around USD120 per barrel, governments had large budgets and were offering numerous infrastructure projects, and there were not enough resources to do all the projects on offer. That is when we diversified our activities to support our main businesses. However, 2014 was a tough year for all of us after the drop in oil prices, the Syrian conflict, and the ISIS invasion in Iraq. Very few of those governments were forecasting or planning for the future. Oil prices fell and their budgets were completely depressed. At the same time, we suffered major setbacks in three of our projects in Iraq. First was our real estate development in Salahuddin, followed by projects in Mosul and Diyala. Therefore, we refocused, concentrated on our core businesses, and diverted some of our resources elsewhere. Diversification is important because it keeps a good balance across the whole portfolio. To give an example from one of our companies, Guardia Systems is by far the largest security integrator company in Lebanon today. It undertook the CCTV surveillance project for the city of Beirut. Many of our competitors claimed that a single Lebanese company could not do the job. It is 100% working today, and we have a five-year operation and maintenance contract with the government. </p><h4>What are the biggest challenges you face as a leader when doing business in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are lucky to be born and living in this country. In Lebanon, one is born with plans A, B, and C; this is the true reason for our success. When we work on projects both inside and outside Lebanon, we think about the project itself and about providing electricity, water, transportation, and so forth. We think about everything and make sure we have a solution for everything. This is the biggest advantage we have over other international companies. </p><h4>What are your goals and priorities at MG Holding for 2018?</h4><p>We are refocusing and looking to expand around our core businesses. Our goal is to be among the top tier in whatever we do. We are very bullish about the situation and very optimistic by nature. In disruptions, there are opportunities, and in deadlocks, there are solutions. I personally see many opportunities ahead. Lebanon has reached rock bottom economically; the only way forward is to go up. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones and achievements for Fattal over its 120 years?</h4><p>Several milestones and a few turning points have marked our journey. Founded in 1897 in Damascus by our great-grandfather, the company succeeded in overcoming the hardships of WWI and WWII while first establishing an office in Beirut in 1926. In fact, the first exclusive agency that we acquired goes back to 1918, with sewing needles. By 1936, we had acquired several multinational agencies, including, among others, Bacardi Martini, Unilever, Bayer, and Schering. From the 1950s onwards, the golden age of Lebanon, the company witnessed an important period of growth by acquiring several more top firms in various industries. In 1965, our offices in Damascus were shut down, forcing our grandfathers to bravely continue their mission in Lebanon. The Lebanese civil war was yet another hit the company had to overcome with exemplary resilience in the 1970s. The 1980s saw the creation of Fattal Holding with a new era of technological advancement and further diversification of industries, on top of a rapid development of commercial representations. In 2000, we started to expand across the MENA and beyond, namely in Egypt, Algeria, the UAE, Jordan, Iraq, and France. </p><h4>Are you planning further expansion to new markets?</h4><p>Although our DNA is Levantine, we want to expand further in the MENA. We already have several suppliers in the aforementioned countries who would like to venture with us into new territories. These opportunities are all being studied. Especially in our turbulent part of the world, these expansions must be carefully assessed based on risks and opportunities and with full due diligence. While the size of a given industry might look attractive in a certain country, the regulatory environment could make it difficult to do business. We ventured into Sudan and had to withdraw due to severely adverse factors, although we know how to handle tough situations. On the other hand, we still have room for diversifying our lines of business where we operate. Understanding the dynamics of a country facilitates this. Nothing can be as precious as experience in the field and full knowledge of a consumer's habits and attitudes. </p><h4>The group handles a large product portfolio. Is the key of your success in diversification? <br></h4><p>Yes. That said, our diversification has been within the distribution mission itself. You see, in order to succeed in what you are doing, you need to be specialized, especially when the competition among distributors is intense. Our diversification is in our industries and geographies. We operate in seven independent lines of business, each having its own expertise and success drivers, structured in totally independent entities. FMCG is different from healthcare, and beauty is different from medical equipment or office equipment. Diversification balances risk and contributes in overcoming industry downturns. For example, when the pharmaceutical sector is hit, beauty or FMCG is there to compensate, and vice versa. Our industry diversification gives us a strong leverage across various distribution channels, from modern trade accounts to pharmacies and other channels. For instance, our FMCG brands benefit from the strong ties we have in the pharmacy channel, while our small home appliances benefit from our strong ties with the FMCG modern trade accounts. In terms of industries, FMCG and healthcare represent 80% of our business. We aim to reach a turnover of USD1 billion in the short-term. Although Lebanon still represents more than 50% of total turnover, our affiliates are steadily growing in various industries. With Iraq hopefully recovering soon and our resilient teams on the ground there, our growth objectives will be even more ambitious. We will never let go, irrespective of the country challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	How is your plan to expand to South Africa progressing?
</h4><p>
	Having for several years seen businesses opening up on the continent, we have built a strong partnership with a local boutique law firm that has offices in Johannesburg and Cape Town and has now merged with Eptalex. It has been a strategic expansion, considering the excellent existing ties and relations between Lebanon and South Africa, the active Lebanese community there, and the level of education, facilities, and size of the economy. We provide a key presence in supporting businesspersons willing to seize opportunities there. In fact, South Africa has many attractive assets for investors; tourism, construction, mining, and financial services are currently the most appealing ones.</p><h4>In which fields do you have a competitive advantage over other firms in Lebanon?</h4><p>
	Before founding Eptalex in 2015 and expanding in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, we had been known for providing efficient and quality legal services to local and international businesses in Lebanon for over 40 years. Today, and as part of the global firm Eptalex, we are able to rely on more than 70 lawyers from different backgrounds and specialties to provide our clients with personalized and expert legal work with in-depth understanding of their businesses in Lebanon and abroad.</p><h4>The Lebanese parliament recently issued a new flat tax on all Lebanese businesses. What other regulatory changes do you expect in the medium term?</h4><p>
	Lebanon has been improving its regulatory framework to comply with international standards regarding financial transparency and the fight against illicit financial flows. On May 12, it signed the multilateral Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters, putting itself in a stronger position toward its international partners. Parliament is also working to fund public sector wage increases by raising new taxes, stamping duties on phone bills and judicial records, public notary fees, alcoholic beverages, income and revenues, and VAT. Furthermore, since the bid process for oil and gas exploration was resumed, parliament has been working on a new specific taxation law for petroleum activities.</p><h4>What should foreign companies be aware of before entering Lebanon?</h4><p>
	They should bear in mind that, first of all, Lebanon is a free market economy based on an unrestricted exchange of goods, services, and capital. Secondly, despite its relatively small internal market, it serves as a privileged platform for access to the markets of the Middle East and Gulf. Thirdly, the tax regulation is favorable for those who want to restructure their global businesses and take advantage of the Double Taxation Agreements our country has signed with 32 countries, including Italy, France, Malta, Cyprus, Egypt, and the UAE. Last but not least, the market offers a young, dynamic, polyglot, and well-educated population.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>
	The year ahead presents great opportunities. The international market maintains an attentive and proactive approach toward more transparency and compliance. As a natural consequence of this process, companies and individuals with assets in different jurisdictions will consider business restructuring and advice to protect capital and comply with global and domestic regulations. The world is also facing interesting developments in the energy sector. Although the Paris agreement on climate change has been challenged by the biggest economic power, many states and private companies are willing to pursue the change and collaborate to increase cross-border cooperation and investments in the energy industry. As an international law firm, we continue to follow these developments and advise our clients on all related legal issues and opportunities. For the year ahead, Eptalex is also boosting its relationship with prominent and service-oriented law firms in attractive markets, thanks to our membership in international law firm networks like GBL Alliance. As such, we will be able to better serve our clients with expert and tailor-made solutions for their transactions worldwide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate Kafalat's operations over the past year?</h4><p>The country is still in a position of heightened crisis and landlocked from within. The region has become economically strained. Even though the price of oil has recovered a little, the impact of the commodity crisis has been more severe in the Gulf countries, which are some of Lebanon's main partners. That has kept a certain pressure on the economy, but we have coped so far. There is a positive mood, as we have political consensus and a new government was formed. With Kafalat as an indicator, our figures for 2016 were slightly better than in 2015. The start of 2017 and the adjustments in the political situation have not yet shown an increase in our activity. I expect, as we calculate on four to six months' delay, changes in the environment because our target is for entrepreneurs to identify possible opportunities to tackle in the market. In four to six months, we will evaluate the changes and develop a plan for economic anticipation, make decisions, and determine how our business is being affected.</p><h4>How is Kafalat targeting SMEs or start-ups in creative sectors?<br></h4><p>These projects are perceived as high risk for the banking sector from the start, though it is a sector that does not have much knowledge of this part of the process. By giving our initial 75% guarantee, we equalize the start-ups in innovation at nearly the same level as conventional businesses, reducing risks for the bank. Of course, there is still a high risk, but we reduce the gap statically and behaviorally speaking. To help them flourish, we have created a program, Kafalat Innovation, which guarantees up to 90%, leaving little risk to the bank. It started in 2006, and we also allow these companies to be treated differently from others with a system that tries to create an extra push for this sector. We are issuing this kind of loan as a replacement for the concept of seed capital, which was not available in the country at that time. As for seed investments, we are planning to take about 50% of the investment that companies need, which winds up being around USD400,000 per shot. We do this because the seed level is where we can concentrate the feed process. In addition to equity, we have a USD2.5-million program in grant funds. We give a small nonrefundable grant of USD15,000 for young people who have a business plan in the early stages. Over the past 15 months, we have given 87 such grants, 20 of which have been able to access equity afterward. In the past two years alone, the Central Bank of Lebanon issued 331 circulars for permitting banks to participate within strict limits in early stage VC capital investment. This has generated a massive field of operations. </p><h4>What role has Kafalat played in the socio-economic development of Lebanon?</h4><p>We act as a booster of different sectors by providing guarantees. When we target the industries and give them guarantees, things start to work. Our maximum loans are of for seven years, but for a tree-growing entrepreneur, for example, we provide a 10-year loan. We adapt to the needs of companies. We create ease for a more dynamic lending market for SMEs of various kinds. We entered with the help of the EU into the green energy market, where we have two programs, one 10- and one 15-year loan program because sustainable energy is a long-term pursuit. </p><h4>What are your main priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our priority is to stand by ourselves. We are there to expand and incentivize the direct players. They must be institutional investors—we will not partner with an informal investor. Our investment committee has to approve the venture capital or seed capital fund, thus it has to have a professional dimension. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Lebanon's capacity for increasing its short-term FDI flows?</h4><p>Lebanon can offer a lot to investors, and our slogan for this year is “the pleasure of doing business.“ Any investor can benefit from the business climate in Lebanon, human resources, lifestyle, quality of education, and all the fundamentals of an open market economy. It is true that the Lebanese economy has been affected by the Syrian conflict since 2011, but now, with the election of the new president and the formation of the government, we are expecting more political stability, which will contribute to the achievement of our ultimate goal, the enhancement of our business climate. Lebanon is on the right track and will be able to achieve larger growth in the years to come, especially with the launch of oil and gas extraction plans and the reconstruction of Syria. </p><h4>Local, international, and Arab investors are key to the country; however, the diaspora also plays an important role. How is IDAL working for diaspora Lebanese to invest in their homeland?</h4><p>Our target investors, the ones that have invested in Lebanon historically, are split into four main categories: local investors, the diaspora, Gulf Arabs, and multinational companies that provide goods and services or use Lebanon as a regional hub. However, due to the conflict in the region, of these main categories only two invested between 2011 and 2016: locals and the diaspora. Regarding the latter, we have been doing a lot recently; we participated at the LDE conferences held in New York, Sío Paulo, and South Africa. Organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, these were aimed at encouraging diaspora investors not only to invest in Lebanon, but also to be connected with the country through three main axes: by investing in Lebanon and creating partnerships with Lebanese companies; enhancing trade between Lebanon and their host countries; and by encouraging them to adopt Lebanon as an outsourcing hub, given our high-quality products, components, and services. </p><h4>How is IDAL working to push for new markets? <br></h4><p>We have launched a range of programs that subsidize exports in the industrial and agricultural sectors, such as the Agri Plus and Agromap Programs. We have also launched the MLeb (maritime Lebanese exports bridge) initiative in response to the closure of all our land borders due to the Syrian crisis. Although the aim of this initiative is to maintain our products' presence in the traditional markets, we wanted exporters to adapt to maritime transportation so they can go much farther and access new markets in the Americas, Europe, and Australia. IDAL also supports the promotion of the agrofood exports to regional and international markets by increasing the competitiveness of exporters, providing agrofood products with a wider exposure to foreign markets, and giving companies financial assistance to participate in international food fairs such as SIAL, Gulfood, Anuga, Fancy Food Show, and Horeca. </p><h4>What is Lebanon's capacity for becoming a start-up hub in the region?</h4><p>In 2017, IDAL launched a program as a business supporter to help start-ups get their operations off the ground in Lebanon. It will help them with the legal infrastructure, how to register their company, trademark, and idea, and how to secure the money for investment. </p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>As a key government player in economic development and as the country's national investment promotion agency, IDAL's plan for 2017 will focus mainly on increasing employment opportunities in the outskirts of the capital, with an increasing focus on the areas with the highest incidence of overall and youth unemployment. To that end, IDAL will partner with public and private sector stakeholders as well as international organizations to identify concrete investment opportunities in selected regions and work on mobilizing financing to ensure implementation of these opportunities. Special focus will be placed on identifying projects in the agrofood and industrial sectors using new technologies to enhance productivity and competitiveness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the evolution of the business environment in the wake of the new political stability? </h4><p>The business environment in Lebanon has grown used to unrest and political instability over the decades; therefore, it is hard to see real quantifiable evolution in development or growth. However, the general sentiment is optimistic and hopeful. Most corporations are starting to feel the positive effects and would say that business is “doing better.“ People are more confident, ready to take risks, and venture into new businesses because the political situation is stabilized.</p><h4>How will the policies of the US president affect economic relations between the US and MENA? </h4><p>The AmCham MENA Council aims to promote intraregional trade relationships, while promoting the region as a whole to the US. So far, we have not seen any negative effect on economic relations between countries in the region. President Trump is a businessman at heart, and it seems that he has the interest of the private sector, so we hope this will affect us positively rather than negatively.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the Startup Lebanon-Silicon Valley Roadshow? </h4><p>Caravan Beirut was a showcase of Lebanese designers, artists, and creativity in general. We managed to attract hundreds of people to our pop-up exhibition over four days in the middle of M Street in Georgetown, DC, and to put the spotlight on the alternative and unique side of Lebanon. Everyone was impressed with the talent and capabilities of the Lebanese. Which brings us to another related sector that we have been promoting heavily for the past two years: the start-up and entrepreneurial world, which has been on the rise for the past few years. We started with “Startup Lebanon“ in New York City in 2015, followed by the “Startup Lebanon Silicon Valley Roadshow“ in September 2016. Both initiatives were extraordinary in their reach and outcome, and were extremely successful in fulfilling their main mission: to showcase and promote Lebanese entrepreneurs and start-ups to an audience of investors, diaspora, accelerators, and other successful Lebanese start-ups in the US, while giving young entrepreneurs and the Lebanese start-up ecosystem a taste of the famous American tech story, particularly in Silicon Valley. We still have plans for future initiatives that will emerge in due time. </p><h4>How is AmCham working to educate SMEs about new regulations and opportunities? </h4><p>AmCham is a platform for exchange of knowledge and a resource for awareness and advocacy. We have several committees that work on sector-specific concerns, and throughout the year we organize various workshops, conferences, roundtables, and meetings to discuss and advocate for key issues that are important to our member companies, most of which are SMEs. We are also a network that connects companies and creates opportunities for its members. </p><h4>Which sectors are currently the most attractive for investors? </h4><p>Energy and alternative energy, oil and gas, financial technologies, hospitality and tourism, technology start-ups, and food and beverage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[hail-to-the-hard-and-nimble]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your main mission, and how would you evaluate your progress in the past 30 years?</h4><p>We are proud to be an elite group, and new members must firstly receive an invitation from two existing members and be subject to a vote requiring a two-thirds majority of the board before they can join. Additionally, our organization is totally apolitical; if any member becomes a minister or political representative, their membership is temporarily frozen. This helps us maintain complete independence. Many of our members become active in the political realm, because we believe it is important to have the Lebanese private sector play a key role in the direction of the country. Economically, Lebanon has survived several episodes of instability, essentially thanks to its private sector. Our major objective is to bring different business people together at the same table. We participate, in one way or another, in almost all major economic decisions in Lebanon.</p><h4>How are you promoting greater cooperation between the public and private sectors to encourage more stable socioeconomic development?</h4><p>Over the last two years, we have presented five laws. As a lobby, we are able to pass several types of economic laws. Whilst general public-private partnership (PPP) laws are difficult to pass, highly technical economic laws are much easier to gather support for. As a matter of fact, many members of parliament frequently ask for our input. In Lebanon, business-lobbying groups can present laws on condition they are signed by 10 MPs. We, however, usually gather up to 50 signatures on the laws we present. Politicians understand that we have no political agenda; rather we are solely focused on business. The points of strength that have fueled the success of Lebanese companies in the last 30 years have dramatically shifted, and a change of mentality is now necessary to survive. Most of the successful Lebanese companies were developed and grew in times of war, which means they are resilient and flexible. These companies now simply need to adjust to the new environment.</p><h4>What will be the economic impact of having a new president?</h4><p>The 29-month presidential vacuum halted the economic cycle of the country, leading to a decrease in foreign investments by 50%, from USD4.85 billion in 2010 to USD2.4 billion in 2016. Thus, the long-awaited political agreement was a tremendous positive shot in the arm for the economy and the country as a whole. We have been paying a high price for regional tensions over the last five years. It is the first time since WWI that so many armed conflicts are simultaneously raging in the region. We should not forget that our economy is based on the region's growth. </p><h4>What are the main attractions and challenges for investors?</h4><p>Lebanon's sovereign risk has been quite stable over the last 30 years. In Lebanon, we have an acceptable judicial system that ensures the protection of investors' rights. Furthermore, we are working to increase the return on investment. Currently, ROI in the country is only 5-7%, which is alarmingly low. Our major objective is to reduce sovereign risk and collaborate with different companies to boost ROI. Lebanon is a hub for the region, hence multinationals with regional ambitions operate out of Beirut. We are focused on attracting international companies interested in relocating here that will play a major role in rebuilding Syria, which is poised to take place out of Lebanon. Naturally, we will not rebuild Syria all by ourselves, but will play a major role in facilitating its reconstruction. </p><h4>What are some of RDCL World's main goals and priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>First, we are looking to close 2017 with substantial growth (2-2.5%). Second, we want to create new micro-companies. The most dynamic engine of a small economy like ours revolves around new entrepreneurs and SMEs. Our economic ecosystem must be changed, and here comes the necessity for new blood willing and able to tackle complex issues. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon's economic growth is projected to double in 2017. How does the ministry evaluate these prospects?</h4><p>The prolonged crisis in Syria continues to dominate Lebanon's outlook, with losses exceeding USD13 billion to date as per the World Bank's estimation. Moreover, growth has been subdued due to further pressures on the economy's depleted infrastructure, chronic trade and fiscal deficits, and the lack of public and private investment. However, the major political breakthrough with the election of the president and the formation of the government will help boost confidence in the economy and return growth to 2007-2010 levels. Moreover, we see consumer and investor sentiment improving alongside inflows of tourists and capital. However, the country will only see positive improvements if structural reforms aimed at improving consumer and investor confidence, boosting economic growth, accelerating deposit flows, and strengthening financial stability are implemented. These must reduce infrastructure bottlenecks (mainly through the adoption of the PPP law), enhance the business environment for Lebanese enterprises to grow and create jobs, and encourage investment in sectors where Lebanon holds a comparative advantage.</p><h4>What initiatives is the ministry taking to protect those sectors considered at risk, such agriculture or industry?</h4><p>The Protection of National Production Legislation was adopted in 2008 and governs the international commercial practices that cause injury or threaten domestic industry or agriculture in Lebanon, or hinder the establishment of these sectors, specifically when a given agricultural or industrial product is being dumped or subsidized by foreign governments. We also have anti-dumping, countervailing, and safeguarding mechanisms to protect any Lebanese sector or product at risk from increased imports.</p><h4>What steps have been taken to improve Lebanon's balance of trade?<br></h4><p>The Ministry of Economy and Trade is developing a strategy aimed at balancing trade flows with new and existing markets such as Mercosur, Africa, Iran, Russia, and others. Our aim is to work toward decreasing the gap between our imports and exports by selling more wine, olive oil and agro-industrial products, jewelry, fashion, crafts, and ICT.</p><h4>What are the ministry's priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our priority is to build on what has been done in the previous years, mainly with regard to undertaking the necessary procedures aimed at protecting the Lebanese consumer, attracting FDI and spurring exports, enhancing SME development, and mitigating the impact of spillover from the ongoing Syrian crisis. In regard to consumer protection, we believe that a well-informed and well-protected consumer is critical to a strong and stable economy. We will continue to stress the important role played by the Directorate of Consumer Protection at the ministry. On the FDI and exports level, our goal is to enhance the business climate to encourage investment, trade, and the movement of capital inflows. This will mainly be done by strengthening current relations and establishing new ones by opening up to new non-classical markets to trigger investments and spur Lebanese exports. This comes in addition to improving market access through the participation of Lebanese companies in international exhibitions with partner countries. With regard to SME development, we will undertake the needed steps to ensure the implementation of the National Strategy for Small and Medium Enterprises launched in December 2014. This will allow for growth and job creation. We are organizing roundtables, joining major stakeholders, tackling important topics, and covering all the regions in Lebanon. Finally, the ongoing Syrian crisis has had a tremendous spillover effect on our economy. As such, our goal is to mitigate this as much as we can. Work will be done through an inter-ministerial committee, the LCRP, which will identify needs and budgets. Meanwhile, international committee support is extremely crucial for getting the needed funds to cover Lebanon's development, humanitarian, and relief needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

It is truly influential in the formulation and shaping of our foreign policy regarding politics and economy. We are a small country that prioritizes preserving its modernity and entity as one country united in how we are diversified. What we seek from our foreign policy is security and stability in the country. Our main messenger here is our diaspora, since it reflects the great image of Lebanon. We have been successful in terms of our performance and the progress we have made in gathering the diaspora together and making it more effective. We want to connect it with Lebanon and connect Lebanon with the world.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the results of the Lebanese Diaspora Energy Conference?</h4><p>It was successful—we had around 2,000 people from 100 countries participate. We launched many projects connecting them with Lebanon, setting up programs with the Lebanese Diaspora Fund to invest in Lebanese resources. We are doing this to restore the identity and nationality of Lebanese people. This is why we granted, for the first time, citizenship to Lebanese descendants through the passage of a new law. This helps solidify our identity and help people return to their roots at a time when we are currently faced with a wave of displaced Syrians who have replaced the Lebanese. It is crucial for us to bring people back to Lebanon.</p><h4>What initiatives has the ministry taken to build bridges between the diaspora and the homeland?</h4><p>We have continuous initiatives, but one is the restoration of citizenship. Now we have people applying for citizenship from Latin America, Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and North America. There are powerful people, including politicians, ministers, businessmen, academics, and famous people seeking citizenship. The idea that they can come to Lebanon without speaking Arabic, owning land or a house, and seek citizenship or inquire about how they can invest here or travel around Lebanon is how we are going to bring people back. We are talking about 14 million Lebanese compared to 4 million here—this is how large the diaspora is. For example, the Speaker of the House in Brazil along with 16 MPs in Brazil are of Lebanese origin. These are people with success stories in start-ups, industry, commerce, fashion, and medicine; people who invested in medical devices or found cures for diseases; people involved in electronics and robotics, even a handmade carmaker—people from all across the industrial spectrum. There is a Lebanese individual who has produced 60 luxury cars. We are setting up diaspora houses to host and receive them. While some of them do not speak the language, and might only speak Portuguese or Spanish, they still have a common identity. </p><h4>What sectors are the most promising for foreign investment in the medium term? </h4><p>Energy and its related fields are very promising. We will hold Lebanon's first-ever bidding in September. Electricity and water are other important sectors, as are IT and tourism. These all require infrastructure, which is another important sector for investment. Any influx in investment in 2017 will largely depend on regional events. If summer 2017 remains uneventful, there should be large inflows and major improvements.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our first priority remains the diaspora. We want to focus on bringing them back to Lebanon and granting them citizenship. We want to win the fight against terrorism, and 2018 is a reasonable year for this to be achieved, at least in Syria. We also want to see, with the new administrations and governments in Europe, a real move towards stabilization in the region. We need to get back on track to living together instead of fighting one other. There must be a comprehensive international effort to bring the region back to normality, diversity, and acceptance of one other. The eradication of borders and communities needs to stop. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The distinguished relations between Lebanon and Egypt are merely the culmination of the ongoing communication between the Egyptian and Lebanese peoples. The two civilizations are deeply rooted in history through cultural and social rapprochement and agree on a fundamental, visionary level about a wide variety of issues. Thus, I am also pleased to congratulate the brotherly Lebanese people on their success in completing a presidential election and forming a new government that enjoys the confidence of Lebanese citizens.</p><p>Egypt has always sought to preserve the stability of the Lebanese state and its institutions. In recent decades, it has continued to work with various Lebanese political forces to emphasize the necessity of adopting dialog as the basis for resolving its differences. Egypt was one of the first countries to embrace the Lebanese people's ability to reach a political settlement without the intervention of external forces, all the while maintaining the “unique Lebanese model" of coexistence between every community, making Lebanon a leading model in the region for resolving political crises.</p><p>I would like to assure President Michel Aoun that Egypt will continue its support for brotherly Lebanon on all levels, and I am confident that his mandate will strengthen Lebanon's status as a country of political pluralism and cultural diversity governed by the principles of participation and harmony among varying political forces. These sectarian or religious conflicts are alien to our region and trying to rob the Arab Orient of its historical uniqueness as a place of coexistence and convergence between religions and sects. A strong and stable free Lebanon is a powerful factor for the Arab nation, and we will provide all the support it needs to maintain stability and continue its reconstruction and development.</p><p>We have agreed on the importance of strengthening triangular cooperation in Africa to promote the industries and products of the two countries on the African continent. I am pleased to hear President Michel Aoun's vision of developing relations between our two brotherly countries, which is enjoyed by the Egyptian community in Lebanon.</p><p>We also agree on the importance of combating terrorism and resolving the Syrian crisis and the refugee crisis in Lebanon. We also agreed that the two countries should stand together against the dangers of terrorism. This has been expressed Egypt's readiness to support the Lebanese army and its various security services.<br>We have also discussed preparations for the Arab Summit to be hosted by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which we are all working on in order to successfully face the difficult challenges facing the Arab nation at this delicate stage in its history. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The government of South Africa attaches great importance to the ties that have been built between our country and the Republic of Lebanon, and we look forward to enhancing our relations further. Once again, I convey my government's congratulations for the manner in which the Lebanese nation addressed the question of leadership, resulting in the current democratic dispensation. The election of President Michel Aoun and the installation of Prime Minister Hariri symbolize a historic transition. We hope that this new era will enable us to take our relations to a higher and more fruitful level.</p><p>South Africa enjoys friendly diplomatic relations with Lebanon. An important element is the sizeable community of South Africans of Lebanese origin (estimated at 30,000), the first of which date to more than a century ago. The Conference of the Lebanese Diaspora Energy (LDE), African Chapter, presented an opportunity for us to meet with the objective of strengthening bilateral political and economic relations between South Africa and Lebanon.</p><p>The LDE Conference brought together some of the most prominent business leaders from Lebanon, who have witnessed the growing importance of Africa in advancing trade and investment with our continent and here in South Africa. We hope this conference will further strengthen the economic ties between our countries and, by extension, Lebanon's relations with our Southern Africa regional partners, as well as the entire African continent. This is in line with our foreign policy priorities, which place the African continent at the center of our international relations program. I recently returned from a successful African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where we had the opportunity to discuss our continent's political and economic realities.<br>South Africa and Lebanon share common positions on the Middle East peace process. We both support the two-state solution—we support the inalienable right of Palestinians to a sovereign homeland, and are strongly opposed to the continued settlement expansion being pursued by the government of Israel.</p><p>My government is also focused on enhancing our understanding of the current developments in Lebanon and the broader region, particularly insofar as it relates to the political, socio-economic, and security challenges confronting Lebanon and the region. We have used our bilateral discussions to identify and strengthen areas of potential cooperation between our countries, particularly in regards to increasing trade, tourism, and investment relations, and possible joint action between South Africa and Lebanon.</p><p>It is in this regard that we agreed to facilitate the finalization of the following draft agreements: an MoU on bilateral consultation/cooperation; an MoU on economy and trade cooperation; a finance cooperation agreement on the avoidance of double taxation and the protection of investment; a bilateral air services agreement; a tourism cooperation agreement; a judicial services cooperation agreement; and an agreement on the abolishment of visas (diplomatic, special, and service passports).</p><p>We already have a growing Lebanese business community active in our economy in communications, agriculture, cement production, property development, and construction. I am certain that we will continue to strengthen our ties and further explore new areas of cooperation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe relations between the two nations?</h4><p>I would rate them as excellent. However, this is not a relationship that has come out of nowhere. The link between Spain and Lebanon has deep historical roots that have sailed across the Mediterranean. For example, some of the most important cities in southern Spain, such as Malaga or Cadiz, are of Phoenician origin. Both countries also share a common Roman and Arab heritage, clearly visible in our cultures. For all this, it is easy to understand the closeness and mutual affection between our peoples. On the other hand, the traveler spirit of the Lebanese and the appeal that the Spanish language exerts on a polyglot population play in favor of the diffusion of the Spanish culture in the region. We cannot forget the millions of Lebanese who live in Latin America and use Spanish as their language of communication. Spain always stands at the side of Lebanon in times of difficulty, as evidenced by the efforts in favor of the Middle East peace process, the presence of Spanish troops in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) contingent, or the development cooperation projects financed by Spain. </p><h4>Is there an area where bilateral relations can be enhanced?</h4><p>I would like to emphasize Spain's commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the region, in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1701. The Lebanese authorities and people appreciate the important Spanish participation in UNIFIL, especially after the sad event that resulted in the deaths of six soldiers from a terrorist attack in June 2007. I know the good work of the General of the Spanish Division Alberto Asarta Cuevas controlling the Mission of UNIFIL between 2010 and 2012 is still remembered. We must also point out the importance of civilian operations carried out within the framework of UNIFIL, which have a great impact on the local population and contribute to improving their living conditions. In the economic-trade area, we are working on intensifying commercial relations and on publicizing investment opportunities open in that country for Spanish companies, in sectors where we have great experience and competitiveness, such as renewable energy or infrastructure. In this sense, in 2015 a Hispano-Lebanese Business Council was created to strengthen commercial relations between the two countries. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that Lebanon will play an important role in the reconstruction of Syria, when it occurs. What's more, the Cervantes Institute in Beirut, whose new headquarters will soon be inaugurated, is a great example of the interest Spanish awakens in Lebanese society. We are working to consolidate the teaching of Spanish in primary and secondary education and are pleased that Spanish has been recognized as an optional language in the Lebanese education system. The contacts and exchanges between Lebanese and Spanish universities are intense and constant. In terms of tourism, more Lebanese visit Spain each year and vice versa. Lastly, Spain has traditionally been a country of solidarity with Lebanon. We were a main contributor to the Lebanon Recovery Fund after the 2006 war and have been major donors to the UN Refugee Agency (UNRWA) in Lebanon. </p><h4>How do you foresee the evolution of trade relations given the instability of the region?<br></h4><p>The country is always able to overcome the challenges it faces. Despite a particularly complicated regional environment, Lebanon has managed to overcome the institutional blockade that has paralyzed it in recent years, electing a president and forming a government. To this must be added the recent agreement to approve a new electoral law and set a date for legislative elections in May 2018. Hopefully, this will bring confidence to investors. The Lebanese government has also launched bidding processes for the exploration and exploitation of gas and oil, which will undoubtedly revitalize the national economy. There are many leading Spanish companies in these sectors that wish to contribute to the growth and expansion of the Lebanese economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[from-astarte-to-achrafieh]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the historic relations between the two countries?</h4><p>Cyprus and Lebanon share excellent bilateral relations. These relations date a long way back: from ancient times, when Phoenicians traveled and traded their goods throughout the Mediterranean, to the medieval and the modern. This interconnection has been facilitated by close geographical proximity and is manifested among other things, through shared cultural expressions, traditions, and social practices. The presence, furthermore, of the Maronite community in Cyprus is another strong connection between our two countries. The intertwined history of Cyprus and Lebanon is splendidly revealed with a visit to the archaeological site of ancient Kition (modern day Larnaka) where one can witness the ruins of the temple of the Phoenician goddess Astarte, who coexisted with Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, a surviving proof of the historical bonds that unite our two countries. In modern times, our two peoples came together once again, in times of hardship and distress, both after the 1974 Turkish military invasion of Cyprus, as well as during the Lebanese Civil War and the 2006 crisis, when Cyprus proved a hospitable and safe haven for Lebanese refugees fleeing their homeland. </p><h4>In which areas is Cyprus currently looking to expand relations with Lebanon?</h4><p>An important area of ongoing cooperation where we place particular importance is security, as the challenges and threats we face are common. In this light, we continue to focus on military and defense cooperation, and Cyprus offers training to Lebanese officers in search and rescue operations. In the energy field, we are happy to see that Lebanon has proceeded with its first offshore licensing round. Through our joint concerted efforts we can create the conditions to secure unperturbed oil and gas exploration in the region, boosting both local economies while strengthening regional energy security. By strengthening bilateral collaboration, we actively promote security, stability, and prosperity and counterbalance the forces of violence and extremism that undermine stability and peace in our neighborhood. </p><h4>What advantages does Cyprus offer in attracting FDI? </h4><p>Despite the economic difficulties we have faced, our country's comparative advantages not only remain intact, but have been enhanced. These include a significant network of 60 agreements for the Avoidance of Double Taxation, a highly qualified and professional workforce, and a fully EU-harmonized tax and legal system. Cyprus has one of the lowest and most competitive corporate tax rates in Europe, at 12.5%, making Cyprus a highly competitive center for international business, and offering a platform for operations and preferential access to markets such as Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia. The safe environment, our traditional hospitality, and our all-year-round good weather are other huge comparative advantages. Sectors such as tourism, port privatization, telecommunications, shipping, real estate, large-scale development projects, research and innovation, and education and health all offer growth opportunities. The energy sector is also a promising field. The discovery of natural gas reserves within Cyprus' Exclusive Economic Zone also creates excellent investment prospects in the energy sector and its supplementary services.</p><h4>How will relations between the two nations evolve?</h4><p>They will further flourish in the years to come. After all, we share a rich common past that inevitably conditions a common future. The Foreign Minister of Cyprus, along with his Greek counterpart, paid a joint visit to Lebanon in November 2016 shortly after the election of General Aoun. The deep-rooted historical relations will be further enhanced in the future for the mutual benefit of our two countries and peoples based on our common interests in various domains in multilateral diplomacy, energy, and regional issues, to name but a few. As regional actors, we shall also continue to closely collaborate to address issues that pose a threat to the entire region, predominantly the ongoing political and humanitarian crisis in Syria. Finally, we need to work together to protect religious minorities in the Middle East, currently under existential threat, and uphold the diverse human mosaic that has always characterized the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

He was elected President on October 31, 2016 in the 46th electoral session of the Lebanese parliament, breaking a 29-month deadlock. He is a Maronite Christian and the founder of the Free Patriotic Movement. Aoun was appointed as a Lebanese Army General in 1984. From September 1988 to October 1990, he served as Prime Minister after being appointed by then-departing Lebanese President Amine Gemayel as head of the Lebanese government and interim prime minister. The controversial decision saw the rise of two rival governments contending for power at that time, one by General Aoun and the other by Prime Minister Selim Hoss. ]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current economic situation of the country? </h4><p>As far as economic and social stability are concerned, the economic, social, financial, developmental, health, environmental, and educational situations have been subject to consecutive crises due to many external and internal causes. While the external causes are out of our control and we can only limit their repercussions, the internal causes compel us to tackle them with a transformational approach, which begins with an economic reform based on planning and coordination between the ministries and the digitization of various state administrations. We cannot go on without comprehensive, sector-based economic plans. Indeed, without planning, the state cannot stand tall, and a state without a civil society cannot be built. Investing wealth from natural resources in productive projects is at the foundation of a growing liberal economy based on individual entrepreneurship. Partnerships between the private and public sectors, within a targeted and developed financial vision, are also key. Moreover, investing in human resources, particularly in the educational and cultural sectors, contributes to building reliable generations to guarantee the future of the Lebanon we all strive for. In fact, the main wealth of Lebanon lies in the Lebanese diaspora spreading itself throughout the world, those to whom we owe the continuity and dissemination of Lebanon's message, as well as the resident Lebanese who are entitled to live in a stable political environment with a clean natural environment.</p><h4>How is your administration working towards combating corruption and ending illicit financial deals? </h4><p>Administrative decentralization, with its combination of flexibility and dynamism in providing people's needs and services while preserving its specificity within the formula of coexistence, must be a main axis, not only in application of the National Accord Document or in harmony with the nature of Lebanon, but also in line with the development of political regimes throughout the world. This socioeconomic reform can only succeed with the consecration of a transparent system by embracing the legal system that helps prevent corruption, by appointing an anti-corruption committee, and by activating control bodies and enabling them to carry out all their duties. The important point is that the Lebanese have faith in each other and in their state—a state that should be their protector and provider of their rights and needs, and in their president of the republic, the guarantor of safety and peace. These are the guiding principles of the presidency, during which I truly hope to achieve a paradigm shift in establishing a real national partnership at various levels of the state and constitutional authorities. In launching an economic reinvigoration to reverse the downward track, and in watching over the soundness of the judiciary, we will pave the way for the rise of a sounder citizenship in which every component of the nation feels reassured about their present, their future, and the fate of Lebanon.</p><h4>What message would you send to those discouraged by years of instability and turmoil in the country and the region? </h4><p>It is true that we were late in fulfilling what we dreamt of and struggled for, and for which many of our dear fellows were displaced in the four corners of the globe and many of our loved ones fell as martyrs, wounded, prisoners, and missing. Nevertheless, I am confident that all the Lebanese people, despite their awareness that the road is hard and long, have the determination, will, and courage to achieve together that for which we vowed our lives: a strong and unified Lebanon for all its citizens; a Lebanon of freedom and dignity; a Lebanon of sovereignty and independence; a Lebanon of stability and prosperity; Lebanon, the pact; and Lebanon, the message. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Great Place To Work and its place in the international market?</h4><p>Great Place To Work is an American company based out of San Francisco. It was founded in 1969, and it  began by investigating and examining role and perception of the employee and what actually was what an employee needed or expected to perceive their company as a Great Place to Work. This investigation was done with thousands of interviews of many different profiles of persons on the labor force. The core of our assessment is employee trust and over the years we have developed a huge dataset in terms of what makes a company great and which techniques are the best. We have assessed over 10 million employees in more than 10,000 companies in 52 countries. This has given us an excellent sense of how a company develops and sustains and excellent relationship with its employees. Our lists and certifications are well known as a way to let the world know which companies are the best to work for and which ones are making a difference, which aligns to our mission of helping companies transform their culture to enable them to create a Great Place to Work for All.</p><h4>How important is the Mexican market for Great Place to Work?</h4><p>Currently, we are the second-largest market in terms of revenue generation; however, we are not just important because of our revenue. We have a large mix of important clients and our client retention is very good. Additionally, Mexico is a strategically important place on a global scale. We are a key component of the North American community as well, and that has important implications for our business. Mexico is a big  part of the evolution of our mission, and it is a key piece of our global strategy. We are also different in terms of how we approach the business and how we develop strategy. We are dedicated to changing work environments in both the public and private sector regardless of how difficult that task may be. Though there are certain limitations in the government on how  changes may be achieved, it is a key piece of our mission being the largest employer in Mexico.</p><h4>What evolutions have you seen in the way companies approach your services and how has your client base changed?</h4><p>In the beginning, it was difficult to influence companies. For Mexican companies, their relationship with their employees was transactional. This made it difficult for us to make inroads because companies viewed their relationship with their employees in limited ways. In fact, only a third of our clients actually make it onto our lists or receive our certifications, demonstrating how much room there is for improvement. The critical component is getting companies to understand the standards against which they should compare themselves. This can be a real eye-opener, and this can be the true catalyst in a company's development. This is a long process and the way it does it is related to the way it sustains it. Perks and benefits are not the keystones of this system; rather, the true foundation is real and tangible changes in management. Leaders must treat their employees well in the most holistic sense of the word. This can be challenging because many leaders were not taught how to direct or manage people. Creating a great place to work is the sum of many small decisions and strategies. Additionally, middle management is a key component in this. A key but complicated piece in creating a great place to work is teaching leaders and managers how to do it. This often flies in the face of managers' established techniques or conventional wisdom, making the process somewhat difficult.</p><h4>Are most of your clients Mexican or international?</h4><p>Our first list, which we published in 2003, included many international firms. The publication of this list, though, prompted many Mexican companies to aspire to this list. Because of increased standards, these lists become harder and harder to get on, making companies work harder and harder. Of the more than 500 client companies in Mexico, only a third that make it to our list are certified. Of those third, the balance between Mexican companies and multinationals is pretty equal.  Multinationals play a large role mainly because of how advanced their operations are. However, in the last three years we have had large Mexican companies making it into our top 10 lists. This represents many thousands of Mexican employees who are being directly touched by this methodology. Mexican companies represent the majority of our revenue growth, largely due to the relative level of their maturity. Their path is a little longer than certain other multinationals; multinationals will still need to make improvements.</p><h4>What is your opinion on growing levels of competition within your space and new and more advanced standards?</h4><p>In terms of competition, our social mission and its holistic nature are the key differentiators between us and our competitors. Additionally, we are a firm with an expertise in cultural transformation aligned to business results, focused specifically on this matter, having the advantage of being highly specialized in what we do.  No firm commits as many resources or has as an extensive methodology as we do. Furthermore, no other company emphasizes organizational trust as much as we do. In terms of our potential obsolescence, there is so much work to be done to meet our standards, but I am confident we will have work for many years to come. Technology has the potential to be a real game changer, giving us the opportunity to work with more companies than ever before. We will be able to scale our techniques and standards so we can reach every corner of the economy. Technology will also make it easier for companies to work with us. Firms that are not familiar with our operations and practices might think that we are a difficult and expensive firm to work with, but that is not necessarily the case. We are dedicated to helping any company including small entrepreneurs establish a culture that is conducive to our mission.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next years?</h4><p>One of our core goals is to reach thousands of companies through the deployment of many new technologies. With new technology  our offering is the best in terms of cost vs benefit allowing companies to access information of their culture allowing them to begin the journey of creating great work places, providing them with services that makes it easier for many different companies to work with us. The easier it is for them to work with us, the faster we can change the workplace culture of Mexico and the world. The key challenge is rapidly developing technology and educating the market to adapt to new ways of doing things.. The other goal is to create a community awareness which in turn pressures companies to change on many different fronts. This requires connecting with people as well as companies and we want to leverage our relationship with Mexican communities to change the way business gets done.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Ghana to focus on MICE tourism]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hon-catherine-afeku-minister-tourism-culture-arts-ghana]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your priorities as the new Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Arts in Ghana?</h4>
<p>The tourism sector is what we call the rough diamond of Ghana. We are blessed with the new administration's vision to promote tourism as one of the economic pillars for growth, job creation, and diplomacy. There are three priority areas we are working around the clock to get into reality. The first critical one is hospitality training. The entire nation sees tourism as a viable economic activity; however, we need skilled personnel in that sector to promote service. The manifesto of the New Patriotic Party had specifically stated that we will build a state-of-the-art hospitality training school with with five satellite campuses modelled on international best practices. The second priority is the development of the creative arts. We have many business hotels, though no leisure hotels for tourists. We have also embarked on an ambitious project to construct affordable, elegant hotels across the country to showcase the ethnic handicrafts, arts, and d&eacute;cor of Ghana. We have registered the patented name as GH Akwaaba Hotels and these will seek private partnerships because growth is built via the private sector. The third and final priority area is Marine Drive, a project that has been on the drawing board for 60 years. When it takes off, 241 acres of coastline will be developed to house hotels, a boardwalk, a marina, cruise ships, and theaters. It will be a designated tourism enclave that will take off between October and December. These are the three main projects, though there are others that were halted as a result of these three developments we are focusing on.</p>
<h4>How does the ministry plan to enhance the agricultural sector?</h4>
<p>The first month I took office, we ambitiously started a project called See Ghana, Eat Ghana, Wear Ghana, which spells the word sew and indirectly promotes fashion of the Ghanaian culture and fabrics. Eat Ghana ties in directly with agriculture because we encourage the hotels to promote Ghanaian cuisine, thereby promoting homegrown produce such as tomatoes, peppers, and coco yams from Ghana. Everything that is grown in Ghana can be served western style at our five-star hotels. Ghana is the second-largest producer of cocoa in the world next to the Ivory Coast, and we want to promote cocoa consumption and its health benefits. This will indirectly benefit farmers, our government, and the GDP. We will also build a cocoa museum that is in the process; plans have been drawn up and we are now awaiting financing.</p>
<h4>What were the highlights of the 2017 World Tourism Forum?</h4>
<p>That is one of the biggest selling points for Ghana; MICE is big business and Ghana is strategically positioned in the ECOWAS zone. The World Tourism Forum was a platform to share with investors from all around the world what Ghana has to offer, and they were overwhelmed by the hospitality. It was the first-ever summit in Africa and we were chosen over other large tourist countries on the continent. With the collaboration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, we will work with the Vice President's office to ensure that e-visa becomes a reality to improve tourism traffic. One of the projects that links in with our top three is an iconic building to tell the world that Ghana is the center of the world since we have the longitude and latitude of 000.</p>
<h4>How are you diversifying the entry destination for Ghana?</h4>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is working tirelessly on this such that hopefully by 2018 Ghana should be seen as a country where e-visa is available, and that will improve tourism traffic. Also, the airport expansion is a major boost to us and we are working with the Ministry of Aviation to make sure there are more terminals and more flights coming in. We only have 34 international airlines coming into Ghana and it could be 50.</p>
<h4>What are the biggest challenges in the tourism sector?</h4>
<p>We are not selling ourselves well enough. One my greatest challenges is to get destination market organizations to fly into Ghana and sign agreements with them so we should have desks in Europe, Asia, the Americas, and the Arabian Peninsula so that people will know and hear about Ghana. We have the oldest mosque in Africa, Larabanga Mosque, which is 600 years old, and the oldest handwritten Quran. That is a big sell for our Muslim diaspora. In addition, there is fashion, music, and film, which is another billion-dollar industry that we intend to promote.</p>
<h4>What is Ghana's competitive advantage and where are opportunities for investors?</h4>
<p>The three Ss: Ghana is stable, safe, and a smiling nation. The laws are strict and we protect FDI and PPP. Investors feel safe. Through the Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC), people can find out about the treasures of Ghana, the investment opportunities, and our reputation as a democratically and economically stable country in the ECOWAS zone. Ghana is replete with history and has 62 slave dungeons dotted along the coast, more than any other country in West Africa. If we are to drive traffic from the Caribbean and the Americas, people can trace their heritage to the west coast of Ghana and can return to see and feel it. Former president Obama visited and saw the magnitude and power. It can only be done when we share that knowledge with the diaspora, which is a huge market for us.</p>
<h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4>
<p>In 2018, I look forward to seeing the Marine Drive tourism enclave take off. I would like to see tourism being a catalyst for job creation and also to encourage investment, more specifically in the tourism, art, and culture sector. Especially in film, as we want to see Ghana as a haven for film production. We have so much to share and need to use film to tell our story.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Backlog of 90 PPP projects]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-bambang-brodjonegoro-minister-national-development-planning-bappenas]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent will public-private partnerships (PPPs) be utilized in the infrastructure sector moving forward?</h4><p>Our main duty is to support the government in accelerating infrastructure development and the source of financing for the development could be from the budget, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), or the private sector. In our five-year plan until 2019, we have laid out that the budget might contribute a maximum of 40%. In our estimation, SOEs will contribute around 23%, which means there is still 37% left that has to be fulfilled by the private sector. Our role is to select the infrastructure projects that are eligible for one of these schemes of financing, with the objective to involve the private sector more. We have two schemes to do so: PPPs and equity financing. For both, our task is to promote these projects domestically and internationally, and we actively go on roadshows to meet with potential investors. In the past, FDI in Indonesia was mostly in manufacturing; however, we now have infrastructure as a real opportunity. For PPPs, we have a strong backlog of 90 projects, including social infrastructure such as hospitals, correction facilities, and educational institutions. For equity financing, which is pure private sector, we promote projects such as toll roads, power plants, airports, seaports, and oil and gas infrastructure.</p><h4>How can you make private sector involvement more attractive?</h4><p>For equity financing and PPP, we have concessions for the private sector. For PPPs, the idea is that this is private sector money; it has a certain period of concessions, depending on the project type, and if the project is not that viable for the private sector then the government can step in with a guarantee or a viability care fund. For equity financing, it is even more attractive as the private sector does not participate as an active developer but a shareholder. We can support project recycling so it does not have to be on a greenfield site but can be brownfield or operating site. If there is a profitable power plant or toll road in Indonesia that is already operational, private investors can still come in, creating a win-win situation, where the previous developer will receive funding for new projects and where the investors get their returns. We target long-term fund managers such as pension funds, welfare funds, and life insurance, offering better returns than bank deposits—at least 13%.</p><h4>What is the potential for geothermal in the energy sector?</h4><p>We need to promote more renewable energy in our energy mix. Currently, it is less than 10% and we have a target of reaching 23% by 2025. From our potential resources, hydro could be number one, geothermal second, and bio-energy third. The challenge is always the price. Solar has become a cheap solution in the Middle East and wind in Europe; however, our weather conditions are different. In hydro, the focus will primarily be on medium and mini-sized power plants. Geothermal offers great potential returns; however, there remains a risk of drilling and not getting enough steam; therefore, we have to concentrate on proven fields. Bio-energy is great for smaller off-grid systems that are not directly connected to the national transmission. For all renewables, we need to find a compromise between investors and the government as renewables are still more expensive than coal or diesel-fueled power plants.</p><h4>What unique opportunities for growth are in the SME sector and how can you capitalize on entrepreneurship?</h4><p>As an emerging country and member of the G20, we have aspirations to be a developed country, not just with a large GDP but also with a sizable GDP per capita. One critical oversight of our development strategy is the lack of entrepreneurship, both in terms of quality and quantity. Without significant entrepreneurship, we cannot be a developed country, a lesson learned from South Korea, who was in the same starting position in the 1950s. The problem in Indonesia is that we are targeting the number of SMEs without checking if they are active in productive or value-adding sectors, or mostly working as traders or retail. These professions are harder to scale into larger business models and our challenge is to have our micro-entrepreneurs be more productive, either in agriculture, manufacturing, or services. We have always treated farmers and fishermen as though they are not entrepreneurs though they hold the greatest potential, and one strategy is to empower them more. Another strategy is to improve and promote vocational schooling. For this, we need to shift the mindset by promoting the importance and the prospects of these skills, especially to graduates that have the potential to become new entrepreneurs, applying their skills directly—for example a cook that can become a restaurant owner and perhaps open a chain.</p><h4>How do you follow trends and strategize on the development of the economy?</h4><p>Our economy has to be adaptive to any new innovation, while also monitoring closely the impact of the digital economy for job creation. We still have around 5% unemployment, equivalent to 8 million people, meaning we still need to find 8 million job opportunities. With a more dominant digital economy, we need to be more creative in finding these opportunities. GO-JEK is a good example of how a technological innovation can increase rather than reduce job opportunities via formalizing  the informal sector: the traditional motorcycle taxi. From a job security point of view, drivers are now in a much better position, and because they are now in the formal sector, there is a tax collection and we have accurate statistics. For future innovation, we would like to have job opportunities consider rather than just sophistication of IT. From now to 2030, Indonesia has a demographic bonus that we should utilize. Therefore, we should adapt the digital economy while absorbing unemployment.</p><h4>What is the strategic advantage of moving the capital to a less urbanized part of the country, and how could the private sector potentially benefit from this?</h4><p>This project is in the study stage, and in fact many countries have moved their capitals in the last 100 years—sometimes to great success and sometimes not so much. Greater Jakarta has already become a large and congested metropolitan area, and it is now an option to just move the administrative district away from the city center. Of the 10 most populated cities in Indonesia, five are based in Greater Jakarta. Furthermore, we have regional disparity between Java and outside Java. Java contributes around 60% of our economy and if we combine Java and Sumatra, then the other regions contribute only 17%. If we want to create more balance, we need to create new economic activities outside Java and Sumatra. The new location should be safe from a non-economic and security perspective, given the possibilities of volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, or flooding. Kalimantan is an excellent option and relatively free of disaster. The idea is not just moving the capital but rather building a new city as the new capital, so political support is extremely important. With regards to financing, we will utilize PPPs as much as we can, as property development has always had strong investor appetite from the private sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Coopesa get started?</h4><p>We started off in 1964 as a company called SALA, owned by an American citizen. Due to financial problems and eventual bankruptcy, it eventually dissolved. The employees of SALA, who had all sorts of salary problems, went to the Legislative Assembly and helped bring about a new law for the founding of a new self-managing cooperative. The employees then became owners and associates of the newly formed company. They received various contracts with aircraft companies all around the world and became successful. The cooperative has now been around more than half a century and competes with many international companies such as Aeroman, (MRO Holdings), Lufthansa technics, and Mexicana. The cooperative has been a huge success, and we are now in the process of relocating to the southwest of the airport as part of a special government program. We have 620 employees now, and out of those, almost 400 are associates, meaning they are partial owners of the overall “capital stock," so to speak. The other 220 are employees, not associates, but they have a unique culture. Coopesa is the only self-managing cooperative in the world dedicated to heavy aircraft maintenance. We are extremely proud of where we are today and who we are. We support more than 800 families through our operations and services.</p><h4>What services do you provide at Coopesa?</h4><p>We work with commercial narrow-body aircraft such as Embraer, Boeing 737 series, and the Airbus Family. We are currently preparing for a new phase, seeking to go into wide-body aircraft, mainly Boeing 767 and 787s. We expect to start on wide-bodies in the next two years. As for what we do, we take care of heavy maintenance for the airframe and engines, painting, interiors modifications wireless, and line service in the airport gates. We are also currently doing jobs for companies such as American Airlines, overnight special service for interiors. We will do the same with Copa next month as well. Besides that, we will also do cargo conversion, which is a strong business for us, especially for 737 classics. However, our core business is heavy maintenance.</p><h4>Who are your biggest customers?</h4><p>Our main customers are LatAm from Chile and Brazil, Avianca, Copa, BoA, American Airlines, Cayman, Volaris, and Bahamas, and some leasing companies as Automatic, Nordic Aviation Capital, GECAS, etc. We have a great customer balance because we believe all customers are important for us, and we also provide special services based on each customer's special needs.</p><h4>How do you ensure client satisfaction and provide quality services?</h4><p>We listen to and always consult with our clients and listen to their needs. We have a great deal of face-to-face meetings and always look for ways to work together to improve our services. Communication is key. Also, we place great importance on turnaround time (TAT) for our customers, an extremely important factor for all airlines due to cost and time, especially with large airlines. That is our primary focus. Some clients, such as Copa, are particularly focused on TAT to the point where it is a part of their slogan, so we have to meet those needs of the client, in fact all clients.</p><h4>What advantages and unique challenges does the cooperative structure provide?</h4><p>Cooperative company employees have very strong rights and benefits that mean a higher cost. Besides that, the social structure of our cooperative is very flat and democratic. We have meetings with associates and employees, every two or three months, and it is always face-to-face, with groups of 50-60 people, exchanging ideas, seeking to make improvements, listening to their ideas, and more. This also enables us to more efficiently and faithfully meet and approach customer needs when we meet with our customers. All of this can be difficult; however, again, communication is key, and everyone knows what needs to be done to get the job done. Three or four years ago, we had many financial problems; however, currently the cooperative is strong, financially, strategically, and logistically, in all senses. We are in talks with associates now about the path we need to take in the coming years to grow, expand, and change the way we do certain things. For example, we have an efficiency target, which is important for all our customers, and we are making major changes in the whole MRO process. The market is defining what we need to do, to some extent. We need less time, less cost, more efficiency, and extra requirements on technology, such as new IT systems and technologies. We have to stay in tune with market changes and needs and always adapt to those. This is a rapidly changing, technologically advanced, and complex industry, and we always have to be attuned to the needs of the market and ready to meet those needs as soon as possible for our clients.</p><h4>What is Coopesa's overall place and position in the growth and innovation landscape of the aviation industry worldwide?</h4><p>Currently, Coopesa is a small seven bays MRO working by itself, but we are developing an aggressive expansion and growth strategy. With the relocation and expantion plan, our growth will double. We have seven bays to attend to aircraft and after the relocation and expansion, we will have 12-14 new bays. That being said, we are already seeking a permit from the government to move to the new international airport after this current relocation, where we can expand even further and acquire property there for ourselves. That will happen between 2019 and 2020. Right now, we are planning the relocation of our facilities to the southwest of the airport and planning for growth in the next two to four years: that is our target for now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[dr-cheick-modibo-diarra-chairman-of-africa-legal-network-aln]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key areas for growth in terms of bilateral business ties between the UAE and Africa?</h4><p>I see immediate growth in two areas. The first area is agriculture; Mali measures 1.2 million sqkm and just 15 million people live there. Our resources are abundant: we don't even have the population of a city like Paris, and yet are two and a half times the size of France and blessed with two rivers. There are millions of arable hectares of land waiting. When we consider what can be done with technology today, with satellites, drones, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we can incorporate this into traditional farming techniques in order to boost productivity in this sector. We can acquire data to ensure regions have adequate water supplies, to determine where fertilizer is needed, and where it is not. Such an information system is knowledge that the UAE has and which Africa does not have enough of. In contrast, Africa has arable land. What we can do in terms of agriculture can also be done in terms of potable water; I believe it will be the most sought-after product in the 21st century. Africa has rich water resources. If we could map, quantify, and learn to transport water, the opportunities would be considerable. Secondly, there is much that can be gained from sharing knowledge and technology between Africa and the UAE. We have seen this being used to advantage in Mali in the field of gold mining; however, the opportunities do not end here. Every now and then, the media talks about Africa and the Gulf listens. The ALN conference is a great example of this, bringing together thinkers and business people from both parts of the world. What we have seen changing is the attitude with regards to the risk involved in investing in Africa and we see increased appetite from international investors seeking to do business in Africa.  As the democratization process is successful across more nations, we are mitigating these risks.</p><h4>How can we ensure that innovation in Africa is nurtured from within?</h4><p>It is undeniable that technology can play a tremendous role in people's lives and help them reach their full potential. Technology companies themselves should understand the potential areas where Africa needs to innovate in order to solve problems across the continent and then let them try to decide what can be installed in terms of infrastructure to propel Africa forward on that front. Combining my experience as Chairman of Microsoft Africa, a position I held for six years, as well as Prime Minister of Mali, a country where 80% of the population are illiterate, I have reached some conclusions about how we might be able to bridge that gap and improve access to innovation. The first phase would be a system where computers can translate into and out of any language. A company like Microsoft can afford to translate software into African languages, which would then enable young people in any country to take that platform and add voice to it. In fact, based on this conviction, we created the Local Language Program (LLP) to translate Microsoft Office and other programs into Zulu, Swahili, and Amharic, for example. This makes innovation linguistically accessible, but then there is the issue of financially accessibility. We cannot purchase a computer for every African, but we can try to see if there are any projects or low-cost buildings in which we can factor in the cost of a computer and the supporting infrastructure. Then we can level the playing field throughout the entire world. Finally, the third phase is to increase human capacity. I spoke with Bill Gates about the fact that people are not really trained in technology and we needed to make an effort in that sense. In my last two years as Chairman, we trained 35 million Africans for free. The point is, most technology companies, and Microsoft definitely, are continuously assuming corporate social responsibilities vis-í -vis Africa. However, Africa has to do its part. We do our share, and they do theirs. It is a place in which we do business and the more people there are who are successful in these places, the more business we can do.</p><h4>How optimistic are you that the regulators and administrators of African countries are able to keep abreast of the trend toward a more services-based economy?</h4><p>We are living at a time where the leadership in Africa has a great deal of goodwill. They listen closely to the needs of the private sector. They have come to understand during the period of independence that the state as the largest employer is part of a bygone era. They now know young people are getting degrees and want employment in the private sector and that SMEs are the ones creating the most jobs. Because of this, it has become vital for administrators to create the right environment for private sector businesses and investors to flourish. Vice versa, the demands of the business community will shape regulation and encourage progress in the right direction. However, what is still a challenge at the leadership level is the ability to create a vision, and then articulate it, publicize it, and execute it. That said, we are now starting to see some progress in that area. We see people with experience in the private sector who may have created successful businesses from scratch, stepping up to the task of making visions into reality. We also see people who have had experience in both public and private sectors eradicate communication barriers, as well as a new generation of people being educated. During the independence era, we saw slow-talking leadership focused on philosophy and freedom. Today's third generation of leaders is familiar with the “work breakdown" structure. The idea is to take complex issues and break them down into something more chewable, as well as deciding which piece to start with. We also need to restore faith in the political system. We see many people preferring to go into the private sector over the public. Even politics has to be innovated. If it is not appealing, change it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[6.8 million people using the PAGA platform]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[tayo-oviosu-founder-ceo-paga]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some highlights from the past year of operations?</h4><p>PAGA is making considerable progress on our goal of building up our agent network. We believe in Nigeria. It is impossible to be a purely digital financial service provider without having a physical presence, and we do this through agents. PAGA currently has 12,500 agents, and our goal is to get to 15,000 in 2017. We are well on track to achieve that. The next thing for us in 2017 is building on our agent network to offer financial services to the unbanked and underbanked. We are very excited about the opportunity as our agent network gives us the needed distribution reach to the mass market.</p><h4>What is the argument for continuing to use agents for financial services rather than making everything digitalized?</h4><p>I do not think we can have a digital-only strategy, because until the day the central banks deliver currency electronically and get rid of physical deposits, we will always need a way to get cash into and out of a system. In four years of trading, PAGA now has 6.8 million users on its platform and a significant chunk of that growth has been over the last two years, due to our agent distribution network. With that distribution network, we are able to layer a digital platform on top. Over time, more people will get comfortable with using digital services, but for financial services, we still need that physical interaction and structure.</p><h4>How would you assess the role PAGA is playing in developing Nigeria's economy?</h4><p>We are already thinking about our impact, and the first thing is jobs. We have created 200 direct jobs in our company, and, counting conservatively, around another 16,000 indirect jobs, such as agents and the staff they hire. Employment is a major metric we use to measure the impact we have. Another metric we use is how many people we have brought into the formal financial sector and how many people are using our services through our platform, for example, to save and access loans to help with their businesses. For us, it is about achieving these things and then scaling them up across Nigeria. We need to look at how many communities we are in and how much are we driving commerce and enabling SMEs to collect payments and provide services easily.</p><h4>What is PAGA's plan to stay ahead of the competition?</h4><p>It is simple. Firstly, it is about the physical network we have built. We know it is by far the largest network and that is how we reach the mass market — we will continue to scale that network. Secondly, it is about staying close to the customer, understanding their needs and what they really want, and being able to offer that to them. We do not get too worried about what other people are doing in terms of driving our timeline. We monitor the market and pay attention to the competition, but we focus on our own strategy.</p><h4>Nigeria is a cash-based society. How is the transition to a cashless society going to affect the country?</h4><p>Over time, people are going to get more comfortable using digital platforms. We are already seeing this with banked people here. What we envision is a world where more and more Nigerians move toward that trend. The impact is going to be lower cost and safer transactions for people and more transparency for society, along with greater clarity on rates and other aspects. I can see us doing something similar to what happened in India, where certain banknotes were removed from the system. We are preparing for that with our agents. We see this as a positive move, but we do not think it is going to happen yet. We think the Central Bank was a bit early with its cashless Nigeria drive because the market was not ready. There are things the Central Bank can do over the next year to really drive cashless Nigeria now because the market is more prepared.</p><h4>What is your view on the concerns on the link between cash and criminal activity such as tax evasion?</h4><p>I have a mixed view on the tax issue because there are two separate objectives of moving away from a cash-based economy. One objective is more clarity and efficiency in the market and the other is a revenue generating objective. Requiring every electronic transaction be visible to the taxman, there will be more tax evasion. I believe we should not just tax people based on electronic transactions, but rather the government needs to give people incentives to declare their incomes and pay their taxes, irrespective of the digital side. We want digital to happen and if we try to bring taxes into that conversation, people will back away from the technology and stay with cash. Having a cash-free society will ultimately increase tax collection for Nigeria, but I do not think that should be the goal. People should be given other incentives to pay their taxes, for instance, access to certain public services and benefits if a citizen prove that they have paid their tax. Digital versus cash is also a big brother issue because people will be concerned if the government looks into their finances electronically.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018?</h4><p>For PAGA, I have a very positive outlook. We have been growing more than 100% YoY, and I see us scaling up and growing in 2018. Next year, we will be entering a period when we can fulfill our mission to offer financial services. For Nigeria, I have a mixed view. I expect 2018 is going to be a crucial year for the country. The key point for me is around the direction of Nigeria's monetary policies and the free trading of the Naira. I do not think any government that is in power here will stifle the ingenuity of the private sector, other than in these two key areas that affect the flow of US dollars into the country. The issue is about whether the Naira is freely and properly priced and traded because, the long-term picture for Nigeria is positive and its economy is going to diversify even more. There are just a few things the government needs to focus on to fix the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the key achievements carried out by AlKhorayef Water and Power Technologies in recent years?</h4><p>Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies (AWPT) is a vital player in the Saudi water and wastewater market for over three decades. We managed in recent years, to assert ourselves as the leading O&amp;M and EPC contractor in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our lead in the market derived from a sustainable operational philosophy encompassing strong code of ethics, performance driven management, and deep subject matter expertise. This accountable approach resulted in high credibility, name recognition, and made Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies the go to contractor in Saudi market. </p><h4>How would you characterize your client base and, looking ahead, in what ways will you be exploring new opportunities throughout the market? </h4><p>Throughout the years, we managed to widen our client base by providing quality and timely services in employing creative solutions that revolve around the client, and the end user alike. We are currently the lead water and wastewater operator for governmental and semi-governmental sector namely Ministry of Environment, Water &amp; Agriculture and National Water Company (NWC). AWPT operates over 30% of Saudi water and waste water infrastructure in 40 towns and cities serving critical needs of large portion of population. <br>In addition to the O&amp;M arm, AWPT possess advanced integrated EPC capabilities proven by the successful and timely completion of numerous challenging projects throughout the kingdom. As the water market dynamics is changing drastically in Saudi by shifting towards privatization, AWPT is in prime position to invest and pursue Public-Private Partnerships, Concessions, BOT, BOO, ROT and other contract schemes to implement its long-term growth strategy. We are actively going after privatization of green and brownfield Sewage Treatment Plants (STP), Water Treatment and Desalination Plants, Water Wells, Storm, Water and Sewer Networks. <br>In addition to the above, Alkhorayef Water and Power is leveraging its position as part of a diversified manufacturing and commercial group of companies to penetrate the renewable energy field in the Kingdom. </p><h4>How do international partnerships fit into your overall growth strategy? </h4><p>Given the demanding nature of Privatization and Public-Private Partnership projects, we believe a truly integrated partnership between local and international firms are the cornerstone prerequisite for the successful implementation of the same. In this sense, we implemented strategic partnerships with some of the internationally recognized industry leaders in the water sector. We always seek for compatible partners where we can integrate our local know-how with their international expertise, apply latest cutting edge technologies, increase efficiencies and formulate a competitive financial structure. These partnerships resulted in the successful acquisition, execution and operations of several high-profile projects. </p><h4>Which factors are helping establish Saudi Arabia as a prime investment destination in the water and power fields? </h4><p>In addition to the population growth estimate to reach over 31 million by 2017, along with the industrial expansion and sprawling development, this caused ever-increasing demand to increase efficiency and capacity upgrade of current Saudi Arabia's water and power infrastructure. The national transformation program NTP 2020 was mandated to fulfill the requirement of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 to make the kingdom a global investment powerhouse and an epicenter of trade as a global hub connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa. This called for a substantial increase in non-oil revenues and export by diversifying the economy, increasing efficiencies, and meeting the demands for expansion. In line with these targets, the relevant governmental and semi-governmental bodies underwent complete restructuring to meet these goals and improve current baseline across all aspects of operations and services rendered. For the power sector, the mandate to diversify the energy mix has driven the governmental bodies to initiate grid integrated renewable energy projects on a wide scale which would contribute to cutting air pollution, reducing fossil fuel consumption and contribute to peak load demand. Vis-í -vis, on the water sector side, the targets to reduce water loss, increasing efficiencies, raise the tariff to cover actual cost, increase service coverage and meet future demands has opened-up the field for vast and wide ranging privatization initiative. The restructuring of Water and Power sector and privatization initiative undertaken by the Kingdom to address the solution to these issues and to meet Vision 2030 target goals are materializing through several major BOT, ROT, BOO in the brownfield and greenfield projects. Moreover, Saudi Arabia enjoys a high credit rating, stability and the required regulatory platform to facilitate implementation of PPPs. This presents wealth of opportunities, rarely available in this magnitude in other countries, making Saudi Arabia a prime investment in the water and power fields. Alkhorayef Water and Power, as one of the leading and long standing Saudi firms, we see ourselves as key players to materialize the implementations of Saudi Vision 2030 goals. Our experience in the market, vast resources, strong financial capabilities, diversified scope, strong track record, commitment to quality and efficient organization made us a prime candidate to formulate strategic international partnerships and make reaching Vision 2030 goals in water and power sectors ever more achievable. </p><h4>What are your expectation for the year ahead (2017)? </h4><p>Our strategic goal for the year ahead and the future is to maintain our lead by continuing to expand our market share and formulate strategic partnerships with governmental and international stakeholders. We are anticipating several BOT, ROT, BOO, and concessions to be let out this year and the year ahead which would be our main focus to transport Alkhorayef Water and Power Technologies into a major developer in the region. <br><br><br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the ministry adjusting study programs to the requirements of the economy?</h4><p>One of the goals of our strategic agenda is to have an integral curricular reform from programs designed by objectives to ones based on competencies and skills that students need to succeed in the 21st century. That has been a major change because this new curriculum is oriented toward students developing competencies and skills for their professional life, promoting self-learning, and critical knowledge. This reform also spells a radical change in the way teachers work, since more dynamism allows students to discover new methodologies, solve problems, and develop new strategies, instead of memorizing content. It is about the skills that teachers develop in their students. A clear example is our foreign language learning programs. We have incremented the number of English teachers with the aim of internationalizing education in the country, programs designed under a European framework. At this moment we have implemented a program of Mandarin in ten schools. We have also discovered that there are a lot of companies searching for young people who speak Portuguese, and thus have already begun to teach this language in six public schools. We have also focused on developing a globalized awareness that allows students to have a strong national identity while being open to the world, so they can take advantage of the opportunities in the global market, since we are a small country with a large presence of multinational companies as well as tourists from all over the world. Furthermore, some of our biggest concerns are the education curricula of primary education and kindergarten, because we strongly believe these first steps are essential for successfully advancing in the educational sector. We have some important innovations here, first, a new curriculum including the newest trends in teaching and required technology. We are going to see the results of all these efforts in 10 or 15 years. On the other hand, another relevant topic is the Dual Education Program. We have a pilot program for the automotive sector and have also been preparing two more for tourism and telecommunications. The main objective of this is to deepen technical knowledge in these fields in the country's technical educational institutions. The Dual Education Program works under the philosophy that knowledge has to be developed both in schools and companies. It constitutes a strong collaboration with the private sector and is being implemented in technical schools. Another primary change is the approval of a national framework of qualifications for technical education that establishes different levels and the competencies needed for each field in this type of education. It also allows employers to have more clarity about the type of technician they are looking for and helps the educational system become more efficient in technical training.</p><h4>How is the government working to improve the infrastructure of the institutions in Costa Rica in order to standardize the education in the country?</h4><p>In this aspect we have different challenges. One of the main activities is a strategy called “Yo me apunto,“ which is meant to reinforce permanency, reincorporation, and educational success. This program works with the most marginalized schools in the country and intends to overcome this exclusion with strategies that help detect students at risk of dropping out and how to combat its causes. This same program works in collaboration with the minister to provide babysitting so that parents can study at night. The ministry is also supplying night schools with food and transport services, which has improved students' long-term attendance rates. Moreover, we have increased the number of scholarships in primary and secondary levels to promote social inclusion. We have also expanded our food support to secure an inclusive education in Costa Rica. As opposed to last year, when the previous government could not make its scholarship payments by the beginning of the year, this government paid them in January so that families could send their children to the schools from the get-go.</p><h4>What alliances does the ministry have with other local and international entities in order to improve the quality of education in the country?  </h4><p>We have partnerships with many private companies, but also we have very important ones with foundations, for example the Gente Foundation and the Asociación de Empresarios para el Desarrollo. We have also signed alliances with the CRUSA and Monge foundations and are working together to grant scholarships to young entrepreneurs. We also have partnerships with entities like UNICEF and UNESCO and with countries like Chile, Panama, and Germany, the latter of whom we are implementing the Dual Program with.</p><h4>How does the ministry ensure the quality of education at higher levels?</h4><p>We have a government program whose main objective is to strengthen the quality of private higher education. This project decreed that curriculums have to be renewed every five years to keep up with new demands in education and the workplace. It will also be mandatory for SINAES to certify the private universities, which will importantly give graduates an international equivalence. The other element of the project and is the hiring of international teachers to improve the quality of education.</p><h4>What are some of the goals the ministry has set for the medium term? </h4><p>One of our aims is to continue strengthening a state policy in education that does not change every four years with each change in government. We are committed to ensuring the effective standardization of early infancy education, effectively implementing the new curriculum in classrooms with the help of all the teachers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[80% of operations in English, 20% in Spanish and Portuguese]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[alberto-mainieri-country-operations-manager-ibm]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does IBM play in Costa Rica, and how important is Costa Rica in your global portfolio?</h4><p>We are a delivery center which provides technology and business services for our clients across the Americas and Europe. We support business process outsourcing for finance and accounting, human resources, procurement, supply chain, and recruiting. We also do outsourcing for IT services such as cloud, data centers support, IT infrastructure management and cyber security and provide shared services (internal support for IBM). From our delivery center we support clients in the Americas and to a smaller extent, Europe. About 80% of our operations are in English while the other 20% is in Spanish and Portuguese.</p><h4>Many companies consider one of the biggest strengths of Costa Rica to be human capital. What value do Costa Ricans workers add to your operations here? </h4><p>Human capital is our most important asset. Costa Rica's educational base is excellent and considering we do significant in-house training at IBM, this is crucial. Besides hiring resources with master's degrees, we also hire entry-level positions with basic skills and knowledge and train them with the required skills.. In the recent years we have established several partnerships with universities to support the development of both current technical skills and skills of the future in fields such as data science, security and cloud. . In doing so, we are contributing to the development of the country and its resources. We want to encourage students in the first few years of high school to choose engineering, mathematics, or technology careers, especially for women. Today there are about five jobs in the IT market for every person who is currently studying IT. The services sector is the fasting growing sector in Costa Rica, surpassing even tourism as a source of revenue for the country. This means there is a great demand for professionals. As a high-value driven operation we are looking for professionals with strong technology, analytics, engineering foundations and good command of the English language.</p><h4>How is the cyber security market evolving in CR and why is it important to include cyber security among your services and operations?</h4><p>Cyber security is a hot topic worldwide. We provide support from Costa Rica to the entire world. We have a 24/7 operation and our X Force Command Center for Cyber Security is the second largest worldwide. Cyber security is a growing need for all companies. Many large companies know and appreciate the importance of cyber security in markets like Europe and North America, but we have seen that Latin American countries have only recently started giving it the attention and importance it deserves. To clarify, cyber security is not firewalls and antiviruses. Cyber security is like an immune system where users will inevitably get attacks and the key is to have proper security tools that will identify the attacks in time, analyze the impact and provide the proper tools to mitigate those attacks. We have several security solutions and automated systems through our Watson Solutions that analyses millions of attacks every second for our clients, and our analysts assess these threats, define a solution, and feed it back to our clients. IBM is one of the leaders right now in the market. IBM is the largest security provider for enterprises with a yearly worldwide business of over two billion dollars. Our worldwide security unit accounts over 7,500 researchers, developers, and experts.</p><h4>What are your most in-demand and popular services and who are your main clients?</h4><p>Hybrid cloud the fastest growing segment in the enterprise cloud space. When it comes to cloud for every large enterprise, IBM sees nothing but a hybrid cloud market. Hybrid Cloud is a strategic business imperative that drives expanded reach, innovation, and business model change. Hybrid Cloud is the bridge that links the client's existing IT environment with any type of cloud and IBM understands that sometimes the client's problem couldn't be solved with just only one type of cloud, you need to combine solutions in order to attend client's needs. IBM is the only company to offer a complete hybrid cloud set of offerings —sell on premises technology (Servers and software), provide services to integrate public/private together as an integrator (GTS/GBS), offer a public cloud infrastructure (Infrastructure as a service). We hear from clients all the time that they don't want to move everything to the public cloud or keep everything in the private cloud. IBM makes it simple to migrate any existing enterprise data to the cloud. In terms of our client portfolio, we have clients from all sectors, including banking, telecoms, other financial institutions, and consumer goods.</p><h4>To what extent do you think CR is ready for this new era of technology, considering so many companies are relocating here?</h4><p>In terms of providing services, the country is well equipped and has the capability to develop the right technical skills and professionals to succeed. The private sector and public institutions need to work together with the education sector to develop programs and support schools, technical high schools and universities to get the young population excited about technology, analytics and engineering careers and have the right curricula to prepare them for the jobs of the future.</p><h4>What are your expectations and goals for 2018?</h4><p>We plan to continue expanding our services (in all areas) and capabilities as we support our clients in their digital transformation journey and artificial intelligence adoption. We will keep focusing on up-skilling our resources and developing our professional's career path in the company. We are looking at expanding our local services to include analytics services positions. We opened a co-creation center along with our business partner GBM in August 2017 and are currently doing workshops and programs to improve cybersecurity skills for attendees, the use of IBM cloud open source products and women in IT initiatives. We are always also looking for partnerships with technical schools, universities, and business partners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the ministry encourage the privatization in the Saudi transport sector?</h4><p>The participation of local and foreign investors in the ownership and management of the transport sector is a major objective in the Saudi Vision 2030, and the ministry is currently working, on several levels, to achieve this goal with the following steps: first, review and develop the existing regulations and legislation to provide a suitable legislative environment for investment; and second, restructure various transport sector entities (roads, airports, ports, railways) to be organizationally ready to implement legislation and controls based on best international practices. In this context, aviation, ports, and railways sectors have been corporatized, applying all corporate governance requirements to commercially manage all the transport operations and led by professional executives and independent boards. These companies will be subsequently offered to local and international investors soon. The ministry also seeks to establish workshops and introductory meetings with contractors, engineering offices, and universities to present the direction of the ministry and take their comments in the development of systems, procedures, and privatization programs.</p><h4>2017 is expected to be an important year to work on major Saudi railways initiatives, including the GCC railways and Al-Haramain express line. What are the ministry's expectations for these projects and their importance in connecting the Kingdom's regions?</h4><p>Roads have connected the GCC countries for a long time. Currently, there are no such projects within the ministry's plan for the coming years. Yet, The Ministry of Transport is responsible for maintaining the roads within the Saudi borders. Concerning the connection between GCC countries via railways, specialized international companies and expert offices have been commissioned to carry out studies. Moreover, a financial and technical committee has been formed to present the detailed studies and recommendations for developments and implementation. The studies began to draw the project road map, specify the scope of work, and propose the timetable for each stage of the project. The initial studies show that the total length of these lines is about 2,116km while the length of the line within the Saudi territory around 660km. Moreover, a global consulting firm completed the initial design, which is now under review. As for implementing the part within the Kingdom, the project will be launched soon and is expected to be completed by 2023. This project will lead to further economic integration among the GCC countries as well as social rapprochement. There are direct positive benefits of this project in facilitating trade between the GCC countries and the freedom of transport of its citizens and residents. Regarding Al-Haramain Express Train, it will be launched soon and will serve passengers, including Hajj pilgrims, connecting the Kingdom's two holy cities of Mecca and Medina via stations at the new airport in Jeddah and at King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh. This project will cut travel time between the two cities down to as little 2.5 hours, instead of more than four hours and will reduce pollution, traffic, and fuel consumption.</p><h4>Freight is a key element in the Saudi economy through its contribution to nearly 90% of total exports and imports. With the ongoing expansions at King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam and Jeddah Islamic Port, what is your vision of the role that this sector will play in achieving sustainable growth?</h4><p>Saudi Ports is a huge supporter of the Kingdom's economy, and all development or expansion projects implemented at ports are in the interest of the national economy. The ports' role in the upcoming phase will increase significantly, effectively contributing to the national transformation program and Vision 2030. In addition to the significant role of facilitating export and import operations, the Saudi Ports Authority seeks to achieve a significant transfer in management methods, operational performance, and productivity in line with the economic diversification of the Kingdom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We have been fighting on behalf of various companies, individuals, and victims regardless of whether a case was commercial, criminal, or civil in order to win them their rights. Our objective was to retain a judgment in their favor. In addition, Al Farouk also helps in setting up companies, obtaining license registration, and protecting trademarks. Our lawyers, who we consider to be a key part of our firm, excel in all legal actions and procedures.</p><p><br><br><br>How do you differentiate yourself from other law firms?<br>Al Farouk Legal Group covers most legal practice areas and provides legal coverage to all types of clients and investors. Our team practice revolves around areas of litigation and arbitration, commercial law, capital marketing, criminal law, labor, employment, intellectual property, and so on. What makes us different from other law firms is the prominence of our lawyers, their experience in various areas, and also our vast coverage, involving not just the UAE but also different parts of the GCC; we not only advise our clients on laws that pertain to the UAE but also other parts of the GCC and the MENA region.</p><h4>What makes the UAE an attractive investment destination?</h4><p>According to the 2017 Global Investment Report, the UAE is the ninth-largest FDI recipient in Asia, attracting approximately USD8 billion. The strength of the UAE includes its easy access to oil resources, low energy costs, a willingness to diversify the economy, and high purchasing power. The UK, the US, India, France, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait are the main countries investing in sectors like financial intermediation, real estate, wholesale and retail trade, oil and gas, and construction. The banking sector provides solid and profitable investment plans for foreign investors and ensures both parties are protected by favorable regulations. The UAE has a cheap foreign labor force, excellent transportation and production, and access to low-cost energy. The UAE's geographical situation makes it a potential platform to influence other parts of the GCC, Asia, and the Middle East.</p><h4>How would you describe the environment for encouraging SMEs and start-ups and how could it be improved?<br></h4><p>The legal system in the UAE provides assistance with all kinds of legal documentation, from setting up a company to actually running the show. The legal system here is trustworthy to the point that it protects the individual seeking an investment as well as the individual investing in a current business. An SME or investor should also have a legal agreement that states all the terms and conditions agreed by both parties in order to avoid future conflicts.</p><h4>Which sectors look the most promising in the medium and long term?</h4><p>Real estate is one of the sectors that look promising in the medium and long term. Similarly, other promising sectors include financial intermediation, wholesale and retail trade, automobiles, construction, and oil and gas. Meanwhile, cities such as Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, and Abu Dhabi have granted permission for foreign investors to invest in properties based on a long-term lease basis in certain areas allotted by these cities. However, a foreign investor cannot purchase properties outside these specified areas in the UAE. Financial intermediaries create a trade channel between the UAE and other countries that gives the UAE an opportunity to bring in foreign investors. Another sector that plays a major role in the economy is construction. A major milestone was achieved when the UAE won the bid to host Expo 2020, which allowed it to spread its wings in construction. Foreign investors are advised to invest in the construction sector in order to reap the largest benefits. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What progress has Sharjah made in becoming more prominent?</h4><p>Sharjah has become more prominent in its positioning, and investment in the Emirate has grown. Multinational hotels are opening up, which increases our profile on the global stage. Our events are becoming world famous; for example, the Sharjah Light Festival has been compared to Sydney's Vivid, the World Championship week has being streamed live globally, and our International Book Fair is now the third biggest in the world. We now plan to expand the MICE market and see another 7,000 key events coming online over next three years. We have kept our top source markets and added to them. The GCC continues to dominate the list of Sharjah's source regions for the tourism sector, sending 450,388 visitors to the Emirate in 2016, which amounts to 25% of the total number. Asian markets continued to grow throughout 2016, constituting a 9% increase from the 370,528 Asian visitors who came in 2015. Europe sent 348,570 visitors to the Emirate, 20% of all visitors to Sharjah in 2016. Non-GCC Arab countries came in fourth as a source region for Sharjah's tourism sector, with 262,027 tourists visiting the Emirate in 2016, 15% of the total number of visitors.</p><h4>How will eco-tourism revolutionize the hospitality and tourism sector in Sharjah?</h4><p>It is a real achievement to see a multi-government approach to environmental tourism, not only Shurooq but the Environment and Protected Areas Authority (EPAA) as well are delivering a unique and exciting eco-tourism product. The EPAA's innovative breeding program has seen many indigenous species being reintroduced to the wild, including the Arabian collared kingfisher. The kingfisher is now a main feature of the Shurooq development in Kalba and lodges have been named after it. Sharjah tourism is supplementing the ecotourism message with a strong outdoor tourism positioning. Many desert activities are already held in Sharjah, and the Emirate offers a great deal of diversity from the east coast, perfect for driving to the mountains, wadis, and deserts so it is ideal for off-road driving and mountain biking. We also have archaeological and fossil hunting digs, salt flats on the west coast, and the breeding grounds for turtles in Sir Bu Nair. Many destinations have jumped at eco-tourism as a strategy for increasing tourism. Sharjah recognizes that while eco-tourism will add diversity to our product and increase the number of visitors, it is even more important for the role that it will play in preserving our natural assets for future generations to enjoy.</p><h4>What opportunities do you envision from the Chinese market?</h4><p>China is an excellent market as we are an ideal stopover for Chinese people because of the uniqueness of the Sharjah product. We target a 30% increase from last year and hope to see growth from this market annually. We see Chinese tourists wanting to learn and immerse themselves in the traditions and heritage found in other countries. Sharjah offers many opportunities for this sort of tourism with its unique heritage and culture tourism product. The easing of visas and the extensive network of flights makes China a natural market though it is just one of many countries that we are investing in as we diversify our customer portfolio. We have recently opened an office in India and we keep investing in Russia, Eastern Europe, and the GCC. Even while the China market grows, we believe in diversification.</p><h4>To what extent does the authority collaborate with other government entities and how do you maximize synergy to achieve your respective goals?</h4><p>As an authority, we work closely with all other entities to ensure that we project the same message. We often support them in their marketing. This year we actively supported all the major events in the Emirate from the International Showjumping Competition, the Heritage Festival, to the Sharjah Desert Sports, and the Sharjah Friendly City Campaign. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones have you accomplished in the last year?</h4><p>The most important milestone occurs each year when we graduate the most qualified and high-achieving students and again when they are hired. We are ranked by QS World University Rankings as the seventh-best university in the Arab world, and Times Higher Education in the UK ranked us as the most international university in the world, just ahead of the London School of Economics. Another milestone was the series of six strategic plans I recently presented to our board to transform the university into a research hub. The board has accepted the plan and His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member, Ruler of Sharjah, and President of American University of Sharjah has approved the funding. This means that while we will maintain our core liberal arts foundation in higher education, the American University of Sharjah is in a transformational state that will result in a rebranded, more comprehensive, and more sophisticated research-based university. We have defined four focal areas for our research: bioscience and bio engineering, the environment of the Gulf, smart cities and the IoT, and materials science. These will be our focal areas but with opportunities for students in design, business, and other subjects to participate in as well. We will also create two laboratories to support our research, one in high-power computing with a major computer facility and a geospatial analysis laboratory applying GIS at different scales for mapping and supportive research. We currently have 380 people in our faculty and will add up to 140 additional researchers and faculty members over the next five years. We seek to be the top destination for research in the Arab world, but it is equally important that we balance our liberal arts foundation, as we want to maintain and improve on that excellence. One of the main objective measures of an educational institution is the student-to-faculty ratio and we are currently at exactly 13 to one. After restructuring and implementing strategic reforms, we aim for 11.5 to one.</p><h4>What role does AUS Enterprise play in the growth and development of the Research, Technology, and Innovation (RTI) Park?</h4><p>It is important to note that AUS is a not-for-profit organization. Around 80% of the universities in the UAE are for profit, meaning a student pays a fee and shareholders take a part of that fee. At the end of the year, any surplus is reinvested into AUS and the future generation of students. His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, gifted us 175ha of land to build the RTI Park. A year ago we created a limited liability corporation, American University of Sharjah Enterprise (AUSE), to act as our commercial arm, to generate an endowment that will be used for research and other university activities. We hope the relationship will help bring in hundreds of companies in the R&amp;D fields of science, biology, IoT, and engineering that want to be located near the university. We have more than 380 professors engaged in some aspect of research, and we seek to establish a synergy between commercial companies and academic research, where our students and researchers can work to develop new products to be introduced to the market. The ambition is for RTI Park to be the Middle East's response to Silicon Valley. Between all the educational institutions in University City, there are some 2,000 PhD candidates working and teaching and 30,000 students. Over the next five to 10 years, if 500 companies establish themselves in RTI Park, we expect to see an additional 9,000 people come to University City, including 2,000 scientists, engineers, and professionals, and 7,000 supporting staff and family members. This academic emigration will encourage tremendous growth and expansion of University City, the surrounding residential areas, and Sharjah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to Rubu' Qarn? What was the main reason behind its creation and what are its main objectives?</h4><p>The Rubu' Qarn Foundation for Creating Future Leaders and Innovators in the Emirate of Sharjah (Rubu' Qarn Foundation) was established in 2016 by Her Highness Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, wife of His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah and Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs. The initiative was conceived to be a platform that will nurture a generation of young leaders in the Emirate of Sharjah and aspires to achieve this by providing young people with a comprehensive array of age-appropriate activities designed to inculcate within them the values necessary to elevate the status of Sharjah at both the national and international levels. The Ruba' Qarn Foundation is an umbrella organisation for four Sharjah-based government entities: Sharjah Children Centres, Sharjah Youth Centres, Sajaya Young Ladies of Sharjah, and Sharjah Tatweer Forum. It unifies their respective activities to ensure that messages around innovation and leadership are standardized and tailored for the correct ages. Under Her Highness's guidance, the foundation will invest in youth capacity building and foster the talents of young people, with its overall aim being to contribute to the creation of a positive and developed society that leads to prosperity for all its members.</p><h4>What role does Rubu' Qarn play in promoting the socioeconomic development of Sharjah?</h4><p>The Rubu' Qarn foundation believes that civic values and leadership are learned at an early age. It is committed to instilling social and communal values among children during their formative years and then developing these into their adulthood to equip them with the skills they need to best serve their communities in every way, including economically. By doing so, the foundation enables children to develop a mindset and set of ambitions which they can use in careers that directly and indirectly positively impact their emirate's economy. The foundation was founded on the principles of creating a cadre of young leaders who can drive the Emirate of Sharjah forward. One important specific initiative for young adults with respect to socioeconomic development is the Sharjah Leadership Programme, which was established by the Sharjah Tatweer Forum. Aimed at discovering and developing candidates to become effective leaders of change, the programme uses key training sessions covering appropriate management principles and experience-backed learning techniques and has been formulated to develop leaders who are well informed and focused on the development of Sharjah. It is organized under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah and Honorary President of Sharjah Tatweer Forum.</p><h4>What are your expectations and biggest ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>The Rubu' Qarn Foundation formalizes and brings under a single umbrella efforts to advance innovation and develop a cadre of leaders who will progress UAE society. It represents a new way forward in Sharjah's and the UAE leadership's strategy to place the nation among the world's top countries and to ensure the wellbeing, security, and stability for all its people. Areas that the foundation is focusing on for the future include entrepreneurship, leadership, creativity and innovation, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), 21st century skills, and linking Sharjah's goals with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.   Throughout the remainder of 2017, the foundation will be working to expand its horizons of cooperation, enhance its existing partnerships, seek new partners and develop more effective methods of communication with national, Arabic, and international stakeholders. Rubu' Qarn is going through the process of formalizing a new strategy that will streamline the direction of all four entities into a unified vision, with the direction to be formally announced at the end of the year.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a short overview of the history of Sharjah Media City?</h4><p>Sharjah Media City was established with an Amiri decree in January 2016. We worked with the Chairman of the Sharjah Media Corporation, Sheikh Sultan Bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, and he headed a team that looked into the possibility of establishing a new media city that leverages Sharjah's many accomplishments and advances. We were also keen to see Sharjah's many media users participate in the creation of this new media city. We wanted to capture all issues and matters that would be beneficial to the Emirate. We submitted this proposal to His Highness, and he accepted the proposal and assigned a plot of land for the city. We have assigned a consultant to begin the conceptual stage of developing the city and this was completed over the course of 2016. We presented this plan to His Highness and he returned it to us with excellent suggestions and adjustments. We are now in the process in detailing the master plan for the media city.</p><h4>What makes Sharjah Media City unique compared to similar developments in the UAE?</h4><p>We looked at all the media cities in the country and around the region and recognized that this media city was vital for the interests of the country and Sharjah. Older media cities were cutting edge and advanced when they were established; however, the media and consumers' relationship with it has changed in recent years. We wanted to ensure that these advances were integral to the foundation of Sharjah Media City from the start. We place every available technology into the construction of the city. Every aspect of the city will support and help the development of the companies. Partnerships are also key to the development of this city, and we are integrating a wide variety of advance technologies into the city. We will provide a great deal of support services to the city's users in order to boost their businesses. We want them to focus only on their passions and fields of expertise while we take care of the rest. We plan on bringing legal services, accounting services, and facility management services to firms operating in the city. We will match and possibly exceed the level of excellence achieved by our sister media cities.</p><h4>How would you describe the role the media industry can play in Sharjah for the economic development of the Emirate?</h4><p>It will be a major milestone in the development of the media economy. Data usage in media is in greater demand than many other fields, and we will provide an opportunity for companies to advance and receive all the technological support they need. Additionally, Sharjah and His Highness want to see the culture and ideas of the Emirate spread to the entire world. Our media city will bear this same standard but do it in way that expands the realm of potential by using languages other than Arabic to spread our message. Sharjah was determined to be the capital of the Islamic world in 2014, and we want to use this crown to connect and contact and communicate with our fellow peoples across the world.</p><h4>What role can you play in creating new SMEs and innovative startups in the Emirate?</h4><p>Supporting SMEs is an integral part of the establishment of the media city; it is even in our founding decree. His Highness explicitly directed us to support SMEs and entrepreneurs in creative businesses. We take this responsibility very seriously and seek to collaborate and find the best partners to support this vision. We want to provide training and education for those firms that are interested in working here. Our users will be well supported, and we hope to begin helping entrepreneurs from an early stage. We see ourselves as a real catalyst for economic development in the media sphere in Sharjah. We have plans in place to develop the media potential of the emirate and are excited about the way forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the SBA expanded its international presence?</h4><p>Although the Sharjah International Book Fair (SIBF) has been held annually since 1981 and comes under the remit of SBA, the authority itself was only established in 2014. However, over the three busy years since its inception, SBA has garnered exciting and fruitful international attention. The authority was chosen to be a guest of honor at the Salon Livre Paris, and Sío Paulo International Book Fair; acknowledgments that have helped to put it firmly on the international stage and to highlight the incredible things Sharjah is doing in the literary and cultural realm. In the three-and-a-half decades since its first edition, SIBF has established itself as one of the top book fairs in the world. Last year, it attracted 2.3 million visitors, generated over a billion Twitter impressions and led to more than USD43 million in total sales.</p><h4>How does Sharjah Publishing City boost Sharjah's international profile?</h4><p>One of our primary goals in attending international book fairs is to promote the SBA and Sharjah Publishing City (SPC). When it opens in November, SPC will be the first publishing free zone in the world and will be a one-stop shop for international publishing. SPC will expand and diversify Sharjah's economic make-up, creating a new industry vertical for the years ahead. It will work in collaboration with SIBF and Sharjah Children's Reading Festival to provide a full range of services and distribution channels. We showcase these attributes when we attend international book fairs and meet with publishers and authors. When we travel abroad, we find that there is a significant level of interest from both groups to attend SIBF and present their books and publications using our platform. Last year, SIBF hosted visitors from over 60 countries, with more than 1,200 titles available for purchase in their original languages or in translated versions. We have writers and publishing companies travelling from Western Europe, East Asia, and South Africa to translate texts into dozens of different languages.</p><h4>How have the facilities been received so far?</h4><p>The Arab book industry is valued at over USD1 billion. We hope to corner this industry with the opening of SPC in November and become the first and only free zone in the world for publishers. The city will house 450 offices, and we are currently oversubscribed by 900 publishers seeking tenancy. With our well-publicised aim of reshaping and revamping the publishing industry, international interest is substantial and we have so far attracted over USD85 million in investment. We will have two kinds of facilities for printing at SPC; print on demand and offset printing. There will be a translation center, an editors' center, and a facility for the negotiating and selling of rights. SPC will be centralized in one location and tax free. Out of the city's five phases, we have completed Phase I and are now commencing Phase II.</p><h4>How has SIBF expanded Sharjah's presence overseas and acted to preserve Arab culture and language?</h4><p>Over the last 30 years, SIBF has become the most important book fair in the MENA and Asia regions. Through it we have been able to expand our participation and presence overseas. We have a partnership with the Emirates Writers Union and, when SBA travels to international book fairs, we display the organization's books and ensure its members' attendance on Arab and Emirati literature panels. We have also created an excellent platform for Emirati authors by translating their work into different languages, thereby bridging the cultural gap between East and West. We are sharing our literature, our traditions, and our culture with the world through books. We have established the largest translation center in the world for the purpose of translating of Arabic to other languages and vice versa. This industry is valued at AED1.5 billion, but it is one that offers benefits far beyond monetary value. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the most exciting exhibitions you've hosted in recent years?</h4><p>We are currently hosting an outstanding exhibition from Jordan at the Sharjah Archeology Museum. Petra: The Desert Wonder showcases artifacts that represent an aspect of the ancient city of Petra, which was recently chosen  to be among the Seven Wonders of the World. The exhibits include a collection of sculptures, manufactured goods, and architectural elements created by Petra's people between the 4th and 2nd century BC. Interestingly, and highly significantly for us, the city of Petra was a contemporary of Mleiha, now acknowledged as an outstandingly important archaeological site within the Emirate of Sharjah. Also currently on show is Moments in the Lives of Muslims in China-Through the Lens of Peter Sanders, a representative selection from the first-ever comprehensive photographic essay on the Muslims of China, brought together by the British photographer Sanders—a Muslim himself—over 20 years. In collaboration with the Sharjah Art Foundation, we are hosting Ahmed Morsi: Dialogic Imagination, which traces the artist's diverse output from the 1940s up to the present day. Generally speaking, SMD organizes about eight to 10 exhibitions every year, usually co-curated by our local curators and colleagues from the lending institutions.</p><h4>How have you worked to promote all Sharjah has to offer to the international community?</h4><p>One of our outreach strategies is to facilitate virtual access to our museums' collections so that people who cannot physically visit our museums can still benefit from it. The other two strategies relate to physical access and intellectual access. The highlights from the museums' collections can be viewed on our main website. In addition, since 2012, SMD has been a major contributor to the largest virtual museum in the world, the Museum with No Frontiers. Over 100 objects from the SMD collections are featured in its database and its permanent virtual exhibitions dedicated to Islamic art and important historical topics. In addition, we have an ongoing collaboration with the Berlin State Museums, which started in 2008 when the Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization hosted the first international exhibition from the Berlin Museum of Islamic Art at its official opening. Since then, we have collaborated on several occasions, further formalizing the relationship in 2014 by signing a joint MoU, which also brought in the Goethe Institute as a third strategic partner. Further ongoing partnerships and collaborations include a fruitful one with the Vatican Museums, following our unique 2014 project, “So that you might know each other." We are now working on a joint follow-on show to travel abroad.</p><h4>How important are programs to engage and educate the youth in the community. Are there any planned for this year?</h4><p>Events like the Sharjah Science Carnival are important because they represent a fun way to make our visitors aware of the far-reaching educational potential of our museums and collections. In addition to the Science Carnival, we organize a wide range of events in direct reference to Earth Hour Day, International Astronomy Day, Traffic Week, and UAE National Day, for example.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, we will complete our latest museum project, which is the comprehensive refurbishment and reinterpretation of Bait Al Naboodah, a traditional house that first opened its doors as a museum in 1995. This house originally belonged to the late Obaid bin Eissa Bin Ali Al Shamsi, nicknamed Al Naboodah, a prominent pearl trader with extensive commercial ties to India, Africa, and France. Another highlight of 2017 is the 20th anniversary of the Sharjah Art Museum, a beacon of Sharjah's pioneering commitment to championing the modern and contemporary arts of the Arab world in dialog with the world at large. On a more general note, we look forward to an exciting and dynamic continuation of our ongoing temporary exhibitions and educational activities across our 16 museums and heritage sites. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an introduction to the University of Sharjah?</h4><p>The university has 15,000 students that participate across a spectrum of disciplines. We offer bachelor's, master's, and PhD programs and are the only university that covers different cities within the Emirate of Sharjah through our five branches. Our strategy is to strengthen the university in terms of R&amp;D through different research institutes and centers of excellence, and to build on that we have established strong collaborations with international institutions and universities from Europe, the US, Australia, and Canada. We recruit scientists and distinguished academics to our faculty and  concentrate on admitting excellent students with high GPAs. We have around 100 different nationalities within our student body, and 90 in our faculty.</p><h4>What kind of progress has the Sharjah Center for Space Science and Astronomy made in the past two years?</h4><p>His Highness instructed us to build the Sharjah Center for Astronomy and Space Sciences in 2013 for education, training, research, public outreach, tourism, and more and the center was completed in 2015. It consists of a planetarium with 200 seats, which houses the most advanced technology for sound, light, and accuracy for depicting stars in the sky. We complement that with two floors of astronomy and space science exhibitions alongside the planetarium for the education of our own students as well as outreach to generate better public awareness. Aside from the planetarium and exhibition we have an observatory, which is small but handy and can be operated remotely. The observatory itself was built with the latest technology.</p><h4>What have been the university's most important academic collaborations?</h4><p>The most important academic collaboration is a joint research project we have signed with many universities such as Germany's University of Lübeck for joint supervision for graduate students and exchanges. They collaborate with the university in order to teach the graduate students within the field of medicine and health sciences. We have another agreement with a university in Montreal, Canada, for an engineering management and PhD program, as well as two other agreements with Barcelona University and Malaga University in Spain. We also have strong relationships with universities in Arab countries like Cairo University, the American University of Beirut, and so on.</p><h4>What are your most important collaborations with the public sector?</h4><p>We have many important collaborations with the public sector, the most important being in renewable energy. We contribute ideas on how to construct houses that are more energy efficient, and we are also working with a number of municipalities on how to develop certification. The students and faculty are currently working together in that regard. The faculty of engineering, for example, is also working with Sharjah Electricity &amp; Water Authority, in collaboration with its engineers.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on how you are preparing students for the modern job market?</h4><p>We started a program two years ago that underlined our strategy for developing the next generation and endowing them with the skills needed for the fourth industrial revolution. We created what we call the professor chair, which means that directors from different sectors of industry have signed a contract with us for funding specifically for researching solutions to the problems they are facing. This research focuses on utilizing technology to solve some of the problems faced by the Emirate.</p><h4>What is your strategy for the university for the next five years?</h4><p>The goal is to strengthen the university in terms of R&amp;D. In that sense, we have to strengthen graduate studies and are making sure the students conduct research projects that serve the community. At the same time, this research will be published in well-known international databases and journals. We want to strengthen the university and be in a good position and ranking internationally. At the same time, we have to boost the university's various branches as they themselves may become a university at a later date. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you develop the Smart Tower concept in the UAE?</h4><p>Our first project in Ajman was in mid-2014. We bought land in the middle of the desert and decided to develop the first smart tower there. If you have a property in our smart tower, you can control everything in your flat—the lights, air-conditioning, television, curtains, cameras, water heater, and intercom—with a single mobile app. It was the first such concept in Ajman, combining IT with real estate. Within four months, the project sold out for USD32.7 million. The government of Ajman could not believe that we had moved the market while it was in the doldrums. Now, construction is 50% finished and will be completed by the end of 2018. Then, I wanted to build the first smart tower in Sharjah, in the Al Nahda area. We launched the project within three months, with total sales of around USD54.4 million and sold 85%. The project was such a success that the Sharjah government honored us with the Best Developer Award and the Best Project in 2016.</p><h4>You give different concepts to your real estate developments. What other concept buildings are you developing in Sharjah?</h4><p>Our third project in Sharjah is in a prime location, on Jamal Abdul Nasser Street. I decided to include commercial and residential space as well as six floors for parking and four floors for offices. It is a large project, bigger than previous ones, and the concept was to combine sport with real estate. On top of the building there is a swimming pool, gym, basketball and tennis courts, and a jogging track, all 50m above ground where the air is cleaner and less polluted. That project is now 95% sold out, including all the residential units, and about 20% of the construction has been completed. The project is called Sarkwa Tower, after the old name of Sharjah. We also bought another plot of land in Sharjah next to Afamia I to build Afamia II. That was the fastest project we ever sold, and all 130 apartments completely sold out in two months.</p><h4>You are also developing the Farm and Arts Towers. What makes those projects unique?</h4><p>In Ajman, we bought yet another plot of land next to Smart Tower and Al Hamra to build a third tower. Called Al Mazraa Tower, this is unique not just in the UAE but worldwide. Mazraa means farm. The tower will give apartment owners organic vegetables year-round through a rooftop farm with a hydroponic system. Residents will have 100% organic vegetables grown on site and brought right to their doors. Sales start next month, and the estimated total value is USD81.7 million. The Ruler of Ajman asks me what new projects we have in the pipelines; that is how excited they are. Another project we launched in July 2017 is the Art Tower in Sharjah. There is a famous Emirati artist called Mohammed Al Ustad that has done exhibitions worldwide, and all our leaders know him. I would like to have his work in the lobby and corridors of the hotel, with a gallery and atelier as well. He loved the idea, and 30% of it is already booked, even though we have yet to launch it. Now, we are in talks with the Art College of Sharjah University to bring their students to paint and work. In July 2017, we will launch our first project in Dubai, which is the Smart Tower III. Dubai is not an easy market to crack. However, I remain optimistic and expect it will do well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history and background of the company?</h4><p>The company has developed substantially since its establishment in 1996. Its first project was to build a fence for the Lycée Francophone in Dubai. Afterwards, the company took on villa and small residential projects until 2007, when it embarked on tower projects. Today, Al Thuriah is a high-rise tower developer in Sharjah with a fully integrated real estate service. Al Thuriah develops, builds, and manages. The company is highly selective when choosing projects, partners, and sub-contractors, and measures itself on its ability to deliver quality turnkey projects on schedule. </p><h4>What have been the main projects of the company in Sharjah?</h4><p>One of Al Thuriah's key contributions to Sharjah's development has been focused on the Al Khan Area. We took part in developing two areas, Al Nahda and Al Khan, and constructed both Petrofac Towers and the headquarters for the Bank of Sharjah. These developments have since been strengthened, and Al Thuriah has since developed several residential towers, some of them already finished and others in progress. Al Thuriah develops high-end residential towers, providing new living spaces to cater to the Emirates' growing demand. As standards and expectations rise, Al Thuriah endeavors to meet demand and lead the market's development of best practices.</p><h4>How does being a fully integrated company differentiate Al Thuriah's offering?</h4><p>Being fully integrated means that Al Thuriah can offer our clients a one-stop shop; an investor can buy an apartment from us with minimal hassle as we would lease it on their behalf, handling all of the paperwork and agency discussions as it is all managed through the same entity be that Al Thuriah Leasing, Al Thuriah Properties, or Al Thuriah Facilities management. Ensuring that there is one point of contact has been the company's focus for the past year. </p><h4>What developments are still available for sale and lease?</h4><p>We are leasing Sahara Tower 4, which was handed over in mid-2017, and Pearl Tower, which was handed over in February 2017. By the close of the year, Al Thuriah will have Sahara Tower 6, which is under construction as I speak. In 2017 we will also launch a megaproject, which represents a market difference in terms of architecture, concept, and it will be an environmentally friendly build.  This tower will have 1,000 apartments and is strategically located, being on the border with Dubai, providing a superior location to the Sahara Complex. With this, we will be one step ahead of the competition, building on the strength of the Al Thuriah brand as well as building towers. </p><h4>How much potential is there for conceptual buildings in Sharjah?</h4><p>The Sharjahan market is not yet ready for conceptual buildings. The profile of customers who want to live and invest in Sharjah differs from the profile of those who buy in Dubai. We see potential in designing better looking towers, but we want to offer our customers more variety. As such, for our next project, we are changing the layouts of the floor plans so that owners can own a unique apartment.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that you encounter in facility management?</h4><p>We face difficulties in differentiating our levels of service to the budgetary constraints of the owners and sometimes we have to compromise on the quality of service. We do not have this in Dubai, where our level of service matches the higher budgets. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are optimistic for the future and are looking forward to launching new projects. In terms of branding activities, we are moving more into digital media and are focusing on our online presence and social media. We have an open-door policy at Al Thuriah, and we do not see customers as income flows but as people who we build a relationship with from start to end, unlike other companies operating in this sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently organized the fourth Middle East Investment and Real Estate Exhibition (Acres Middle East 2017) in Sharjah in collaboration with the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry. What main conclusions did you draw from this event?</h4><p>We decided this event would take place in Sharjah every year from now on. This is a stage for those who are interested in investing in the real estate market. On this stage, we will host developers, owners, investors, and customers who will meet and discuss the top proper investments in Sharjah. For developers, it is like conducting a survey, and they are promoting their real estate products and receiving feedback. Then, they can see if the yearly trends are going toward residential units, how many bedrooms, and qualities like that.</p><h4>How would you describe the significance of the real estate market for the overall economy of Sharjah?</h4><p>The economy and real estate are closely connected. On the economic side is the company, the showroom, the residence of the employee, and the factory. Both are important and well connected.</p><h4>How have real estate transactions evolved over time in Sharjah? </h4><p>Based on the 2016 statistics, the volume of real estate trading increased by 9.8% to AED24.7 million. In Sharjah, we have different segments and sections of real estate such as residential, commercial, and industrial. Moreover, in 2014 His Highness submitted the Usufruct Contract, which allows foreigners to buy in Sharjah. This arrangement is set for 100 years in special areas with different land uses. This is why we have been receiving a lot of requests from foreigners who would like to invest in these areas. This initiative started in Sharjah in 2014 and is one of several positive decisions to attract investors to Sharjah that is contributing to the development of our Emirate. Many investors come from the GCC and Arab countries.</p><h4>How has the e-boom impacted the way the department operates? </h4><p>We have a new organizational structure, and there is an innovation office within this structure. This will manage and control the entire procedure of the innovation and the real estate structure and departments. We have a website, mobile application, and some additional digital services. We also have a cooperation agreement with other sectors and departments, such as the economic department and planning department, where we share the information from our side, such as services. Data collection is crucial to allowing these departments to provide good service.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment in Sharjah, and why should international investors choose Sharjah over other Emirates?</h4><p>Here in Sharjah we have free zones, infrastructure, and an international airport. There are many things that make it helpful for investors to invest. Prices between Sharjah and the other Emirates are also an advantage. We also have areas where we can invest in such as residential, commercial, and industrial areas. This is also a manufacturing hub, so anything an investor needs can be sourced here.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of real estate prices in Sharjah?</h4><p>Every market has its own surprises, and it is hard to compare them to others because all the conditions are different in each Emirate. For us this is an encouraging environment for real estate investors, and prices are still significantly lower than in Dubai or Abu Dhabi. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the next year? </h4><p>The first quarter of 2017 showed more transactions than the same period in 2016. We expect better numbers for the second quarter. At the moment, apartments are driving the bulk of the growth of transactions. Industrial and commercial numbers are also rising gradually. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-most-commendable-cog]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is your recently implemented Marine and Container Handling (MACH) terminal operating system (TOS) at the terminal in Sharjah assisting operations?</h4><p>This is a brand-new system we are implementing in cooperation with Tata Consulting Services from India. We are putting the final touches together for its launch in the Khorfakkan Container Terminal. It will improve the way we do business, both in terms of operational efficiencies and transparency. We are going from a previous system, which was adequate, to a new system that is state of the art and gives us many advantages internally, as well as providing our customers with a greater visibility of their cargo. People want to be able to access more information about their shipment, and now we can give it to them. </p><h4>What are the main reasons behind Gulftainer's success?</h4><p>The past two years have been about IT at Gulftainer; we introduced the TOS and a new SAP system called S4 HANA, which was the first time this technology was introduced in the Gulf. SAP was introduced without any delay and without any overrun in budget and has resulted in greater efficiency and smoother transactions. We have now interlinked SAP with the Sharjah Port Authority and the Sharjah Customs Authorities to provide a more holistic experience for our customers. These awards are not just given for the systems, though; it is how you apply these and how our people utilize that capacity that makes the difference. </p><h4>In what way do Avalon and Momentum Logistics complement the operations of Gulftainer?</h4><p>Avalon Transport specializes in long-distance trucking between Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai to places as far away as Jordan, Riyadh, Jeddah, and even Oman and Kuwait. This company allows us to cultivate more business in Sharjah and the region as a whole. Together with the port and customs authorities we have now developed a system called Sharjah Land Bridge that allows us to take more and more cargo in and out of Khorfakkan on the east coast and transfer it either through Sharjah or to our inland container depot in customs-bound mode. Then, customs clears it from there and gets it out to the customers in both Sharjah and elsewhere in the UAE. Avalon focuses specifically on high-end customers, quality, and meeting time requirements, and they cannot grow by 20, 30, or 40% per year because we cannot compromise on quality. Avalon has an annual growth of about 10-12% per year, and we are adding around 10 to 15 trucks to our fleet every year. We are operating about 140 trucks today. We created Momentum Logistics after requests from our customers. It was originally called Speed Trucks and focused purely on trucking, but our customers requested warehousing, and we started to complement the port services of handling containers and offloading cargo with storage. We continue to look at growing the various business segments, such as distribution, freight forwarding, container repair, and storage. </p><h4>In terms of commodities, what countries have been trading the most with Sharjah?</h4><p>We have direct services to and from Europe, Africa, Asia, India, and the Middle East. We have a limit in terms of the size of Port Khalid, which is 12.5m deep; therefore, we cannot receive larger ships as we do on the main east-west routes. In terms of commodities we move everything from cement to clothes to raw materials, electronics, and foodstuffs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the next 12 months for the company?</h4><p>Our ambition is to grow. Today, we are probably number 15 or 16 in the world in terms of size and we would like to be somewhere around the top 10 or 12 within the foreseeable future. In order to achieve that we will need to keep on growing our business here locally and we also need to expand internationally. We are looking at specific investment opportunities, which are for both the logistics as well as the port division. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[magic-of-three]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the volume of commodities entering through the ports of Sharjah evolved since 2015?</h4><p>Cargo volumes barring container and vehicle trade has seen steady growth in the last few years, in part due to the diversification we have achieved in bulk agricultural products and industrial commodities such as furnace slag, fly ash, and steel billets. Our customers' satisfaction with the services at our ports ensures that we get repeat business. At the macro level, the IMF forecasts the real GDP of the UAE to rise to 3.4% in 2018, and we believe that will be the case going forward until 2020</p><h4>What are the comparative advantages of Sharjah's ports compared to other ports in the country?</h4><p>Sharjah's geography makes it the only Emirate with ports on both coasts of the UAE. The maritime infrastructure in Sharjah comprises three deepwater ports, each with their own signature traits. Port Khalid is a multipurpose port that has traditionally supported the offshore service industry and is the principal hub for such activities while remaining the port handling UAE bound containerized cargo and traditional break bulk cargoes. Khorfakkan Port is the leading transshipment port for containers, and its position is further enhanced as a result of its strategic location outside the Arabian Gulf. Hamriyah Port serves the need for an industrial port handling raw materials for the food industry, steel, and the building material sector, in addition to being a major player in the oil storage and distribution sector. This way, each of our ports plays a part in making Sharjah a unique maritime hub for the region.</p><h4>What role do technology and innovation play at the Department of Seaports and Customs?</h4><p>Technology provides the source of innovation and we incorporate cutting-edge technology in our services such as customs clearance, documentation, and handling of unitized cargoes. The purpose of innovation and adoption of technology is not to follow the crowd but to ensure that our customers truly gain tangible benefits and are not just satisfied but are delighted with our services.</p><h4>How would you characterize the role of the ports for the successful development of Sharjah's economy?</h4><p>Ports, being the gateway to international trade, provide the necessary connectivity in an interconnected global market. Several thousand tons of goods and commodities move through our ports, connecting us with all the countries of the world. In addition, there are several ancillary services associated with the port that thrive as a result of our ports, such as transportation, ship agents, freight forwarders, ship repair companies, and offshore support services, all of which contribute to the economy and the GDP of the Emirate. Our ports do not just support the economy of Sharjah, but that of the UAE in general.</p><h4>What expansion and developments plans do you expect for the future of the three ports of Sharjah?</h4><p>Sharjah is fortunate to have two ports within the Arabian Gulf and one outside the Gulf to the east of the UAE on the Indian Ocean. Port infrastructure, investments with long-term horizons, require regular and sustainable additions that may not be headline-grabbing news. Construction of additional berths at Port Khalid is underway as we speak, which will be commissioned by the end of the year. We have carried out a study for the expansion of the main harbor at Hamriyah and will be taking a decision in this regard very soon.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I have a positive outlook on the economy; the UAE has been able to sustain positive growth in GDP in spite of low oil prices, which goes to show that the diversification of the economy into other sectors is paying off. I see further turnaround in the coming year based on the growth seen around the globe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Governments use the media as a conduit to reach out to people, express opinions, and change attitudes. How has Sharjah Government Media Bureau (formerly Sharjah Media Centre) been performing that function since its inception?</h4><p>I usually ask journalists who work in Sharjah how they compare the situation from six years ago to what we enjoy today, and we receive positive feedback from these media outlets. Sharjah Government Media Bureau (SGMB) has changed the perception of not just the people in general, but also the leaders of various government departments. In the past, many government entities here followed a closed-door strategy. This is not the case anymore. We have been showcasing this change in attitudes through International Government Communications Forum (IGCF), hosted by International Government Communication Centre, and other initiatives. Our most important role is to communicate, opening and maintaining channels for dialog. It is better for individuals and entities to speak about their own positive and even negative image, rather than let someone else talk about it. We used to lack this dialog in Sharjah. Not anymore. We are not just taking the lead in this respect, we are also sharing our experience with others.</p><h4>What existing or new avenues are there that Sharjah Government Media Bureau can create or tap in to understand the public better?</h4><p>Our annual forum is one way of finding out what people are thinking. We get many high-profile speakers and people who have a vast experience and knowledge that we can draw on and subsequently put to use in Sharjah. After every forum, we sincerely implement its recommendations. Over the past seven years, these recommendations have always been implemented without fail. For example, when a recommendation was made to introduce an award rewarding excellence in government communication sector. Today, it is one of the most coveted honors. We trust the people we bring to this event and benefit from their experience. We implement their ideas under our remit.</p><h4>What are the challenges or differences between communicating and engaging with the local Emirati population and the expatriate community?</h4><p>In 2017, our theme, Societal Participation Comprehensive Development, was about making society prosperous through inclusion. It is not possible to have a prosperous society unless everyone is included in the development. You have to include women, children, the younger generations, and disabled people. This is what we have in Sharjah and UAE. We have homed in on issues that relate to women, the disabled, young people, and children. We have had all these segments of society participating in the Forum so we can listen to them and find solutions to various communication issues. Sharjah Media City was recently given the status of a free zone. </p><h4>What are your primary objectives for this free zone, and how do you plan to expand it?</h4><p>The Sharjah Media City is a new entity that deals with all media opportunities, offering local and international players an unprecedented opportunity and freedom to set up shop in Sharjah all under one roof. Sharjah Media City or Shams is fast evolving. We have already started issuing licenses and businesses are fast coming up. We are targeting the SME media market, whereby a talented director who does not need an office can come here, shoot a movie, edit, and leave. This is just one example of how we can provide the facilities and services adding value to the industry. We are also trying to tie Shams to various universities so that students can come and train here, giving them a creative space to use their talents. The ambition is to allow these individuals to start their own business or project with the minimum amount of overheads, conduct their work from a creative space with a laptop, and grow from there. Sharjah Media Council forms an umbrella over Sharjah Media City, Sharjah Media Corporation -- Sharjah's television and radio services -- and Sharjah Government Media Bureau.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the Unger Steel Group end up operating in Sharjah?</h4><p>About 10 years ago, the Unger Steel Group, one of the largest steel fabricators and general contracting companies in Europe, saw the growth in the Middle East and decided it was worth looking into opportunities here. Unger decided to set up a factory in the UAE and, after extensive research, decided to settle in the Hamriyah Free Zone (HFZ). As an engineering company, we have a number of both blue- and white-collar workers that benefit from living in Sharjah. Sharjah is a family-oriented city and more affordable than Dubai.</p><h4>How has demand for your products evolved in the GCC?</h4><p>There is always demand as well as competition. There are many fabrication factories in the region. We do not just sell steel in the UAE; Saudi Arabia and Oman are also big markets for us. We even recently completed a project in Turkmenistan, where we fabricated the steel in Sharjah, loaded it in containers, and delivered it to Turkmenistan. In 2016, we did two projects for one of our German clients, where we fabricated the steel in Sharjah and shipped it to his projects in the US. Our client prefers to use Unger Steel Middle East in Sharjah over a factory in the US because he knows the quality he will receive from us. We are also one of few companies in the GCC that can put the Conformité Européenne (CE) stamp on all the products we fabricate. This is why most of our clients are repeat clients and why we are in full production; we do not constantly have to go out looking for new clients. Additionally, we do not just fabricate steel; we also have a large engineering department. We do the engineering, the fabrication work, the delivery, and assembling the material onsite. We offer a ready-to-use solution.</p><h4>What are the differences between doing projects in Europe compared to the GCC?</h4><p>One factor is the temperature in the region; it is not easy working outdoors in high temperatures. Fortunately, between June 15 and September 15 there is a three-hour break in each work-day that helps. </p><h4>What have been the key factors in satisfying client needs over the last 10 years?</h4><p>Number one is reliability. When a company signs up to deliver a project by a certain time it makes that commitment and has to deliver not just on the finish date, but for every milestone in the project. There are other trades involved in any project, and they depend on the company meeting its milestones so they can get their work done. These are number-one priorities for us. This comes down to excellent factory and project management, having great engineering and fabrication, and on-time delivery from the factory and onsite. The second important factor is quality. </p><h4>What characteristics make Sharjah an excellent destination for investors, especially in manufacturing?</h4><p>When the Unger Steel Group decided to come here, it was a great decision because it is easy to do business here. Everyone wants companies to succeed, and no one holds us back. Again, coming to HFZ was another excellent decision because we receive great support and help from the HFZ Authority. As there is a harbor directly in the free zone, we can use barges and vessels to transport over-sized materials from HFZ to the project sites. Kuwait is another big market for us; last year we supplied more than 5,000 tons of steel to that market from HFZ.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Unger in the next year?</h4><p>We have great clients that trust us and we always have enough work. To be in a great position we just have to run a good company. A company has to look after its clients and provide a quality product on time and at the market price. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Back to the Developing Future]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[back-to-the-developing-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of National Paints?</h4><p>National Paints got its start in Jordan in 1969 and established its presence in Sharjah in 1977 as a small company. In 2001, it established one of the biggest industrial complexes in the Middle East for paint manufacturing, with a built-up area of 130,000sqm and a production capacity of 500,000 tons per annum. Separate plants have been established to produce alkyd resins, powder coatings, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The paints complex contains six production lines to produce a full range of paints, fillers, adhesives, and thinners. National Paints has different product ranges—including decorative, industrial and protective, marine and yacht, powder, wood, and floor coatings, not to mention automotive paints. We have the largest collection of paints manufactured under one roof and export to 80 countries around the world. Among local manufacturers, we are the second-largest non-oil and gas exporter from Jebel Ali Port, and our products meet ASTM and British standards. </p><h4>How important is quality to National Paints?</h4><p>We consider quality our number-one priority and offer our products and services at competitive and cost-effective prices compared to multinational competitors. For the same reason, we are the first choice in the UAE market and have maintained over 50% market share, despite the fact there are 30 other paint factories in the UAE.</p><h4>Does National Paints do more than just paint production?</h4><p>We are a backward and forward integrated company. In terms of forward integration we provide painting services through our trained painters and, in large projects, supervise the people and manage the timely and successful completion of projects by organizing subcontractors. We deal with about 150 subcontractors that each have at least 40 painters, managing their people and supervising their projects. We currently manage 398 projects valued at about AED400 million. In terms of backward integration, we do our own polymers, emulsion, resins, precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), and metal containers. Over time, we seek to expand our backward integration to cover more raw materials for our production.</p><h4>Which regions or countries are the most dynamic in terms of growth in the near future?</h4><p>We only look at developing countries. In modern and western countries, there is too much competition and too little profit, and the market is shrinking. Markets in developing countries have double-digit growth with growing populations, so that is where the future lies. It is much easier for us to grow in the GCC, Africa, CIS, or Southeast Asia compared to Europe, which is too expensive and burdened with red tape. The best stepping stone is to be based in the UAE because of its strength as a logistical center.</p><h4>Do you see Sharjah as being more competitive than the other Emirates?</h4><p>Sharjah is centrally located; everything is easily accessible, including ports, airports, and a road network. We are strategically located and can be in any major city in the UAE within two hours. The infrastructure in Sharjah is also incredible, and today 40% of the UAE's manufacturing is in neither oil nor gas. </p><h4>What is needed to succeed in business in the UAE?</h4><p>The UAE, and especially Sharjah, is a land of opportunities. Anyone can be successful in any business they start here if they have a good product and put their heart and soul into it. If one conducts a business within the laws of the Emirate, it is easy to own and maintain your business here, especially when we compare Sharjah to other Emirates or neighboring countries.</p><h4>What are your expectations for National Paints for the coming 12 months?</h4><p>There is talk in the market about a recession, though in my opinion this is unlikely. Our market is growing and sales have grown YoY. We currently have 6% growth. We work with 3,000 companies including contractors, retailers, manufacturers, wood works, steel works, car re-finishers, and flooring companies, all of which are growing with healthy profit margins. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you stay competitive and differentiate yourself from the competition?</h4><p>To adequately compete in the UAE construction and trade market, it is essential to have accurate market analytics. We consistently review, analyze, and quantify the market in order to maintain our niche and work on projects. Our area of architectural metal works is specialized for hotels, malls, hospitals, towers, oil &amp; gas, residential, mixed-use, and airports. We deliver high-quality products and services for our customers, which greatly differentiates us in a crowded market. We also hire qualified and supportive staff, a professional corps of engineers, and technical team. We also actively seek out the newest and most efficient technology by attending international trade fairs. </p><h4>How do you assess the strength of the rules and regulations in the UAE?</h4><p>One of the best aspects of doing business in the UAE is that with its stellar growth, it has come to be known for attracting all businesses because of its efficient licensing rules and infrastructure, to name a few. It has strict, but favorable business regulations that protect labor rights and promote a healthy, transparent relationship between employers and employees. The UAE also has its own regulations that prohibit monopoly and encourage competition. It encourages private sector growth and maintains liberal policies in terms of foreign exchange controls, visa policies, and import regulations. This is why it is growing so fast. </p><h4>What led you to go overseas, and how are these operations performing?</h4><p>Expanding overseas is one of the most important targets for us to ensure we increase in turnover and growth. We work in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Uganda, where there is a big boom in construction and sub-contracting. We have also had projects as far apart as Angola, Kazakhstan, and India. We are extremely interested in India as a growing market because of the growth of luxury high-rises, airports, and hotels. In Africa, we have begun operating in Nigeria, where we have worked on palaces and villas for luxury properties. Our location attracts a great deal of business as when a contractor develops a luxury property, they seek out sub-contractors in the hub of construction and development. </p><h4>What are the main benefits of being based in Sharjah?</h4><p>Sharjah is all about location. The combination of developed infrastructure, capability, and professional logistics services makes Sharjah the perfect location for a business to have its headquarters. The cost of living is reasonable, transportation to and from work is reasonable, and the government is flexible and accommodating. </p><h4>What are the best strategies for the successfully managing and growing human capital?</h4><p>To maintain a great team with committed employees, a company has to run a successful business, manage well, and inspire loyalty and respect. Firstly, the system of management should be healthy, happy, and friendly so that employees feel safe and secure in their jobs. The second factor is timely salary payments. It is impossible to expect loyalty without respect, and if a company pays an employee less than they deserve or less than their work is worth, they will lose their employees' respect. Another of the most challenging things is to retain employees after they have developed, matured their skills, and are recognized in the business world for the unique asset they are.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for 2017 and beyond?</h4><p>We are extremely busy. We have a high rate of tendering within the industry—450 jobs for 1,000 quoted. Due to our professional reputation, strong portfolio, and positive relations with all our clients, we receive 4,000 inquiries annually. We have been in Sharjah since 1969, myself for 20 years, and I stand behind the success of our work. However, our achievement and accomplishment in this business were made possible by our dedicated team in every department. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[gassing-the-galaxy-galore]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What offshore and onshore infrastructure has Dana Gas put in place to be able to develop the Zora field? </h4><p>The Zora field is in a concession straddling the offshore waters of Sharjah and Ajman and has been delineated by three wells drilled between 1999 and 2002. The first production from the Sharjah-2 well, a dual lateral horizontal well with a combined horizontal length of 9,000ft, commenced in February 2016. Gas and liquids are brought from the unmanned offshore platform via a 12-inch pipeline to shore for processing in the Dana Gas Zora Gas plant located in the Hamriyah Free Zone and which is capable of handling 40mmscfd of gas with associated condensate and water. </p><h4>How would you describe Dana Gas' exploration success rate in Egypt, and what have been your latest investments there? </h4><p>In partnership with the Egyptian government, we operate 14 development leases along the Nile Delta and hold three large exploration concessions. Dana Gas is Egypt's fifth-largest gas producer. We consider Egypt a core country for us, which is why we signed the mutually beneficial Gas Production Enhancement Agreement to enable us to further invest in growth and provide a mechanism for our receivables to be paid down. We have invested over USD300 million in Egypt since 2015. We are doing well operationally in Egypt. Production is at 40,000bpd, a 24% quarter on quarter increase compared to 2016 and is at maximum plant capacity for the first time. We have achieved a high success rate of 92% on our exploration and development drilling campaign. We have also now reached maximum capacity at our El Wastani gas processing plant.</p><h4>How do you expect natural gas demand to evolve in the GCC in the next few years?</h4><p>My personal experience in the UAE in particular and the GCC more generally is that there is great understanding and concern about the impact of everyday decisions and activities on the environment, in addition to the COP21 commitments already made. Energy demand in the Middle East is expected to almost double from 14mmboe/d to 25mmboe/d in 2040. Fossil fuels are expected to continue to dominate on the supply side. Therefore, reducing CO2 emissions becomes a key challenge. Middle East CO2 contribution is currently only 5% of global emissions, but with the forecast demand growth through to 2040, CO2 emissions in the region will significantly increase. Gas currently contributes 51% of the demand in the Middle East and will contribute 54% by 2040. Furthermore, the use of oil is expected to fall as gas supplies increase from 58% to 67% of electricity demands by 2040. As such, the role of gas as a clean source of supply has the potential to play an increasingly significant role for Middle Eastern nations to comply with their COP21 commitments in lowering CO2 emissions. </p><h4>How significant is the role of the banking industry to support the gas sector?</h4><p>It is important. However, given the reality of our industry, with the cyclical rise and fall of prices and the inherent risk of exploration, it is not always easy for companies to access the funding they require. Our approach at Dana Gas is to take every step to be profitable when prices are low; everything beyond that is a bonus. </p><h4>How do you see the role of women in the Middle East evolving at the executive level, especially in your industry?</h4><p>After 30 years in this industry, I do not see any huge strides being made. No company or organization should have women at the executive level for visual effect alone; though diversity of thought and approach make great business sense. And quotas are nonsensical: merit and gender are two different things. That said, there is a great deal to overcome before we will see equal numbers of women at the executive level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major milestones you have accomplished as CEO in the last few years?</h4><p>In the last several years we have initiated work on four major projects. The first one is the development of our LNG import and regasification business. The plans for this project were developed in February 2016, and in October 2016 we signed an MoU with Uniper as a JV partner to implement the project. Another major milestone for the project was our signature of a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) with SEWA in May 2017. This agreement creates the critical mass for the project and supports the feasibility for us to continue developing it. We are targeting the full Northern Emirates market, not just Sharjah, and as such we are looking into collaborating with Dubai and Abu Dhabi to evolve this project as a strategic energy project for the entire UAE, supporting the energy security of the entire country. The second project is a gas exploration program. This is the first exploration project for SNOC. We completed a 3D seismic survey that covered more than 1,000sqkm using the latest technology. The high-quality resolution of the technology we are using now allows us to pinpoint sites with much greater accuracy. The geology of the Northern Emirates is extremely complex, which is why many wells missed their targets in the past. The third project is the LPG Blending Project. The project is an effort to divert our LPG production to the local market. Historically, our entire LPG production was exported to Japan. At the end of 2016, we decided not to renew our export commitment and instead decided to divert all our LPG to the local market.</p><h4>How will the envisaged LNG Joint Project with Uniper impact Sharjah's energy supply and the energy supply of the UAE?</h4><p>Gas availability has been an issue for the Northern Emirates for the past 15 years; demand has been skyrocketing and our production has been declining. In 2003, we reached the point where we could not satisfy even all of Sharjah's summer demand. This forced the various Emirates to look for alternative resources. The Dolphin Project closed most of the gap for Dubai and Abu Dhabi, but the Northern Emirates remained starved for gas and when they did get it they paid a premium. While there have been a number of intermediary arrangements, Sharjah has had to burn liquid fuel in the summer. SNOC's LNG Project should essentially close the gap between demand and supply for Sharjah and for the Northern Emirates. The expected capacity of LNG import and regasification will exceed Sharjah's demand gap, and there will be plenty of extra capacity to satisfy any other demand within the Northern Emirates. Still, this does not mitigate the huge swings between summer and winter. Domestic summer power demand is three times greater than in the winter. As a result, we are considering the fourth major project, a gas storage project. With the new LNG program, we will have excess gas, and with proper planning we will be able to make the gas storage project a reality.</p><h4>How does SNOC plan on modifying its operations to adapt to global trends toward preservation of environment and renewable energies?</h4><p>Historically, the environment question has been a major point of focus for SNOC and the previous holders of the concession. Since 1999, we have had a very extensive program aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions. BP had a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 10% over 10 years, and Sharjah cut more than 50% of emissions over the first five years of the program. When I joined SNOC in 2011, I enacted a set of strict rules regarding acceptable emissions during our flaring operations.  We are the best company in the country, perhaps the entire region, in terms of minimizing flaring. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on SEWA's innovation in creating a device to detect and prevent water spills, and how it will be implemented to better conserve water?</h4><p>The water management device is a prepaid device that is installed in Africa to control the supply and billing of water. Over 10 million devices have been installed there. In the UAE, we do not have the prepaid system yet; nevertheless, SEWA brought it in to control the supply of water to buildings. After installing and testing it, the device demonstrated superb results; it can both control water supply and provide alerts of an internal leak in any building. SEWA's water department installed it in all government buildings to only provide water supply during office hours and also to set a maximum flow to these buildings in the event that a leak occurs. Also, we are installing the management device in all Sharjah mosques to prevent any leaks or misuse of water. Finally, a few pilots were tested in villas and on verified leaks, and the device was proven to prevent leaks.</p><h4>What opportunities for synergy have you been able to explore as a result of SEWA's collaborations with the American University of Sharjah (AUS)?</h4><p>SEWA signed an MoU with AUS and Sharjah University to collaborate with them in the fields of energy, water, and innovative efficient practices. The synergy between up-to-date know-how and best industrial practices will produce creativity and innovation. SEWA hopes to offer innovative solutions to its customers during this collaboration, such as evaluation of water consumption patterns for different purposes as well as methods and techniques of rationalization of consumption, assessment of groundwater in Sharjah using GIS and remote sensing, assessment and development of gray water reuse systems and related policies, and the examination of water systems and certification of their performance. In terms of research, we expect to explore opportunities such as using solar energy to power air conditioning; tapping into hybrid solar, photovoltaic, and thermal energy; and managing electrical loads using independent hybrid power systems. We are also exploring campus sustainability in energy and water.</p><h4>How will SEWA's MoU with Meinhardt modernize Sharjah's water storage infrastructure?</h4><p>Meinhardt Singapore, a leading global multidisciplinary engineering and project management consultancy, and SEWA signed an MoU to create a collaborative platform to assist SEWA in its mission to provide world-class strategic planning, design, operations, and management of its water supply infrastructure. Meinhardt has identified six initiatives to modernize the water storage infrastructure in Sharjah; these include planning and engineering design consultancy services for the strategic water storage reservoirs for water crisis management and capacity building for SEWA. Through training programs held in Singapore, Meinhardt will share its global expertise for efficacious implementation and management of Sharjah's water infrastructure.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges in ensuring the supply of electricity and water to the entire Emirate?</h4><p>The biggest challenge is to sustain the supply through strategic and innovative plans that provide security of supply in a cost-effective way for residents today and future generations. SEWA has also entered into a venture with Bee'ah and Masdar on a new waste-to-energy facility, which is a landmark achievement in the region's renewable energy projects portfolio and a key step in the realization of the UAE's vision for a sustainable future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the investment-grade rating assigned to Sharjah by Standard &amp; Poor's?</h4><p>The rating of BBB+ shows the strength of the economy. It shows that the fundamentals of Sharjah are strong and solid, despite the global economic crisis and the turbulence we experienced in the financial market. Sharjah managed to maintain its rating on a yearly basis and maintain our solid position.</p><h4>How has the number of vendors and contractors registered with Sharjah's Finance Department evolved in the last year?</h4><p>The suppliers, customers, and business volume are always increasing; therefore, we always have more vendors and contractors listed in our database. We are committed to releasing payments of vendors and contractors as agreed, even in times of crisis. It really shows the strength of the financial processes we have in place.</p><h4>What role has digitalization and integration played in improving transparency and efficiency?</h4><p>Sharjah's finance department adopted the latest technology and applications as well as the best international standards in accounting and public finance. So, whether it is 60 or more, we are capable of handling this volume in the best way possible, and we have no problems in that. We have proper procedures and higher auditors who ensure that everything is in place. We see the management of our public finance department as one of the best worldwide. </p><h4>How do you expect VAT's introduction to transform Sharjah's economy?</h4><p>Of course, it did not come as a surprise. The VAT systems have been going through many years of study, analysis, and research, and it is in the best interest of the country and the wider Arab world. When the VAT system is implemented, it will be done in a proper way to add more value and improve the services of the Emirates.</p><h4>What is your strategy to ensure that Sharjah's growth is sustainable and inclusive?</h4><p>We have all of the elements of the economy working together, and we have all the factors in our favor. We have our reputation, our processes, our infrastructure, and the structure of our finance platforms—they are all in place. Therefore, growth will continue, and we always look for more ways to break records year after year. In 2017, the UAE had a record budget, and we will see this year what else we can do. </p><h4>How can the Finance Department ensure that foreign investments translate into maximum benefits for the Emirate?</h4><p>Foreign investment in Sharjah is not new. For decades, we have had foreign investors coming and we treat them as if this were their home. We do not tax their profits or levy fees when transferring funds. We have a freehold on a few projects in Sharjah and free zones where they can own 100% of the companies, so the environment for investing in Sharjah is in place. The investors that come to Sharjah have taken notice of these benefits.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I am always optimistic, and there are always ways to improve and develop. We feel that the future looks brighter and brighter. Under the leadership of our ruler, we always feel that he places the bar higher and higher year after year, and we are thankful that we are always able to translate his vision into reality and reach those heights, and we are always looking for a more challenging environment so that we can prove we are capable of beating our own records and achieving better results. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[steady-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SIB's profits continue to grow amid headwinds. What are the main reasons behind this success?</h4><p>SIB has always been a conservative banking services provider. We believe in steady growth instead of huge peaks followed by dropping valleys. This is in our DNA and the sponsors and bank's Board of Directors endeavor to see a consistent approach in increasing assets and profitability. The shareholders like to see stable growth and increase in shareholder value. At the same time, our continual focus on steady growth allows us to tap into new areas. While we have been well established in Sharjah, the bank has been expanding its footprint in the rest of the country. It is adding new customers in corporate, retail, and government businesses. Similarly, investment banking is a key area and has been growing at a decent pace, allowing us to increase our revenues.</p><h4>What role can SIB play in encouraging investment in the UAE in general and Sharjah in particular?</h4><p>No country can prosper without a sound and stable financial system in which banks play a pivotal role. The UAE is blessed with an encouraging financial services and banking sector that allows businesses to operate openly in the country. The policies of UAE governments have always existed to encourage foreign investment. We have seen the fruits of these policies; when regional economies faced many difficulties after the Arab Spring, the UAE became a magnet for capital and investment. The ability to hold the Expo 2020 and further expansion plans are an embodiment of these policies. In Sharjah, we see an increasing impetus from the government on infrastructure development and attracting FDI. There are two free zones in Sharjah, both of which are served by SIB. We encourage financing facilities for projects in the Emirate and look to provide financing solutions to our clients. We hope to offer more attractive solutions to our prospective customers, providing them with a one-stop solution while investing in the country.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the two  conflicting schools of thought regarding fintech?</h4><p>Technology has brought about the best from existing brick-and-mortar businesses. There is, for sure, room for technology to bring about change in banking systems. That said, banks depend on the trust of their customers, especially depositors. The need for brick-and-mortar banks will always remain; however, technology will complement banking services. As greater emphasis on smart services takes place, we will see technology in banking become more aggressive. Fintech is the next big thing in banking and is quickly taking root. While it may seem threatening, it will bring the best out of banks and allow them to be more customer centric. We have invested heavily in improving core banking systems, introducing impressive internet banking and mobile banking facilities to customers.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We expect the bank to post high single-digit or low double-digit growth in assets, credit, and profitability. We have increased our capital by issuing bonus shares and are likely to increase capital 10% by issuing a convertible sukuk, which will convert into equity of the bank and will not be tradable. The additional 10% of shares will be issued to an endowment that will be nominated by HH Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Federal Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah. Overall, in the banking sector, we expect challenges, which we will then to turn into opportunities. SIB's capital and strong investment grade ratings are the pillars that will allow us to convert challenges into opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bee'ah's new headquarters will be completely powered by renewable energy. How will the new HQ help Bee'ah develop its services?</h4><p>Bee'ah has been growing rapidly and has big ambitions for building a circular economy in Sharjah, and our new headquarters must reflect this big ambition. Today, the building is already under construction, and the projected completion date is in the last quarter of 2018. The building will be an icon and example for other energy efficient buildings. It will be platinum certified, which is the highest certification for sustainability in a building. It will also be 100% powered by renewable energy. We have also signed an agreement with Tesla for the building's battery storage. Other than being sustainable, it will also be a smart building and an example of how the office of the future should run. We will no longer be just a waste management company; we are working on many other projects. This is how the building reflects the vision of Bee'ah.</p><h4>What has been the motivation behind diversifying into different sectors?</h4><p>We believe in a circular economy, and Bee'ah in Sharjah has almost completed the move toward that circular economy, specifically when we look at waste. Currently, we have the highest waste diversion rate in the Middle East, at 70%. Recently, we signed a joint venture with Masdar for a waste-to-energy project for that remaining 30%. Once we reach that 100%, we will have completed the waste management loop, which is why we have to start looking into other sectors. In the end, the overall vision of Bee'ah is to improve the quality of life in Sharjah, the UAE, and the region. Technology is an area that touches everyone as well, and we also wanted to improve the quality of life with digital transformation. We created EvoTeq, which focuses on digital transformation in the public sector. This will have a strong impact on healthcare, education, logistics, and areas where we can influence and improve people's quality of life. It is about making things more convenient, healthier, and potentially life-saving through technology. We have also developed our first product in partnership with SAP, which is called SmartTrack. This is an advanced track-and-trace mechanism for pharmaceutical products to fight counterfeiting. We created a product that tracks a pharmaceutical product from the manufacturing facility to the end-user where the consumer can scan the product with a mobile app to know whether or not it is counterfeit. Also, this will enable health authorities to manage the supply and storage of medication across the country. </p><h4>You recently expanded your operations outside of Sharjah. What is unique about these operations?</h4><p>We started operations in Sharjah, and now we operate across the UAE. We manage one of the largest contracts in downtown Abu Dhabi and have around 1,000 people mobilized there. It is our largest government contract outside of Sharjah. To date Bee'ah has around 7,000 employees. In Abu Dhabi we provide waste collection services as well as street cleaning. Now we are exploring the recovery of waste and recycling. In Dubai we manage many iconic projects like Burj Khalifa, the World Trade Center, Internet City, and Media City, among others. We also seek to extend our services to Saudi and Oman. In Saudi Arabia, we have signed an MoU with the Public Investment Fund to explore partnership and project opportunities. Having become the leader in waste management, we now want to utilize our skills in other areas across the region. In addition to expanding geographically, Bee'ah is expanding into new services, such as technology, air quality, and water quality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[aluminum-is-the-new-gold]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sharjah seeks to become a waste-free city by 2020. How does Sharif Metals International contribute to this objective?</h4><p>Sharif Metals International, which specializes in metals recycling, runs advanced recycling facilities across the GCC/MENA whereby half a million tons of ferrous and nonferrous metals are recycled and converted from “end-of-life" (abandoned, post production, and post consumption industrial, construction, and household discarded) material into “back-to-life" feed stock material to industrial production line. Our Sharjah facility receives mostly aluminum cans, aluminum window and doorframes, obsolete automotive obsolete parts, and copper and aluminum cables. Our processes ensure no metallic material goes into landfills or pollutes the soil and under ground water. Knowing that recycling of aluminum reduces air and water pollution by 75% and saves energy by 95% is definitely helping achieving a waste-free city by 2020.</p><h4>Is the government pushing private enterprises to take the lead in making Sharjah waste free?</h4><p>The government is taking the lead in running awareness campaigns and demonstrating their commitment to the “waste free" concept. By founding Bee'ah, which is a government-owned firm and has been the leading company in waste management, the government is working closely with the private sector to ensure that materials get to the right facility and are not thrown into landfills. The government restricts recycling within environmentally approved and licensed facilities, and cracks down on unauthorized collectors or dealers who may not comply with regularities. Sharif Metals' collaboration with government authorities to receive any end-of-life material and ensure proper recycling procedures is an advanced synergy between the government and private sector for a waste-free city.</p><h4>What differentiates Sharif Metals International from its competitors?</h4><p>What differentiates us is our long track record in this business; Sharif Metals goes back to 1938 wherein my grandfather, A. Salam Al Sharif, was a coppersmith. Now my younger brothers and I are running the business. We know the business, and we set our vision toward the long-term and sustainable future. Sharif Metals International is also relatively resilient; if circumstances change, we have the ingredients to adapt to those changes. This approach has proven to be effective over the last 33 years of our operations in the UAE, as it has given us continuous growth results and sustainability for the next 10-15 years. Nurturing the fourth generation of Al Sharif family members to continue our legacy is also an asset in which we invest.</p><h4>How do you see the recycling field evolving in the Middle East particularly?</h4><p>The sector has excellent potential to grow because the Middle East is predominantly a consuming market; we do not generate many products here. A large percentage of our goods are imported from countries such as China and India that we could not compete with via local production. There are two main pillars here; the first is our abundant oil and gas resources. These local natural resources give us the comfort of being competitive in the products that we do manufacture. For example, we can produce aluminum from hydrocarbon products cheaply compared to the rest of the world because we have an inexpensive local supply of the raw materials. This aluminum production brings other byproducts and downstream industrial activities into the region and these in turn create a great potential for recycling. Secondly, construction is a major pillar in the region. There are growth prospects due to the vision of the UAE's leaders and the population is growing here again now. There will be excellent growth in the GCC in general. Also, BMR, as the “voice of recycling in the Middle East," has put great effort into serving its 156 members and 550 associate delegates, in recycling awareness and networking opportunities through its quarterly official board meetings and annual conference. BMR is connected with with other international recycling associations in America, Europe, India, and China. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 380 dumpsites across Oman replaced with 11 engineered landfills]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[eng-tariq-al-amri-ceo-beah]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Be'ah's current strategy to position itself as a leader in the solid waste management and other related segments? How is your divergence strategy going to help further develop Oman and its economy?</h4><p>To understand Be'ah's strategy it is necessary to look at waste management in Oman a few years back. There were different municipalities in charge of waste across the country and we had big issues when it came to the disposal of waste. All types of waste ended up in uncontrolled, open dump sites from household to healthcare and hazardous waste. There was also wastewater in the same places. The government decided to do something about the problem and a 2006 study came up with various recommendations. One recommendation was to set up a government company, a central body, to look at waste in general in Oman. This is how Be'ah came into existence in 2007. Our first goal was damage control; we could not allow these waste disposal practices to continue. Even the recycling industry in Oman was too informal, the safety and environmental standards were bad. Our priority was to replace the dumpsites with proper infrastructure and engineered landfills and then start providing municipal waste services across the country. We decided to close over 380 dumpsites across Oman and replace them with 11 engineered landfills supported by around 25 transfer stations and logistical hubs. Once we have the infrastructure ready in an area we tender for international players to come and provide the municipal waste services. That is stage one of our strategy, building the infrastructure. Stage two is providing municipal waste services. Special facilities need to be built to treat healthcare waste coming out of hospitals, clinics, and to a certain extent pharmacies. We moved to an autoclave system, which is basically a sterilization process, and then we can shred and landfill the waste. Now we have four autoclave lines here in Muscat, plus we have built another facility in the north close to Sohar and another in the south near Salalah. So we currently have three facilities treating almost 95% of all our healthcare waste. We have a huge issue with hazardous waste; we can only store it, and there are no treatment facilities here. In fact in the whole region there are only a few small facilities in Saudi Arabia to treat hazardous waste. We are planning an integrated facility in Sohar for this. Phase I will be ready by the end of 2017 and operational in 2018. We are floating tenders now to build Phase II, which is the most complex part of the project, and it should be ready by 2020. By 2020 we will have a state-of-the-art facility in Oman dealing with all kinds of hazardous waste.</p><h4>What messages are you giving to the public to increase awareness and change peoples' waste management habits to help Be'ah do its job?</h4><p>One of the success factors is the legal framework. This is as important as public awareness. This is one of the challenges for Be'ah because the legal framework is not sufficient, for example in terms of policing powers. We are working closely with the Ministry of the Environment to develop the right legislation. We have a first draft under review and hopefully within 2017 we will have a proper law, which will be followed by proper regulations. Once the legislation is in place we have to ensure there is proper policing of it. This framework would be a huge step forward in helping us with our plans and strategies. In terms of awareness there are two aspects—education and awareness. We have a joint team with the Ministry of Education to develop and update the government schools' curriculum to make sure environmental topics are included. That new curriculum should be implemented by 2019. This will be an ongoing process where we continue to update the syllabus as developments come in. In terms of public awareness we have a dedicated community outreach team that is out every day meeting different communities, households, and mainly schools. We are targeting future generations. We also have special interactive buses that go around the country doing roadshows at the schools. We have looked at what is going on around the world and we have picked the approaches we think are best for Oman and adapted these for use here.</p><h4>How easy is it to find the skilled engineers, chemists, and other professional talent you need to move your strategy forward?</h4><p>It was a challenge and it remains a challenge in some areas. When it comes to engineers they are readily available as graduates, but the problem comes with getting experienced engineers and chemists in this particular field. This is why we put so much emphasis on developing young Omanis at Be'ah. What makes us stand out among the companies in Oman is we invest heavily in people. We send them out on training programs and bring training programs into Oman. That said, we had to bring in experts from around the world, including New Zealand, Australia, and Denmark. We try to get the best experience into the company here. It is a challenge. In terms of Omanization, around 86% of our staff at Be'ah are Omani.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Controls around 75% of  total Costa Rica market share]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[federico-alvarado-director-general-alimentos-prosalud]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of the company and how has it transformed in the last 45 years?</h4><p>The company was founded in 1973 originally as a sardine producer. However, five years later an opportunity arose to start producing tuna because it was a source of cheap protein and a good supplement. In 1976-1978, Costa Rica went through a crisis, and the company wanted to offer an inexpensive product, and tuna was ideal for that purpose. In 2002, we inaugurated our new production facility in Barranca in Puntarenas. It was a modern and state-of-the-art 25,000sqm plant that replaced a 7,000sqm facility in Cocal. This new plant allowed us to expand to the international market. We started to export to the US, Europe, and even Asia. We continued to grow and are currently one of the largest companies in Latin America—no doubt the largest in Central America—in the tuna business. In 2005, we acquired Tesoro del Mar, which at that time was the second-largest tuna producing company. In 2012, we decided it was time for the company to innovate and participate in different types of businesses, and we changed our name from Sardimar to Alimentos Prosalud. We started working aggressively in innovation and entered other markets such as dry pasta; we also started working on our own R&amp;D department, where we have many people working on different formulas for completely new products. Now, we sell rice with chicken, pesto sauce chicken, and many other different products that many people had not thought of before. In 2018, we will start working with two new categories through the acquisition of two companies; these are different from our current segment but are growing rapidly worldwide.</p><h4>What is the average Costa Rican consumer like from your company's perspective?</h4><p>Costa Ricans have been consuming tuna for 70 years. It is the fourth country in the world in terms of per capita consumption; hence, it is a large and interesting market. However, the Costa Rican consumer is also demanding in terms of quality. They do not buy cheap products that come from other countries. We own around 75% of the total market share of Costa Rica. Of that 75%, close to 60% are for Sardimar and Tesoro del Mar, which are our premium brands. Of course, these have a price difference compared to other brands, but people are willing to pay for them because they know they are paying for quality. Costa Rica is an attractive market for that reason; eventough, competition increases every year and we have to be even more aggressive, efficient, and creative.</p><h4>How is the company innovating?</h4><p>We constantly offer customers new flavors and new presentations. We have to invest significantly in marketing to create brand loyalty and that has given us good results. If we look at what this company has launched, mainly of the Sardimar brand, we used to launch 20-25 products a year, some of which are stable shelf products, while others are seasonal.  </p><h4>What has been the strategy to enter international markets?</h4><p>Central America is similar to Costa Rica; it is a small market. It behaves a little differently because it prefers sardines to tuna and does not have such a strong tuna culture. This leads to competition being aggressive in Central America. We face competition from Asia, Africa, and Ecuador; it is simpler or cheaper to produce in those countries; for example, labor costs are much lower in Mexico, Ecuador, and Thailand. This makes our efforts to compete a little more complicated. We are not leaders in Nicaragua or Guatemala in the sardine business because competition is tough and regulations are not as established. There are extremely cheap products that arrive without taxes from Mexico, so there are barriers to entry in those countries. However, we are leaders in tuna products. Our prospects are brighter in areas like the US, Europe, and certain countries in Asia, because they are willing to pay for quality. We have 70% of the market share of the gourmet tuna in the US with the brand Tonnino and have been growing around 30-40% a year for the last eight years. The US will be the second-most important market for us in the coming years. We are investing in that and creating a whole team for the country; we have high expectations for what we can do there. Our strategy there is to offer high-quality, high-priced products with good margins and offer them to specialty chains such as Whole Foods. We have had excellent results so far and are trying to implement the same strategies in Germany, France, Italy, Qatar, and Bahrain, which have high incomes per capita and where such items are typically accepted.</p><h4>What has been the contribution of Alimentos Prosalud to the development of the country?</h4><p>We invest large sums of money in mainly three different areas. Education is the best way to prepare the people of a country for the future, and we are committed to investing in education. We concentrate our efforts in the Puntarenas area, and every year we provide the schools there with 6,500 book packages. We have also cooperated with them in the maintenance of their buildings. We go there annually to have people from the Puntarenas region that are now managers or chiefs in our company to give speeches to encourage children to continue their education. The other area where we help significantly is health; we recently donated to the local hospital in Puntarenas an ambulance for newborns, the first in the country. We also donated all the equipment for a new room for newborn care with incubators. The third one is related to the environment and sustainability. We only purchase our raw materials from certified ships that respect other species such as dolphins; we do not buy a single kilogram of fish from a boat that is not certified as dolphin safe. We force our suppliers to respect the mating season; if they do not comply, we stop purchasing from them. We have a strong respect for social and environmental responsibility.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Plans to introduce electrical power distribution products by the end of 2017]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jude-abalaka-managing-director-tranos]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the business environment like for Tranos over the past year?</h4><p>In 2016, we were working on a major power system project for telecoms that was completed early 2017. We have now moved from producing power systems to providing support for the equipment we produced. At the moment, we are focused on industrial customers. Historically, we have always had a B2B model; however, we now seek to expand into the B2C market. We seek to put our name out there and become more “consumer facing“ to promote our products. When we tell people about our company and what we do, a lot of people doubt that such a company exists in Nigeria. We plan to introduce several new products by the end of 2017 related to electrical power distribution. The design is complete and we have purchased new machines, with some of them currently on their way.</p><h4>How much of Tranos' raw materials are sourced locally?</h4><p>It depends on what we produce. On the mechanical side, for products like enclosures for example, the main raw material we use is sheet metal. We have a local factory for sheet metal on the outskirts of Lagos that we buy from. Generally, depending on what we produce, up to 90% of our products could be made from local raw materials. If we are producing a generator for example, only a handful of companies produce engines to a high enough standard so we have to import engines. If we take engines and alternators out of the equation as well as accessories such as hinges and locks, we aim to localize everything else.</p><h4>What do you hope to contribute to the “Made in Nigeria“ brand?</h4><p>The philosophy behind our strategy is not to just manufacture here and source raw materials locally to be able to say, “we did it in Nigeria.“ We look to localize production and make our products affordable and of a high quality. We are looking at it from the perspective of being able to compete internationally. Our target is to be able to compete with companies in Europe. We see that at the moment, we are competing with products from Turkey. We clearly produce better quality products than China; however, cost-wise we cannot compete with China because the quality is lower. We want to continue to improve so that eventually we can be at par with the best international brands. On some levels, we are already doing that; still, we have a great deal of work to do in terms of training personnel and putting systems in place. We have come a long way; we have contracts with international companies that operate in Nigeria that seek to be more localized. We are substituting what they used to buy from their foreign affiliates and have certainly made significant progress.</p><h4>How do you intend to change the mindset that products from Nigeria are as good or even better than products made in Europe?</h4><p>First, we benchmark ourselves with brands from the EU or US. We are in fact currently working with some of those brands. They incorporate our products and we appear with them at conferences as partners. The problem is that there is the current perception that if something is made in Nigeria, it must be much cheaper. However, this is not necessarily so. In local manufacturing, our main advantage is cheaper labor and elimination of some importation. However, when a company still needs to import raw materials, equipment and spares, some of those will certainly affect overall cost of production. Apart from that, there is still a great deal to do with regards to training personnel. It takes a toll on cost and time, and it is something that we need to look at. It is easy for us to sell our products through a different brand; however, we have a great deal of work to do to be able to market our products with our own branding.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that Nigeria's industry sector faces, and how does Tranos deal with them?</h4><p>Looking at demand, we see many competitors importing products that we produce here, or substituting them for cheaper Chinese products. First, we need to look for the sweet spot in the market where we are most competitive and try to focus on that. Most times, we lose market share based on our pricing; we need to identify where in the market our value will be appreciated and customers are willing to pay the right price for it.</p><h4>What do you want the government to do to help your business?</h4><p>Looking at the economy, there isn't sufficient purchasing power. However, compared to 2016, we have seen things pick up. Other challenges have to do with finding experienced personnel and also supply chain challenges. If we purchase a new machine, we will still have to fly someone in to train people on how to use it.  These are real business issues, but there is not much that the government can do about them. Still, my wish is for a solution regarding the ease of imports and exports. Currently, importing and exporting is relatively cumbersome. As a manufacturer, one of our biggest headache is with the supply chain. We have a situation where we have to order materials three months or six months ahead because of clearing delays.</p><h4>What do you expect for 2018?</h4><p>My outlook is that we will do the setting up of our new product line as well as train personnel given that we have concluded our design for the new products. We aim to have the new line of products launched in 2018. There is also a brand awareness campaign to introduce our products to the market under our brand and get people to recognize us. We will also begin to get more business from multinationals that need what we produce and are currently importing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We generally assess market share by looking at several different sources and indexes. A good deal of growth is forecasted in the market, new regulations have had both positive and negative effects on our business and the market in general, but we have chosen to view the changes as opportunities and are positioning ourselves accordingly.

In just six months, from December 2015 to June 2016, Virgin Mobile KSA added an additional 1.5 million customers, taking its user base to 2.5 million and pushing the established operators hard. It's a staggering success and has changed the way operators, industry, regulators, and investors look at the potential of the KSA telecom market. We invest a great deal of time into developing growth strategies and are witnessing the impact of that. We are committed to operating within the market with a great deal of agility; all of our internal processes allow us to react to changes rapidly and effectively, such are the advantages of an MVNO. This has been one of the major reasons why we were so successful in 2016.</p><h4>What trends do you see in regards to regulation of market dynamics and requirements?</h4><p>It is in the best interest of firms to disrupt the market in a positive way, to try and get the best prices for customers. By focusing on niche markets that the larger, more established telecoms firms have neglected to service appropriately, we have the ability to expand our market share, and thus position ourselves as a very unique service provider with best of breed technology. However, regulations in Saudi Arabia remain to be evolving so we can see some regulatory improvement to allow MVNOs to have more flexibility and balanced competitive edge operation. They are more agile, more nimble and more willing to take risks. MVNOs are also accelerating the digital transformation in Saudi Arabia, we at Virgin mobile Saudi are looking into digitizing our sales channels, member care and billing as we see those as three main areas that will help in transforming the industry digitally on the short term.</p><h4>As companies have begun stressing high quality and service, how have you been able to keep your prices competitive?</h4><p>We believe in providing our members with an exceptional experience rather than just a telecom service, increasing value for money dramatically, by providing our members with unique lifestyle propositions. When someone becomes a Virgin Mobile member, they are joining a family and taking part in the full Virgin Mobile experience. Such as the many initiatives we take part in throughout Saudi Arabia, some examples of which are the first ever Saudi Comic Con, or even our social media activations which give everyone the chance to be a winner. It is through initiatives like these that we believe in providing our members with something much more valuable than simple telecommunication services. With regards to our competitive prices, we do extensive research and analytics in order to build our pricing structure, after which we implement the pricing best suited for our target audience. Seeing as though the majority of our members consist of Saudi Youth, we must take into consideration the purchasing power of such individuals and as such we provide packages, bundles, and services that suit their specific needs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>Market dynamics are changing, so our strategy is to take the company to the next level in 2017. This year we had 60% growth, and that is very rare in the telecom industry. The customer now has multiple choices and we think we will benefit from being one of those choices with point of difference. We will continue to be leading the change in the Saudi market so that digital transformation, innovation, R&amp;D, and creativity set the path for our future digital aspiration. Our digital services strategy will demonstrate to our members our commitment and difference to remain consistent with delivering disruptive strategy. Right now, Virgin is concentrating on the youth market, and it represents one of our fastest growing demographics. People recognize the brand as being youthful and energetic, and we are trying to develop that across every aspect of our business. Last year was a huge jump forward for us, and now the entire team is aligned with our strategy for the future. Every aspect of the company is invigorated with a new spirit, and it is certainly paying off. We have had 93% engagement from our entire team, and we are dedicated to ensuring that our employees continue to feel appreciated. Too often there is a mentality in business that overlooks the importance of the team and the employees. Our philosophy is putting our people first, because if our people are happy, our customers are happy. An example of this would be our new “Young at Heart" headquarters in Riyadh that truly exudes the spirit of fun, dynamism, and energy. The office features an open space and many entertainment activities that allow our employees to feel at home as they work throughout the day, this has dramatically changed the way our people work and interact with one another, boosting morale in ways we have never seen before. We are sure that this sort of engagement will reverberate down to our members and their experience with our brand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Invest in Sharjah?</h4><p>Sharjah's leading investment promotion agency, 'Invest in Sharjah' is a one-stop shop for the promotion and facilitation of international businesses looking to establish in the Emirate. Since its official inception last year, the agency's in-depth market knowledge and thought leadership have been guiding investors to capitalize on Sharjah's competitive advantages which make the Emirate one of the UAE's and the region's most preferred investment destinations.</p><h4>What have been some of Invest in Sharjah's major accomplishments since it was established?</h4><p>We started under the name of the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority (Shurooq) in 2012, but the growing demand for our services required us to rebrand ourselves as a more specialized agency for international investors keen on setting up in Sharjah. Our key objective is to attract and retain more strategic long-term investments, with a special focus on increasing FDI opportunities through strategic government partnerships clearer. We are active in both local and international circles, where we host events involving major business councils, and undertake diplomatic missions and roundtables to promote new projects that are coming into Sharjah. Such activities are not only aimed at promoting Invest in Sharjah; they try to put the entire Emirate under the global business spotlight and engage our stakeholders everywhere.</p><h4>What has the organization gained from visiting new markets such as China?</h4><p>At Invest in Sharjah, a host of investment promotion managers with expertise in specific markets around the world are constantly working with their international counterparts to discover new areas of collaboration. Currently our main focus areas are China, India, Italy, the UK, the US, and the GCC. The forums and events that are held in India and China provide us with a great platform for understanding the requirements of the Indian and Chinese markets and to meet potential investors in these countries. We have been to three such gatherings already in China this year, and there is more to come. The same goes for India, which we have visited twice this year. Sharjah is already a popular investment destination among the Southeast Asian countries, but events help to keep them updated with our new initiatives, the promotion of our new free zones, and our industry-specific opportunities. We customize our market strategies to fit the requirements of the country we aim to target. In some cases, our strategy is to promote the Emirate itself, and in other countries where Sharjah is well established, we pitch specific projects and investment opportunities. Continuing the India-China example, while the former country knows where and what Sharjah is, the understanding of the opportunities is still in its nascent stages in many parts of China. In essence, our marketing strategies are born out of careful research and study of a country's competitive advantage and investment opportunities to be able to effectively facilitate their entry into our markets as quickly and cost effectively as possible.</p><h4>What unique role does Sharjah play in the region and how does it contribute to the UAE's overall growth?</h4><p>We always emphasize the importance of our strategic geographic location and demographic mix. Not only do countries on both sides of the world have numerous access points in Sharjah, which has been serving as a bridge between the East and West for years, but we also connect Abu Dhabi and Dubai to the rest of the Northern Emirates. As the industrial and educational hub of the UAE, our coastline includes both the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, and our locational importance to the world can never be overstated. We are the only Emirate in the UAE with access to both. We offer world-class business infrastructure through our free zones and our focus on recycling and waste management make us unique. All these put together make Sharjah's role central to the growth of the UAE as well as the entire Arab region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the level of exports evolved since 2016?</h4><p>Sharjah exporters have seen a 5% increase in their exports since last year in figures released by the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI). This shows that the market demand for Sharjah's products remains robust, and we are confident that there is potential for continued growth over the next two years. Lubricants are the largest export products, followed by products in the food and beverage category. In third are electrical and mechanical products, with switchgears the fourth-largest export products. Currently, Sharjah has around 2,500 manufacturers, of which 2,000 operate in free zones. The value of the products exported from Sharjah is around AED60 billion (USD16.3 billion).</p><h4>How do you assess your trade mission to Uganda and Kenya in collaboration with SCCI in late 2016?</h4><p>East Africa is a lucrative and potential market for UAE- and Sharjah-based products, especially for food and beverages, plastics, iron, and steel. These products are in high demand in East Africa, especially in Uganda and Kenya, and our registered companies in that region have seen 15% growth in exports over the past three years. Today, the trade mission is in its third year, and the number of companies grows every year. East Africa, and Africa in general, is a huge market with a lot of potential, so we will be focusing on that continent for the next five years. Our biggest partner in the GCC is Saudi Arabia, and we are also looking to export and invest more in Saudi Arabia, as well as other GCC countries. Beyond Africa and the Gulf, we are also looking at CIS countries. That market also has a lot of potential and opportunities for our products. The UAE has signed an agreement with the CIS that will facilitate UAE products reaching those countries. There was already an MoU with Kazakhstan, and now the whole CIS region is open to UAE exports and products.</p><h4>What incentives do you have in place or will you introduce to promote more exports going forward?</h4><p>For companies participating in trade missions and exhibitions abroad, we pay between 15-20% of their travel and participation expenses. We want as many SMEs as possible to participate in trade missions, fairs, and exhibitions to take advantage of the opportunities that are out there, so we will continue to support them with such incentives. For our members, payment methods and regularity are issues. So we try to provide them with alternatives like credit insurance, which is a new product that will be launched by Sharjah Exports to mitigate this risk and problem. This product will help our exporters secure their payments in a timely and guaranteed manner.</p><h4>How would you describe the current export policies and regulations in Sharjah for exporters? </h4><p>We are well rated in terms of ease of doing business. On the export side, the UAE government is fully supportive of exports from all of the Emirates. The UAE in general is a place that makes doing business easy, with a lot of shipping lines connecting our ports. In order to have a strong export culture, one needs to have great ports, facilities, and other such infrastructure, in which the UAE and Sharjah have invested heavily. We have industrial areas that are well connected with other ports and facilities, making it easier and cheaper to export goods from the UAE.</p><h4>What role does the SEDC play in terms of job generation and training?</h4><p>Sharjah Exports supports specialized and technical workshops and training programs, and emphasizes the importance of human capital and skilled labor in the industrial supply chain and export industries. We work with local manufacturers to help train people in the use of machinery and new technologies used by the manufacturers, and sometimes we engage with an original equipment manufacturer like General Motors to ensure more components are produced here in Sharjah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What milestones has SCCI achieved in promoting innovation?</h4><p>In line with the UAE's vision, the SCCI is focused on maintaining a culture of innovation, promoting creativity in all fields of operation, and enhancing competitiveness. The SCCI seeks to realize the vision of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, to achieve sustainable development and a knowledge-based economy through continuous efforts to provide an environment conducive to development, innovation, and education. The most recent program launched by Sharjah Chamber was “Business on Wheels,“ during the “UAE Innovation Week“ at the Sharjah Expo Centre. First of its kind in Sharjah, Business on Wheels offers clients, investors, and proprietors a mobile, one-stop solution to complete their transactions, issuance of certificates of origin, attestation, and signature. The vehicle is a mobile office furnished by the chamber with all the necessities for completing a variety of transactions. Early in 2017, the chamber launched a package of services and initiatives called the “Workshop to Innovate“ aimed at developing ideas that increase everyday productivity. This will be implemented through an application for interactive games that motivate staff to increase their efficiency, focus, and elevate their competitive edge. The chamber also communicates with members and the public through a smart application to provide a “one window“ service, in coordination with the Sharjah Economic Development Department (SEDD).</p><h4>What are the chamber's primary tools for communicating with the public, the private sector, and potential partners abroad?</h4><p>Currently there are more than 45,000 SMEs operating in Sharjah. The SCCI provides all regions of Sharjah with integrated services of international standards. Sharjah Chamber pushed further development by adding value to the economic arena through launching the Expo Centre Sharjah, Sharjah Export Development Center, Sharjah International Commercial Arbitration Center (Tahkeem), Sharjah Training and Development Center, and Sharjah Economic Excellence Award. We also oversee the Sharjah Award for Best 10 Entities, Sharjah Green Award, Sharjah Award for Social Responsibility, Sharjah Award for Business Start-ups, and Sharjah Award for Entrepreneurship. The SCCI also maintains close ties with the different local government entities in Sharjah as well as its counterparts in other Emirates under the umbrella of the UAE Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry. We also have a strong role in the Federation of GCC Chambers, working alongside our counterparts in the Arab world to elevate and integrate the economic performance of the UAE and our neighbors to the highest level. The SCCI receives delegates from countries all over the world to improve bilateral ties by strengthening economic, commercial, and investment relationships. We take part in economic events, international meetings and conferences, and organize visits by commercial delegations year round. Sharjah Chamber recently launched a new initiative under the theme “business breakfast“ with the purpose of bringing a select group of Sharjah CEOs together with representatives of diplomatic missions and business council members across the UAE. </p><h4>How does the SCCI encourage growth in the private sector and help businesses build their international profile?</h4><p>The SCCI designed a business incubator project to provide continual assistance for start-ups by providing support resources and services.  The project aims to create a conducive growth environment for start-ups and increase their chances of success in the early stages of operation, which are often the most difficult for new businesses. In addition to helping transform preliminary research and feasibility studies into marketable projects, we offer various support, facilities, and experience to help foster growth. Sharjah Chamber supports start-up investments and honors outstanding businesses of all sectors by providing them with various advantages like allocating monetary awards, international promotion, and increased networking. Each of our awards is given with the intention of spreading a culture of quality and excellence in all segments of the private sector and to support and motivate young entrepreneurs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sharjahs-surge]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has SEDD played in encouraging growth in manufacturing and making it attractive for newcomers?</h4><p>Industrial output represents about 18% of the Emirate's GDP. SEDD plays a great role in developing the industrial sectors by identifying investment opportunities, developing industrial indicators, building databases, and undertaking more than 90 visits to factories. The number of industrial licenses increased by 2.35% in 2016 compared to the previous year. This growth was due to significant cooperation between SEDD and our local and foreign partners. In addition to taking an active role in monitoring trends in the sector, developing lines of communication, and encouraging growth, we are continuously developing and improving our industrial infrastructure. We work hand-in-hand with the appropriate government bodies for the external promotion of industry, technical support programs, and to forge bilateral cooperation with foreign countries and businesses.</p><h4>How does SEDD work to attract FDI and foreign entities to bring their commerce to Sharjah?</h4><p>SEDD promotes Sharjah through its participation in local and international economic exhibitions and forums. These are excellent platforms for attracting investors and international attention to Sharjah because of their diverse participation and attendance. SEDD also places great value on developing economic, trade, and cultural relationships between Sharjah and foreign entities. In this way, we can increase mutual investment rates across all sectors, provide top-of-the-line facilities, and overcome obstacles in international commerce. Sharjah enjoys one of the most attractive and promising environments for investment because of its range of safeguards, incentives, and state-of-the-art facilities. Raising awareness at international conferences and forums is vital to promoting Sharjah's economic and trade comparative advantages, in addition to acquiring expertise and capabilities.</p><h4>What are the most effective methods of promoting and facilitating two-way communication between government entities and citizens?</h4><p>SEDD's customer satisfaction rate of 95% is one of the highest for a public organization globally. This demonstrates the department's level of experience in dealing with the public and service seekers. SEDD's ability to effectively communicate with individuals is based on four criteria. The first is the availability of continuous communication, through direct or indirect channels, such as e-services like the Tasheel service centers. The second is the effectiveness of communication between the government and individuals, which we evaluate in periodic surveys. Third is SEDD's ability to anticipate people's needs by predicting obstacles or challenges in the market. The last criterion evaluates our efficiency in resolving complaints and addressing the actual requirements of individuals.</p><h4>Sharjah is undergoing great transformations in several sectors. How do you measure the Emirate's growth, especially in relation to the duties of SEDD?</h4><p>Sharjah boasts several unique historical, cultural, social, and infrastructural components, making it a chosen destination for residence and work. The explosive population growth we have witnessed in the last three to four years presented the need for government entities to increase the number of e-services, employees, service channels, and regulatory inspectors, for which we have accommodated. The Emirate's expansion in terms of transport, education, healthcare, and manufacturing are reflections of Sharjah's growth and renewed potential. Sharjah had a 3.5% GDP growth rate in 2016 and increased the number of active business licenses to more than 72,000 by the end of 2016, up 6.1% from the previous year. The economy grew healthily sector by sector as well, by 7% in manufacturing, 6% in construction, 9% in the wholesale and retail, 6% in restaurants and hotels, and 7% in the real estate and business services area in 2016. Furthermore, Sharjah witnessed an increase in the general production to AED140 billion (USD38.1 billion) in 2016, a growth of 4%. The volume of fixed capital formation in 2016 exceeded AED25 billion (USD6.8 billion), public investment increased by 5%, and the number of micro enterprises increased by 22.6%. We are very confident in our goals of attracting investment and maintaining customer satisfaction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the growth of Sharjah's strongest sectors over the last 12 months, and which areas are you looking to develop?</h4><p>Shurooq's activities throughout 2016 have focused on increasing investment in four key sectors: tourism and leisure, healthcare, transport and logistics, and real estate and the environment. With regards to the first sector, Shurooq has committed itself to meeting the continuing tourist demand for different experiences. Sharjah manages and develops a number of the Emirate's key lifestyle and leisure projects, and has seen a number of heritage projects become fully established in the last year. Cultural tourism visitors in Sharjah grew from 548,115 in 2012 to 682,734 in 2013 and 706,777 in 2014. With respect to healthcare, Sharjah is positioning itself to be a medical services hub in the region, with growth being fueled by the increasing demand for specialized tests and procedures. Sharjah's healthcare sector is expected to grow to approximately USD2.5 billion by 2019, with its pharmaceutical market size predicted to reach USD1 billion by the same year.</p><h4>How is Shurooq actively supporting and encouraging SME growth in Sharjah? </h4><p>Sharjah is considered one of the top SME-friendly destinations in the MENA region and is currently home to more than 55,000 SMEs, with the growth of this sector influenced by easy and cost-effective market access, growing confidence, sustainable profitability, and the Emirate's SME-friendly services and facilities. Sharjah hosts a number of organizations dedicated to promoting and facilitating entrepreneurship across sectors, including Sharjah Entrepreneurship Centre (Sheraa), Sharjah Business Women Council, NAMA Women Advancement Establishment, Irthi Contemporary Crafts Council, and Ruwaad Establishment, which work to provide new startups with everything they need to become established and profitable ventures. Future opportunities that Shurooq is aiming to capitalize on are the upcoming free zones Sharjah Healthcare City, Sharjah Publishing Free Zone, and Sharjah Media City. We have strong hopes for this sector. Sharjah Economic Development Department issued 35% more new trade licenses during the first two months of 2016 than over the same period in 2015, indicating its underlying importance for Sharjah's investment landscape.</p><h4>What was achieved in your meeting with the Macedonian delegation and what potential do you see there?</h4><p>Shurooq's hosting of the Macedonian business delegation was just one of a series of meetings undertaken by the authority in the last 12 months to explore initiatives that will lead to mutual benefits for countries that ally themselves  with Sharjah's economic growth plans. Shurooq is committed to exploring diversified and tailored opportunities with economies from around the world, strategically creating business advantages, new jobs, and new room for profitability for both Sharjah and its partner countries. From a business perspective, Sharjah has developed rules and regulations on trade policies, taxation, safety, and customs to cater to the demands of international markets.</p><h4>What are the biggest opportunities and challenges facing Sharjah in the medium to long term?</h4><p>The biggest challenge we continue to face is one of perception, and enabling countries and nation states across the world to find out about Sharjah and to understand the plethora of economic advantages it offers. Global economic growth and ever-changing investment trends are factors that we continuously assess to make sure that our investment promotion strategies are in line with market demands. Sharjah offers fertile ground for investment across its various sectors and industries, meaning economic powerhouses can perceive the Emirate as a new area for investment growth and one that provides access to a network of opportunities across the MENA region. Thanks to its wise leadership that is committed to enhancing economic growth, more global investors are seeing the UAE as a prime destination for business expansion into the Middle East and other markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[growth-from-the-grass-roots-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><span class="red"></span>What are the main themes of Sharjah's economic vision, and what are the guiding principles of these themes? </h4><p>Under the leadership of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah and Member of the UAE Supreme Council, Sharjah has been guided by the principle of equitable and comprehensive economic development. This principle articulates the nature of our economic ambitions as well as our direction for the future. We believe that economic activity is not only transactional, whereby goods and services are exchanged and circulated in return for money. We believe that economic activity is a transformational process that integrates social and cultural development, and that all members of society should be part of this process in one way or another. It is a vision based on moving forward all together and not just a few of us who have the means to conduct business. As a result of this vision, Sharjah places its first and foremost focus on the development of human capital because we believe the human being is the source and catalyst of any sustainable economic activity. This focus has led Sharjah to offer world-class education, create support programs for entrepreneurs, empower women and children, host cultural activities that integrate all members of our society, and build sustainable infrastructure that facilitate the implementation of our vision and strategy on ground.</p><h4>At a time of massive global change and regional instability, Sharjah is making remarkable economic achievements. How has the Emirate shielded itself from these economic fluctuations?</h4><p>We pride ourselves in Sharjah on our strict economic diversification philosophy. No one sector represents more than one-third of our GDP. This strategy has proven its worth during the recent crises that shook global markets. While some regional and global markets were struggling or on the verge of collapsing, Sharjah was making steadfast progress in its economic activity with significant stability, which gives investors greater confidence in our Emirate. This strategy also allowed us to move steadily in global rankings on many fronts. For example, we have recently been announced one of the top cities in the world for connectivity based on internet penetration and the capability and ease of movement of goods. This report, which was managed by FDI Intelligence Magazine, confirmed that Sharjah has established itself as an essential Middle East hub of modern continental trade thanks to its logistics, seaports, and airport capabilities that helped us secure a place among the leading global connectivity cities. In terms of the future, we plan to continue building world-class infrastructure. The 2017 plans reflect our intention to continue spending on our infrastructure with a 7% increase compared to last year. Our total spending on infrastructure represents 30% of our budget this year, and this commitment attracts local and global investors alike as their confidence in Sharjah's economy and future rises. </p><h4>Many governments rely significantly on PPPs to advance their economic agendas. In Sharjah, what sectors do you see PPPs focus on?</h4><p>Fruitful PPPs are essential in the development of any economy and Sharjah is not an exception to that. A PPP is the best solution for the speedy implementation of affordable infrastructure development, and as Sharjah continues to grow and expand into new sectors, it is important that we boost our partnership with the private sector, which has the power and resources to be a difference-maker. The speedy growth in population, combined with our economic vision that includes major projects and expansions, places additional demands on infrastructure and the only way to cope with these demands is to partner with the private sector. We expect our PPPs to yield investment in critical infrastructure as well as social infrastructure such as healthcare and education. The environment, transport and logistics, light manufacturing, tourism, and support for entrepreneurship programs are also areas where the private sector is welcome to contribute. The world is shifting rapidly in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. The global economy is changing rapidly and Sharjah is planning to stay ahead of the curve by investing more in technology, education, innovation, and research and development. We see great opportunities in these areas for the private sector to contribute. </p><h4>What are the pillars you will focus on in the future to ensure the competitiveness of Sharjah?</h4><p>One of the pioneers of the internet revolution said, “There is not a problem large enough that innovation and entrepreneurship cannot solve." Intellectual ingenuity invents new things that have practical utility, and economic ingenuity finds a profitable way to bring the new products to market. It is a symbiotic relationship that has worked for the greater wellbeing of mankind since time immemorial. The world's leading cities and nations have adopted knowledge-based economies built on innovation and creativity, the key component of which is the people. We will continue our investment in local talent as well as focus on attracting talents from all over the world to ensure continuous innovation in all sectors. We will work tirelessly to ensure excellence of government services and infrastructures at all levels to encourage more FDI. We also constantly review our policies and regulations to make sure that our government plays the role of enabler, not just regulator. We also launched the Invest in Sharjah initiative, which is spearheaded by Shurooq, and our aim is to share the Sharjah success story with as many investors as possible in all markets. Our trade delegations have been active in Europe, China, and North America organizing meetings with potential investors. Their efforts have paid off and will continue so in the future. Our investment outreach program has given a chance to formulate a positive narrative about Sharjah in the investment circles, which is being translated in Sharjah receiving more investments thus bolstering our competitiveness.</p><h4>How is the youth of Sharjah empowered through entrepreneurship?</h4><p>Sharjah has all the innate advantages of the region: a young demographic hungry to advance itself, a well-educated and motivated corps of female workers, and centers of academic excellence like University City. It has a business-friendly culture, a secure and supportive environment for small business start-ups, and good infrastructure and access to the booming markets of the Gulf, Africa and South Asia. That is where projects such as the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center “Sheraa" initiative come into play. The core of the Sheraa concept is that each one of us is responsible for the future of the region, and for the generations that will inherit it. We have built this center around campus because we believe that our students should learn the skills of business and economy as young as possible. The world today is not made for job seekers but job creators, and we in Sharjah government understand this fact well. This is why we have invested in centers like Sheraa and other programs supporting and encouraging the idea of entrepreneurship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[National target of 7.2GW of geothermal energy by 2025]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[yunus-saefulhak-director-geothermal-ministry-energy-mineral-resources]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the potential for geothermal energy in Indonesia?</h4><p>Indonesia is one of the most attractive geothermal regions in the world with a potential of more than 17.5GW reserves and 11GW resources. If we compare this to the installed capacity today, Indonesia runs around 1,698.5MW per day, or around 9.3% of our total reserve of 17.5GW. Based on our national energy policy, our target is to have 23% of our national energy mix come from renewables in 2025 and geothermal expected to contribute 7.2 GW or 16% out of the renewables energy share. It means that we need additional 5,000MW in less than 10 years.</p><h4>What is the strategy to reach this ambitious target?</h4><p>The Indonesian government sees this as being achievable as much as it is ambitious. We have the entire support network to achieve this. The government has provided necessary breakthroughs in terms of geothermal acceleration for this program. Special assignments have been issued to state-owned enterprises to develop geothermal concessions without a tender process. Secondly, the government allows for preliminary survey assignments plus exploration. For such preliminary survey assignments and explorations, a company is allowed to commence drilling without a geothermal license once it fulfills the necessary requirements. The third action is the simplification of our licensing and permitting process, which has been reduced from 29 licenses to three licences for business entities conducting geothermal operations. We are eliminating unnecessary licenses and shorten the time period. In fact these permits have been centralized through our One Stop Service Centre (PTSP) at Investment Coordination Board (BKPM). Furthermore, the government has exclusively alocated USD300 million in our national budget for exploration drilling. Each of these concessions will be drilled by the government, at least three wells, and if the geothermal potential is proven to be economical then it will be tendered for the next stage. This reduces the risk for the private sector at the exploration stage, especially as the main obstacle has been the willingness of financial institutions to provide loans. The fifth action is the acceleration of the tender process, and in 2017 we expect to finish five concession tenders to the private sector, especially in the east of Indonesia, an area with the greatest potential and the highest price for the PPA. In addition, the government provides fiscal and non-fiscal incentives for geothermal, including VAT exemptions, tax holidays, and no import duties on imports of geothermal materials. In terms of non-fiscal incentives, the government provides a guarantee that PLN will not fail to fulfill its entire obligation to pay under the PPA. The government assures that all electricity will be paid to the IPPs within their contract period.</p><h4>What is the role of the Geothermal Fund set up by the Ministry of Finance in June?</h4><p>The financing of the USD300 million, which is named as Geothermal Fund, is under PT SMI, one of our SOEs focusing on infrastructure financing in the broadest sense. The main goal of Geothermal Fund is to mitigate exploration risks, which become the main obstacle in geothermal development.  All concessions that are succesfully explored and being proven by the PT SMI, will be tendered to private entities and the winner will repay all the exploration costs that have been spent. The funds will then be used for drilling another concessions. Ministry of Finance, ESDM and PT SMI, have a MoU in cooperation whereby ESDM will provide the technical assistance and may have support from other international consultants.</p><h4>What will be the best policy moving forward to encourage geothermal energy from a pricing perspective?</h4><p>The previous policy was to implement a feed-in tariff for geothermal. However, the government need to guarantee an affordable electricity price for the community and provide a competitive price for industry. The government recently had issued the new pricing policy through Ministry Regulation No. 50/2017 in wich using the ceiling tariff mechanism. The government seek to provide enough energy and electricity for the entire country given that the energy infrastructure in the east is much less developed. By providing enough electricity, we also seek to lower the cost of electricity and subsequently encourage industry to come to Indonesia since production costs will be lower. This is the main reason why we changed our policy from a feed-in tariff to a ceiling price.</p><h4>How do you address the education requirements of geothermal energy production?</h4><p>It is not as easy to educate communities as we initially believed; there are still some resistance from local communities that believe geothermal will cause incidents like the “Lapindo Disaster," which was actually an oil and gas development. This requires education about geothermal and how it is a different type of technology, with different technical aspects.</p><h4>What is being done to reduce the costs of the exploration stage?</h4><p>The cost of drilling a well in Indonesia varies from USD6-10 million, while the average exploration cost of one well is USD8-10 million; however, most of these costs depend on the infrastructure and depth of the hole. In more remote areas with less infrastructure, costs are much higher. Aside from coordinate with local government and government institution for infrastructure, the government creates a knowledge-sharing forum between related stakeholders for sharing best practices. We have set up regular meetings with geothermal IPPs to review the drilling processes and share knowledge. We seek to find the most efficient technique to develop our wells and are progressing well. Some of the developers has managed to incur lower drilling costs using a new methodology and we seek to replicate that in other areas. This knowledge is shared with all IPPs so that they can use the most efficient process to lower exploration costs. In terms of electricity generation, we also had a knowledge-sharing discussion. Our first power plant using ORC technology in Sarulla project for example. This project seems has a higher production than expected now and we seek to emulate the success elsewhere. We envision being a knowledge-sharing hub, along with our Center of Excellence and R&amp;D department.</p><h4>How would you address the international community of investors to help support your geothermal objectives?</h4><p>Geothermal business opportunity in Indonesia is still widely open. The national target for developing geothermal energy is 7.2GW in 2025. We now have 70 geothermal concessions, of which 40 have already been granted geothermal licenses. There are around 30 more concessions to develop and offer to investors and partners, so this is an opportunity for the private sector to develop our geothermal industry alongside the government. Our intermediate goal is for Indonesia to be the second-largest country in the world for geothermal electricity development by 2018 and by 2022 Indonesia become the largest country in the world for geothermal electricity. We are currently in third place, behind the United States and the Philippines. We need the support from the private sector, banking institutions, and lending institutions to achieve this 7.2GW program and the government provides the necessary incentives and investment details for them. This is a great opportunity for the private sector to be a part of Indonesia's geothermal development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[raoul-restucci-managing-director-petroleum-development-oman-pdo]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategy is PDO currently following in order to mitigate the impact of low oil prices?</h4><p>There is a comprehensive effort to leave no stone unturned in our drive for cost control/efficiency and value creation, including far greater collaboration with our contractors. Throughout 2016, we staged 24 Contract Optimization Reviews (CORs), which are focused, multi-day workshops where we, together with the relevant contractor, identified opportunities for efficiency enhancement and waste elimination. This resulted in the identification of USD64 million cost savings for the year, and importantly with efficiency/productivity gains for PDO and our contractors. Our strategic partnership with Petrofac has enabled us to save in excess of USD480 million on key equipment and other purchases for our Yibal Khuff mega project. For 2017, we have set an aggressive target of 30 CORs. Already 20 had been completed by the end of August, identifying around USD185 million of cost benefits. We have challenged all of our projects and standards to examine if there are any ways we can explore and produce hydrocarbons more competitively and efficiently and our second Focused Results Delivery (FRD) program has identified an opportunity to simplify the regulations around our small oil and gas facility projects that could save more than USD100 million a year. We undertook this after the success of our first FRD program in 2016 which identified over 500 cost-saving improvements through the removal of “nice-to-haves“ in our engineering standards. One particular area I'd like to highlight is our Lean program which has transformed the way we work by stripping out waste and streamlining our practices across all aspects of our business. It's integral to all we do internally, but there remains much scope for expanding our Lean practices across our supply chains. So far, Lean has helped us to generate around USD1 billion through cost saving, revenue generation, and cost avoidance, and over 5,000 ideas for continuous improvement ideas have been submitted by our staff. Lean has galvanized all levels of the Company, delivering tangible benefits by freeing up resources and ratcheting down costs.</p><h4>Although PDO has 178 producing oil fields, approximately 10,000 active wells and had its highest oil production in 2016, does PDO have any plans to expand its exploration and drilling operations?</h4><p>We have to work within the mandatory parameters laid down by Government in the light of the OPEC production agreements. However, our focus remains on delivering our growth program with ever-increasing efficiency and staying the course on our key strategic priorities. We remain very bullish about our growth prospects as our portfolio remains healthy and profitable. We are capable of ramping up our long-term production plateau to at least 650,000 bpd in the next three years but are being guided by the Ministry of Oil and Gas on future targets. I'm particularly proud of the approach taken by our exploration team which has proficiently hooked up and monetized all exploration discoveries, enabling it to fully recover its exploration spend within the same year.</p><h4>As evidenced through the GlassPoint EOR project, how is solar energy transforming the way PDO is doing business?</h4><p>PDO is working to transition to a fully-fledged energy company with a greater emphasis on renewables, especially solar because of the Sultanate's climate. There is no reason why Oman cannot become a global leader in solar energy expertise and we are determined to play a major part in that. The Miraah project to produce steam for thermal enhanced oil recovery has already shown the scale of our ambition and we are currently actively implementing a number of other solar ventures in both our hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon portfolios. For example, we are now almost two thirds of the way through a project at our Muscat headquarters to install more than 19,500 solar roof panels on car parking lots. When finished next year, this will generate 9.5 million kWh annually to power key office buildings, with the electricity being diverted to the domestic grid during off-peak periods. Meanwhile, we will soon be issuing an invitation to tender (ITT) for up to five 20 MW solar projects in our concession, mainly scattered in the area between Bahja and Marmul. The aim of the project is to save gas through the daytime generation of power while learning how best to support and service photovoltaic (PV) solar facilities in our operating environment. The overall venture is expected to introduce an equivalent fuel saving of 70.5 million cubic metres of gas per annum (US$17 million a year), reducing our dependency on conventional gas turbines. It will also reduce overall CO2 emissions by around 8,550 tons annually. Along with the gas saving and the environmental benefits, the enterprise will be a landmark in the country as it will be the biggest solar PV initiative to date and bolster our position and operating experience in renewable energy.</p><h4>What main initiatives is PDO currently rolling out across its multiple operations?</h4><p>These are many and varied but I'd like to flag several which will give you a flavour of our direction. In January, we launched PDO's in-house behavior-based safety system called Ihtimam in three pilot areas and it has provided a step change in how we manage personal safety and associated behavior. We now plan to roll this out across the entire company and contractor community. Changing and working to continuously improve our safety culture and that of our contractors will take time, but we have taken a major step towards that goal. Another pillar of this is our In-Vehicle Monitoring System, which provides a combination of online monitoring, structured analysis, and reporting, as well as consistent consequence management — and has led to significant falls in the number of road safety violations, such as speeding, seatbelt usage, and harsh braking. In February 2016, there were 14.76 violations per vehicle in the 8,500-plus PDO and contractor fleet. However, by August this year, this had fallen to 1.65 with improved compliance of around 89%. Our commuter bus network has been launched to discourage private vehicle use to and from our interior installations. This is also creating a big improvement in driving standards and road safety. Among a battery of environmental initiatives, PDO has officially endorsed the World Bank “Zero Routine Flaring“ initiative, demonstrating our commitment towards gas conservation and reducing our carbon footprint. We are currently inviting suppliers of gas flaring mitigation technology and solutions to show their interest in helping us to tackle this challenge. In the company's journey of cost saving and unlocking production opportunities, new technology implementation remains a key enabler. Over 60 new technologies are being matured by the new technology (UCT) team at present with a trialing success rate of over 90%, reflecting comprehensive market intelligence, rigorous pre-trial technology assessments, proper success criteria definition and close execution monitoring. There is no doubt that new technology, “Big Data“ and digitization are going to play an increasing role in shaping how we operate as the emphasis stays on growing production more efficiently. We are now engaging with number of leading IT companies on technology and software which could make a real difference to the way we operate thousands of wells and processes. It is about moving from lagging indicators to leading indicators and then to predictive indicators. We are also working with a number of Omani universities on research and development to devise solutions to our challenges and increase the exposure of their staff and students to the oil and gas industry. Technology is changing our day-to-day modes of working, and we are currently trialing a flexible working plan by allowing a selected group of staff to work from home or a hub office. This will increase productivity, improve personal work schedules and home and family commitments, while reducing commuting headaches. This year, we launched a high-profile diversity and inclusion campaign to ensure PDO is a workplace free from bias, harassment and bullying where everybody can succeed regardless of background, gender or age. And in relation to our contractor community, we are in the middle of a three —year initiative called Project Prism to establish the welfare standards for more than 30,000 personnel and ensure they are being treated in accordance with PDO policies and the Omani law. Our finance directorate is making good progress towards its vision of being world class by 2020. A recent benchmarking review by global business consultants The Hackett Group has recorded significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency since the last assessment two years ago. The review found that finance has maintained top quartile efficiency, with improved speed of execution, with a 34% improvement in cycle times since 2014; and contracting and procurement has made big strides to world-class status, despite a heavier workload, in areas such as sourcing cycle time and cost avoidance. There is still much to do, but there is no doubt that the wave of initiatives launched by the directorate is underpinning our drive to do more with less. In this respect, I also cannot overstate the importance of Lean (mentioned earlier) which is transforming the way we work by empowering staff to challenge the status quo and seek simpler, faster, more productive and less expensive ways of doing things. Beyond PDO, we are working closely with the Government's Tanfeedh program on enhancing economic diversification in Oman in a number of key areas: manufacturing, transport and logistics, labor, and tourism. We are energetically pursuing our National Objectives program to provide thousands of employment, training and redeployment opportunities for Omani jobseekers in the oil and gas sector and have also signed a number of commitments with non-oil sector players to fund vocational training for Omanis such as aviation, retail, real estate, digital media and fashion as part of our effort to create 50,000 such opportunities over the next three years.</p><h4>What are PDO's main objectives for 2018?</h4><p>To stay the course on delivering our key projects while adding value and controlling costs across the full spectrum of our business, from exploration to abandonment. In a nutshell, this means delivering on promise and meeting our stakeholders' demands and expectations more safely, more efficiently and more responsibly. We will continue our drive for the early monetization and hook-up of low unit technical cost prospects while maintaining our overarching focus on personal and process safety as we strive for “Goal Zero:“ no harm to our people, our environment and our assets. At the same time, to guarantee our future sustainability and that of the nation, we must ensure reserves and contingent resource replacement ratios are above one. The roll-out of sustainable and diversified in-country value programs and initiatives will continue to ensure Omani employment and skills levels are raised, both in the oil and sector and beyond our natural boundaries, and ramp up our support for Omani entrepreneurs to boost the Sultanate's SME sector and help spur the greater diversification of the national economy. Within PDO, we will continue to focus on the development of Omani leaders and staff. Continuous improvement and innovation, through Lean, simplification and standardization will help us meet our targets to maximize net cash to shareholders with agreed spend ceilings. You will also see us continuing to embrace new technological solutions to tackle our challenges and PDO will increasingly leverage its expertise and human capital across our sector and further afield as we forge new partnerships with national and international operators to monetize our know-how and best practice.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[parliamentary-perfection]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Sharjah Consultative Council's processes be an example for the other emirates?</h4><p>This is the first Consultative Council in the UAE, and was established in 1999. It was the wish of HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan Bin Muhammed Al Qasimi to have a legislative backup to the government for the monitoring of the processes of government entities. I have been a member of the Consultative Council since 2001, and at the time it was welcomed as an initiative from His Highness that brought women a greater role in this parliament. The women participating at the Consultative Council at that time were the first women to be involved in government not only in the UAE, but also in the whole GCC, and five of them were representing the city of Sharjah. The Consultative Council has a total of 44 members, of which 22 were elected and 22 were appointed by His Highness. The Consultative Council is different from other parliaments in the world because it has an elected party and an appointed party. Now there are seven women on the Consultative Council. I am the first woman to chair this organization and for me it is fundamental to work as a team and to have qualified people working together to serve the Emirate. This is the message that His Highness wants to send through the Consultative Council to the people; that this is a democracy. We are all working together to serve the Emirate.</p><h4>The council recently received an ISO; what is the significance of this achievement?</h4><p>This is the first time that a parliament has won an ISO, which demonstrates that this is an organization that has excellence in its people and wants to be as efficient and transparent as any corporation. This ISO is important because it shows that we follow processes and work systematically, without which the parliament would not be able to deliver its message and vision. Another reason why having an ISO is important is because all the procedures are documented. This is key to be able to leave a documented legacy for the ones that come after us. I am leading the team now, but once I leave, they will be able to show and guide the next chairman on how to lead the parliament. </p><h4>How can the Consultative Council ensure that foreign investment in the Emirate translates into maximum benefits for the people of Sharjah?</h4><p>When you want to invest in a place, you look for security. When you have security and a ruler who has a system in which he listens to everyone in the country you will be able to attract FDI. Having the Consultative Council assures people coming from outside that there is justice, that there is security and that there is equality. We represent His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah, who is a very educated individual and a person with a vision. Having such a person at the helm emphasizes the sustainability of the system. Whenever we have a dialogue with government entities, we make sure that His Highness's vision is communicated. We practice our role, as legislators and as supervisors, and we ask questions to make sure that all the government institutions follow the instructions and pursue the right investment. Besides following up on the performance and level of service provided to the public, our role as a parliament is to focus on the budget in terms of how much is spent, where it is spent, and what is the ROI. We are always open to suggestions and ideas from the public, we filter them, and we send them to His Highness. If he finds them important, he sends it back to the government to be implemented. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the core objectives, functions, and goals of the Department of Government Relations?</h4><p>The Department of Government Relations in Sharjah was established to provide a window of cooperation to Sharjah's international partners. As the center of culture, education, and innovation in the UAE, the Emirate's international reach spans the globe. The department supports this outreach through representing Sharjah abroad, welcoming international delegations, and partnering with strategic cities that share Sharjah's core values: culture, education, and innovation. These efforts are closely coordinated with the UAE federal government.</p><h4>The Department of Government Relations recently received a high-level delegation from the UK. What opportunities for synergy were discussed?</h4><p>The UK has been a long-standing partner of the UAE and cooperation between Sharjah and the UK is focused on the key initiatives of Sharjah's strategy. The International Government Communication Forum, held annually in the Emirate, recently announced the establishment of an International Centre for Government Communication, and we look forward to working closely with the UK Government Communication Office to share best practices in the field of communication. American University of Sharjah Enterprises' Research Technology and Innovation Park recently announced an MoU with Oxford Sciences Innovation to coordinate the development of innovation ecosystems.</p><h4>What role does improving government communication have in helping your department, and Sharjah as a whole, achieve its goals?</h4><p>The International Government Communication Forum (IGCF) 2017 highlighted the importance of government communication in achieving sustainable development. The Department of Government Relations became a strategic partner at the event to ensure that our international partners can engage with and learn from Sharjah's expertise. Former US Vice President Al Gore was a keynote speaker and highlighted Sharjah's role in coordination between the public, private, and academic sectors to support sustainable development. He also commended HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammed Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, on his pioneering efforts to protect the environment of Sharjah. The role of the Department of Government Relations is to ensure that our international partners can engage with and learn from Sharjah's best practice.</p><h4>Construction on several megaprojects such as the Publishing City, Healthcare City, and Saja'a Oasis is underway. How do these megaprojects complement your goal of increasing Sharjah's visibility on the international stage?</h4><p>Sharjah's sector-specific projects are key components to HH Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammed Al Qasimi's vision for Sharjah. They support our triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental returns that are core to our future and provide exciting opportunities for cooperation and investment with our international partners. Our international visibility is further supported by our unique role as the center of culture, education, and innovation in the region.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for Sharjah in the next few years?</h4><p>Sharjah's international outreach will continue to be based on the values that we share with our international partners. There are exciting projects to share culture, exchange students, and academics, and promote business opportunities with strategic cities that we partner with. The Department of Government Relations looks to work with other cities that share our common values of culture, education, and innovation. These “strategic cities" exist as cultural and education centers of the world: Oxford and Cambridge (UK), Cambridge (US), St Petersburg (Russia), and Marseille (France)—the list touches every corner of the globe. These cities host Sharjah for a week—if not longer in certain cases—and we will share our culture, art, and opportunities. Reciprocal events are also held in Sharjah, where we host our international partners to show the people of Sharjah their culture, arts, and opportunities. All success stories are based on strong cultural understanding and we look forward to supporting this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[model-learning-models]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you adapted distance learning to meet your requirements?</h4><p>The model of teaching in universities all over the world is based on two types: face to face and distance. Now, they are coming together in a new model called blended learning. This is the future of learning. We expect that, by 2025, at least 50% of all universities in the world will be implementing or using blended learning. This allows students to come to the university a maximum of once a week or once every two weeks. The students of four or five years ago who came to SEU have started to enjoy learning this way. About five years ago, 2.6% of the students took advantage of the blended learning implementation we offered. This year 53% of our new students are fresh from high school and want to come to SEU because we have flexibility and new models of teaching.</p><h4>When you look at specific courses like English, how do you address specific skill sets?</h4><p>We are working with other platforms like English Town. It is a virtual school software suite through which students study in one place. Through this technology, we have professors from Australia, the UK, and the US teach our students. We also have a degree for English that students must pass, and they continue to study until they pass.</p><h4>What increase in enrollment are you looking at?</h4><p>We have seen increased enrollment. Our budget from the Ministry of Education this year is better than last year. It is trying to dedicate the budget for educational use such as developing new skills and programs to better prepare students for the job market. The Ministry used to put more focus and money toward conferences, furniture, and cars. Now, most of the budget is focused on the education sector rather than luxury. We are on the right path for the vision.</p><h4>Have you seen an increase in the number of students in 2016-2017 as well?</h4><p>Yes, we see around 26% growth in new students every year. The new generation likes these flexible, tailored models of learning more than the older ones. I was the dean of the College of Computer Science in 2004 at Iman University. In 10 years, computers and mobile devices came together as one. Now, the same fusion of face-to-face and distance learning is occurring; by 2025 they will completely combine. There will be no entirely face-to-face education at all. This new model saves money and time, and now we have a professor from Texas who offers his course live through a video classroom. We have lecturers from Tunisia, Jordan, and more. They can give lectures from home for our students here.</p><h4>For the rest of 2017, what are the overall goals and achievements you wish to make?</h4><p>We have an increasing number of students and better key performance indicators. We will start to see the benefits in no more than three to four years. Additionally, this model will help the country to reach its Vision 2030 goals, which all depend on a well-educated youth. This generation is well served by the model that we are implementing, and we have seen excellent results. There are not many other ways to get the same results at the same cost, and to quickly and efficiently educate so many people simultaneously. We try to teach and train students to use our model, and now we have some universities looking to try and implement our model. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the PMU's main academic strengths?</h4><p>At the very start, the founder of PMU, HRH Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Bin Abdulaziz, decided that the new institution should represent a remarkable addition to existing higher education institutions in the Kingdom. Therefore, the design of the PMU system and academic programs followed the most developed and effective methodologies, which resulted in a university encompassing the most effective learning environment. An outstanding academic strength of PMU is the adoption of the Core Curriculum, which is designed and included in the curricula of all colleges. The Core Curriculum is designed to enable the students to acquire the competencies they need to be successful in their chosen fields and to contribute to the development of their community and the Kingdom. These competencies are: communication, technological competence, critical thinking and problem solving, professional competence, teamwork, and leadership. PMU provides a learning—not teaching—environment that is student centered and aims to develop the student as a whole person. A learning outcomes assessment process is continually applied so as to ensure that all objectives are successfully accomplished and required improvements are constantly introduced. By adopting a student-centered approach, we aim at enhancing students' abilities to develop as life long-learners and pursue improvement during their studies and long after they have graduated.</p><h4>What do you think about some of the changes that will arise for the Eastern Province?</h4><p>The Eastern Province is the most important industrial and business region in the Kingdom. It embraces the Oil industry and the main and longest oil reserves in the world. There are also the basic industries of the Kingdom represented by the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) and a lot of other industries such as food industries and manufacturing industries. As such, the Eastern Province is poised to develop more and more and will continue attracting more and more people to work and live in it. Therefore, there will definitely be constant progress and development in main and support sectors. This will be reflected in increased business, urbanization and a proliferation of recreational and service institutions. In addition, there will be an increase in educational institutions including colleges and universities.</p><h4>What do you gain from your international partnerships and will you be looking more toward increasing the number of foreign students?</h4><p>We have international partnerships in many parts of the world. We gain an international outlook to diversity and successful practices witnessed in different higher education institutions around the world. Currently, we are establishing three Arabic language programs, namely in Turkey, Kazakhstan, and China. We have developed international collaboration programs with a number of renowned universities, such as the University Of Central Florida (UCF), which houses the Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Program for Strategic Research and Studies. We have also developed collaboration with the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), which houses the King Abdulaziz Endowed Chair for Islamic Studies, and we have established the King Fahd program for Dispute Resolution at Pepperdine. Regarding student diversity, the Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Scholarship Program, which is implemented it in collaboration with the Arab League, has hosted more than 40 students from the Arab world on full scholarships and the same program is now being established with Turkey and Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are your expectations and key strategic objectives for 2018?</h4><p>In 2018 we will continue pursuing our roadmap and that includes the establishment of a School of Architecture, the Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz College for the Visually Impaired, the Medical School, and the Teaching Hospital. By this we hope to continue serving education in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia and preparing global graduates that will assume leading roles locally and internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does IHG play in the market?</h4><p>IHG operates the largest number of guest rooms in Saudi Arabia. We have over 744,000 guest rooms globally, serving over 150 million guests each year. Our family of 12 trusted brands includes several brands in the Saudi market: the business traveller trusted Crowne Plaza®, the friendly comfort of the city center Holiday Inn® hotel, the luxury of an award-winning InterContinental® resort, and residential-style Staybridge Suites. For decades IHG has led the lodging market, providing exceptional accommodation and dining experience and going beyond the hospitality experience with the IHG Rewards and IHG Business Rewards programs, the largest loyalty program in the world, to ensure our guests' complete satisfaction. Moreover, with community projects like the IHG Foundation, which aims to develop foundations of stronger, healthier, more prosperous communities through supporting community projects across the globe, we are doing our part to make local communities better for all.</p><h4>How has the group expanded its footprint in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Over the long term, the hospitality industry has grown broadly, affected by the global and local markets, driven by economic growth and an increasing trend for domestic and global travel. Saudi Arabia is witnessing increased demand in the lodging sector; as a result, we plan to launch new properties to meet this demand with the Staybridge Suites brand at the Al Andalus District, in addition to other projects to be announced soon.</p><h4>Jeddah is a stop for all pilgrims to Umrah and Hajj. How do you appeal to pilgrims?</h4><p>Jeddah is the global gateway for Makkah and Medina, where millions of Muslims head to every year to perform the Umrah and Hajj, and our role here is to take good care of them by providing the best amenities, comfortable rooms, good food, and our famous seamless service to allow them to recharge and complete their rituals or relax both before and after.</p><h4>The Gulf has high demand for great service which can be difficult to meet. How do you train and equip your staff?</h4><p>GCC locals and residents have a unique taste when it comes to food and accommodation which we understand, and we seek to exceed their expectations and amaze them each time they visit our properties. We truly believe our people are the ones that have brought us to where we are today and our people will help us grow even more. Our dedicated team learn efficient practices and workshops by the IHG institution and other training entities to maintain the excellent service provided at every level and department, and that is why we receive global awards for guest satisfaction from TripAdvisor, Booking.com, and Hospitality Check as well as recognition certificates by Cristal International Standards for implementing and maintaining the highest standards of health and safety. The most precious and heartwarming rewards are the thank you notes that we receive directly from our satisfied guests before they leave.</p><h4>Saudization is a key goal for the hospitality industry. How do you train Saudis to meet the needs of your customers?</h4><p>Many young Saudis are talented, highly motivated, and well educated. Our role is to offer them strong internship programs like the I-Host program for high school talents and Future Leader, a specialized program for university graduates. Via these programs we gave them the opportunity to train in the career they aspire to, with the supervision of senior managers, giving them the required experience to lead IHG properties equipped with the best knowledge.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017 under the Vision 2030?</h4><p>Change is the law of life and the global economy is variable. Changing the way things work has become essential to be familiar with the business cycle and to win at all times. 2017 will be a transition period and people need to adapt in order to meet Saudi Arabia's comprehensive and ambitious vision for 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What initiatives have been undertaken by the Ministry of Education to encourage PPPs and promote other investments in the education sector?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education aims to achieve eight strategic goals within its plan in the National Transformation Program 2020 through the implementation of 36 qualitative initiatives worth more than SAR28 billion. As a result, public and private education will jump towards the forefront in the next three years. The strategic objectives of the Ministry of Education are to provide educational opportunities for all segments of the society, to expand kindergarten and nursery programs, adult education, and special education because of its importance in completing the education system for all segments of the society. Following this, the ministry moves towards the teachers by improving the opportunities to attract them and develop their skills and abilities. In addition, a learning environment that stimulates creativity and innovation will be created, including the support of universities by providing opportunities for students and faculty members to present their thoughts and innovations, patenting their inventions, and nurturing the gifted and the talented amongst them.</p><h4>How can the ministry contribute to achieving the goals of Vision 2030?</h4><p>The Ministry of Education contributes greatly to providing an environment capable of enhancing students' personal skills and their abilities to adapt to the labor market and its requirements. A basic group of skills and competencies will be created and included in school activities and curricula, and at the same time we will improve teaching methods and evaluation of students and thus achieve the compatibility between education programs and labor market needs. We see to restructure the education sector, formulating a modern system of regulations, instructions, and executive rules governing the development of curricula and the enrollment of teachers in educational institutions, organizing the process of educational supervision, increasing the effectiveness of development and vocational training on an ongoing basis, raising the efficiency of the operational performance, reducing the cost of waste, and making maximum use of human potential, resources, equipment, and buildings.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Education support the use of technology and digitization of education?</h4><p>We have signed an agreement with a specialized company in the field of technology worth of SAR1.6 billion to produce special devices for Saudi schools at competitive prices and specifications that correspond to the nature of the Saudi education system until 2020. The new educational system will be launched in 150 Saudi schools in mid of 2018 and the number of e-learning schools will be increasing to 1,500 at the end of that year. In 1996, Saudi Arabia launched the Comprehensive Curriculum Development Project to develop the educational process in all its dimensions and elements, reviewing and evaluating the curriculum and the extent of its relevance to the educational development in the world. We have been able to achieve three dimensions of the main shift to the digital world by creating an electronic platform containing the digital integrated content of all curricula, as well as reducing the use of paper books, providing computers for students as an educational tool, and training and qualifying teachers to use modern technical methods.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future of the education sector in Saudi Arabia in 2017?</h4><p>We are working to achieve an ambitious national strategy and plan whose features are evident with the formation of the task teams in all governmental institutions to activate the initiatives of each authority according to a specific time plan. The future of education is directed to achieve the most important aspects of the educational side stipulated in Vision 2030, including involving 80% of families in school activities by 2020, providing training programs for teachers, and raise awareness of the importance of their participation, and cooperating with the private sector and the non-profit sector in providing more innovative programs and events to enhance and promote the educational partnership, among other goals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given your family's long history in education, how is the current period different, and how has your business grown?</h4><p>UBT Company is focused on investments, consultation, and operations for higher education, professional training, and knowledge transfer beyond high school. The company holds all of its endeavors as an investment firm, including the eponymous university. We focus on undergraduate, graduate, and executive education. I come from a family that has chosen education as a career for over hundreds of years. My brothers, sister, father, uncle, grandfather, and his brothers are all educators, and my ancestors have pursued this profession for many generations. However, today we are operating with the first for-profit business model that the family has ever used. We believe in sustainability, and a business model must underpin any sustainable operation.</p><h4>Aside from UBT, what are your key investments today?</h4><p>Today, there is a greater mix of higher education, training, and vocational education. In line with that, we have invested in new sectors through our new brand called UBT Academy, encompassing English Institutes and the Higher Training Institute. The latter will provide knowledge and skills required to enter a job directly, without any extra information. They will be completely job focused. In May, we will announce these new schools after getting curriculums developed and approved by the Ministry of Education and the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC), respectively. We will operate the English Institutes on a franchise basis throughout the GCC. We are keen to find investors who would like to promote quality English language education.</p><h4>Vision 2030 has a clear vocational and training component, as well as a clear intention to increase private participation in the sector. Are these investments a reaction to those plans?</h4><p>They want to see proportionally fewer students in universities because current universities simply do not meet the needs of the market. Today, the country needs to quickly and efficiently equip large numbers of young people to do specific jobs. Right now, vocational and training schools are seen as the most effective way to provide careers for the Saudi youth. That is why we are investing in the vocational business and training and leveraging our existing resources in line with Vision 2030's goals. We find more than 85,000 teachers in the region qualified to receive teacher training and self-development, and we want to produce the best teachers.</p><h4>Is it a challenge to meet the demands and requirements of the private sector, and how do you deduct which skills are in demand?<br></h4><p>We review the course content of our programs every year to ensure each is in line with international programs and processes. For example, we have recently been approved to deliver 26 new minor programs for the engineering college that cater to tomorrow's engineering and technology needs, not only today's. Also, we are the only university in the Middle East that has an advertising school, and yet advertising is a USD24 billion market in which 94% of it is an outflow of cash because the advertisers and agencies are not Saudi. We want to change that, and our innovation in this area speaks to our awareness of the market's needs. Our first batch of around 60 students just graduated, and they are all either employed or self-employed. That is the highest employment rate for a graduating class we have reached in 16 years. The Jeddah College of Advertising was created in partnership with Bucks New University in the UK. We learned for six months in the UK, going from one agency to another, and then we applied our findings here. For each of our programs, we tailor our operations to address market and employment needs, and, in September 2017, we will have a set of newly reviewed programs that ensure our graduates become better equipped for the market than they have ever been. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the idea behind the CoE, and how was it established?</h4><p>The Technical and Vocational Training Corporation (TVTC) established CoE, a limited liability company, in 2013, for the purpose of expanding and improving the quality of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in Saudi Arabia. CoE operates through three distinct models: International Technical Colleges (ITCs), Strategic Partnerships (SPs), and the Capability Building Contract (CBC) program. Recently, a fourth model was introduced, namely customized training for employment. ITCs are operated by international training providers, ensuring high quality of technical and vocational training and preparing Saudi Arabia's youth for the labor market. CoE currently oversees the operation of 31 ITCs, including 14 male colleges and 17 female colleges. SPs are highly specialized training institutes established in partnership with both the Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) and the private sector. All SP trainees are enrolled in training programs by signing an employment contract with a specific employer. Thus, trainees are employed from day one of their training and are guaranteed employment upon successful graduation. HRDF supports employers by funding a portion of the cost. Currently, there are 24 institutes in different sectors and locations across the Kingdom. The CBC program aims to transform current traditional TVTC training units by contracting international training providers to work alongside the existing units and enhance their performance.</p><h4>How does the CoE differentiate itself in the TVET system in the Kingdom?</h4><p>What differentiates our programs can be directly attributed to the way we conduct our business. We maintain high quality standards throughout all stages of the training process. This includes training methods and curricula, administration policies, and third party quality assurance, such as Saudi Skills Standards (SSS), in addition to other internationally renowned quality assurance and accreditation bodies. Another criterion that differentiates CoE from others is its updated five-year strategy (2016-2020). This strategy has been pioneered by renowned international consultant agencies. The five-year strategy ensures alignment with the vision of 2030 and the NTP of 2020. Additionally, a new branding identity has also been launched simultaneously with the new strategy. The third point is our flexibility in catering to the demand of the national labor market. CoE offers numerous specializations through ITCs, SPs, and customizable training for employment. Durations of training programs can be long or short depending on an employer's labor demand. Also, training units are very well distributed over the Kingdom. In conclusion, international standards and benchmarks, flexibility in specializations and durations, quality assurance, logistics, and strategic alignment with national interests and objectives are the primary components of CoE's uniqueness and value proposition.</p><h4>Where did the idea come from to set up the aviation college and who are your partners in this college?</h4><p>Over a decade ago, TVTC started planning to provide the aviation sector with highly skilled technicians. TVTC worked closely and diligently with Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus, and Saudi Airlines to determine what different types of skills the sector is looking for and determine the number of technicians needed. With relentless efforts and strong determination, CoE, with the support of its primary stakeholder, TVTC, established a state-of-the-art technical college in the area of King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh to provide the Kingdom's aviation sector with highly skilled national technicians in 2013. The development of the curriculum and the entire setup was done in collaboration with several parties. Subsequently, through a robust tendering process, CoE attracted the best international training providers in the field. Australian Aviation College was awarded the contract to operate and maintain the International Aviation Technical College at Riyadh. Many employers have developed partnerships with the college by sponsoring trainees to secure qualified national technicians. The Saudi Royal Air force is the college's largest sponsor. Also other branches of the Ministry of Defense have shown interest in sponsoring trainees. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vision 2030 has vocational training as one of its key goals. How does TVTC promote that through partnerships with the private sector?</h4><p>We are expanding our technical education and skills development in Saudi Arabia at a rapid pace. We have created a company called Colleges of Excellence, and through this company we operate newly established colleges through international training providers. All of our international partners operate the college, prepare the students for the labor market, and help them to become employed. We pay the operators based on performance, which is advantageous for both parties. We pay per student, but we also maintain an additional payment for graduation rates and students' employment. That means the operators must study what the labor market needs. We currently have 33 colleges operating in partnership with operators from the UK, Canada, the US, Australia, and New Zealand. From the US we have Laureate, which operates many colleges in different cities. We are still expanding in this operation model.</p><h4>Do you partner with specific firms or industries in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have started strategic partnerships institutes whereby we work closely with local or international companies, which work in Saudi Arabia, to prepare customized training for them. One example is Almarai, a very big company here. We have a strategic partnership institute with them whereby the company interviews students—their future employees—and signs a contract with them. Then we start training based on the company's needs, and the company receives trained staff at the end. This means there will be no waste, as all training of this type starts and ends with employment. This is a win for the students, a win for the company, a win for us, and a win for the broader economy. We currently have 24 colleges such as this one with companies like SABIC and Aramco. With the Saudi Arabian Railway (SAR), we have a college called SRB, and, in this institute, all students are already employed by SAR. Under Saudi Vision 2030 and the current National Transformation Program, we will increase the number of strategic partnership institutes to 35.</p><h4>What are your key goals for 2017?</h4><p>We need to expand and attract students. We need to compete to provide high-quality training so that aviation, railway, and other industries are attracted. Last year, we had a more than 30% increase in the number of students we serve, but we are not satisfied with this and want to have more. We are looking for any other opportunities to expand, although this must always be demand driven. One avenue we are pursuing is the fact that Saudi Arabia is now attracting some industrial companies within the auto sector. We developed specialized automotive institutes. We are similarly ready in many other fields, such as maritime, for example. In addition to expansion, we are also seeking quality and international accreditation, which is very important for our colleges, and we continuously need to retrain our educators, as technology is changing very fast. Mobile technology, for example, is changing fast and we have worked hard to keep pace. Our collaboration with Huawei and Samsung is evidence that we are collaborating with the key players. We will always look to collaborate with other entities, both in the public and private sectors. More than 50% of TVTC's Board of Directors is from the private sector. Although we are public sector, we operate as a business, as this is the only way we can ensure that we exceed the minimum requirements of the labor market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How much of your growth strategy is aligned with Vision 2030?</h4><p>We are trying to advance the cooperation between the private sector and the public sector in terms of providing healthcare, and this is a key part of Vision 2030. We support the Ministry of Health's goals, which call for the government to become more actively involved in regulation and oversight rather than ownership and operations of healthcare facilities. I see great opportunity to bridge gap in providing care, including shortages in beds and manpower to operate medical facilities in Medina by implementing this vision; however, the mechanism is still in need of adjustment and development. Through our monthly meetings with the government, we ensure that our strategies and operations are highly coordinated. It will take time to implement all these ambitions, but the most important issue is the development of a clear plan of action. The government has introduced nine initiatives and areas of operation for privatization, but there are still issues that need to be ironed out. The government needs to figure out how it wants the private sector to begin carrying out its initiatives. We need a clear vision for how we are to proceed. The government still needs enact legislation that makes the tender processes clear. For instance, we are currently preparing a plan for operating the new Madinah General Hospital (500 beds) with our Canadian and Malaysian partners; however, unclear and bureaucratic procedures are hindering progress. The government wants to privatize, but it still needs to develop a framework for how to do it.</p><h4>To what extent are you targeting Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, and other international visitors?</h4><p>We are interested in offering our services to pilgrims coming into Medina performing Hajj and Umrah. We tend to make contracts with Hajj and Umrah companies, which allow us to integrate pilgrimage travel services with medical services. These people opt to receive medical treatment in Medina for financial and spiritual reasons. We want to focus on these types of projects to expand awareness about our healthcare system, but some legislation needs revision and simplification for us to be able to effectively implement this.</p><h4>What are your overall expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have great ambitions for 2017 emerging from our strength as a key player in reforming the healthcare sector in Saudi Arabia. As a family business, we need to recruit the right people to take this family group to the next level. In terms of collaboration with ministry, we have concerns regarding taking this collaboration to next level. These include clear privatization plans, well-defined mechanisms for hospitals operations, well-defined national healthcare model, and accelerated payment system for ministry-sponsored patients receiving care in private hospitals. Also, it is important to maintain the relationships and boundaries between care providers and insurance companies to ensure an effective financing system to avoid liquidity risks. On the international side, in 2016, we have tried to develop partnerships with firms abroad. We need to attract global partners in healthcare to work with us in Saudi Arabia. We had meetings in Malaysia and North America to form collaborations with institutions in these countries regarding potential partnerships in hospitals management and operation. We went to Accreditation Canada International to receive international accreditation. We also have promising collaborations in progress with institutions in Turkey. We want to develop a consortium that includes international hospitals. Looking ahead, before we expand we need to develop financing channels beyond the company. If we have a long-term vision and want to maintain our share, we have to be willing to trade equity for new investors or partners. We can expand our vision and our operations if we are willing to look to new sources for investment and partnerships that could reflect on a better quality of life in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does KSMC fit into not only the sector, but particularly the National Transformation Plan (NTP) and changes to the sector?</h4><p>The NTP 2020 was launched across 24 government bodies operating in the economic and development sectors. This aims to build the institutional capabilities needed to achieve Vision 2030; the Ministry of Health is one of the key government bodies that underwent a restructuring process to align to the requirements of the program and to enable to perform its tasks and expand its competencies. In 2016, KSMC was tapped to share its expertise and experience in the design of the health transformation program. The transition was initiated with the assessment of the situation on the ground and formulated a gap analysis to convert into Accountable Care Organization (ACO). Leading the patient pathway through the new “Model of Care“ methodology will lead to increased efficiency and ultimately decrease the waste in time, efforts and costs. In June 2017, the Minister Council approved the NTP to form five health-providing companies, and KSMC will be the core for implementation. This actually means a broader spectrum of responsibility for KSMC in terms of providing excellence in health care to a larger population. The new initiative changes the model of care and patient flow. The change in governance, organizational structure, and financial model is created to fit the new Vision 2030. All these things start to impact on our manpower plan and structure design.</p><h4>How do the plans to reform the healthcare system affect your plans and operations? </h4><p>Previously, we were responsible for the patients who arrived at our Emergency or Outpatient Departments. Now with the new model of care, populations are divided into clusters and each medical city is then responsible for a specific sector comprising of primary health centers and secondary hospitals. KSMC takes the lead for Cluster 1 that is responsible for 10 primary health centers and four hospitals (King Salman bin Abdelaziz Hospital, Al Iman General Hospital, Imam Abdul Rahman Al Faisal Hospital, and Al Naqaha Hospital). Cluster 1 covers the west and south sector of Riyadh, or rather approximately 3 million people. It provides patients faster access to care between primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care, which makes our operations more efficient in terms of utilization of our capital and manpower resources. This also an effective model for enhancing access to care and providing greater proximity for patients. In addition, there are many projects that include the NTP budget to upgrade the existing system to meet patients' expectations. Before, we were talking about the patient; now we are talking about the population.</p><h4>KSMC is one of the key trauma centers in the country, and specializes in trauma. How does your acquisition of the new hospitals affect that specialty?</h4><p>Trauma care is one of the core competencies of KSMC. We are moving fast towards being the Level 1 trauma center. This year we signed an agreement with The Alfred Hospital, Australia under the patronage of the Minister of Health. The agreement covers redesigning of the trauma system starting from pre-hospital care to post-discharge long-term care. A large part of the agreement relates to training and research, and redesigning of the trauma services to cover all health facilities in Cluster 1, which means concentrate more specialized specialties in KSMC like spinal, neurosurgery, and more training in refining the service of trauma in other facilities creating safe environment to deal with trauma patients and rapid access of highly specialized centers. As a Level 1 Trauma Center, this will increase the coverage outside Riyadh, and the medical city will continue to play its role as the national center for trauma. Likewise, we will continue to complement and support preventive measures and initiatives initiated by the Ministry of Health like traffic safety initiatives, which is a part of the NTP2. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Has there been a change in opinions in Saudi Arabia that the country possesses all the assets it needs and now is the time for utilization?</h4><p>In Saudi Arabia, we have scores of resources. What we are trying to do now is to utilize these resources in the most efficient, economic, and beneficial way. This is key. We can no longer go ahead without planning and thinking strategically about every step of the way. The 2030 Vision has opened a broad horizon and reshaped how we do business. I am convinced that those who cannot cope with this new era should step aside. People are in fact resigning if they are unable do what is required. There has been a change in the way of thinking, be it in ministries, government agencies, or the private sector. We are also optimistic; regardless of the situation today, we are on the right path.</p><h4>How is the unified policy you debuted last year progressing?</h4><p>We implemented the unified policy in phases and are now finalizing the fourth phase. The unified policy has been beneficial for the market and has solved most issues with fake insurance policies. We developed electronic solutions and made agreements with the Ministry of Interior to create a data center containing all the information of each insured person to verify that the information is 100% valid. We have also resolved the issue of Saudis working in the private sector by ensuring that they are all included in the mandated health insurance scheme, which will also be done electronically. In 2017, we expect around 1.5-2 million Saudis to be enrolled in health insurance schemes. We also regulated a minimum list of health providers in each city. This year we will also launch our largest product, the Saudi Health Insurance Policy (SHIB). Our goal on this is billing with quality, not just a billing with service. We are working to create a common platform that can be utilized by different agencies and organizations to unify all the quality standards, the platform standards, the electronic data centers, and the rest. This will help CCHI, as well as the other stakeholders and the insurers as well. </p><h4>Will the private sector play a bigger role in health insurance?</h4><p>Certainly. We cover almost 38% of the population under CCHI, Saudis and non-Saudis, all through private employment. With our cooperation, before 2020 there will be changes and growth in the private sector. The majority of public hospitals will become corporatized. The demand is there and there is a great deal to do for all sides: health insurance companies, the public, and the private sector. Our goal with CCHI is to no longer achieve anything without KPIs. KPIs are now a keystone in all parts of the health sector. We are creating KPIs for each employee, each section, and each department, for the CCHI, for the government, and for companies. We also plan to publish an evaluation that unites both us and the customer. This will ensure we are at the top of our game.</p><h4>How have the stringent goals of the NTP influenced your operations?</h4><p>We are planning for a 100% digital transformation for the CCHI and the sector as a whole. We will cover the provider side. We seek strong health insurance companies with strong regulations and are also making it about health, not just medical. We need to have a healthy population, not just adequate hospitals to treat the ill. We are also monitoring our transparency in terms of governance. By 2018/19, we will have a fund for those who exceed the maximum allowance. Our policy covers up to SAR500,000, and the fund will pay for those who exceed that. We are also proposing to amend and update our bylaws by 2018—we may even change the law itself. We have collected feedback from companies and are already drafting a proposal and will bring it to the Royal Cabinet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vision 2030 is a massive project, with sweeping goals for the health sector. What has been accomplished toward achieving these goals since they were announced?</h4><p>Our health sector has not had a substantial or significant reform since the Ministry of Health's inception. We have traditionally supported building more hospitals, more primary care centers, and more care delivery. Clearly, we now need to shift the focus to the prevention of disease. The concept is a far-reaching transformation that engages almost every component of how we provide care, from how we finance it to how we actually deliver care on the patient side. One of the themes of our transformation is collaboration with the private sector. We have identified more than 40 PPP opportunities. We have looked at imaging, laboratory facilities, and the pharmacy segment as well as at some of the services we have seen a large shortage in: rehabilitation, long-term services, and home care. We have also looked at issues like the large number of hospitals that are being completed, but have problems commissioning and operating. We look to the private sector to help us with that. Two hospitals have been released to financial, legal, and business consultants who will develop the complete package.</p><h4>Do you intend to take the road of corporatizing assets on the way to privatization, for example as done by the General Authority of Civil Aviation?</h4><p>Currently, the MOH has a conflict of interest. It provides care through a network of more than 365 hospitals and 2,500 primary care centers but is, at the same time, the governor and regulator. We have plans in 2018 to separate this process so that the MOH will no longer provide care. The provision of care will be given to multiple corporates that will then compete on the basis of quality of services and patient care, experience, and safety. We have started what we call the “pathfinder" engagement, in which the Health Minister initiated the road to corporatization. We hope that by 2030 we will have corporatized them and granted them autonomy. Doing so would reduce the level of decision-making to as close to the patient as possible and allow them to develop competitiveness. We hope that by 2030 it will be left to the decision makers to decide on whether to privatize that asset or keep it as a government-owned asset. It would be completely corporatized by then, but still a government entity.</p><h4>How will this change transform care?</h4><p>We will integrate the different silos that currently exist in the system. Now, a patient goes through the system in a horizontal manner; we always have the problem of patients going to a primary care facility and being unable to get a referral to go to hospital. Instead, they skip the first step and go to a hospital directly, and that creates a huge burden on hospitals and does not utilize our primary care appropriately. Through a series of workshops over a period of five months, healthcare workers have designed six main pathways for our patient population. One of them is the chronic disease pathway. There is also emergency care, maternal and childcare, elective care, mental care, and end-of-life care. Corporates will be asked to roll out this model of care in different locations. This is the concept of the integrated new model of care that we want to use. Technology will also transform care. A private firm will provide a complete solution, including the health permission systems, hardware, software, data center, cloud, and infrastructure, to our ailing primary care network that has no connectivity. There are 2,300 primary care centers today, and most of them lack internet access. Our goal is the accessibility of 70% of the population to e-medicine by providing the internet access to the primary care centers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of TD and how has the company evolved over the years?</h4><p>Engineering has been my passion from an early age and it was the driving force for me to major in mechanical engineering. After my graduation from college I had the opportunity to work for major and reputable Saudi construction and maintenance companies, and during my employment I realized that there is an over whelming demand for energy due to the country expanding and accelerated increase in population; therefore, I was certain that electro-mechanical works was a profitable future business and I should plan for my future company accordingly. After thorough market research Technical Development was born in the spring of 2002 with a vision to specialize in electro-mechanical works with a leading role in the market; our mission, goals, and objectives were centered on our vision. The Saudi market is such a vast and complicated market; therefore; it was essential for our expertise to be comprehensively aligned with business demand and for us to be able to deal with our projects form the ground up. This gave us the opportunity to work with more experienced local and international partners on major government projects—the insulation of diesel generators and gas turbines for building, subways, and airports. This went on until the end of the 2015 fiscal year. 2015 was the pivotal year for the company, and with audacity the company established a reputation for high quality and precision. This success helped the company expand and gain more business ground. In 2015, Zahran Holding requested Technical Development to join Zahran Holding group of companies and after some difficult negotiations we believed it was not a hasty decision but rather it was a decision with prowess, and it was in our best business interests to join such a mammoth group of companies for it is in line with our long-term business plan.</p><h4>Where do you see the current state of the local construction sector?</h4><p>For the past 30 years the government has been the sole supplier of electrical power for all its citizens and in charge of all related aspects of power providing from infrastructure, power generators, power grids, and connectivity to the end user. This philosophy was working when the population was 7 million; now the game has changed and the population has increased dramatically. Now it is around 30 million and expected to reach 40-45 million in the next 10 to 15 years. These statistics alone made the decision makers think seriously that this current practice cannot go on forever for it is very a expansive market with vast areas to cover and far more complicated than ever. It was decided that the government should not be totally in charge or the sole provider of electricity. In 2013 the government made the decision to invite the private sector to join in as a partner with the aim to improve services, generate income, and open new business opportunities for the private sector and employment opportunities for young Saudi engineers and technicians. This government's business-oriented policy will eventually eliminate the long and bureaucratic government project budgeting process and award decision-making. This is all important for the private sector to be able to take the initiative and align itself with the new era. I am happy to say that we are currently ready to accommodate these new opportunities.</p><h4>Regarding the government's Vision 2030, which aspect of the reforms will impact the industry and TD the most?</h4><p>The 2030 country vision laid the groundwork for government project processes that are less bureaucratic and more transparent, in addition to the privatization of some sectors and agencies. The endless opportunities for private-sector involvement in infrastructure—roads, dams, power stations, airports and sea ports, hotels and resorts, railways, medical cities, and industrial cities—along with government partnerships will ensure the country has a bright and promising future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[partnering-for-redevelopment]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current progress with the redevelopment projects you have taken on across Jeddah?</h4><p>The mandate of JDURC is the development of unplanned settlements, or slum areas, within the city. Jeddah has around 53 million sqm of unplanned settlements, which emerged many years ago when there was no city planning. One of those areas was Ar-Roweis in the middle of the city in a prime location, surrounded by developed areas and close to the waterfront. This project actually started with attracting the private sector to participate in the development, and several development organizations and companies participated. We have worked hard to move residents to another location that is acceptable and an upgrade to their quality of life. The difference is paid from the development fund, and we do not expect them to pay it back; it is to support and encourage them. It took us a while to develop the fund and convince the developers to finance that fund, but we have now reached almost the final stage where we have an approved master plan from the Minister of Municipality and Rural Affairs (MOMRA), and we have developed the detailed infrastructure design.</p><h4>What other projects are occupying JDURC these days?</h4><p>We are working in two big projects. The first one is the heart of Jeddah, which is located in the old airport and is an area of around 850,000sqm. We have been working on this project for more than two years; we did a full study and reached the stage now where we have completed the master planning and design of the infrastructure and some of the anchor buildings in the project. The project will have some buildings that are unique in Jeddah, mainly the 175,000sqm multi-modal station that will be the main metro station in Jeddah and will have two major metro lines. There will also be a conference and exhibition center, which will be the largest in Jeddah. When finished, the total developed area will be more than 246,000sqm. The exhibition area alone will be 110,000sqm, which is almost the size of Dubai exhibition center. It will have other facilities like a five-star hotel with 44 floors, a 2,000-seat auditorium, and retail spaces. This reflects the 2030 Vision where we expect the tourism sector to grow. We see that Jeddah has potential to grow in this area, as right now we do not have sufficient facilities. We have already opened the bids for contractors to build the infrastructure and are almost one with the bid evaluation. We expect to start the final negotiation with the final contractor shortly.</p><h4>Are you looking for private investors to join that project?</h4><p>JDURC is going to develop all the infrastructure, which includes underground utilities, landscaping, a beautiful lake with fountains, and water canals. Then we have special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for the conference center, commercial space, and business park, as well as opportunities to invest in hotels, a medical center, and other facilities. The remaining residential developments will be sold to the private sector. The other project we are starting is the Murooj development east of Jeddah. This is a large site that is well located on the two major highways connecting Jeddah and Mecca through our site, and it is only 20km away from the airport and 42km away from Mecca. We created an SPV with private developers, to transfer development of all the residential space, which is 22 million sqm out of the total 132 million; the value of that land is our contribution to the SPV. The private sector is paying around 30%, or SAR1.6 billion (USD426 million), and the remaining will be funded through banks and presale, including the Public Investment Fund, which is providing infrastructure finance of SAR6 billion (USD1.6 billion). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[distinct-advantage]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the recent approval by the Makkah Region Development Authority to expand the construction area of the fifth, sixth, and seventh phases of the Jabal Omar Project?</h4><p>The total construction area will increase to 1.66 million sqm, compared to its previous size of 1.17 million sqm. Jabal Omar will take advantage of this increase to introduce new development concepts across those phases in order to add architectural and financial values and achieve the company's growth strategy YoY. JODC is the largest real estate developer in Saudi Arabia. Founded in 2006 with SAR9.2 billion in capital and a current market cap of SAR60 billion, Jabal Omar is the sixth-largest company on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). Currently our flagship project is in Makkah, located at the edge of the Al Haram. Our mixed-use project consists of 40 towers with a build-up area of 2.1 million sqm, including 15 five-star hotels, over 100,000sqm in malls, and approximately 3,000 residential units. Our vision is to make Jabal Omar the main destination for pilgrims and visitors of Makkah by creating innovative concepts and introducing new spaces and uses that will positively impact the pilgrimage experience.</p><h4>How does JODC meld the demand for landmark, commercially viable real estate projects that are open to foreign investment with the sacred and traditional nature of Makkah?</h4><p>Foreign investment is a cornerstone of driving the Saudi economy to the next level. Direct international investments, considering compliance, will fuel demand in the real estate markets and enhance liquidity and contribute to the overall growth of non-oil sectors such as residential, hospitality, and retail. In addition, such foreign investment can also contribute to an array of real estate assets and portfolios across Saudi Arabia. Our shareholders include government entities, charity foundations, large institutional investors, as well as high-net-worth individuals, a base that gives JODC a distinct advantage to attract international and regional operators. This in turn allows us to consider our strategic position and prepare for the future. Nonetheless, the JODC Board of Directors and management take into consideration the sensitivity of the location and consider sharia compliance in all situations. In addition, we strive to maintain the touch of our local culture in the architecture of Jabal Omar project. We recently conducted a limited architectural design competition between four of the world's top architectural firms for our upcoming seven-star Four Seasons Hotel adjacent to the Holy Mosque. Foster + Partners won the competition with a superbly contextual design that fully respected the sanctity of Islam's most holy site. Moreover, we worked closely with the architects to achieve a design solution founded on providing guests with “luxury with humility.“</p><h4>What does the future hold for JODC?</h4><p>We completed Phase I of the project in 2Q2017 with the opening of Jabal Omar Hilton Convention, offering more than 2,700 five-star rooms, two shopping malls located on Ibrahim Alkhalil Street, and the largest convention center in Makkah. We always aim high; our strategy is to be the national, world-class urban developer. Our strategy has proven successful this year, and we registered the highest profit in our history and in record time. With expansion in mind for our business, we have our eyes on other potential areas in Makkah, Medina, and surrounding areas. In addition, Jabal Omar is working on several investment packages that will attract the most astute buyer. We will soon announce the launch of Al Bawaba-Jabal Omar, which is a hotel operated by The Address, allowing buyers to invest in what is arguably the best investment on earth, based on real estate fundamentals. We currently have two showrooms, Jeddah and Riyadh, with interactive models that allow interested parties to look at and experience the project and select and reserve their property with confidence and ease. Our Chief of Sales and Marketing Officer David Nezar Awayda welcomes early registration in this project; this will allow buyers to select their preference no matter if it is for investment or personal use. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[housing-market-renovations]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the major current opportunities and challenges in the Saudi housing market?</h4><p>The Saudi housing market is undergoing an unprecedented transformation to meet the growing demand for affordable housing. Today, the Ministry of Housing portal has 1.1 million families registered for government support in purchasing a home, and 500,000 registered on the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) portal. This transformation has met with many considerable challenges, including low productivity in the construction sector, increased building material costs, and the fact that the majority of homes supplied were supplied by single homebuilders, and only 200,000 homes out of 6 million homes were financed by the financial sector. These one-off challenges are additions to fundamental inefficiencies that have existed in the market historically, including low level of private sector contribution to supply and high reliance on government funding. The case for transformation is further amplified by the demographics of the country with over 60%, more than 5 million people, below the age of 35. This youth bulge only makes the current market status more challenging.</p><h4>Which models is the ministry pushing to engage citizens and the private sector in these emerging opportunities?</h4><p>To enact a true partnership with the private sector, the ministry took a holistic view of the housing ecosystem and its drivers when activating transformational solutions. The PPP model is unproven in Saudi Arabia with only a few success stories to tell. It was therefore imperative that the private sector be engaged and enabled across all components of the housing ecosystem. There have been important milestones in the transformational plan with a few described below. First, the ministry created a sustainable lending subsidized program through partnering with the financial institutions. This was done by relocating the lending activity from the REDF to the more efficient financial institutions. Furthermore, it subsidized the interest rates charged by the banks on its beneficiaries, and the REDF to use its USD50 billion assets to invest back into the real estate development sector, which is a major cash injection into the supply side of the sector. In addition, the ministry has worked closely with the Public Investment Fund to establish the country's first mortgage refinance company, increasing both the synergies with the REDF and increasing liquidity in the market to help create more than USD20 billion liquidity in the financial system just for 2017. Second, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA), with the Ministry of Housing, led a major economic incentive for the sector by lowering the home down payment requirement from 30 to 15%. The ministry also established its own regulated closed joint stock company to create a vehicle to partner with developers and other stakeholders and move faster and leaner in creating JVs, SPVs, funds, and other investments. In addition, the ministry decided to gather accurate data on the market, beneficiaries, and overall economic activity in the sector, and is establishing the National Housing Data Centre, where it will be able to share accurate data with developers on demand and help developers produce housing units that have a relevant and secured buyer. Finally, the ministry needed to create various incentives and schemes for the private sector to support the development of affordable housing in the price range of USD150,000-220,000 per unit. Today, the ministry has launched the first two waves of requests for proposals to develop its own land, and has provided financial incentives to promote participation from the private sector, such as advanced payment up to 20% of the project cost to developers free of charge, underwriting to secure lower lending cost from financial institutions, and higher financial support for developers using energy efficient installations and fast home construction technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have operations evolved in the last few years?</h4><p>Olam continues to do well. We have been able to double our capacity in flour and biscuits recently and have added a cocoa processing facility a year back. Our current focus is expanding in the food space, and our projects are in staples, such as rice and flour, and packaged foods which is part of Nutrifoods Ghana Limited. We are currently the market leader in biscuits in Ghana and our tomato line is the top-selling brand. We are now looking into new categories such as noodles, pasta, juices, yogurt drinks, and snack foods. These products will be a new entry in Ghana market, though we already participate in these categories in Nigeria. Most of these will happen through investment in local manufacturing.</p><h4>A big problem, particularly in Ghana's agribusiness, is the lack of data. What role do you expect technology to play in Ghana in the future?</h4><p>Technology is the backbone of our growth and is the only reason we are able to continue to scale up quikly. One example is Olam Information System which is the technological platform that we use in our sustainability programs with our partners. We have our IT processes integrated with mobile phone technology. This is important because most of our users on the farming side may not have electricity. These systems are used extensively both for our supply chain partners and for internal customer management.</p><h4>How will the One District, One Factory initiative affect the agribusiness sector and Olam in particular?</h4><p>We welcome the drive from the government wants to distribute growth to all districts and regions. We hope many entrepreneurs will take advantage of that and set up units related to agriculture or other related industries in the interior of the country. That should help both the coordination and the aggregation of agricultural produce from various parts of Ghana. Equally Olam sees opportunity for government to invest in infrastructure in the farming communities to help them get market access.</p><h4>The agribusiness in Ghana has moved to a progressive consolidation, with five major players. How do you plan to maintain your competitive edge?</h4><p>In the last few years, we have acquired several companies in Ghana. We recently acquired a company in cocoa processing in 2015, and we continue to be relatively ambitious with our Ghana operations and will look for opportunities in the consolidation phase.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2018?</h4><p>We expect a robust growth between 6 and 8% at least. We also expect the government to stabilize the currency. It is a promising outlook. Our budget planning for next year is currently based on an assumption of robust growth. We also see an ongoing evolution in the foods space with increasing incomes and improving lifestyles. Consumption is moving from the traditional foods such as corn, cassava, sorghum, and millet to convenience processed foods. This continues to present an opportunity for companies such as ours to tap the changing nature of demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Successful Evolution]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[successful-evolution]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the creation of CMCI over three decades ago, and how has the company evolved since?</h4><p>The growing demand for construction chemicals in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf was behind the establishment of CMCI back in 1984. The company grew from one production facility in Dammam First Industrial City to three production facilities at present and a planned production facility in Bahrain in the coming months. Today, the company produces a wide range of construction chemicals serving all building and construction projects requirements starting from the foundation to the finishing stages. Our successful evolution over the years was not only built on our breakthrough technology throughout the manufacturing process, nor just in our procuring the highest-quality raw materials, but also in implementing the toughest quality control and quality assurance measures at our manufacturing facilities and testing laboratories.</p><h4>How would you describe the key sectors and clients served by CMCI in the local market?</h4><p>CMCI services the biggest companies in the Saudi market across a broad variety of sectors. We are proud to serve the biggest oil company in the world, Saudi Aramco, as well as SABIC, the Royal Commission of Jubail and Yanbu, and SEC. Whether the project is a mega industrial project like SATORP or SADARA, or a refinery project like Jazan Refinery, our products are catered toward serving the most advanced companies and technologies across the country. We also have experience in supplying key industrial complexes like MAADEN's Ras Al Khair, in addition to housing projects in Jubail, Dhahran, and Riyadh with SABIC. Our well-established presence within the construction sector has given us access to products and services to major builders such CCC, Azmeel, Khonaini, Nesma, NCC, SSEM, Gussan, Sinopec, and China Harbor, to name few.</p><h4>How has CMCI looked to overcome challenges related to the drop in the oil price, and with Vision 2030 reforms firmly in place, is the sector back on the stage of growth?</h4><p>The decline of oil prices has been reflected in the number of projects delivered in recent years, which has been quite low. While we are happy to see that many of the notable megaprojects, including KAEC and Jeddah Tower, are back on and momentum is growing, as there have been significant delays or cancellations that have impacted the industry over the years. However, CMCI had its strategy shifted from focusing on mega industrial projects to focus on housing, power, and maintenance projects. The result of this strategy enabled CMCI to reduce the effects of the construction market slowdown to a minimal and diversify our growth strategy for when the construction sector rebounds, as we are seeing signs today. CMCI believes the construction market has huge potential in the years ahead and we are working on our strategy in anticipation of this. The increase of oil prices recently provides us the confidence in the market's prosperity and growth. On top of this, we are encouraged by the widespread Vision 2030 reforms and the impact this will have on the industrial, power, construction, and oil and gas sectors. It shows that the country has a vision, and we are aligning ourselves accordingly.</p><h4>What proportion of your production caters to GCC and wider Middle East markets, and how are you aiming to expand your overall exports?</h4><p>Our present exports share is between 10 and 15% of our total turnover. However, CMCI plans are to increase our export market to 25-30% in the coming years, focusing on Gulf countries and other parts of the Middle East as well. As already mentioned, we expect to open a new plant in Bahrain in the coming months, which will support our growth ambitions in the region. In addition to this, extensive marketing efforts will be exerted and we will restructure our export department to be closer to our customers. We are on the constant lookout for international opportunities and are excited about building our business further.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Since the beginning of 2017 we are witnessing uncertainty in the market, resulting in some of the large contractors being withdrawn from the market due to financial difficulties. Nonetheless, things are gradually starting to pick-up again and we believe the market is now moving toward stability. In light of this, we have focused the majority of our projects toward housing and power projects as the growing demand in both sectors suggest that upcoming projects are both necessary and inevitable. We are also expecting Aramco to release new projects toward the end of the year, and as we have seen with its recent IKTVA initiative to support localized supply chains, we are eagerly anticipating the opportunities that will arise in the years ahead. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the highlights in Makkah this year, both in terms of visitors for Hajj and Umrah, and also from an organizational perspective?</h4><p>As part of Vision 2030, it was announced that the Hajj and Umrah would become a source of economic generation in the country. One of the pillars of the Vision is to increase the number of visitors coming to Makkah to 20 million by 2020, and 30 million by 2030. The infrastructure in Makkah is prepared for such an increase, especially after finishing the expansion project of Masjid Al-Haram, the Great Mosque. The roads, particularly the ring roads, have also been improved, and the Makkah-Madinah high-speed railway is expected to be finished by the end of this year. This will be commissioning tests in the first half of 2017, and will hopefully begin to transport people by the end of 2017. All these improvements are set to transform Makkah and we hope that these developments will go through. In addition to more than 20 four and five-star hotels, there are mega housing projects, including the Jabal Omar complex, which has just been completed.</p><h4>What is your outlook regarding the completion of major infrastructure projects in Makkah?</h4><p>Although there is a small chance of delay due to the financial crisis, there should not be any risks concerning the completion of these projects themselves. They will go well, especially the ones that need to be in service for the pilgrimage and visitors to Makkah and Madinah. We expect a substantial increase in the numbers this year. Last year, we had about 12 million visitors, mostly during Umrah. The Hajj attracted about 2.3 million people in 2016, 1.3 million of whom were visitors from outside of Saudi Arabia. One of the megaprojects that we hope will be started in 2017 is the development of the Mashair, the areas for performance of the Hajj, especially Mina and Arafat, which will increase the capacity of the Hajj. The capacity in the Mashair is currently limited to fewer than 2 million people, but once we start this project, it will accommodate about 4 million pilgrims a year.</p><h4>A big part of Vision 2030 is religious tourism. What would you also like to see from the governmental side in terms of easing the procedure for international visitors to Makkah?</h4><p>There is a regulation that has already eased the process for businessmen who travel to Saudi Arabia. It will be a multiple-entry visa lasting from one to three years. Vision 2030 will facilitate visa issuance to visitors. One of the pillars of the Vision is to increase non-oil income.</p><h4>You feel strongly about turning Makkah into a smart city, to work with innovation and renewable sources of energy. What is your reasoning for this?</h4><p>If we go through with the plans for making Makkah a smart city, it will first serve the visitors coming from the Islamic world, so they will know everything about the city, its hotels, and services. It will also act as a model for other cities in the Islamic world. We have made considerable progress regarding connectivity. As far as the internet and applications are concerned, there is a new company now established by Umm al-Qura University called Wadi Makkah. This young company with innovative ideas is working on applications especially designed for Masjid Al-Haram and Mina. For instance, there is an indoor navigation system of the Grand Mosque called Al-Maqsad. At the moment, we are working on an application for parking lots in Makkah, and another one for city cleaning and smart systems to collect garbage and optimize the journey for collecting it. There is a trend in Saudi Arabia in terms of solar or renewable energy, since the central government has established a city called King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy. There are plans for having different sources of energy other than the traditional use of petroleum. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors are contributing to the growth in the number of trainee pilots that we are seeing right now?</h4><p>All parameters have actually gone up regarding this matter. Since last year, we have seen a clear increase in the number of ground training and simulator hours, and particularly the number of trainees grew by 30%. We are doing business for Saudia Airlines, which is our main customer and takes up almost 95% of all our work. However, the number of other agencies and airlines (national and international) working with us is also increasing. We just installed and certified two new full flight simulators and two new flight-training devices, which are for the B777-300 and the B787-9 aircraft type. This should attract more customers in the region, which is one of our goals for 2017. The B787 Full Flight Simulator is the latest model. Since many training centers currently do not have this model yet, it offers great business potential for us.</p><h4>Airlines in the region expanding their fleets. How much does your scope of work follow the trends of the industry?</h4><p>All the airlines working in the industry are expanding. Saudia alone has 133 airplanes. By 2020, it will have 200, maybe more. By 2030, the total number of airplanes will certainly be huge, so we have to be ready for that as we are the official aviation training center for the Saudia Airlines. There is demand, and there is competition as well, and some airlines prefer to have their own training center, so we are targeting carriers that do not have their own training centers. In the medium term, the number of trainees will definitely be doubled or tripled. We need to increase our budget to satisfy the local market. It takes time, and we are working with our holding company for this. We are aiming for privatization so that we can go fully commercial. Maybe in the future we can have a strategic partner that will give us more opportunity to maneuver for business.</p><h4>The biggest push in aviation seems to be Saudization. Why is this important and how much do you contribute to this?</h4><p>It is a part of the official Saudi vision for 2030. In the aviation industry, we have a great degree of Saudization. Saudia was established 82 years ago, and the first Saudia pilot training school started back in 1959. We are trying to achieve what the government is aiming to do in this regard. All parameters have actually gone up regarding this matter. We are currently serving Saudia Airlines and its affiliates, including Saudi Private Aviation (SPA), Royal Fleet SBU, Saudia Cargo, and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries (SAEI). We also train others agencies and airlines, including the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF), FLYNAS, Air Atlanta, Alpha Star, and ACT.</p><h4>How important is it for you to engage with partners in the region and globally?</h4><p>We have international partners that send their pilots to train with us. In order to do this, we have to comply with the authorities of other countries. We are recognized and certified by Boeing and Airbus. Since each government has its own civil aviation authority, training must take place under their supervision. We are also inspected every year by EASA. What we do requires a high level of professionalism; we are subject for audits and inspections throughout the year. This is a matter of safety, and when it comes to aviation, safety is the number-one priority and is the responsibility of all concerned parties. Therefore, every party has to be handled carefully. When I train a pilot here, I imagine my own loved ones flying with that pilot.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>So far, the first quarter has seen an increase in growth figures and that's good news. All the fundamentals are there for future growth, so that is what we expect. We are currently expanding. We have installed a new CBT System, which is computer-based training for flight deck crew, cabin crew, and flight dispatchers. By the end of 2017, we will go for distance learning or an e-learning system. The current learning method involves the trainee coming here and logging into a computer for self-training. This takes a lot of time. We are looking to have the trainees log into their own computer from wherever their location may be. The trainees can come here after they finish all the online lessons. So, for example, instead of coming here for ground training for three days, they can come here for just one day. As for the new equipment and the existing facility, we are looking to install new Full Flight Simulators and probably expand the main building or open another branch somewhere in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the near future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent has the company sought to build a lasting footprint in the Kingdom?</h4><p>We are here for the long term. We enjoyed more than four decades in the Kingdom and plan to continue with our commitments. We are now focusing on developing the youth of Saudi Arabia to be the future business leaders dealing with the most sophisticated technology. For example, we work with universities on cyber security and have annual competitions related to cyber security. Last year, the competition was presented by the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the winners were immediately recruited by various companies. The most challenging part is building a pipeline of capable Saudis who can be the future business leaders in the high-tech area. Interestingly, last year the winners on all three days were all female, and this sent us signals that this is an area we should focus on and look at female empowerment in terms of enhancing their cyber capabilities.</p><h4>To what extent does this fit into Vision 2030?</h4><p>This absolutely aligns with Saudi Vision 2030. We transfer knowledge and work with the youth. We also have other programs where we send Saudi students to the US to work with high-tech start-up companies. They get involved in everything, from human resources to design and R&amp;D; they learn about all aspects of the business, from technology to investment. At the same time, we seek a great deal of initiatives where we can transfer our own technology to the Kingdom to not only serve Saudi Arabia, but also in the long-term export to the region.</p><h4>How much of your business is divided with the MoD and how much goes into training and nurturing the new generation?</h4><p>We have a great history in the Kingdom; however, as a corporate office we started in January 2014. We did not have large B2B deals yet as we worked with universities and other institutions to transfer knowledge and technology. As we grow and win more business, that amount of work will be multiplied by a large factor. Now there are more opportunities, and an important element of every opportunity is related to localization and industrialization. We do not only deal with the MoD, we also deal with the Ministry of National Guard and our products and capabilities go to the Ministry of Interior. We have two joint ventures in Saudi Arabia. Most of the work is done with the Ministry of National Guard by one of our joint venture called “Vinnell Arabia" and the other is called Northrop Grumman Mission Systems Arabia. Most of the work with the latter is related to strategic site protection with Aramco.</p><h4>Is Saudi Arabia diversifying its defense mix more and more to deal with other countries?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has always held a position of diversifying its procurement. A large majority of that procurement was with the US, due to the fact that the US is undoubtedly the most advanced country in the world when it comes to defense technology. It has the most advanced working system, the most advanced defense system, and so on. When it comes to the amount of money it spends on R&amp;D, no one compares. That is why we are extremely positive that defense trade with the US will remain the highest. From Northrop Grumman's perspective, regardless of the rapid political changes happening both in the US and the Middle East, we are absolutely confident the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the US will remain strong, and that we will continue to support each other in security and defense matters for many years to come. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the recent split from GACA affected your organization and its operations?</h4><p>The country is moving further toward corporatization and privatization and seeks to do so with as many entities as possible. The government wants to see a dramatic increase in performance and service quality in all areas. The idea is to develop financially independent, sustainable companies that provide high-quality services to stakeholders across Saudi Arabia. Our main customers are the airlines flying over Saudi airspace or transiting through the country. The split from GACA has empowered us to become a leaner and more efficient company. We now collect our air navigation charges from airlines sooner, ensuring we provide a better service, and have catalyzed a company-wide improvement in all areas of our operations with safety as our top priority.</p><h4>What will be the specific operational changes facing SANS moving forward?</h4><p>SANS will continue its efforts their flight operations. As traffic grows quickly in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia takes a great portion of the regional traffic. Therefore, SANS is planning to redesign the airspace structure to increase capacity and improve efficiency. This effort will include heavy investment in the empty quarter area, serving thousands of future flights crossing Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>How do you plan to fund some of these new initiatives, and how quickly do you plan to become fiscally independent from the government?</h4><p>Moving forward, we have to fund every project ourselves. We have even funded a number of smaller projects that we began a few months ago. We have a number of strategies to raise capital. Air Navigation's global strategy is based on cost recovery. This means we are allowed to cover our cost plus a small margin of around 10%, which is to be used for upgrades. We have also made agreements with local banks in the event we need extra funds for special projects. The other option in case of major capital investment would be through increasing tariffs. Moreover, there are several initiatives aimed at cost optimization and increasing non-aeronautical revenues.</p><h4>How did SANS achieve its rate of Saudization, and what lessons can be learned from your experience with the rest of the economy?</h4><p>The company is more than 90% Saudi, while the air traffic controllers are 100% Saudi. This was achieved by developing and implementing a solid recruiting plan. In the past, we recruited directly from high schools; however, in the last couple years we have established a fast-track program. In this program, we take students with good English that meet a certain level and enroll them straight into the ATC program. By ensuring we have strict selection criteria for controllers, which is a job that requires a special mindset and aptitude, we have had a higher success rate. In engineering and maintenance, we still have some expats to help, but the majority of the workers are Saudis. We maintain this by enrolling them in a high-quality training program. By doing so, we have made great strides in Saudizing this sector. We are considering recruiting female staff as well, which could happen soon. Part of the 2030 Vision calls for involving women in the economy to a much larger degree, and we seek to play a part in this.</p><h4>What does the year ahead look like for SANS?</h4><p>We are optimistic about 2017 and have ambitious programs in the pipeline. We have to ensure that the culture of the company is more private-sector oriented. The entire corporate mindset needs to be changed. We need to ensure our employees recognize that the company will operate differently as a private entity, and we want this recognition to change their behavior. We have set up a new unit called customer relations management, which will take care of complaints and suggestions from customers and stakeholders. This is a unique year for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Saudi Airlines Catering in line with the government's Vision 2030? And how is the company proceeding in light of these reforms? </h4><p>Our business is built on 10 strategic foundations that we have identified as providing a multi-faceted and sustainable platform for our development, growth, and contributions to society. These include our longstanding core business divisions of In-Flight, Hajj and Umrah, Catering &amp; Facilities, Lounges, Security, and Retail, which are important emerging areas of opportunity; and the vital principles and support functions that underpin our operations — Human Resources, Procurement, Saudization, and Technology. There are direct links between these pillars and the KSA Vision 2030 program. Our Hajj and Umrah services will help the country welcome more Hajj and Umrah visitors; human resources through our various divisions will provide new opportunities for women, youth and the disabled; adopting technology will contribute to the growth of e-commerce and e-services; and procurement and Saudization will support national companies and the development of local talent.</p><h4>How will Saudi Airlines Catering continue with its business diversification plans and what will be its focus for the years ahead? </h4><p>Saudi Airlines Catering has over the last 35 years blossomed into a broad and diversified enterprise, offering a wide suite of food and beverage, retail, hospitality and support services to local and international clients. Our response is a heightened focus on selective diversification, which will position the company in areas aligned with emerging demographic and economic trends, as well as the KSA Vision 2030 development platform. These areas will ensure we continue to deliver value to our employees, customers and shareholders. The country's youthful population, the government's commitment to spending and indicators such as consumer sentiment, all point to a positive long-term economic outlook. Our strategy is based on the conditions and opportunities emerging in each of our business sectors; in-flight catering and retail in addition to catering and facilities.  </p><h4>Many leading companies in Saudi Arabia has been focusing on appointing more Saudi females to lead important positions. What is Saudi Airlines Catering's plan when it comes to develop Saudi talent, particularly Saudi females? Any future plans that you can share with us?</h4><p>Along with talent acquisition, retention and development, Saudization is a core responsibility of the HR department. Pursuing a policy of Saudization ensures SACC plays a part in the development of the national economy, contributes to the well-being of Saudi women and youth, and maintains alignment with the KSA Vision 2030. In 2016 we maintained a Saudization rate of approximately 29.5 percent, significantly higher than the preceding year and our own targets, putting us in the upper bands of the Government's rating system. To further advance this cause, we have developed a special committee that will specifically address issues related to female employees. The committee is comprised of representatives from all key functions — such as training, recruiting and marketing — and female staff members from each department. We are also forging partnerships with local institutes and civic groups involved in women's causes to solicit their views and expertise. This Committee will ensure women have a voice within Saudi Airlines Catering and will also act to improve conditions for female workers, for instance by providing training for managers on creating a female-friendly environment and fostering new development opportunities. Our approach in developing opportunities for female colleagues exists across many seniority levels and business units to provide multiple options for work and career progression.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is SMSA Express's history in Saudi Arabia, and what key services do you provide?</h4><p>SMSA Express is the leading express transportation and logistics service provider of Saudi Arabia and has been operating since 1994. SMSA Express provides air-ground freight transportation services and logistics solutions, adapted to its clients' needs within Saudi Arabia and around the world. SMSA has several services ranging from express, mail management solutions, freight forwarding, and a range of healthcare/cold-chain logistics services. Despite advancements in technology, the necessity of maintaining physical documents is a reality, which is why express has been our core business. SMSA also provides warehousing and distribution solutions to healthcare and e-commerce customers in both the public and private sectors. SMSA also excels in providing customized solutions to the banking industry throughout a dedicated special delivery channel for a fast and reliable delivery service.</p><h4>One of Saudi Arabia's key goals for the National Transformation Program and Vision 2030 is to become a logistics hub. How does SMSA Express contribute to this goal?</h4><p>In order to achieve the key goals of becoming a logistics hub, Saudi Arabia needs to take many initiatives including setting up a state-of-the-art logistics infrastructure and its related services. SMSA has an extensive Kingdom-wide network of retail outlets and distribution channels, offering unparalleled access to all corners of the Kingdom. SMSA's network strength, coupled with future infrastructure initiatives from the government, may transform the Kingdom into a regional logistics hub. For its part, SMSA has developed a bonded facility in King Fahd International Airport, Dammam and recently signed an agreement with General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) to build a similar facility in King Khalid International Airport, Riyadh.</p><h4>How does technology implementation drive efficiency?</h4><p>Technology is always evolving and integrating new innovative tools and processes. Technology has not only simplified logistics networks but has also enriched its automation and connectivity, and has taken it to new heights. SMSA has become the leading express transportation and logistics service provider of Saudi Arabia through integrating technology with over 20 years of experience. Through the use of innovative technology, we have been able to analyze the packages being delivered within the network, allowing us to adapt to constant changes taking place within the Kingdom. We have been able to improve the customers' experience by notifying them via SMS and email on the shipment details. With the help of technology, we have been able to develop a bundle of services made ready to suit businesses and e-commerce customers' needs. These services can be as comprehensive as managing the supply chain, starting from the supplier till the end user. They have provided us with advances in address validation and ID verification with a drastic reduction in error, as a result making our services not only reliable but cost effective as well.</p><h4>From what areas of your business are you seeing the most growth today?</h4><p>We provide last-mile services to major e-commerce players, which have seen tremendous growth recently. Aside from this, SMSA operates a store-2-door service, which allows consumers in Saudi Arabia to purchase products from US retailers. We have also recently introduced a new service, called smartship.com, which can be used by e-retailers of handcrafted products, social media traders, and web-based vendors to sell their products directly to end consumers.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We foresee regional expansion in the short term with the aim of becoming a global player in the next five years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mohammed-s-al-tobi-minister-environment-climate-affairs-oman]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs play in diversifying the economy?</h4><p>The ministry participates with other government agencies in the Sultanate in its role in achieving economic diversification through several axes. The first involves the continuous development of policies and procedures to attract serious investors through improving the business environment. New regulations for issuing environmental permits have been issued, a comprehensive environmental permit system has been implemented, and an e-portal for issuing permits has been launched, as well as other procedures that are in line with the current stage and looking forward to the future. The second axis includes providing advice and technical and legal support to investors and development agencies in the sectors targeted by economic diversification in order to inform them of the best global practices for sustainable development in these sectors and the latest technologies. The third axis involves working with investors and coordinating with consulting companies that are assigned to conduct environmental studies—if required according to the applicable regulations—and then issuing the environmental permits and licenses necessary for the project. The fourth axis is related to the direct role played by the ministry in diversifying the sources of income. We have coordinated with the Ministry of Tourism to prepare regulations for investing in nature reserves ecotourism and is currently completing the necessary procedures for offering investment opportunities in two nature reserves as a first stage. The ministry has played an active role in diversifying the Omani economy by encouraging the use of renewable energy sources and the use of low-carbon technologies, which will contribute to the economic growth of the Sultanate and contribute to diversifying the Omani economy and achieving environmental benefit by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The ministry also launched the “Green Climate for a Green Future“ initiative in 2016 to record and inventory green projects, applications, and ideas in the areas of climate change adaptation and mitigation that they have done or planning to do in the future. The ministry will also intensify its efforts in the development and implementation of other tourism plans in Al Qurum Nature Reserve in Muscat Governorate, the Al Jabal Al Akhdar reserve, the Wetlands Reserve in Al-Wasta Governorate, and the Turtle Reserve in A'sharqiayh South Governorate. In cooperation with the Ministry of Tourism, we have set up the regulation of tourism investment in nature reserves in line with purpose for establishing protected areas and in line with the preservation of biological diversity.</p><h4>What environmental projects are currently being led by the ministry, especially in the field of water treatment and waste management, and what is the expected impact on the economy?</h4><p>The ministry is currently leading a national project to prepare a national environmental policy for the energy sector in cooperation with the relevant parties. It is expected that this policy will open up new areas of economy and development in the framework of environmental protection and public health and saving in the budget of payments, especially those related to external economic cost. The ministry also prepared the final draft of the integrated waste management law in cooperation with the Omani Holding Company for Environment Services (BEA) and many partners, which will be an important addition in reducing the damage and risks to the environment, especially the preservation of groundwater quality and environmental quality through the application of the best and latest technologies. In addition, it will open the way for green investment in the sectors of waste management and recovery of value, which also contributes to the economic sector of small and medium enterprises in addition to major investment projects. Improving infrastructure and the quality of the environment are attractive factors for investment, which is expected from the implementation of these projects in addition to other projects carried out by the authorities responsible for water management in the Sultanate, such as the Ministry of Regional Municipalities and Water Resources and the company. The ministry is currently working on a draft waste management law in cooperation with various partners such as Oman Holding for Environmental Services (Bee'ah) and other relevant competent authorities, which will certainly be an important addition in the field of waste management to reduce damage to the environment and its natural components. We also conduct continuous and periodic reviews of our decisions related to the protection of water wells.</p><h4>What is the role of renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy in industrial growth and environmental conservation?</h4><p>The Sultanate's approach to generating electricity using renewable energy sources such as sun and wind will have a positive effect in several respects, including reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the pollution caused by emissions and waste generated by the use of non-renewable sources of fuel, resulting in a significant improvement in quality-of-life indicators for current and future generations. The diversification of energy sources is one of the policies adopted by the government to achieve energy security and provide what is needed in light of population growth and expansion in the industrial sector and other strategic sectors. In addition, opening the way for renewable energy will contribute to economic diversification and attract SMEs to work in the green business sector. Such projects will reduce long-term greenhouse gas emissions, diversify energy sources, reduce dependence on low energy, create sustainable growth, promote environmental awareness, reduce pollution of all forms caused by the use of fossil fuels, and enhance the energy security of the country.</p><h4>What will be some of the ministry's concerns in the coming years?</h4><p>We continuously work on development programs using the lean approach, which the ministry has already started with some of its applications, in addition to enhancing human resource capabilities at various levels to prepare for dealing with future changes. The ministry is keen to complete the process of full electronic transformation of various services provided to clients, increase efficiency and effectiveness in the methods and approaches of environmental management, and implement the recommendations of the global advisory study on re-engineering procedures to achieve further development and modernization to keep pace with the contemporary world. We will continue to activate cooperation frameworks with various international bodies and organizations specialized in environmental management and human development, such as cooperation with the Institute for Environmental Management and Assessment of the United Kingdom (IEMA), the Center for Environmental Sciences and Fisheries (CEFAS) of the Ministry of the Environment in the UK, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and others. In the field of environmental policies, the ministry seeks to build a culture of voluntary environmental compliance through various incentive tools to enable entrepreneurs and industry to comply with environmental laws, and to contribute and participate in the preservation of the environment and conservation of natural resources while achieving sustainable development. Further, it will continue the work on nature reserves management development of by allowing the private sector to invest in ecotourism and activating the management protection approach to provide financial resources to protect wildlife components and the sustainability of ecosystem services as well as focusing on continued cooperation with universities and scientific research institutions to carry out further joint applied research to strengthen the scientific foundation in order support decision makers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

	We have been present for 50 years in the Costa Rican market. Deloitte was the first services consultancy company in the country. We also manage the Central America region from here with our 500 collaborators.

The other project was getting the Essential Costa Rica certification, which has already been achieved. Obtaining the Essential Costa Rica certification entails some degree of complexity, and, for us, it is important to obtain a verification of our numbers; however, we also believe that as more companies are certified as Essential Costa Rica, it will promote the country abroad. Why? Because size is relevant in this sense; therefore, we consider this is a good situation to know and be clear about what we are. It is also a way to contribute to the country.
</p><h4>
	What is the profile of Deloitte's clients in Costa Rica and the region?
</h4><p>
	We have an interesting range of clients. There are, of course, transnational companies that are Deloitte's clients in other parts of the world, and we serve them here in Costa Rica. In addition, there are many Multi-Latin companies. We work with the most important companies of the country, but also, we have among our clients a great number of SMEs that value the quality of our services. Here, we have different business lines, and according to each of those lines, the range of clients served is differently.
</p><h4>
	How is the performance of SME sector here in Costa Rica, and how are they being integrated to the global value chains?
</h4><p>
	A significant percentage of services and manufacturing processes is in the hands of SMEs—we cannot aspire to get micro and small business as our customers. However, the truth is that, being committed to the development of the country and to our own development, investing in these emerging companies that are in a consolidating process is important for the country as well as for us in the future. We aim to be not only a service provider, but also a business partner for different companies; therefore, it is totally valid to be business partners of a transnational company, a multinational company, and a consolidated company in this country, or become business partners with SMEs that are in a growing process. We believe in supporting this growth.
</p><h4>
	What are the challenges foreign companies will find when investing in Costa Rica?
</h4><p>
	In 2016, Costa Rica captured close to 45% of the investments that were made in the entire region related to shared services centers. Costa Rica is an already consolidated services provider in sectors such as traditional exporting for manufacturing, agricultural, tourism, and others. We have a lot to do with topics of tramitology, in matters of communications and infrastructure. In addition, the biggest challenge for the country is to solve the macro-economic problem and the current fiscal deficit. Because, without this, there is no sustainable path to go in terms of our development. Because in case of an economic crisis that affects our citizens, a resulting economic imbalance would affect the investment and business environment of our country, and this would not be convenient for anyone.
</p><h4>
	What are the opportunities investors can find here?
</h4><p>
	The secret here is the people, the human resources. The truth is that as a country we have been investing almost the 8% of our GDP in education. We do not have an army. Costa Rica is a stable country. It is a country where there are no major political upheavals. In my opinion, these factors are what we offer, besides the commitment with the environmental conservation. Costa Rica being 28th in the Social Progress Index is an objective indicator, and it is meritorious that with our GDP we were rated in the Social Progress Index in a level well above our respective GDP. This means we are doing things well, but it does not mean that there is no gap to improve. Especially in macro-economic and fiscal matters.
</p><h4>
	What products and services are most demanded by your clients?
</h4><p>
	Deloitte has passed from being an audit company to a consulting company, but in our case, the audit service business is still an important component of our services portfolio. We also have an important component with our finance services and in RA, which is the advisory component. In addition, during many years, and that continues with an impressive growth, we offer legal tax service, where we are by far the largest in the country.
</p><h4>
	What distinguishes Deloitte from other consultancy firms?
</h4><p>
	Deloitte, according to the May-July 2016 reports, was first Services Firm based on income. In addition, the support of this global first Services Firm to the region helps a lot in our own development as countries, combined with the effort that is made in each of the regional markets. It is part of a 20-20 structure, a 20-20 strategy, where we want to be not only the biggest; however, the best and most profitable. This has been done in all countries we are present, and as a result of this we are executing the integration project. It is a comprehensive financial integration in the Americas.
</p><h4>
	What is your outlook for Costa Rica's business environment in 2018?
</h4><p>
	It is complicated. In 2018, there will be an election in Costa Rica. By 2018, the fiscal deficit in terms of a national agreement should be solved or at least a strong economic adjustment should be already executed. I am sure we will continue running adequately, and I have no doubt about the process and electoral results and that there will be no disturbances; the result is going to be accepted and the electoral process is going to occur without major difficulties. I think 2018 should be a good year.
</p><h4>
	What are your plans for 2018?
</h4><p>
	We will continue with our plans for growth, our ongoing improvement, and retaining our people. This is a business based on people. Our priority for 2018 is to continue our active participation in the America integration process.

		<title><![CDATA[Desalination costs decreased by 25% in UAE over past decade]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[xavier-joseph-ceo-veolia-middle-east]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering the consolidation we have seen within the government over the past year, can we expect more activity in the PPP space in 2017?</h4><p>The Veolia group strategy is to increase our market share in the industrial sector, by which I mean industrial players, and that classification does not necessarily differentiate between the public or private nature of our clients. This region is home to big industry actors that are public but act as private companies. From our global perspective, there is a willingness to increase the market share regarding industrial clients, but so far there has been a lot of statements but no concrete projects coming into our business lines. Within this space, the range of business models is wide but does not necessarily interest Veolia. Overall, this region is contemplating a lot of PPPs, so we will wait to see more strong opportunities. We are an operator and our core business is to operate facilities on which we can improve efficiency, train people, and transfer knowledge. We do not want to offset the investment of the government and take that onto our own books. We invest in technologies, we invest in the energy-saving sector, we invest in tools, and we invest in training centers, but investing to be the owner of a facility is no longer a part of our strategy.</p><h4>How are your operations in the water market progressing?</h4><p>One of the essential conditions for a company to stay afloat is to adapt to its market. The water market in the Middle East has become more competitive, and along with competition comes cheaper prices. I am not convinced that it is in the interest of a company like ours to try and compete against international companies that can offer far lower prices. The price of desalination in the UAE has decreased by 25% over the last 10 years and, if you integrate the inflation today when you bill one cubic meter of a desalination plant, you are paying 40% less than 10 years ago. The evolution of the technology on the market has allowed everybody to keep the margins steady with a 40% decrease in the unit price. In production, our expertise is in biomass electricity production. This is a way to produce electricity in which we can claim to be a leader and have cutting-edge technology. For a lot of reasons, I do not expect this region to have biomass plants for another 10 to 20 years, except in Turkey. In this region we are much more working on the demand side of energy, to help our clients decrease their consumption through monitoring, and there is a strong market in which our flagship is Enova, which is the regional energy savings leader. We have invested a lot in the energy savings sector, which is a must to be able to help clients decrease energy consumption.</p><h4>On the desalination side, around 98% of the UAE's water is produced through desalination. Veolia has claimed it has more efficient and cheaper ways to produce potable water. How can that be achieved?</h4><p>The best example is the pilot that is co-funded by Masdar to ensure less than 3 Kwh per cubic meter of desalinated water, while the market is currently standing around 3.5kwh. Globally speaking this is the future of desalination. The UAE remains a big energy consumer so it is a problem of concept, as one cannot imagine desalination without energy. The challenge for tomorrow is to increase the efficiency and thereby decrease the price. The market is currently very low standing at USD 0.8 per cubic meter and on big units; I think you can reach USD 0.7.</p><h4>How are you engaging with real estate developers at the design stage in order to generate greater savings on energy efficiency?</h4><p>When we take on a pre-existing building then our knowledge allows us to commit to around 10% in savings. If we are involved at the design stage of the building then compared to a traditional building we can commit to a 30% saving, so it is absolutely clear that the next step of energy savings in this region is retro fitting for existing buildings and new building norms and mindsets for the buildings to come. There is proof that with an open mind we can finance retro fitting with a short-term payback; one day after the retro fitting starts, you already have savings that help with fewer carbon emissions.</p><h4>Can you tell us about current biomass technology development within the company?</h4><p>Veolia is able to produce electricity with any kind of biomass. In Morocco we are producing electricity with the remaining waste from olive leaf pulp and we are able to make electricity with that waste. In Japan we are making electricity with woodchip, so we have the technology, with any kind of green waste, to make electricity. The problem is that here there are not a lot of trees or forests and not a lot of green waste in the UAE, on which biomass is based.</p><h4>Does anything in the carbon capture sector interest you?</h4><p>There is a project to return used carbon to active carbon, an ongoing scheme in Paris, but it is still fairly underdeveloped. What is currently active in the Middle East, and we are submitting an offer to Dubai, is basic waste-to-energy, whereby you incinerate waste and produce electricity. There was an active project in the Northern Emirates, which has stopped, but will perhaps be re-launched. There is a lot of big projects in Kuwait and the first project in the region was in Abu Dhabi around 10 years ago. Someday there will be a new one but in the waste-to-energy sector, in which we are interested, we have 63 incinerators under operation worldwide. There are the same issues in this market, it is a very competitive market in which not one company can claim so many technological advantages to differentiate itself from the competition, which makes it difficult to be award</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[raymond-siva-ceo-edelman-indonesia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are core strategies for international firms coming to the Indonesian market?</h4><p>It is important for firms to understand in one sense the culture and, in another sense, Indonesia. There are 17,000 islands, with easily more than 200 ethnicities and languages. It is impossible to have a one-size-fits-all approach. However, if we focus on where the population is centered on, it is definitely Java, which has 60% of the population. There is an urban migration of about 5% a year and more people will move to Java. President Joko Widodo's move to decentralize is great. It lends itself to talk about moving the administrative capital of Indonesia to central Java or even to Kalimantan. It then means we need to have an understanding of the red thread that cuts across all this various logistics. The cultural nuances are one. Indonesia is a collectivist society and people are consensus builders. They are more concerned about what is going on within Indonesia rather than outside. When a company comes to Indonesia, it has to take stock of these cultural nuances. Otherwise, it would be a challenge to understand how to do business here.. The power of communication is significant. Although we do not have a physical presence, our consultants have already gone to different parts of Indonesia to assist in various campaigns for our clients.</p><h4>What has your experience been with Indonesia companies wanting to reach out to the international arena?</h4><p>Right now, we are working on one of the largest IPOs in Indonesia for 2017. We see a sense that they are keen to expand. That is a sense of confidence now about local companies that can grow big. For example, there is GO-JEK, which has hubs in India and is building in San Francisco, or Traveloka, which recently received USD500 million in investment, including from Expedia. Therefore, there is sense of confidence that Indonesian companies can work on the global scale. In the new business e-commerce technology, there is a great scope for Indonesian companies to push out. Traditional companies may have some difficulties because they are mostly in the resources sector. This includes palm oil and coal, which does not really present an opportunity for international expansion. The area they can also play with is the FMCG area, where halal food is now getting a great deal of traction.</p><h4>How would you describe the e-commerce landscape from your perspective as a PR agency?</h4><p>Because of the spread of the islands and where people are, logistics is quite expensive. It can be a challenge to open up retail stores. Getting goods from the port to all parts of Indonesia will be tough. The infrastructure is not quite there yet, although the country is building on it currently. The road, port, rail, and air cargo infrastructures could all be improved, and they are being improved. The e-commerce business is the best way to reach Indonesia. If we look at fintech, banks are doing e-banking purely because it is impossible to open up 2,000 branches. With e-commerce and the smartphone service system, if the traditional offline post office infrastructure is already there, then it makes more sense. More and more businesses realize that in order to capture the 260 million population and truly maximize the consumer spending power, it has to go online. That is simply because there are 260 million people. We now see Alibaba and Amazon coming in, because the market is so large and digitally savvy.</p><h4>How would you describe the business media landscape of Indonesia?</h4><p>Things have changed; there are more than 13 media groups, some of which are fiercely independent. We now also see the rise of citizen journalism. News as we know it, in terms of traditional media such as broadcast, is doing fine because outside of Java or Jakarta the TV is still key for media. The newspaper reach, however, is dropping. Everyone in terms of the media landscape in Java has moved to convergence and consolidation towards digital or online news platforms. The other side of the fence is that the credibility of online platforms is not as high as the traditional platform. There is still a need for newspapers, though the reach is not big enough. The move toward a digital platform is needed. Facebook has about 90 million users here, and almost 80% are active users. Social messaging platforms are huge. That is really how news is spread and shared among people, which poses a challenge to traditional news outlets. However, how fast can they get the news out? In that sense as well, the online social space has got certain issues because of hoax news. People share a story before they have checked it. The traditional media still has a role to play in how social media is harnessed. Brands have a role to play by monitoring what is going on in conversations and reacting quickly. The media, as how we look at it, has transformed over the last two years. We do not even talk about online or offline anymore because the phone is where it happens. The only time someone probably picks up a newspaper is on a plane, a lounge, or hotel room. It will be social by design, digital first. We focus on the consumer end-to-end, instead of online or offline. We could start offline first, with an ad in a shopping complex, and then from there social media shares or something in the newspaper. Or we could start there first and then drive it through. Indonesia is one of the most rapidly digitalizing countries in the sense of consumer social media. That is the news for investors coming here: to get people on their phones. From the brands and reputations side, this is extremely important. On the brand-side, the best way to reach innovations is online. Data analysis and real-time insights will be the key differentiating factor for brands in Indonesia moving forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Jamaica Stock Exchange seeks to help public and private sectors be more competitive]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marlene-street-forrest-managing-director-of-jamaica-stock-exchange]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate your impact on the Jamaican economy?</h4><p>Our role is to facilitate capital formation and secondary market activities, and the role of the exchange is extremely important to the Jamaican economy. This is especially significant in light of the fact that it is very difficult in most cases for SMEs to get capital to grow, expand, and compete. When the interest rate is high, it is even more critical that the stock market plays a pivotal role in ensuring that these companies can be properly capitalized and that there is a place for them in terms of growing the economy. While we cater to all companies seeking to raise capital, since 2009 we have focused heavily on ensuring that the facility to raise capital is attractive and, as a result, have partnered with the government in terms of special dispensation for SMEs to raise capital on the market. The secondary market is also extremely important; we have an efficient automated trading platform to facilitate secondary market activity in a smooth and efficient manner. Again, going through the cycle from trading to settlement, we also have a securities depository. It is extremely important in this scheme of the capital market to encourage confidence, the raising of capital, and secondary market transactions.</p><h4>What have been some recent successes of the stock exchange market?</h4><p>In 2015, Bloomberg recognized us as the best-performing exchange in the world. In 2016, we were among the top 10, and in 2017 we continue to hold our own. In terms of the statistics, our results are not a flash in the pan but a result of the level of interest that people show in the market based on the fact that we have had a concentrated effort on market education. In addition, our 13 broker members have shifted their focus somewhat from concentrating too much on debt instruments to equities and galvanizing SMEs into taking advantage of the market. The fact is that every subscription since 2009 has been oversubscribed, which means people are also recalibrating their portfolio such that instead of concentrating heavily on fixed-income securities or banks, part of those funds are flowing into the capital market.</p><h4>What incentives are in place to enter the Jamaican Stock Exchange?</h4><p>In 2009, we felt it was important to grow the equities market and our discussion with the government was on growing both the supply and demand side of the market. The government decided that on its end it would provide companies with a tax holiday. SMEs have a 10-year tax holiday, namely five years where they pay no corporate tax and another five years where they pay 50% of the prevailing rate. There is always the question of whether the government has the resources to forego those taxes; however, all the studies we have conducted have shown the move is tax positive. The government may provide relief on corporate taxes but PAYE, NIS, NHT, and GCT taxes all show tremendous growth for the government. Therefore, it is a win-win situation as companies become more compliant, those on the stock exchange are more sustainable, and there is significant growth seen when a company lists as there is immediate transformation and growth, no matter from the standpoint of corporate governance or profitability. Since that tax concession, we have had some stops and starts, where the previous government rescinded the tax concession. However, the program is back on and is entrenched in an income tax act. We have 32 companies listed on the junior market and 33 securities. We push after the companies listed to encourage them to look at other options since there is a restriction in terms of how large the participating equity capital should be; it should be between JMD50 and 500 million. In the event that those SMEs want to raise more than that band, they can return to the bond market or take other options.</p><h4>What are your current projects and do you plan to have more companies listed?</h4><p>We certainly do, which is why we have partnered with the Multilateral Investment Fund, an arm of the IDP. The idea was to promote access to equity capital and the project takes us to potential listing companies to talk about their appetite to come to market and see where their deficiencies are. We assist the companies in terms of their business plans, financials, corporate governance, and any other aspect that may prevent them from coming in. The project has been extremely successful, and we have in the pipeline many SME companies preparing themselves for market. This speaks of the sustainability of the exchange and speaks also of being in synch with the government's thrust for growth.</p><h4>What are the goals and objectives for the Jamaican Stock Exchange in the coming year?</h4><p>We see ourselves as a securities market, and we thus have to move more to offering more products and services in the market. We want to increase our footprint as well as increase the number of products and services offerings to the market. We sit here in Jamaica; however, our market as far as we are concerned is global and for the coming years we will concentrate on leveraging the platform to allow for offerings such as ETFs, REITs, commodities, and more products and services. In the instance of looking at smaller companies, we will also look at how we use our platform within the context of crowd funding. We want to look at our platform in the context of engineering social change and will look at a social exchange. The economy is growing and the idea of a stock exchange is to provide the capital. Because we are an open country, competition comes from within and the idea, therefore, is to see how the stock exchange can assist both the government and private businesses to be more competitive and compete against other companies coming here. We want to give Jamaicans a stake in their own resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Jamaican diaspora in investing in Jamaica and consuming Jamaican products?</h4><p>The remittances from the diaspora amount to over USD2 billion per year. In addition to that, the diaspora is the warm market for Jamaican products. Due to nostalgia, people want to eat what they remember from their childhood; therefore, we have the opportunity to sell into that diaspora market. The UK, Canada, and the US are the core markets for our food exports in particular. We have been successful with this, for example, with companies like GraceKennedy, which has been a huge exporter and investor in these markets. GraceKennedy exports into the North American Tri-State area around New York and has its own manufacturing company in the UK producing for that market. It has also opened a distribution company in Ghana and is present all over the Caribbean. JAMPRO takes Jamaican companies to trade shows internationally. For some markets, this is our principal means of penetration. We try new consumer penetration strategies as well. Currently we have several companies exhibiting their products in a cosmetics and beauty supplies store in London. We are bringing in distributors to look at and try the products, and hopefully sign contracts.</p><h4>What is JAMPRO doing to promote foreign investment in Jamaica?</h4><p>Our investment program starts with Vision 2030, a bipartisan program that aims at making Jamaica a developed country by 2030. Part of that vision includes FDI. We have six sectors in which we promote investment that we have selected based on Jamaica's advantages, such as our natural and human resources and location. The six sectors are tourism; outsourcing; minerals, mining and energy; manufacturing; logistics; and agriculture. One of the biggest events we have is our triennial Jamaican Investment Forum, which we stage in Montego Bay. We held this in 2012 and 2015, and the next one is in 2018. This event is for around 400 hand-picked and vetted investors. We invite people we specifically want to talk to and who are focused around our six targeted sectors. Of these six, tourism is one of our biggest sectors and contributors of foreign exchange. Tourism is growing at about 5% per year in terms of visitor arrivals. There are around 10,000 rooms that we know are going to be built in the next five years. Secondly, the outsourcing, including the business process outsourcing (BPO), sector presents a huge opportunity in Jamaica, with 25,000 people employed in the industry and growing. The opportunity here is because we really have a strong local workforce for BPO. Added to this, our proximity and cultural affinity with the US makes it quite seamless with Americans being happy to have their call answered by a Jamaican voice. In the minerals, mining, and energy sector, our largest mineral exports are bauxite and alumina. We have had some strong inward investment in this area recently with the Chinese takeover of the Alpart Alumina Refinery in St Elizabeth, and the Noranda company out of the US that has taken over the plant in St Ann. In addition to bauxite, over 80% of the surface area of Jamaica is limestone and we feel there is a huge opportunity for export because we have a pure grade of limestone here at around 99.4-99.8%. This means we can export food and pharmaceutical grade limestone. In terms of energy, JAMPRO has a plan to expand the use of renewables to 30% by 2030, The country is somewhere in the region of 12-14% renewables currently, including solar and wind. We have projects in both those areas already. Manufacturing is going to receive a huge boost because of the development of Jamaica's Special Economic Zones (SEZs). The SEZs are going to be taking over from the free zones because they are a concept that is more integrated into the fabric of the economy. This is what makes it exciting because we are really looking at investments along the whole value chain. This leads on to logistics, and Jamaica's location directly north of the Panama Canal gives us huge opportunities for being a regional distribution hub. The Port of Kingston was privatized in 2016 to CMA CGM from France and it is upgrading and improving the efficiency of the port. The sixth sector where there are huge opportunities is agriculture. Jamaica has long been a producer of sugar cane, but there are other products where the country also has great advantages that we have not maximized yet. One of these is Blue Mountain Coffee, which is one of the most expensive in the world, it is in the top five. Then of course there is cocoa production. Jamaica is one of the eight countries in the world that are allowed to use the term “fine cocoa" because of the blend of cocoa we have. There is a lot of other fresh produce that has potential that we can develop further.</p><h4>Is the government changing the regulations to make doing business easier in Jamaica?</h4><p>Absolutely. There is a huge program to make doing business here easier and to catapult us into the top-10 countries in the world in terms of the ease of doing business rankings. Currently, Jamaica is ranked 67th internationally. We have a plan to get the country into the top 10 by 2020. To do that, we have to look systematically at all the factors that go into doing business. JAMPRO monitors those factors, and we have also the Secretariat for the National Competitiveness Council, which coordinates all the government agencies that have an input into those indices. We have a vast program of e-government to put all the government's services online, along with the port community system that will allow paperless trading with Jamaica, and a target by YE2017 to be able to set up a company in less than a day, and then in one or two hours. Big companies here can already pay their taxes online. We are also looking at creating an investment portal that will allow for all business transactions to be made online.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives at JAMPRO for 2018?</h4><p>Our goal is to triple FDI and local direct investment. We feel there needs to be a balance between foreign and local investment. One of the things we think is exciting is that the local private sector has increased in confidence. The confidence level index is at about 149, meaning there is a high level of business confidence. Almost all the large companies in Jamaica are investing and expanding at the moment. We also want to diversify the FDI we attract because we think the balance of the two is what will drive Jamaica to achieve 5% growth in the next three years, which is our goal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[get-up-go]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Mex Rent-a-Car get started?</h4><p>In 1986, I came to La Paz, Baja California Sur, to manage an automotive distributor of Nissan. Together with my partners I opened a distributor in La Paz and a branch in Los Cabos. At that time, with the experience I had in managing business, I started to research the car rental business and in 1989 we brought in a franchise of another brand, first in Baja and then for the whole country. We were successful and managed a fleet of almost 1,000 vehicles. I later sold my share of the business and moved back to Guadalajara in 1998. We remained in the automotive business for 12 more years. In 2013 we acquired the franchising rights of Fox Rent a Car and started operating in three cities. Since we have the franchising rights for all of Mexico, we knew this was a big commitment. We partnered with an association from Guadalajara called Dalton and together we have developed this business. We started in 2012 with 300 vehicles and now have 3,600, a growth of 1,100% in four years.</p><h4>What were the challenges of developing the Mex Rent-a-Car brand?</h4><p>We knew it was hard to compete with the large companies, because they were merging and becoming more powerful. We created our own brand to control our own future by being in charge of our own technology and costs. We created our own system and hired engineers to develop this idea. Right now in 2017 we have 20 locations in Mexico and two in the US. We were the first Mexican car rental company to open at the CBX San Diego crossing. Since 95% of our customers are Mexican, we thought they would be more comfortable renting from a Mexican company when traveling to the US. We have also an alliance with Fox Rent a Car, called MexAlliance. Our customers make reservations via Fox's system and we accept those reservations for both Mexico and the US.</p><h4>What is your client profile?</h4><p>Our client profile has been focused on Mexican business travelers and tourists, though it is not just limited to these. As a result of the internet, we see more interest from clients from the US and Canada. We have travelers from all around the world that choose Mex Rent-a-Car when coming to Mexico. Around 92% of our clients are individuals for business and leisure. Around 8% of our revenue comes from corporations, mainly Mexican. We have also corporate clients that are multinational and hire our services for several months in a row for their representatives who come to Mexico for business. There is great potential in corporate clients; however, we are more focused on leisure and have seen an explosive growth of Mexicans traveling within Mexico. In January 2016, Kayak saw an increase of 170% of locals seeking to travel within Mexico, while international destinations saw a 67% increase.</p><h4>How do you target your customers in terms of trends in the tourism sector?</h4><p>We have a plan for the next three to five years. We are focused on growing with our alliance. We plan to launch two new brands in Mexico, one of which is MTT, focused on the on-demand rental product. We are focused on technology and want to launch this brand this year, which will enable users to reserve and pay through a mobile app. Also we will launch another brand called MGT or Mex Ground Transportation. There are special segments of the market that do not want to drive in Mexico, so this brand targets this segment. We plan to achieve a 95% growth in units and 120% in revenue by 2020.</p><h4>What distinguishes Mex Rent-a-Car from your competitors?</h4><p>Technology is our forte. With our app, it is easier for customers to reserve cars and make payments. We offer an all-inclusive product. We recognize that in the market it is difficult for customers to understand what it is included in rental fees; others add insurance and other fees on prices. Our fares are all-inclusive, so customers do not need to worry about other fees. Our service includes cars, gasoline, and insurance, so when a customer comes they are ready to go.</p><h4>What your goals over the next few years?</h4><p>We have set a goal of 7,000 units and income of MXN1.5 billion by 2020. We want to penetrate the US market under the Mex brand. In terms of the development of the Mex brand through our affiliations, we will probably cover about 30-40 countries. Now we have eight countries that use the Mex technology and brand and have exposure on major websites like Expedia and rentalcar.com. They use our brand in Central America and the Caribbean as well as in Romania, our first country in Europe. We plan to grow in more countries, especially in Europe and the rest of the Americas. We seek to offer entire new experiences and mobility and are considering mixed solutions for cities like Mexico City with limited parking spaces, combining it with rentals by the hour or other means of transportation. The keys to our success are the expertise in administration of our founders, Francisco and Martha Garcí­a, as well as our partnership with Dalton in 2012, who have invested a great deal of money and believe in the technology we are developing, and our employees, who are our main key to future success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[CESCA example of transition from academia to entrepreneurship]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marcos-monroy-ceo-cesca]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What motivated you to launch CESCA?</h4><p>We are a company based on knowledge; our expertise is our knowledge. CESCA is an example of how researchers successfully transition from academia to entrepreneurship. With Mexico's undertaking to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies, which has been one of the strongest commitments at the global scale, companies producing energy with renewable sources have arrived in the Mexican market. The transition meant the creation of eolic as well as solar parks all across the country. We offer consulting services to these new projects launched by renewable energy companies so that they can meet all environmental regulations.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your clients?</h4><p>Our clients are mainly power and mining companies, because their activities have an impact on the landscape. Today, we work with Enel Green Power, Acciona Energia, BMW, Grupo México, and other Mexican developers as well, among others. In the case of Grupo México, must of the environmental licenses for its new mining development program in Cananea, Sonora, were obtained through CESCA's work.</p><h4>What services do you offer?</h4><p>We conduct environmental impact assessments, land use viability studies, and more generally we help our clients meet any legal requirement related to the environment. We help industries decide how to prevent environmental impacts associated to the location of their new operations and developers decide which plot is suitable for construction. We aim to not only obtain the permits and the licenses, but also to reach a sustainable balance throughout the whole operation, in the case of contracts including follow-up studies. More generally, we seek to ensure our standards go beyond what is asked by regulators in order to provide the best possible service.</p><h4>How has the legal framework evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Environmental regulation is not really new, in spite of what many people think. It dates back to the 1990s for the most part. The difference is that currently companies, consultants, and even regulators have learnt how to apply it. Implementation has definitely improved significantly. We help private companies understand how to abide by these rules. The most recent piece of regulation in this field is the Federal Environmental Responsibility Law, voted in 2013. With this new law, if a company pollutes or impacts, it has to pay. Companies have to internalize the cost of polluting, impacting the environment or damaging the wildlife.</p><h4>How has the market of renewable energy evolved over the past few years?</h4><p>As a result of the incentives for the generation and distribution of renewable energy included in the Energy Reform 2013, many projects have been developed to generate energy from solar or wind energy sources. The Energy Reform has been a boost in the sector. However, it is not enough to identify areas with high potential, where it is feasible to install new projects without increasing impacts on the environment, without damaging wildlife and without affecting the rights of the local population. These are the challenges for the coming years, both for developers and generators, as well as consultants such as CESCA and environmental authorities.</p><h4>Given that renewable energy is a fairly new economic sector, do companies face any challenges concerning labor provision?</h4><p>There is a shortage of skilled labor in this field. Foreign companies come with the know-how. These foreign companies need also to develop knowledge in Mexico to increase skills and abilities, for example to sign MoUs with local universities in order to facilitate technology transfers and help train a generation of skilled professionals. I agree with this, especially concerning environmental protection, where there is a lack of specialized training. For example, CESCA employs many young graduates and we do our best to train them in environmental management, which is new for many of them. Moreover, in any project we include a training component for our client's staff.</p><h4>Is there an ongoing evolution in the mentality of business leaders in Mexico concerning environmental protection?</h4><p>It is still seen as an obligation they have to meet in order to operate. However, that is already progress, because today every single company bears in mind the environmental impact of its activities and the measures it must take in order to mitigate them. Some years ago, this was not the case. There is culture of compliance with the environmental legislation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for CESCA over the years to come?</h4><p>I want CESCA to always be ahead of market needs. For that, we need to continue to produce more knowledge. For instance, we want to follow producing more quantitative data for our clients based on models built in-house. In particular, we want to help companies to increase the knowledge about their processes and the adaption to climate change by producing more accurate forecasts. Scientific data about soil, water or wildlife applying GIS will also be translated into economic and environmental data for our clients. The ultimate goal is the improvement of corporate practices in environmental protection and impact mitigation. The government has a strong commitment to increasing the share of renewable energy in the power matrix. However, the country still has a long way to go to reach that goal, so our market will continue to expand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[mohammed-al-jadaan-minister-finance-saudi-arabia]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The global outlook has improved due to the continued economic recovery of developed countries, in particular the US, driven by flexible financial policies and labor market growth.</p><p>However, there are still challenges surrounding the prospects for global growth. Nevertheless, the Saudi economy has strong fundamentals, which include a GDP that has doubled over the last 10 years, the world's third-largest foreign currency reserves, a non-oil private sector that is considered a vital contributor to economic growth, and a low level of public debt, the lowest among the G20 countries. Combined, these factors help drive economic stability and reduce the negative effects of low oil prices. Saudi Arabia's fiscal policies have helped enhance financial stability and support economic growth. Maintaining the exchange rate policy has also contributed to rising confidence levels.</p><p>As part of its move to further strengthen the economy, the country delivers multiple programs to realize Vision 2030 that have taken into consideration the needs of all public and private sectors. In order to fully implement these programs, a comprehensive governance framework was required. In addition, a great focus was given to ensure the development of government agencies. The government of Saudi Arabia has recently undertaken structural fiscal reforms to strengthen the fiscal framework, diversify government revenue sources, and support the non-oil revenue sector, taking into account a potential impact on economic activity. Our government policies focus on increasing capital and operational spending efficiency. In addition to this, the government has developed a national program called the Citizen's Account in order to minimize the impact of these economic reforms on the cost of living and purchasing power, especially for low- and medium-income families.<br>In order to achieve the vision of creating a more prosperous economy for the country, the government announced 10 additional programs to support the National Transformation Program and Fiscal Balance Program 2020. The 10 new programs include a housing program, improving the lifestyle program, national champion program, national industry and logistics development program, PIF program, strategic, financial sector development program, and a privatization program, all elements that will make it possible to realize the goals of Vision 2030.</p><p>In addition, the government has adopted more than 150 initiatives to boost efficiency in CAPEX and OPEX spending across the ministries of health, education, municipal, and rural affairs.<br>At the same time, the country's fiscal policy focuses on diversifying the sources of public financing and achieving the highest levels of transparency. It also embraces best practices in the preparation and implementation of the budget and in corporate governance by taking into account the potential repercussions of new fiscal policies, especially the level of employment, inflation, and the growth of economic activities locally. In this year's budget, the government has allocated more than SAR40 billion to be spent on national transformation-related initiatives, and has allocated an additional SAR220 billion to be spent on national transformation initiatives over the next three years.</p><p>In order to ensure a more active role of the private sector in supporting economic activity and creating job opportunities, especially during the implementation period of the initiatives designed to increase non-oil revenues, a SAR200 billion stimulus package was put in place and will be rolled out over four years. With the needed private sector involvement in deciding the appropriate set of stimulation initiatives, a series of workshops with private sector representatives have been organized, which will conclude within six weeks and the results of these workshops will be announced by end of 2Q2017. Government policies will focus on enacting legislation to promote private sector growth, support the development of local content, provide more investment opportunities to attract foreign direct investment, raise labor market efficiency and create more job opportunities, improve the private sector investment environment, and support Saudi companies' competitiveness in domestic and international markets. The ministry's strategy aims to position Saudi Arabia among the world's largest 15 economies by 2030.</p><p>* Drawn from public comments made by HE The Minister</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Considering the global decline in the shipping industry, the bankruptcy of Hanjin Lines, and the general malaise of global trade, Bahri had an excellent 2016 with only a slight drop in profit and a slightly larger drop in revenues. How did you achieve this performance?</h4><p>Bahri managed to achieve strong results during 2016 owing to the successful deployment of its business expansion strategy and enhancing its operational efficiency to keep pace with developments in the maritime transport sector in the region and the world. Despite lower spot market rates, a 14% increase in fleet with the addition of 10 new vessels, and enhancement of cost efficiencies resulting in a decrease in daily ship running costs all contributed to the overall performance.</p><h4>Your key cargo is oil and chemicals, but you have made a few recent moves to expand in breakbulk and dry bulk, such as a JV with Bunge. What do these recent moves imply about your shipping mix?</h4><p>Bahri is a global leader in transportation and logistics, and prides itself on offering a range of services and solutions across the board. Bahri currently has six business units providing diverse services that include transportation of crude oil, oil products, chemicals, bulk, and general cargo, in addition to ship management and big data solutions for the maritime industry. Each of these business units are independent of each other and have their individual strategic objectives and goals. The market dynamics, consumer demand, opportunities, and challenges for each vary; however, we are resilient in our focus on constantly upgrading our services and continuous value creation for customers, shareholders, and employees. </p><h4>You recently signed a logistics agreement with SAR. How will this arrangement expand your logistics arm?</h4><p>As part of the agreement, Bahri Logistics will provide SAR with transportation services for all types of cargo from around the world, as well as customs clearance support. This will help further strengthen and expand our services, while generating constant revenues.</p><h4>You also have a data unit. What is the concept behind this creation and what insights has it yielded?</h4><p>The use of big data in shipping is very much in its infancy, for many reasons, namely limited communications capabilities, reliance on niche market applications, as well as a reluctance to modernize. So clearly, while the application of large amounts of data to operational improvement is beginning to grow in importance, this is a technology still in the “early adopter“ stage, and Bahri is one of the few maritime firms globally that can count themselves among this early group. At Bahri, we believe that it is important to stay at the forefront of the development of big data technologies in order to ensure our industry leadership position by leveraging the benefits of changes in the market as they occur. It is no secret that ships generate terabytes of data but the main concern is that this valuable data is not mined or assessed, and hence no actionable insights are drawn that could be used for important decision-making. Bahri is in the process and has embarked on the journey by building a new infrastructure platform called Bigdata Resource Integrated Sea Operations (BRISO), leveraging all of the data created by the company's ships during operations, its interactions with third parties, as well as the activities going on in its shore offices.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>As we head in the second half of 2017, our main focus rests on continuously improving our performance across all fronts, aimed at benefiting all our stakeholders. To achieve this, we will continue to innovate and deliver big data solutions to provide value-added onshore and offshore services, ensure fleet optimization, and maximize profits. Consolidation, diversification, and increasing capacity are also key elements of our growth plans. While oil and chemicals are key cargos for us, we will continue to increase our focus on breakbulk and dry bulk transportation and ship management services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[For Better Or Worse]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[for-better-or-worse]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Budget is the largest firm in Saudi Arabia. How do you compare to others in the region?</h4><p>We are the largest franchisee in the world for Avis Budget Group and one of the largest car rental and leasing companies in the Middle East. We have about 25-28% market share in the Saudi Arabian car rental industry. Budget Saudi is the only car rental and leasing company listed in Tadawul, the stock exchange in Saudi Arabia, and our shares are publicly traded in the market. This was one of the strategic moves that allowed us to scale up the business to its current level.</p><h4>Such dominance is rare in any sector in the Middle East, much less in the highly competitive rental car market. How did you do it? </h4><p>Budget Saudi was established in 1978. We have built a wealth of experience in nearly four decades. By this, I mean our key employees have decades of professional practice. Our visionary founder is the executive chairman of the group. Our formidable team has excelled in every area of our operations. The average tenure of our top management is nearly two decades. This shows the depth of experience with our team and the consistency in management practices, but there are other factors that contributed to our position. We have invested heavily in our infrastructure as well. We understand that we do not produce a tangible product; our product is our service. When renting a car, it is necessary to trust that it will function well and is safe. We create a customer experience each time they drive a Budget vehicle. </p><h4>Is there a new push for you to be present in smaller, secondary cities, and what recent investments have you made in your maintenance and retail infrastructure?</h4><p>As long as there is an airport, we are present. Budget Saudi Arabia has been present in all the major airports in the Kingdom for several decades. We have also recently expanded into smaller cities. With 105 retail locations, we are present in every province of the country. This is a major advantage for us because our clients, corporate or retail, can find us everywhere they travel. Once an airport opens in a city we build our infrastructure there, including workshops and branches, and we recruit and train our team. </p><h4>How are you adjusting to the new macroeconomic situation?</h4><p>2017 will provide excellent opportunities for Budget Saudi Arabia compared to our competitors. When we buy in a difficult time, we dictate the price. Most of our competitors are family-owned businesses that are less willing and potentially less inclined to invest during poor economic conditions. We intentionally invest more during downturns. We know that we will gain more market share in an economy where our competitors are not willing to invest. We are still keen on investing because we believe we can gain a higher market share of the existing pie even though it is stagnant at the moment. </p><h4>Do you see scope for growth at Budget Saudi Arabia due to the reforms that being implemented in line with Vision 2030?</h4><p>The government's Vision 2030 will bring a great deal of business to us. With the private sector coming up, companies will employ more people because Vision 2030 is all about employing more Saudi citizens. We have approximately 200,000 students abroad, and when they return to the Kingdom they need to work, and the country needs to create jobs for them. Job creation will definitely add to our economy because we depend on domestic travel. When people have jobs, they have higher spending power and will use to this travel within the country. We are enthusiastic about the reforms and are ready for them. More private sector activity means employing more people, which creates higher demand for our services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the reforms being implemented impacted your business?</h4><p>We are witnessing a big opportunity coming within Vision 2030 and are enthusiastic about it. Today, the challenge is to be prepared for the future and to invest. SAPTCO will be one of those that does. This is what drives us to restructure our organization to be more flexible and provide autonomy to our business units. In addition, the company is moving toward a customer-centric model to utilize its strong customer base. SAPTCO is optimistic about the future of the transportation sector in the Kingdom. A strong and independent regulator, the Public Transport Authority (PTA), was recently set up in our sector. As a large company we prefer an organized market. This is part of the reason we have restructured ourselves in order to focus on our lines of business.</p><h4>How has your mandate expanded and diversified over the years?</h4><p>SAPTCO was established in 1979, since when we have had one focus: linking the 382 cities and villages of this country within a single unified bus transportation network. Since 2008, we have spent 10 years building for the future to ensure more diversity, lines of business, and modes of transportation. In 2010, we established a luxury limo line of business, a cargo and logistics business, and the metro and railway. Today all these services are becoming integrated. We are now preparing to move into new areas. We are building new platforms with partners, setting up new companies, such as in education, where in partnership with Emirate Transport we established the Saudi Emirate Integrated Transportation Company (SEITCO) to serve the education sector. For three years our services have been used to transport 250,000 students all around the country. Another key piece of our strategy is the PTC Saudi-French Public Transport Company, which we formed with our French partner RATP. Together we won the contract to build the bus network for the King Abdulaziz project for Riyadh Public Transport, which will start operating in mid-2019. This is a massive network and is hugely important to the future of the city. We are also in the bidding process for operating and maintaining the Riyadh Metro, a completely new line of business for us. This is based on our partnership with the leader of driverless RATP.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the deal you recently closed for 1,000 new buses?</h4><p>Some of these new buses will be produced by Mercedes and some by MAN. This is the single-largest deal in history for Mercedes worldwide. Also, SAPTCO is one of the largest clients for Mercedes worldwide, which reflects the size and importance of the work we do. We operate more than 330 million km per year, which greatly reflects this story of why we are the largest Mercedes client worldwide to sign the largest single deal in its history. It also indicates how committed we are to quality. Mercedes make some of the best buses in the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the next 12 months?</h4><p>Development cannot take place properly in unorganized markets; it is impossible to deliver the quality people seek without rules and regulations, and a large company cannot make big investments while competing with small businesses or individuals with a completely different model. If we seek superior quality, the market must be organized. The establishment of PTA will definitely benefit us. Only those who pursue quality can exist in the market. For the next 12 months, our goals are to translate what we heard about the vision into reality. This next year should entail a great deal of work building the bridge from strategic to implementation. This is what we are working toward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-fleet-for-all-ages]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Saudi Arabian market is the biggest for car rentals in the Middle East. Where does Auto World stand in this market?  </h4><p>Established in 1983 in Al Khobar, by 2007 Auto World had expanded its services to include daily, weekly, and monthly car rentals with a wide-variety fleet mix. It is currently one of the biggest four players in the market. In 2010, our facilities covered 7,500sqm and our fleet size was 2,575 cars, with seven branches in different locations. By 2017, our facilities reached 40,000sqm with a total fleet size exceeding 12,000 vehicles. The company operates nearly 30 branches, mainly in the major cities of KSA.  </p><h4>You recently signed a franchise agreement with Sixt Rent a Car. How will this boost your business?  </h4><p>Sixt, founded in 1912, is a German international car rental company, and the fifth largest in the world, with over 2,000 locations in over 100 countries and a fleet exceeding 180,000. It is one of the largest car rental companies in Europe and the number-one player in the German market. Prior to signing this agreement, Auto World was a local company focusing on the domestic market only. Now we have expanded our operations to the international level with new inbound and outbound sales channels. Potential benefits of this include: an improved market share from inbound and outbound car rental business; the opportunity to enter into cross-border agreements with other franchisees; and access to a worldwide client database in both leasing and car rental.  </p><h4>Greater demand is being driven by religious tourism as well as growth being driven by Vision 2030. How are you preparing for this? </h4><p>As part of the Vision 2030 plan, economic diversification is one of the key targets. As part of its long-term business plan, Auto World is also applying the same strategy by diversifying its customers from different industries. Besides these efforts, Auto World has already started analyzing the opportunities for improving its operations in religious tourism by creating new synergies with other Sedco Holding companies operating in the industry.  </p><h4>What differentiates you from other established international players in terms of fleet and level of service?  </h4><p>Auto World's greatest advantage is its diversified operations. In the leasing business, we not only lease cars but also give our customers complete after-sales services such as replacement and periodic maintenance.  </p><h4>How do you deliver a high level of service while maintaining your margins? </h4><p>The increased competition and the downturn in the economy have adversely affected the industry. To cope with this, Auto World has implemented certain cost rationalization strategies to optimize its cost structure, which have enabled the company to keep its margins without sacrificing service for its customers. We have also started implementing a large-scale management change to smooth the transition of our operations, organizational structure, and corporate culture in light of our new partnership with Sixt.    </p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>The remaining months of 2017 and the following year will be difficult for the industry. Even though the current economic conditions are not in favor of Auto World, the same situation is applicable to all our competitors, so I see this as an opportunity to improve our market share. The companies who are going to survive within this environment without deteriorating their service levels will have a greater chance of growing their market share. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-revolutionary-custom]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes are you pioneering at Saudi Customs in order to meet the National Transformation Program (NTP) goals?</h4><p>When I started at customs, three initiatives pertaining to the NTP had already been submitted. The first was the automation of exporting processes, the second the post clearance audit, and the third the reimbursement of subsidies when exporting. These build on a long list of additions that will transform Saudi Customs into a truly 21st century customs authority that acts like an invisible experience for our customers, without compromising security or reducing revenue leakage. Vision 2030, which is connected to the NTP, is about transforming Saudi Arabia into a logistics hub. In order to do that, we need to be operationally effective and efficient. For example, we have reduced the number of documents required for imports from 12 to four and are looking at reducing that even more. We are in the middle of questioning every single document that we request, what we do with the data, whether it is needed, and how can we get it from other sources. </p><h4>How will you be coordinating the 24-hour initiative with Saudi Ports?</h4><p>This is a joint effort; I do not see it as a customs initiative, but for ports, customs clearance, and shipping lines. There is great synergy taking place in order to achieve the 24-hour target. Of course, this is a complete paradigm shift for our ecosystem's regular modus operandi; however, we made a calculated judgment about this. We are piloting this at King Abdullah Port and Jeddah Islamic Port. We are going through an exponential learning curve about how to optimize and upgrade our technology systems. Within Jeddah Islamic Port there are three operators; we have been successful in reducing the average dwell time from about 10 days to three days.</p><h4>Cultural change is key across government agencies. How are you working to change the culture at customs?</h4><p>That is one of our most significant goals. We are creating a big-change management program within customs in order to ensure that we involve everybody in this transformational journey. We are hiring a head of customer service, as well as a customer advocacy unit. We have launched an internal survey about rest periods because in remote areas they work about two to three weeks and then come back and take a vacation. We have changed that based on the feedback of our employees—it was not top down but bottom up. There will be resistance if we do not change this structure. </p><h4>What other goals do you have for the end of 2017?</h4><p>We have about 31 programs, each of which has its own set of initiatives and projects. It is too early to announce; we are still validating, questioning, and challenging each of them internally. We are still looking forward to engaging with the private sector and our stakeholders because we are going to start workshops from the beginning of next year. We can definitely launch the revised version of how customs clearance agents work. We are going to try to uplift the industry, revise and upscale guidelines, and ensure there is quality and accountability. Another critical program is the AEO, a World Customs Organization initiative. Saudi Customs had internally developed the program, and we are revising it so that we can launch it before the end of the year. Thirdly, there is the automation of our services. For example, we are still struggling with the technology system, but the idea is that by the end of this year we receive no paper documentation from anyone. Another critical element is the risk management system.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Jawraa received in the market, and what are its core businesses?</h4><p>In 2005, we began as a systems integrator, and today we focus on three major areas. Today Jawraa's vision is in line with the Vision 2030. We want to be a partner in digital transformation by providing the right models and solutions for governments and corporates to make the transition. Our three operational pillars help us deliver on this vision. The first pillar is cloud solutions. In 2015 Saudi expenditure on IT was USD13.8 billion, which was the most of any country in the region. Still, despite this, there has been little focus on coordinated spending. This means that there has been a good deal of double spending and unnecessary expense, with different ministries spending money on redundant services. In 2016, there was a move to centralize these expenditures on the service systems, and this requires a local cloud, which we help provide. We deployed our cloud technology in 2015 and are now the second-largest MS cloud service provider in the country. This is an area where centralization of common services is necessary because it is much more cost efficient. The second pillar is finding the right solutions and partners. We are currently partners with some of the largest technology firms in the world, and these partnerships allow us to craft solutions and systems that better serve our customers. We can create systems that are useful across a number of different industries, ministries and entities, and to do this we need the best partners with the best technologies. We can provide our customers with high-quality solutions while giving them a service that respects and acknowledges their native traditions, norms, and ways of working. The third pillar is Professional Services. More than 50% of the federal budget goes to health and education; however, looking at the output and the results of these ministries operations, it is clear that there are still challenges. The best way to fix these issues is to convert its operations to digital platforms. This makes nearly every aspect of its operations more effective and more efficient, helping to lead to more successful outcomes. We are now working with a number of government agencies on many different levels, and we strongly believe that digital transformation will be key in the future in the success of 2030 Vision.</p><h4>How are international hardware and software firms approaching Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>In 2015, the ICT market in Saudi Arabia was worth USD34.7 billion, and any international firm would like to be part of that. We have seen many international firms entering the market place and aggressively pushing for greater market share. We are constantly fielding calls from international firms seeking access to the Saudi IT market in one way or another. We have partnerships with many firms and we provide a number of services that help them gain access to the Saudi market. Whether we are a distributor or end user retailer depends to large degree on the requirements of the specific market needs. In other cases, we form joint partnerships with international organizations, leveraging the synergies of each to enhance profitability. So, much depends on whether we are a systems integrator, a partner in joint venture, or a distributor.</p><h4>How satisfied have you been with the reforms implemented under the Vision 2030, and have they impacted the way you position Jawraa?</h4><p>Jawraa is an extremely nimble and adaptive company, and change can take place rapidly. For us, change and flexibility are paramount. We are therefore able to adapt quickly to any new trends that emerge in the market place. Last year, we played a large role as a consultancy, helping firms and ministries take general strategic suggestions from large international consultancies and translate them into actionable tasks. This year will see those tasks executed on, and we expect that major changes can be realized on a number of levels. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How you have grown to your current size from a small initial capital base?</h4><p>We began our journey in 2012 with limited capital and means, which we supplanted with the boundless energy and innovation of young enterprising Saudis. Our success was underpinned by pioneering a true PPP model in Saudi Arabia that delivered a strong and lasting value proposition. Naturally, we reinforced this approach with an operating and business model geared towards generating commercial opportunities by enabling and delivering better public services. Government entities are our key customers, and our goal was to enable them to serve every citizen better. </p><h4>How do you support and finance your operations? How do you generate revenue?</h4><p>Whenever we come up with a solution we think about it from a multidimensional perspective; stakeholders, sustainability, and financials. In this sense, we assure an added value to all stakeholders that the solution will have direct positive impact in which we generate revenue. We believe that if you create a truly innovative and smart solution, something of true value, then the revenues will follow. There is no one revenue generation method here at Thiqah, such as a supermarket. </p><h4>What are some of your most recent products, and how do they fit your business model?</h4><p>One recently launched product with the Ministry of Housing was “Wafi“ or off-plan sales. Essentially, this is the licensing map-located sales for real estate units. This enables developers to engage in large-scale real estate projects, such as apartment complexes, and sell units as they progress in their build-out, organically funding later stages with earlier ones. Wafi provides full integration with the Ministry of Justice for the seamless electronic transfer of deeds, automates all requests for complete licensing, and electronically evaluates real-estate developers and their projects. Of greatest value is perfecting the virtual integration of all stakeholders along the same value chain. This embodies our business model because it is innovative and provides a great benefit to the country, much like our award-winning 180-second CR registration, which saved over 2 million workdays. The economy-wide impact of such an initiative is enormous. OPS "Wafi" will reduce the price of real estate units for end-users and developers and lower the cost of funding for banks and investors while generating improved returns. The overall process is also streamlined, automated, and instantaneous.    </p><h4>What about future areas of growth? </h4><p>When the National Transfromation Program (NTP) was released, we examined our activities and realized that our business model truly embodies just what privatization is all about. We want to introduce this model to other entities and have expanded our portfolio with the Ministry of Commerce and Investment (MCI). Today, we are proud to have solidified partnerships with over 12 governmental entities who replicate our proven partnership model. </p><h4>Is there an opportunity to privatize this organization? </h4><p>We are a 100% private entity. If the question is about going public, we are ready in terms of all policies and procedures to go to the Capital Market Authority (CMA) and satisfy its requirements. </p><h4>What are your most immediate ambitions in the next 12 months? </h4><p>The country is on a very fast track to development. Going at the same pace requires Thiqah to be more dynamic than ever and means we must double our efforts to fulfill our purpose of leading change. With that in mind, we have major programs with many initiatives. We have to maintain strong relations with every governmental entity, innovate, and enable entrepreneurs to become key factors in what we do. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[top-priorities]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The IT sector is one typified by constant change. How would you describe the role of the ministry in today's climate of rapid technological advancement and breakneck reform?</h4><p>In the midst of rapid technological advancements and disruptions, the ministry's primary role is to provide core enablers as well as a mature, dynamic, and favorable ICT ecosystem to businesses, citizens, and the government so that we, as a nation, can achieve the highest social and economic impact from technology and more broadly from digitization. Indeed, the IT sector is witnessing constant change and offers massive opportunities for the Kingdom. This has been recognized as part of the Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan (NTP) 2020 priorities. Overall, our IT industry is growing; however, contribution to GDP remains modest at 0.4%, compared to 2% in best practice regional markets and 15% in best practice global markets. This offers massive development opportunities. Furthermore, the IT market continues to be import driven, where 80% of IT spending in the Kingdom goes to companies based outside the country. Hence, this offers a massive localization opportunity. Finally, we still have major improvements to be made on trust and security. The Kingdom witnessed around a 1,000 cyber attacks in 2016, targeting primarily foundational IT infrastructure and platforms. The social and economic reforms that the Kingdom leadership has lined up from the 2020 and 2030 horizons are expected to multiply the opportunities for the IT industry, thanks to increased digitization in citizens, business, and government applications and interactions.</p><h4>The IT sector has the ability to directly and indirectly employ vast numbers of people. It also has the ability to bring markets to SMEs and create new tools for society. Is the ministry involved in training and equipping Saudis with technological skills, and how is this best done?</h4><p>Building local skills and talent is among our top priorities as we currently suffer from a shortage of more than 50,000 specialists in our ICT workforce. It is also among our top priorities as it is a core enabler with a multiplier effect on the broader economy and its digital transformation journey. As such, we are indeed highly involved in fostering local ICT talent, and have successfully launched several talent development programs and partnerships with global IT companies to train more than 56,000 Saudi youths on key ICT skills between 2017 and 2020. We have also set up the National Information Technology Academy in collaboration with Saudi Aramco and signed multiple MoUs with private-sector companies to train and develop Saudi talent. We are also looking at new innovative approaches to foster, more broadly, digital talent across all ages as we strongly believe training alone is not enough; we need to develop a true digital culture in our people. Several flagship initiatives will be announced here very soon. To bridge the estimated talent gap, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) is focusing on promoting ICT interest, elevating ICT skills, and ensuring ICT employability readiness. Among others, MCIT is mobilizing ICT providers and securing commitments to large-scale training and employment opportunities.</p><h4>Broadband provision is a key area under the NTP. What plans are being made for increasing provision to rural areas, and will the private sector take the lead? </h4><p>A nation-wide, efficiently deployed, high-speed broadband infrastructure is critical for Saudi Arabia, including in rural areas. One of the key challenges in infrastructure and communications is its large geographic spread, and NTP has set a target to increase broadband coverage to 70% of rural areas. We have been working toward this jointly with operators, regulators, and the private sector. The ministry has introduced a broadband stimulus fund to encourage the private sector to invest in broadband particularly in rural areas, and is working on establishing partnerships between municipalities and the private sector to accelerate deployment. In this fund, Zain has already been awarded the first phase and is on track to deliver the first milestone by the end of July. We are also collaborating with the private sector to evaluate regulatory mechanisms that will incentivize investment in infrastructure. We see the private sector as a direct stakeholder and partner in the ICT sector transformation as well as the overall national digitization journey. We expect the private sector to contribute to the country's national goals and as such to prioritize investments and resources on broadband provision to rural areas. We would also like the private sector to take the lead on piloting new technologies in fixed and wireless broadband like 5G, sharing best practices and recommendations for standards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of PTA in Saudi Arabia's rapidly evolving transport sector?</h4><p>In 2016, there was a decision to merge the PTA with the Railway Commission, a move that significantly expanded the agency's portfolio. The goal was to move the regulation of transport goods and marine regulation from the Ministry of Transport to this authority. This was a significant shift within the sector, and one that conforms with other government restructurings to provide more independence and a clearer structure. The PTA is responsible for regulating three sectors: railway, land transport, and maritime transport. It is totally independent. The authority does not own or operate projects; it just regulates. Our aim is to have a solid, well-regulated industry that is inviting for local and foreign investment. </p><h4>What key regulations and changes indicate your new direction?</h4><p>It is no secret that if we do not have a regulated industry we will be doomed. In Saudi Arabia, there are more than one million trucks; unless we regulate this fleet we will face problems. A government company has developed a platform for us called Wassal, which connects point A to point B. The role of this platform is to bring in licensed service providers to one stage. This platform will centralize data, such as the weight of the truck, the hours the driver has driven, and his record, and will include dispatchers and other stakeholders. With that technological leap we will be able to improve services and reduce accidents. In addition, we have been regulating and working with a public company called Takum. It is in charge of enforcing all transport laws and fining all violations. We are assisting on the ground to ensure the taxi drivers are licensed and have the right safety equipment. Our role in maritime is making sure everyone is following international agreements and adhering to them for safety, environmental, and other regulatory requirements. </p><h4>What is the future of the Saudi land bridge project?</h4><p>Part of the Vision 2030 is for Saudi Arabia to become an international logistics hub. Saudi Arabia is half the size of Western Europe. We need to have proper ports that can accommodate our expansion, especially on the Red Sea. Approximately one-third of the world's traffic moves through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal. The land bridge is a key part of the success of our ports. It will be freight oriented and be tendered to the private sector.</p><h4>The Haramain High-Speed Rail project is on track to begin limited operations later this year. Will it be profitable to operate in the medium term?</h4><p>The goal is to have a sustainable project, so the ticket price has not been decided yet. We need to have affordable prices while still being profitable and managing costs. We are studying the tariff and every cost. This project will pay for itself with the tickets and real estate around it.</p><h4>What are the major things you hope to accomplish in 2017?</h4><p>2017 is the year we want to make sure we have commercially committed partners, not hit and run investors. The goal for the end of 2017 is to identify the proper industry players and support the committed ones. We also need to improve the safety of our transportation and provide enough job opportunities for Saudis. We have already started by requiring service providers such as Uber and Careem to use Saudi drivers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What changes must happen to more deeply involve the private sector in the nation's ports?</h4><p>The port sector was one of the first sectors that privatized its operations through concession and BOT agreements. There were long-term incentives for the private sector to invest and reinvest in the terminal operations and various ports. This started nearly 20 years ago, when everything was based on a revenue-sharing model where the regulator and the Saudi Port Authority (SPA) and operator were incentivized to increase volumes and thus revenues for both sides of the concession. Looking forward, we see a two-pronged approach to the next round of privatization. We have learned a great deal through 20 years of experience about what works and what does not in these long-term concession agreements. We are keen on addressing those deficiencies that imbalance some of the concession concerns over the next 20-30 years. This is building on the great work of the past 15-20 years; we already have three of the top four port operators operating in the Kingdom now. Though the overall structure is good, we are working on the next round of concession agreements and the restructuring of those agreements to improve it all the more.</p><h4>What have you done to improve human capacity and work culture?</h4><p>The key to the National Transformation Program (NTP) and Vision 2030 is not just a new vision of how the economy is structured, but a new vision of how the government operates. This vision is about demanding efficiency from government agencies and responsiveness to requests, either from the business sector or the citizen. We are seeing more demand for more business-friendly practices and an opening up of data and better statistics for the country. One of the things we are working on is having clearer KPI structures within SPA that allow us to pinpoint the bottlenecks in our port logistics chain. </p><h4>What does that shift imply about the way the authority is run today?</h4><p>My job here is to sweat our assets and not to build something new. It is to make sure I get everything out of the assets I already have. The government has spent in excess of SAR40 billion (USD10.7 billion) over the past 30-40 years in ports, and we need to ensure the investment gets an adequate return. Anything that can be done by the private sector will be. There is no desire for the government to crowd out the private sector. My predecessors went down this path and privatized the ports' operations. We need to stay on that path and be more aggressive about privatizing as much of the operations as we can. </p><h4>Where do you hope to achieve in the rest of 2017? </h4><p>The NTP has targets for 2018. By the end of 2017, we hope to have a better delineation between the various authorities within the SPA and ensure the inner workings between the various government agencies are clarified. There are other minor steps along the way in terms of our corporatization process and internal assessments in terms of where we are and the authority's overall balance sheets. Another major aspect of the 2030 national transformation program is a big shift on the logistics front. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the company begin, and how did it complement the group?</h4><p>Alkhorayef Commercial is more than 60 years old and the product of Alkhorayef Conglomerates. It has developed and created what we call today the Alkhorayef Group. At the time, the company started in the agricultural sector; over the years it has organically developed and diversified into other businesses. Some diversification was due to low market growth in the agriculture sector, and some was due to distributing risks among the portfolio. As everything grew, the group was created in 2007, and the name was put aside for two and a half years. I came back with the idea of consolidating all trading business as capital goods under one umbrella called Alkhorayef Commercial, which became my mandate in early 2010, since it was under the umbrella of Alkhorayef Industries. The business model was very simple: we work with well-known brands worldwide to transfer the technology and quality of products and services and have our manufacturing branch in Riyadh, which we also represent in Saudi Arabia. This was the best approach to get economies of scale when it comes to branches, after sales services, and logistics.</p><h4>How would you describe your product portfolio?</h4><p>Alkhorayef Commercial has five divisions, the largest of which is agriculture. Within this division, we have well-known, worldwide brands like Volvo Penta engines and John Deere tractors, which we have been carrying for more than 30 years. Additionally, we manufacture at our facilities and are well known for our pivot system product. We have been a world player in this industry and have been manufacturing our pivot systems in Riyadh for a very long time. Over the years the name and the model have changed, so today we call it Western in most of the world, except in the US and Australia, where we call it Pierce. Most of it is manufactured in Saudi Arabia, but we do have an assembly facility in China. We also manufacture the turbine pump and gears under the license of the American companies Western Lean and Randolph. In addition, Alkhorayef manufactures high-quality steel pipes with a wide range (API). For many years, we also had the patent on perma pipe technology. Our second division is the marine division within Alkhorayef Commercial. We have Yamaha outboard engines and Volvo Penta inboard engines, in addition to diving equipment and military applications for diving. The third segment is the material handling equipment. We became a large and sophisticated assembler with a proper facility, production line, canopy production, metal sheets, and control panels and have worked the whole supply chain. Our capacity goes beyond the local market, and we are always participating in the Middle East Electricity and Power Exhibition and going with the Saudi Export Authority to promote our products. We see Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and the Caspian countries as potential buyers, not to mention many places in Africa. </p><h4>Are there any regions you are looking to penetrate in terms of partners?</h4><p>The sky is the limit. We are selling irrigation systems in the US, so there are no boundaries if we have the right distribution formula. However, we do not want official partnerships with financial obligations, but prefer to have the pure distribution model. I am working on a great opportunity in Argentina, supported by the Saudi Export Program, which we have already done in MENA, Ecuador, and Cuba. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major changes at UNIVEST since 2014? </h4><p>UNIVEST as a company was established in 1976. We believe we need to review and evaluate our short and long term strategies. By asking ourselves where we are and where we want to go, in this sense we have implemented major changes in our business by adding more resources, machineries and people, focusing on the market needs and trends, a branding campaign to re-introduce ourselves to the market with a fresher and younger look, at the same time maintaining our high quality standards. At UNIVEST, we produce all kind of decorative and industrial coatings, meeting an ever increasing market demand. We are a 100% Saudi company; we have social obligations to our employees and our environment through our paint academy and various training programs. We invest in people and products. We are indeed investing for the future.</p><h4>How is the competition in Saudi Arabia for UNIVEST and what sets you apart in the market? </h4><p>The Saudi market is a dynamic market that has lots of major local and international players, particularly in the decorative paints sector. We see ourselves among the top five paint brands in the country as we are 100% Saudi with international quality standard paints and great services, and our market share is growing. We have been known since our establishment by the quality of our products and our team of experts in paints, which cover the entire country. In 2015 as the market faced a big challenge due to the fall in oil prices, we started mapping out a three year strategy, adding new resources and more infrastructure, which helped us maintain our market share. At UNIVEST we believe we are on the right track, what sets us apart from competitors are two words: quality and service.</p><h4>What are some of your specialized applications and products in terms of R&amp;D? </h4><p>R&amp;D is our main key factor of success. UNIVEST pays much attention to renewing and re-equipping its lab and hiring talented R&amp;D chemists, operating with latest ideas and technologies in eco-friendly paints, leed-free coatings, anti-bacterial paints, kids paints, magnetic paints, and more. Our R&amp;D team is developing new interior and exterior special effect products and we are aiming to launch them before the year end. </p><h4>How do you tailor your products to up-and-coming industrial projects in the country? </h4><p>Our R&amp;D experts are working under a clear umbrella strategy for developing our existing products, identifying needs for new applications that serve the industrial business segments. We specialize in adhesives, wood, metal paints, can and coil coatings, and many other products that serve the industrial sector. As for the new projects, we tailor all the required and needed products for new projects as per the specs required. We have the flexibility and capacity to do so. In this regard, the cycle to introduce, launch or modify any product goes through a long and complicated process of various tests; heat, dust, wind, and sand as per our own standards and specifications and keeping in mind the fluctuations in weather to meet our clients' and consumers' requirements. Quality is the name of the game. </p><h4>What are you expecting from 2017? </h4><p>I am always optimistic. The company is moving forward and focusing on training, launching new products and overall benefiting from the healthy business environment in the Saudi market. UNIVEST is a Saudi company proudly working within Vision 2030 outlines which paves the way for new investments. It is a strong and healthy economy and we have to be ready. There will be huge competition, which is healthy for any economy's growth and customer service, and we are ready to compete and face the challenges. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NATPET began as a distinguished producer with key advantages in the sector. What is the background to your growth and diversification?</h4><p>We specialize in the production of polypropylene. We chose this particular polymer product because there is high demand for it around the world—close to 62 million tons per year. Additionally, annual growth in demand is around 4%, or an additional 2.5 million tons per annum. This product goes into industries like car manufacturing, construction, packaging, food packaging, health and home appliances, and more. It is a versatile product that is in high demand. Although NATPET was only commercially operational toward mid-2010, we decided to go further downstream almost immediately—a sound strategy for a number of reasons. We no longer depend solely on a commodity product that would leave us open to price fluctuations caused by macroeconomic shifts. For example, our first joint venture is with a British listed company, Low and Bonar. Our product is geotextiles, which primarily go into infrastructure projects like roads, rail, buildings, airports, seaports, and more. We also went into partnership with an American company, A. Schulman, a significant player in the field of polypropylene compounding. The process makes our product useable in many different applications such as cars and home appliances. This project is under construction and will be operational by 3Q2017. The other reason we went downstream was to meet the government's objective of diversifying income, adding value, and creating more employment opportunities for Saudi nationals. Moreover, we recently invested USD15 million in an American company, Siluria Technologies, which is working on new technologies to produce petrochemicals. For a company of our size and a short history of seven years, this is a major step forward. It shows that we are thinking of the future and taking early steps to benefit from the technological developments happening in our field.</p><h4>Chinese consumption has slowed in recent months. Has that trend or other macroeconomic changes affected your business?</h4><p>We sell to 70 countries per year on average. That protects us from any economic issues with one specific country, like China, or region, like Europe. However, we are not fully protected; when China sneezes everybody gets a cold. When it started to have problems last year with lower GDP growth, the effect on us and everyone else was clear. Less demand in the Chinese market means products will be diverted into other markets, reducing everyone's margins. We have seen that the world is not only volatile in geopolitics, but also in economics. Europe has low GDP growth, China's growth is lower than earlier years, and many emerging markets are facing problems as well. </p><h4>What is your outlook for next year, and what are your plans?</h4><p>We have invested in two downstream ventures, an American company for new technologies, and are looking for other ideas. We are finding it difficult to invest in local expansion or new petrochemical projects due to the above reasons. Our Saudization rate is 60%, which is excellent for a company such as ours. We are also engaged in social programs, and have won the King Khalid Foundation award four times. We are proud of what we do for society. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Is there an awareness of the importance of integrating tech into business here, and how are companies embracing the changes that technology brings?</h4><p>The maturity of the market is clear to all vendors, which is why people have started investing here. The majority of businesses have realized that without technology, without digitalization across their operations, it would be difficult to sustain and continue growing in this market. Therefore, we are no longer trying to educate the market on the importance of technology; we are now talking about how to acquire and adapt technology and how to utilize it to the maximum benefit of an organization. There is a clear connection now between technology, transformation, and economic diversification; the digital economy is in a mature stage in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What are some government projects you are working on with the public sector?</h4><p>We are working on many. We have projects with the General Authority of Zakat and Income Tax, among others. What is key is that we have a vision for this market and a plan for the next 10 years. This market will continue growing in digital, since the issue is not growth but how to build capabilities that benefit the economy and put the right investments on the ground. We realized that the government would like to leverage SAP solutions; however, it needs to have it in the country. It is not willing to put critical data outside the country. We understand we have the best solutions, but need to be localized to work best for the government. When the government makes a decision about certain processes it does not need somebody to come and do it for it; it wants that solution to be created here. </p><h4>Are you pursuing projects in the healthcare or education sectors?</h4><p>When it comes to healthcare, the government is trying to bring the expertise and productivity of the private sector into public-private partnerships. The regulation and supervision of that sector and of complex partnerships could not happen without digitalization or companies such as ours. We are moving in the right direction and gaining ground in the sector because we come with experience from other markets and are helping to build these partnerships between the public and private sectors. This will save the government a lot of money, without losing business there. In fact, healthcare was one of the best sectors for us in 2016. Regarding the education sector, while there were not many initiatives from the government in this sector last year, we see strong potential. There were initiatives in private sector education, and hopefully the partnership between private and public sectors can also happen for education in the way it did for healthcare. </p><h4>What are your goals for 2017?</h4><p>We have already made the investments that will fuel the next phase of growth. We have created a full-fledged digital hub, a big investment from our side. We started last year with cloud services for STC, which now provides SAP solutions to businesses through its platform. We need to shift our capabilities to the next level in 2017. We anticipate more growth and more leveraging of digital, and are investing as such. We are making major investments this year to build this hub, train people, and make it ready for the government to leverage. We will also be building our investment into a more global hub, which will serve not only the country, but the Middle East and Africa as well. So, we need to keep up the activity and build capabilities that allow the Kingdom to meet these rapid changes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 4Q2016, 242 new projects were launched by the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. What impact will these have on the Jubail Industrial City and the development of the city?</h4><p>The 242 new projects were related to oil and gas by Saudi Aramco; petrochemicals by Aramco JVs, SABIC, and the private sector; minerals by Ma'aden; and supporting infrastructure development led by the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu in collaboration with the private sector. They include the Satorp refinery and the Sadara petrochemical project, the largest integrated chemicals complex in the world to be built in one phase and with a production capacity of more than 3 million annual tons of various plastics and specialty chemical products. This will be beneficial in terms of added value and employment for the local and national economy. Other projects are the King Salman International Complex for Maritime Industries &amp; Services in Ras Al-Khair and the Saudi Railway company's North-South Railway project to help Ma'aden move phosphate and Ma'aden Aluminum to deliver phosphate and bauxite ore from mines in the north to manufacturing areas in Ras Al-Khair. Each of them represents a positive development with huge economic impact.</p><h4>How will Vision 2030 transform the industrial city? </h4><p>Vision 2030 is built on three themes: a vibrant society, a thriving economy, and an ambitious nation. This has provided a methodology and roadmap for economic development action for the Kingdom, identifying general directions, policies, goals, and objectives. The public, private, and non-profit sectors are given strategic objectives, targets, and indicators to be achieved through developing their initiatives, which emphasizes partnerships with the private sector and maximizes local content, job creation, and the digital transformation of IT infrastructure. From its very inception, RCJY has taken the lead role in contributing to the local and national economic and social development through its integrated industrial and community development of new industrial cities with active government support. It has attracted private sector participation in a range of industrial and community development areas. The RCJY industrial cities are well geared through its established strategic and integrated master planning and project planning processes in implementing successive National Development Plans for the diversification of the economy through petrochemicals and minerals. We are therefore able to align most of our ongoing project initiatives with Vision 2030 and the National Transformational Programs. Although many of our strategic projects in the past were based on a build, operate, transfer (BOT) agreement basis, we are now actively studying other PPP options. </p><h4>What are your expectations for Jubal in 2017?</h4><p>In 2017, we are implementing projects for the National Transformational Program that include, among others, the city center, Jubail airport commercial operations, the development of community areas for Jubail and Ras Al-Khair, the further development of downstream industries and the logistics area, the consolidation of asset management practices, environmental protection areas, crisis management, and the development of security systems. All these projects are important for creating a sustainable city. For the city center and Jubail airport projects, we are considering PPPs. We are also completing our studies for some of these projects for phased development, while for others the primary infrastructure is being laid. For example, the airport project will be a phased development; the first will be for private aircraft, the second for cargo, and the third will be for the public. The target for completing the airport development through PPP will be 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the biggest changes and projects from the past few years?</h4><p>When we started in Yanbu 40 years ago, this area was a desert. The city has grown rapidly and continues to expand, all the while providing excellent investment opportunities in numerous industrial sectors and becoming a globally recognized industrial and business center located on the coast of the scenic Red Sea in Saudi Arabia. The Royal Commission at Yanbu has gone through major transformation phases over the last 40 years, moving from infrastructure developer to a comprehensive city management business model focusing on strategic partnerships with our partners and promoting industrial development and diversification. The mission of the Royal Commission at Yanbu is to plan, promote, develop, and manage our city. Over the past five years, we have been focusing on developing a specialized industrial city for strategic downstream industries or clusters that complete the Kingdom value chain, increase our finished product exports, and create more jobs for Saudis. </p><h4>Where do your efforts stand to bolster your logistic capabilities?</h4><p>One of Saudi Vision 2030's goals is to raise our global ranking in the Logistics Performance Index from 49 to 25 and ensure the Kingdom is a regional leader. This is because Saudi Arabia is right at the crossroads of important international trade routes between Asia, Europe, and Africa. To achieve this goal, one of the Royal Commission's initiatives in the National Transformation Program 2020 is the development of a multi-modal logistics hub in Yanbu Industrial City. Our Economic Plan 2030 defined this initiative in 2012. That project by itself is a huge project for the city with a total area of 75sqkm. The Royal Commission at Yanbu has completed the feasibility, conceptual, and detailed designs and started the construction work for this project in late 2016. The objective of the multi-modal logistics hub is to provide outstanding logistical services to our investors by rail, air, and sea. The hub will provide world-class customer service through safe, reliable, and efficient logistics services that link our city with regional and global ones. The project has many components, including a rail link, storage, shared tank farms, a minerals hub, and special economic zones. All these components will help in optimizing the supply chain for investors and promoting new investments in the Kingdom. To support this, Yanbu Industrial College is establishing a national logistics center of excellence to train employees to meet the challenges facing the movement, storage, and supply of goods. The center of excellence in logistics will position Yanbu as a hub for industry-driven transport, distribution, and logistics commercialization and help build a national reputation for Yanbu as a location for logistics service providers entering the Kingdom. It will also serve as a center to fast-track innovation in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What are your ambitions for the year ahead?</h4><p>We will have major projects worth over SAR10 billion in the coming years. This includes industry, education, and the development of community services such as hotels, housing complexes, and recreational facilities. Projects focused on industry and housing will be the bulk of our work next year. We will also launch our smart city initiative. It is a project that we started three years ago, and now we have the base for launching it. Soon we will have a major celebration as the first smart city in Saudi Arabia, and one of the world's first industrial cities to do so. Completing these projects, providing customer-focused service programs, and closing partnerships with stakeholders will help us achieve these goals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the ministry encourage the privatization in the Saudi transport sector?</h4><p>The participation of local and foreign investors in the ownership and management of the transport sector is a major objective in the Saudi Vision 2030, and the ministry is currently working, on several levels, to achieve this goal with the following steps: first, review and develop the existing regulations and legislation to provide a suitable legislative environment for investment; and second, restructure various transport sector entities (roads, airports, ports, railways) to be organizationally ready to implement legislation and controls based on best international practices. In this context, aviation, ports, and railways sectors have been corporatized, applying all corporate governance requirements to commercially manage all the transport operations and led by professional executives and independent boards. These companies will be subsequently offered to local and international investors soon. The ministry also seeks to establish workshops and introductory meetings with contractors, engineering offices, and universities to present the direction of the ministry and take their comments in the development of systems, procedures, and privatization programs.</p><h4>2017 is expected to be an important year to work on major Saudi railways initiatives, including the GCC railways and Al-Haramain express line. What are the ministry's expectations for these projects and their importance in connecting the Kingdom's regions?</h4><p>Roads have connected the GCC countries for a long time. Currently, there are no such projects within the ministry's plan for the coming years. Yet, The Ministry of Transport is responsible for maintaining the roads within the Saudi borders. Concerning the connection between GCC countries via railways, specialized international companies and expert offices have been commissioned to carry out studies. Moreover, a financial and technical committee has been formed to present the detailed studies and recommendations for developments and implementation. The studies began to draw the project road map, specify the scope of work, and propose the timetable for each stage of the project. The initial studies show that the total length of these lines is about 2,116km while the length of the line within the Saudi territory around 660km. Moreover, a global consulting firm completed the initial design, which is now under review. As for implementing the part within the Kingdom, the project will be launched soon and is expected to be completed by 2023. This project will lead to further economic integration among the GCC countries as well as social rapprochement. There are direct positive benefits of this project in facilitating trade between the GCC countries and the freedom of transport of its citizens and residents. Regarding Al-Haramain Express Train, it will be launched soon and will serve passengers, including Hajj pilgrims, connecting the Kingdom's two holy cities of Mecca and Medina via stations at the new airport in Jeddah and at King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh. This project will cut travel time between the two cities down to as little 2.5 hours, instead of more than four hours and will reduce pollution, traffic, and fuel consumption.</p><h4>Freight is a key element in the Saudi economy through its contribution to nearly 90% of total exports and imports. With the ongoing expansions at King Abdulaziz Port in Dammam and Jeddah Islamic Port, what is your vision of the role that this sector will play in achieving sustainable growth?</h4><p>Saudi Ports is the huge supporter of the Kingdom's economy, and all development or expansion projects implemented at ports are in the interest of the national economy. The ports' role in the upcoming phase will increase significantly, effectively contributing to the national transformation program and Vision 2030. In addition to the significant role of facilitating export and import operations, the Saudi Ports Authority seeks to achieve a significant transfer in management methods, operational performance, and productivity in line with the economic diversification of the Kingdom. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your client base and the core line of business?</h4><p>For SKFH, asset management and investment banking and private equity both are equally important to serve its client base. Our client base includes large and medium-sized financial institutions, family offices, large and medium-sized corporates, and retail clients. Kuwait Finance House is globally recognized for its sukuk services. We have many interests, but have decided to concentrate more on this area because of the current deficit and the need in the market for such finance. There is high demand for sukuk, not only in Saudi Arabia or the Middle East. It has also become a growing trend in the European market, in the UK or Luxembourg for instance. In Saudi Arabia, due to the high demand for finance in an alternative SME market, we are currently taking advantage of this opportunity and trying our best to earn the status of the leading company in this area. There are many new possibilities and assets up for sale at a great discount. Therefore, our task is to evaluate, see what area the client is interested in, and then make assessments.</p><h4>Which sectors do you expect to benefit the most from the ongoing reforms associated with Vision 2030?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is experiencing the largest economic transformation in the country's history in an attempt to reduce its reliance on oil. The Saudi government aims to raise more than USD100 billion in non-oil revenue a year by 2020, through measures including value-added taxation, as it seeks to balance the budget. Capital markets have a great role to play in the future economy. The diversification that is being promoted by the vision is empowering local entrepreneurs and investors to look toward the future and invest in it. As such, the experience and market knowhow, which companies such as SKFH possess, will prove vital. In terms of the sectors that could thrive the most in the coming years, this country is creating an opportunity for future health and education demand; hence, we are considering these sectors right now. Saudi Arabia has a great deal of interest in building more schools and healthcare facilities. More importantly, a large portion of this comes directly from the private sector, which is crucial as this means less expenditure for the government and makes this a great opportunity for the private sector to move in that direction and begin to take the lead.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company in the year ahead?</h4><p>The Saudi economy is going through challenging times due to massive economic transformation; however, we believe every challenge provides an opportunity, and we see many opportunities in the equity and debt capital markets of Saudi Arabia in the coming years. SKFH has not built in optimistic revenue targets for next two years but rather has developed a focused strategy for next three years and would look to improve operational efficiencies. SKFH would retain and source the right talent to implement its strategy. Right now, we are concentrating on our clients' needs, and do not expect to do much before 2018, which will certainly be a much better year for SKFH. There are many challenges ahead of us this year, as well as the next one. There will be more cost cutting and consolidation for efficiency. In spite of the fact that there are a great deal of opportunities to be seized, the present geopolitical and financial circumstances, including the oil prices and the US elections, affect the environment here, because we are overwhelmingly bound by the US dollar. Nevertheless, we see an optimistic future ahead. There are many favorable changes being made concerning the laws, which are supposed to encourage foreign investors to come to Saudi Arabia. Several things, including low stocks and low oil prices, should encourage international investors to come and make investments, and we will be there to guide them throughout. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins behind Saudi Aramco's IKTVA program, and how will it contribute to the long-term, sustainable development of the Kingdom's industrial sector?</h4><p>We identified a strategic need for a robust Saudi energy and industrial sector in order to capitalize on our true long-term value, but we knew it was critical that any solution was collaborative in nature with our international supply chain, the Saudi private sector, and of course the government. IKTVA is that solution—it drives key activities towards localization and job creation, by measuring the added value brought to the Kingdom by a supplier. The program was designed to positively change the way Saudi Aramco engages with its suppliers when procuring goods and services, targeting primary goals that will enable a sustainable economy, supply chain, and energy sector. Put simply, we will double the share of Saudi Aramco spend allocated to locally manufactured materials and services to reach 70% by 2021. Our forecast spend, approximately SAR1.4 trillion (USD373 million) over the next 10 years, for our goods and services is a huge opportunity for our suppliers and investors to capture. Our partnership with them will create the economic and industrial building blocks for the Saudi energy sector. It will also create hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs for talented young Saudi men and women over the long term. To meet the new demand for skilled manpower for drilling and oil field services as well as the professional and craft labor jobs required to build our facilities, we are establishing training centers and programs in collaboration with the related government entities. Across the Kingdom, we will have about 28 training centers targeting 360,000 graduates by 2030.</p><h4>To what extent does IKTVA's launch coincide with the drop in oil prices and, by extension, the government's diversification reforms under Vision 2030?</h4><p>IKTVA and its launch in 2015 was a long time in the works, developed in-house within Saudi Aramco. It would have gone ahead regardless of market dynamics. Shortly following the launch, the Kingdom made the announcement for Vision 2030 that provided much-needed focus and drive across the economy, and to which IKTVA is Saudi Aramco's premier contribution. Beyond the specifics of IKTVA, we have been preparing for several years with a keen focus on business sustainability. We have been laying the economic groundwork to facilitate and enable success for our supplier network and enable the success of IKTVA and the transformation of the Kingdom's economy to a more diversified industrial base. We have formed partnerships with training institutions, worked closely with government entities, and built industrial parks, value parks, and economic cities. We have done this to ensure that a high quality workforce is available; there is an investment-friendly landscape; and there are readymade hubs of economic activity for businesses to set up shops here in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What have been some of the key early indicators of IKTVA's success following the recent one-year commemoration of its launch, and what are your short-term objectives going forward?</h4><p>We marked the one-year anniversary with real progress and results. In December 2016, we celebrated by gathering more than 700 attendees of our local and international suppliers along with the government entities and officials in IKTVA Forum 2016. We are proud of what has been accomplished during the first year of the program. A major milestone of IKTVA was embedding it in our procurement process where all major procurements now include IKTVA targets, IKTVA proposals are required to be included in bid submissions, and business allocation guidelines have been revised to reward IKTVA achievements. To date, IKTVA has been embedded in approximately SAR60 billion (USD16 billion) worth of contracts. Alongside, we have boosted the share of materials procured from local manufacturers. We are proud of how much ground we have covered since the launch of IKTVA in 2016, and going forward in 2017, we will continue to work closely with our suppliers and stakeholders to increase our local spending. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2015, the Tadawul opened its doors to Qualified Foreign Investors (QFI's). How would you rate the success of this liberalization?</h4><p>The Saudi Capital Market is already the largest and most liquid stock market in the Middle East and North Africa, and the 22nd largest stock market (by market capitalization) of the 66 members of the World Federation of Exchanges. We have great ambitions for our market in the future and will embody the best global practices and the highest level of professionalism in everything we do. The opening of the market to QFIs in 2015 is one of a series of actions we have undertaken to integrate the Saudi equity market with global markets. As a first step in June 2015, the QFI framework was made available to the largest international funds. Subsequently, in September 2016 we extended eligibility to a much larger number of international investors. At the same time, we have relentlessly continued to develop new services and introduced new products, such as the T+2 settlement cycle, DVP settlement, securities borrowing and lending, and short selling. These changes will lead to stronger interest in the Saudi market from a broader range of international investors, which will gain further momentum from the eventual inclusion of Saudi Arabia into emerging market indices. </p><h4>Regulators and Tadawul officials have repeatedly stated their intention to join the MSCI Index of Emerging Markets. What systemic benefits would this bring? </h4><p>We are undertaking changes to the equity market primarily as part of the transformation and diversification of the economy and to support the growth and development of the private sector. We expect these changes will also lead to the Kingdom's inclusion in the MSCI Index of Emerging Markets, which would certainly bring many benefits, for example: global investable market indices will bring more exposure to the global investor community and coverage to the Saudi capital market; massive funds are benchmarked to tracking such indices, which will bring large capital inflow to the Saudi capital market; and interaction with global fund managers would reinforce the culture of adopting international best practices across the industry in Saudi Arabia. Higher disclosure requirements are in fact an advantage to both the market and overall economy. And these are determined by the Capital Market Authority (the CMA), not the index provider. We do not believe the potential MSCI EM Index inclusion would alienate family businesses from listing; in fact, it could be the exact opposite. </p><h4>How does Tadawul plan to translate Vision 2030 in terms of capital market development?</h4><p>Tadawul is dedicated to three key areas. The first is Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) transformation. We have designed a new FMI in order to open the capital market to more products and participants to the benefit of all stakeholders. The infrastructure will facilitate a clearing and depository cycle that will drive QFIs to increase their investment in Saudi capital markets. The transformation will be completed by 2019. The second area is the inclusion in top international indices. These indices allow the development of index-based asset management products and further increase foreign investment in the Kingdom. The Saudi Capital Market will get the exposure it needs. The third is raising awareness. There is a need to mature the market by enhancing the knowledge of its investors. The majority of participants, around 68%, are retail investors who bring liquidity and volatility to the market. To reduce this and ensure the market moves in a more efficient way, awareness campaigns and programs are being conducted on different levels. These programs will shed light on regulations and serve as tools to help shape a more sophisticated retail base. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[visionary-outlook]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The global outlook has improved due to the continued economic recovery of developed countries, in particular the US, driven by flexible financial policies and labor market growth.</h4><p>However, there are still challenges surrounding the prospects for global growth. Nevertheless, the Saudi economy has strong fundamentals, which include a GDP that has doubled over the last 10 years, the world's third-largest foreign currency reserves, a non-oil private sector that is considered a vital contributor to economic growth, and a low level of public debt, the lowest among the G20 countries. Combined, these factors help drive economic stability and reduce the negative effects of low oil prices. Saudi Arabia's fiscal policies have helped enhance financial stability and support economic growth. Maintaining the exchange rate policy has also contributed to rising confidence levels.</p><p>As part of its move to further strengthen the economy, the country delivers multiple programs to realize Vision 2030 that has taken into consideration the needs of all public and private sectors. In order to fully implement these programs, a comprehensive governance framework was required. In addition, a great focus was given to ensure the development of government agencies. The government of Saudi Arabia has recently undertaken structural fiscal reforms to strengthen the fiscal framework, diversify government revenue sources, and support the non-oil revenue sector, taking into account a potential impact on economic activity. Our government policies focus on increasing capital and operational spending efficiency. In addition to this, the government has developed a national program, called the Citizen's Account, in order to minimize the impact of these economic reforms on the cost of living and purchasing power, especially for low- and medium-income families.<br>In order to achieve the vision of creating a more prosperous economy for the country, the government announced 10 additional programs to support the National Transformation Program and Fiscal Balance Program 2020. The 10 new programs include a housing program, improving the lifestyle program, national champion program, national industry and logistics development program, Public Investment Fund (PIF) program, strategic, financial sector development program, and a privatization program, all elements that will make it possible to realize the goals of Vision 2030.</p><p>In addition, the government has adopted more than 150 initiatives to boost efficiency in CAPEX and OPEX spending across the ministries of health, education, municipal, and rural affairs.</p><p>At the same time, the country's fiscal policy focuses on diversifying the sources of public financing and achieving the highest levels of transparency. It also embraces best practices in the preparation and implementation of the budget and in corporate governance by taking into account the potential repercussions of new fiscal policies, especially the level of employment, inflation, and the growth of economic activities locally. In this year's budget, the government has allocated more than SAR40 billion (USD10.7 billion) to be spent on national transformation-related initiatives, and has allocated an additional SAR220 billion (USD58.6 billion) to be spent on national transformation initiatives over the next three years.</p><p>In order to ensure a more active role of the private sector in supporting economic activity and creating job opportunities, especially during the implementation period of the initiatives designed to increase non-oil revenues, a SAR200 billion (USD53.3 billion) stimulus package was put in place and will be rolled out over four years. With the needed private sector involvement in deciding the appropriate set of stimulation initiatives, a series of workshops with private sector representatives have been organized, which will conclude within six weeks, and the results of these workshops will be announced by end of 2Q2017. Government policies will focus on enacting legislation to promote private sector growth, support the development of local content, provide more investment opportunities to attract FDI, raise labor market efficiency and create more job opportunities, improve the private sector investment environment, and support Saudi companies' competitiveness in domestic and international markets. The ministry's strategy aims to position Saudi Arabia among the world's largest 15 economies by 2030. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major operational achievements of SWCC over the past three months?</h4><p>SWCC continues to fulfill its strategic obligation to meet the demands placed upon it as the largest producer of desalinated water in the world. In doing so, we have worked on improving our core capabilities through executing a number of initiatives and programs related to enhancing our operational capabilities accompanied by developing the capabilities and performance of our workforce. Recently, we have revamped our strategic workforce plan to ensure its alignment with our cooperate strategy and be able to anticipate our surplus/demand of required manpower, thus redeploying and recruiting our workforce in an effective and productive manner that ensures the sustainability of operations. Furthermore, tracking the cooperate performance through the SWCC Performance Management System has enabled us to better identify and diagnose weak areas and issues, thus taking proactive decisions that lead to enhancing our operational performance and productivity. In addition, one of the major achievements over the past three months has been the launch of the Ras Al-Khair desalination plant by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman in November 2016. Located in the Ras Al Khair Industrial City, 75km northwest of Aljubail, the desalination plant will supply Riyadh and the surrounding provinces using both the Multi Stage Flash (MSF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies. As noted in the Guinness Book of Records, Ras Al Khair constitutes the world's largest dual-purpose plant with a capacity to produce 1.025 million cbm of potable water per day and 2,400MW of electricity. The megaproject represents a significant step forward in line with Saudi Vision 2030.</p><h4>The company has outlined plans to undergo full-scale privatization as it looks to double production capacity over the next 15 years. Why is it such a crucial time for SWCC to expand its scope, and how do you expect privatization to impact your long-term capabilities?</h4><p>The privatization program represents a significant opportunity for the evolution of the water sector and opens the door for improving efficiency, eliminating current headwinds, monitoring operational key indicators, and increasing the flexibility of SWCC plants. As part of the privatization, investment opportunities will arise for building new desalination plants.</p><h4>How has interest from foreign investors been in terms of the local water sector?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is located in one of the world's most arid regions characterized by low rainfall and high evaporation rates. As a result, desalination represents the major source of potable water in Saudi Arabia with rapid demand growth driven by the rising needs of the population. This in turn explains why future investments in water desalination are so attractive to the private sector. In an effort to promote and facilitate investment opportunities in the Kingdom, SWCC organized The Water Investment Forum 2016, which successfully took place recently and was attended by investors and key national and global water players. It has become clear that foreign investors understand both the rationale and investment opportunity for the development of these essential resources throughout the Kingdom. The opportunities are exemplified by key success stories in the sector including the construction and operation of Shoaiba Phase III and Shuqaiq Phase II, which together represent the potential for the private sector.</p><h4>In what ways do you expect the local water industry to contribute to the government's Vision 2030 reforms?</h4><p>Currently, the private sector contributes less than 40% of GDP in Saudi Arabia. One of the key aims of Vision 2030 is to increase the private-sector contribution to the Saudi economy through the privatization of some government services and entities. To increase the role of the private sector in the economy, the privatization program will help to facilitate investment, encourage innovation, and introduce healthy competition. Water sector infrastructure investment and sustainability are key to achieving Vision 2030 and the government's role will transition from being focused on providing services to concentrating on monitoring and regulation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for electricity prices?</h4><p>In the past, due to the government's financial capabilities, subsidies were put in place for the prices of electricity to support consumers. However, due to the decline of oil prices in the last two years, the funding of power projects has become a serious issue again, and tariffs need to be revised and increased to prepare the sector for privatization. The government policy as a part of the Vision 2030 is to gradually remove subsidies to the sectors until 2020. In 2016, there was a reasonable increase in electricity prices, and that was the first review of the tariff during the last 15 years for the residential sector. Moving forward subsidies should only be given to the fraction of the population that truly need them. All these changes seek to improve the use of natural resources, increase power generation efficiency, and adjust the habits of consumers to be less wasteful, as well as make the sector more attractive to investors from the private sector.</p><h4>You are also the Chairman of the Saudi Electricity Company, and the company seeks to move to privatize by the end of the year. What steps will you take in that direction?</h4><p>Privatization of the power sector is not a decision of the Saudi Electricity Company; it is the decision of the government as per 2030 vision. Around 20 years ago, the first steps were taken in this direction; however, due to number of obstacles it could not be carried out. The serious intention of the government to privatize many utilities or services has reignited the process. It is now under evaluation; a final decision has not been made yet. However, the government's objectives have been laid out clearly. The first steps would be to sell the existing generation assets to investors. In the past our experiences with the private sector in power generation was good and successful. So far, we already have a significant contribution to power generation coming from the private sector. The ultimate objective for the future is to leave all power generation, either conventional or renewable, to the private sector. However, the final decision about that is not yet clear. The general intention is to proceed seriously, and to have first-phase power generation privatized and to sell up to 70% of generation assets within the next five years.</p><h4>What are the key priorities for your ministry over the next 12 months?</h4><p>We are focusing on the objectives of the national transformation program, in addition to our usual business plan. This includes expanding our operation to cover the whole country. We also focus on energy efficiency and improve the use of resources on both the supply and demand sides. We also proceed in localization of industries and services related to the power sector. On top of that, we want to propel the use of renewable energy. Developing the power market and improving connections to our neighboring countries is key as the long-term plan is to export electricity. The goal is to eventually improve electricity trading among the six GCC countries, which have one grid so far. In addition, we aim to link this group with other neighboring countries via a connection with Egypt, which will be in place in three years, and after that we can create a regional active power market. We also aim to eventually reach the European power market, which has a lot of potential. That way we can export our surplus, especially during wintertime in Europe. In addition, we could import from other markets during summer peak time. For renewable energy sources, it would also be encouraging to export energy to that market, because it is a priority of the European market to have a clean energy source. After Egypt, we plan to connect with the Turkish network, which will be our door to the European market, as it is already connected to the European grid. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the changes over the past year impacted your business?</h4><p>The reforms that took place during the last two years have, in a way, cleared the market that was sprawling with non-professional companies. The market is healthier now, because companies are more professional, providing healthier competition. For those who could survive the difficult past year-and-a-half, prospects are brighter. The government is also considering reduction of subsidies on water, electricity, and fuel and this will be done in a gradual manner over the next four to five years to enable the business community and general consumers to adapt to the new scenario. The government is also looking into increasing the privatization of the water sector, which will help in availability of larger funds allowing for an increase in the number of projects in this sector. This will encourage the entry of more local and international companies into the market. Local companies that often lack expertise and magnitude will have an opportunity to link up with international players.</p><h4>How have you done this?</h4><p>We started by having a joint venture with Suido Kiko Kaisha, Ltd. of Japan to create and improve our EPC capabilities. Our desalination-based private water utility, SAWACO, is expanding organically in Saudi Arabia and we are looking into opportunities outside of the country. However, the size of assets required for the privatization of the market is so huge that we need companies with a significant capital, as well as international and local exposure. We currently target the mid-size desalination market. We have, under our management, a capacity of 40,000cm/d but seek to increase this to 70,000-100,000 cm/d. Even this is considered mid-market but we are proceeding in this direction in a gradual manner. These assets are built on a BOO/ BOT basis.</p><h4>Do changes in the tariffs for consumers, such as subsidies, affect your operations?</h4><p>SAWACO is locked into long-term contracts with clients such as the ARAMCO and MODON. When there is an increase in diesel or power tariffs, it is not easy to pass on this increase to them because we have contracted with them for a fixed period. This puts pressure on us and takes time to convince our clients to agree to an increase in price. This does have a bearing on our profitability, but with time we can adjust the rates and maintain an acceptable level of profitability.</p><h4>Is SAWACO looking into renewable energy?</h4><p>SAWACO is interested in renewable energy and we are contemplating a couple of investments in solar energy. We are also looking at zero liquid discharge (ZLD) for all desalination plants where we can take the brine water and recover salt and sweet water from it. It is here that ZLD and solar energy find a place.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for 2017?</h4><p>It will not be an easy year but is expected to be much better than 2016. The challenges of limited spending exist, and may well persist until the end of this year. The market is getting healthier, and the remaining players are stronger and more capable. Moreover, the quality of projects open for bidding are high. From a realistic point of view, we are not going to see the lavish spending that we saw in 2013 and 2014; but the spending will be more focused because of more prudent considerations at government level. Serious companies will now have higher chances of securing projects than before. This is a positive outlook. Earlier, we used to have innumerable projects to bid for, but now we only have a few dozen projects for bidding. The quality of the projects and the quality of our competitors is better now than what we saw five years ago. The market is also in a clean-up mode and we can expect healthier competitive environment. Any correction or improvement in any market is painful at times, but the rewards are already starting to show. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Raydan is a fast-growing traditional food business in Saudi Arabia. How have you built your business?</h4><p>Raydan was founded in 1996 by Mansour Al-Sulami. The success story of Raydan is to provide smaller portion sizes of traditional Arabic food that is typically served in large quantities, such as a whole lamb or whole goat. These are the reasons behind our success: bringing single-portion meals to customers, ensuring it is cooked according to traditional methods, and guaranteeing freshness. We have almost 15 branches in Saudi Arabia and two branches in Egypt. We also have other concepts; we made an acquisition in 2014 of a confectionery business that produces Arabian sweets and chocolate in addition to providing catering services.</p><h4>What are your immediate expansion plans, and do they call for international growth?</h4><p>We already have a successful operation in Egypt. We determined all of the logistics and supply chain, and it generated excellent revenue until the currency fell. This will become a franchise in the coming months, thereby becoming an advantage. As a result of our performance in Egypt, we know we can replicate this elsewhere. We would like to expand to Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman, also via a franchise model. However, we first want to increase our presence in Saudi Arabia; we are currently only in Jeddah and Mecca. We have 11 branches in these two cities and also have several branches in Riyadh and Dammam. We will open one in Medina this year, two stores in Jeddah, and one more in Mecca. After 2019 we may open confectionary restaurants in Riyadh and Dammam. The market for such of food is in demand, and we are encouraged to have a wider menu to attract new people, such as children. One key thing is that our food is prepared fresh every day; nothing in the company is frozen at all. We have meat and chicken delivered fresh every day, ensuring we do not need to refrigerate for a long period.</p><h4>What market forces helped you to decide to list on the new parallel capital market for SMEs (Nomu)?</h4><p>We grew to the level and size required to go to Nomu, because the size of the company was almost SAR1 billion. The owner decided to separate the family from the management and install proper governance, and Nomu gave us the opportunity to do that. Growth cannot happen after a certain point with the same strategy and ideas as before. Last year we distributed a profit of SAR48 million. The growth of business continues as before, and we can still distribute more benefits to shareholders.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to move up to the main Tadawul market?</h4><p>Yes, that is the plan. The law states we cannot move until we complete two years in Nomu. After that we can upgrade to the first market if we meet the requirements. We are currently implementing a new ERP system that will help us collect information and be well organized. Good intelligence makes things easier and we are also working to change the corporate identity of the company, which is the Raydan logo. We will also change many aspects of the business, like having kids meals and signing agreements with religious tourism companies to increase our share during the Hajj season. We have prepared many things.</p><h4>What has been your experience with online delivery services?</h4><p>We had an agreement with Talabat.com and worked with it for almost six months. We have our own delivery service as well, and a fleet of 54 cars for delivery. It is a great practice as the sales and revenues have increased significantly from deliveries.</p><h4>What are your plans for the next 12 months and your expectations of the market in this time?</h4><p>We expect to grow more than the last two quarters as the worst is now over and we expect things to settle down. We plan to have the same performance by the end of the year as we had in 2016 because of the new branches that we will open and the new initiatives that we will take. The future will be positive as the government is investing money into the economy now. The number of Hajj pilgrims will also double in size, which will also benefit us. We expect business to pick up to 2015's figures. After that, depending on the performance of the company, we expect it to improve further. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the recent restructuring of the Ministry driven your transformation agenda?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia has witnessed the launch of Vision 2030, a program that aims to make the national economy more diversified, more lively, and capable of growth and sustainability. In the framework of this Vision, the restructuring of many government agencies has taken place, including the Ministry of Energy, Industry, and Mineral Resources, which has become a key driver of economy growth, particularly diversification. The Ministry now efficiently orchestrates the three critical components of domestic economy—energy, industry, and mineral resources. This restructuring has allowed us to launch new developments and improvements energetically and quickly, and a number of important tasks have been undertaken, like developing a roadmap for national industry and re-launching the mining and minerals sector through new strategies, while also restructuring the energy sector.</p><h4>How will the benefits of this economic growth and change be localized?</h4><p>Local production and participation is key, and developing local content in Saudi Arabia is a clear objective. Local content is a key constituent of Vision 2030, as is the development and training of national human resources. The third principle is the transfer of technology. We aim to make the country the source of cutting-edge technologies, and we have financed research centers like the King Abdulaziz University Center for Science and Technology and King Abdullah University Center for Science and Technology. We expect developers and strategic partners will invest with us in the field of scientific research. Based on what has been achieved here in innovations in various fields, we want Saudi Arabia to become a country that develops and exports advanced technologies in the field of renewable energy production in the medium term.</p><h4>What role will the expansion of the country's historic role as an energy provider play in the ministry's efforts to accelerate economic growth and promote diversification going forward?</h4><p>As part of our renewable energy strategy and the diversification of energy resources, which we aim to achieve, we will also seek the development and expansion of gas production in the Kingdom by 2020. This gas production will help to encourage industry as it can be used as a feedstock across a variety of petrochemical processes. We will also be launching a program to include nuclear energy over the next few years in order to have the best and most diverse mix of sustainable energy in the country. This program will contribute heavily to R&amp;D, as well as to various industrial sectors that will support it. The program for renewable energy includes the development and launch of a total of 60 projects that will be implemented over the next seven years, adding an estimated 9.5GW of electric energy produced from purely renewable sources by 2023, thereby bringing the share of renewable energy in the overall energy mix to 10% of total capacity of by 2023. This will help us attain our national goals for renewable energy and will be safeguarded and sustained by national commitments to protect the environment and contribute to the fight against global warming.</p><h4>What role will the private sector play in the expansion of energy production, and will it take a similar role in other sectors?</h4><p>As part of our goals for renewable energy in line with Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020, we have set ourselves the task of creating an attractive climate and environment for local and global investors so as to enhance confidence in our economy across all of its sectors. We are working to enhance the participation of the private sector by establishing electricity generation stations with strategic partners from the private sector. This will leverage the unique experience that Saudi Arabia has accrued after having proven its reliability and trustworthiness to investors. Needless to say, the private sector has proven to be capable and adept at establishing and operating these independent stations in the long term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main objectives and achievements of the Ministry of Commerce and Investment?</h4><p>In response to the current economic challenges, Saudi Arabia has taken several steps to enhance the power of the Saudi economy and increase its effectiveness. Therefore, a restructure within the Ministry of Commerce has been made to include the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) under MCI. Thus, the General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises was established to effectively contribute to the realization of the Kingdom's Vision 2030, taking into consideration a number of strategic objectives that include: ensuring fair trade between consumer and seller, creating consumer confidence with products sold in the market, raising the culture of entrepreneurship, increasing the contribution of SMEs to GDP, increasing job opportunities provided by SMEs, promoting and increasing consumer's awareness, and increasing the level of competitiveness of local products and services. In a joint effort with the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, the Ministry of Commerce and Investment has pledged to introduce a number of mechanisms to empower and support the role played by SMEs in the local economy.</p><h4>Which initiatives relating to the SME sector have you launched, and how will they impact the economic reforms of Vision 2030?</h4><p>Taking into consideration the importance of the SME sector as a major factor of the local economy, the General Authority of SMEs has been established, which aims to increase the contribution of small and medium enterprises to GDP, create job opportunities, and promote and support a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Accordingly, a number of initiatives has been launched to achieve the objectives of the Authority, such as introducing business accelerators and incubators and entrepreneurs centers, where these facilities are concerned with providing support and services to entrepreneurs and the emerging SMEs. Second, we are launching applications and services for the SMEs sector, thus supporting small and medium enterprises with various electronic programs designed specifically for SMEs, including offering and presenting opportunities, cloud e-services, training and consulting services, and a job platform. Third, we are encouraging an initiative that seeks to enhance the status of the commercial franchise in the country by introducing the franchise system, as well as helping the Saudi Franchise Association be successful, in addition to spreading the culture and awareness of the franchise among local investors. Fourth, we are enhancing the contribution of small and medium enterprises by facilitating the necessary procedures, so they are able to compete in the public and private sectors. Fifth, we are launching a SMEs Data Center initiative, which is a statistical database, representing the historical and current data and the future forecasts for the SMEs sector. We are also revamping financing services and the relevant solutions to support the SMEs sector by creating direct or indirect new financing sources.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Commerce and Investment expect the Saudi investment environment to change based on Vision 2030?</h4><p>In line with the Ministry of Commerce and Investment's mission to enhance the capabilities of the trade and investment sectors and protect the interests of the beneficiaries through the development and formulation of effective policies and implementing mechanisms that contribute to sustainable economic development, the Ministry of Commerce and Investment has set out 18 strategic objectives, which are: creating investment opportunities, enhancing competitiveness and the business environment, promoting foreign trade, guaranteeing fair trade, enhancing the productivity of the commercial sector, providing strategic goods and input, developing small and medium enterprises, supporting major large companies, developing investment companies, enhancing national infrastructure, developing and empowering chambers of commerce and industry, updating and promoting rules and regulations, promoting distinguished professional services, developing the capacity of manpower and human cadres within MCI, developing governance systems and improving the operation model relevant to MCI, updating and digitizing information technology and data analysis, supporting decision making, and strategizing internal and external communication. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How encouraged are you that a country like Saudi Arabia has committed to a major renewable energy initiative?</h4><p>This is of global significance and is clearly important for the country and its diversified economy of the future. It is also extremely important globally. The US and Saudi Arabia clearly have economies that are in different stages of evolution; however, we should not lose sight of the fact that both are energy powerhouses. The US is often viewed through the lens of continuing large oil imports, and that is true; we still import between 7 and 8 million barrels of oil per day. The reality is that we are but an enormous oil producer and an enormous gas producer as well as coal, uranium, and renewables. The transformations may look different in both countries but they are absolutely central for how the world will follow in this transformation. What the country is doing is just right in terms of preparing for the future and preparing the human resources that will be required. It is a great global stimulus as well. On the human capital side, I was involved in discussions with KACST and other institutions in Saudi Arabia before it was established. It is hard to imagine any other place with such a degree of progress that has been made in such a short amount of time.</p><h4>Is Saudi Arabia uniquely positioned to generate a significant portion of its energy from renewables?</h4><p>It is not a fair characterization to say that advancing renewables in the US has been difficult. Many states have adopted portfolio standards. In addition to the US, federally it is back and forth though we have tax incentives for wind and solar. We need to look at another factor that contributes to a great deal of the discussion, which is the fact that demand is not growing. When demand is not growing and we require the introduction of a certain amount of new generation, we are going directly against incumbent providers. In Saudi Arabia that factor will not be there. Demand is growing here and that is a different environment for introducing new technologies. Second, the government appears united in wanting to pursue this direction. There are many factors, including its commitments to Paris and other goals. Here there is also the feature that it is almost the anti-incumbency. The country would like to displace its current product for the export market. When all is said and done, it is the demand side in a certain sense that is the major difference in the two countries.</p><h4>Is it possible for Saudi Arabia to be in a position to generate a higher percentage of its overall energy from renewables than any country in the region?</h4><p>I do not know about the highest percentage. Germany is a different economy that has enormous wind penetration. There is also Spain, Portugal, and Denmark. There are many European countries in particular in that regard. China has aggressive targets as well. Here it is the issue of a major producing country taking this tack of dramatically changing the energy mix. That is not being done in a vacuum. The Kingdom sees this as an opportunity for the issue to build up a different domestic economy. The US and Saudi Arabia are different economies and yet we both have a jobs issue. In Saudi Arabia's case, it is a question of a growing young demographic that has to be educated and employed. No matter what, hydrocarbon demand growth will be challenged in a low carbon world, and in a world of demand management, of high efficiency vehicles, some electrification of vehicles, high efficiency construction, and others. It fits a dual purpose, including this idea of an economy that looks different in the future because this economy does not look like it will be a sustainable model for many decades. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Malaysia cooperating with the education sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We just signed an MoU with Saudi Arabia. We have a good relationship with its education minister and with the education sector at large. There is great potential in Malaysia because the country offers quality education at 30% of the cost of education in Europe, the US, and other countries. Looking at our ranking, it is easy to see why we are highly competitive. Our engineering programs are in the top 30 in the world. Other subjects keep improving. For the last two years we have continued to improve ourselves. It is a good opportunity. With Malaysia being a Muslim country, people from the GCC will feel comfortable there. It is friendly and safe. That is especially true for Saudis.</p><h4>What kind of increase of Saudi citizens coming to Malaysia do you anticipate?</h4><p>Next year we expect a significant increase in the number of Saudis coming to Malaysia for education, as well as Malaysians coming to Saudi Arabia. We share excellent curriculum on Islamic finance, for example. The quality of education is what we have to offer. More and more Saudis understand this, the minister understands this, and recognition was even given to us by King Salman when he was in Malaysia recently. He received two honorary doctorates from our universities. His trip will help to attract more students to Malaysian universities. In Islamic finance we have two excellent institutions. They are both highly ranked in Islamic finance. There is certainly scope to train more Islamic finance professionals between the Saudi and Malaysian systems. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What measures and strategies are in place in the event that the oil price drops below USD50?</h4><p>The voluntary production adjustment decisions taken last year by 24 participating countries in Vienna at the 171st Ministerial Conference and the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers were specifically focused on bringing forward the market, rebalancing, and accelerating the drawdown of the stock overhang to the five-year average. The collaborative and timely developments were taken to address the prevailing market realities, which should then lead to oil finding its equilibrium. In terms of volatility, all producers—in fact all consumers—would like to minimize price volatility. This is natural. What we need to recognize is that short-term price fluctuations caused by such issues as geopolitics, supply disruptions, economic developments, and weather are natural. While they are unavoidable, they are absolutely normal. It is clear we cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. However, it is important that we differentiate between such normal fluctuations and those that can be viewed as 'extreme.' Extreme price fluctuations are clearly not conducive to the effective functioning of the market, particularly given the long-term nature of investments in our industry.</p><h4>How has Saudi supported OPEC, and what role has it played as a role model for conformity with the landmark decisions taken last year?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is another key founding member of OPEC, and over the years it has been vital to OPEC's decision making processes and in helping the organization achieve its central objective of oil market stability. This was true in the consultations that led to the landmark decisions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC members in Vienna, and it has continued to play a leadership role in the implementation of these decisions in 2017. The country's conformity to its production adjustment has far exceeded 100% throughout the first quarter of 2017. I have met Khalid A. Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, and the 2017 OPEC Conference President on many occasions. His wise words, constant encouragement, and firm commitment to the OPEC and non-OPEC decisions taken in 2016 have been extremely welcome. Moreover, as Conference President, he is always looking to find positive solutions to any challenges the organization may face, and to work constructively with all the other member countries.</p><h4>How has Saudi Arabia's investment strategy in the local petrochemical and refining sectors developed, and how are these contributing to a healthier, value-added domestic energy market?</h4><p>Given Saudi Arabia has a production capacity of over 12 million bpd and vast crude oil reserves, it is obviously vital to look at ways and means to gain further value from them, beyond just exporting crude oil. On a visit to Saudi Aramco in February 2017, I was shown how the company continues to establish synergies between its upstream and downstream businesses by applying its creativity and cutting-edge science to transform its crude oil and gas resources into a multitude of useful products that benefit people around the world. Moreover, the developments are also creating opportunities for new businesses to spring up in Saudi Arabia to support these petrochemical developments and integration. The expansion of its refining and petrochemical business is also taking place at home and overseas. Alongside the large refinery complexes in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco also has refining and petrochemical joint ventures and interests in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and the US. In March 2017, the King of Saudi Arabia, HH Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, inked a number of new refining and petrochemical deals during a three-week tour to Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, and China. There is no doubt that the country, with Saudi Aramco taking the lead, views growth in this sector as vital to its long-term interests. These developments are also supportive of the Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 that aims to see the country become a major global investment destination, and to stimulate and diversify the country's economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were your takes from your most recent visit to Riyadh, and how do you hope it will contribute to a new era in Serbia-Saudi relations?</h4><p>The visit to Arabia was crowned by the meeting with HRH King Salman, with whom the possibility for Saudi Arabia to finance a joint infrastructure project of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina was discussed. Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina will come up with a concrete proposal of what kind of project it is going to be in order to jointly apply to the Saudi Fund for Development, where there are great chances to obtain funding for the project. It was also agreed to form a Joint Trilateral Committee, which will deal with the creation and monitoring of joint activities related to increasing trade exchange and the implementation of the Saudi investments in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the area of agriculture we agreed to organize a joint fair in Riyadh, where Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina will present their agricultural and food products as well as potentials in this sector. Construction companies from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were invited to participate in tenders in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, a successful business forum was held during this visit, organized by the Council of Saudi Chambers, which brought together more than 30 companies from three countries. In addition, the visit of tour operators from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in April this year was agreed with the host, HRH Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, President of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage, during which the tourist offers of the two countries will be presented at the Saudi Arabian market.</p><h4>With trade ties between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Serbia standing at a modest USD31 million for the previous year, which economic areas of cooperation will you look to strengthen in the years ahead?</h4><p>Although the volume of bilateral trade exchange between the Republic of Serbia and Saudi Arabia is still modest and much below its real potential, it should be noted that during the past few years it has been constantly increasing, and that in 2015 it reached USD54.3 million, which is twice as much as 2014. That year, due to a sudden increase in exports from Serbia (an increase of 493.2% compared to 2014), a trade surplus was recorded for the first time on our side. The growth trend continued last year, in 2016, with the total exchange reaching USD97.9 million, which is an increase of 79.6% on 2015. For us this is a great result, especially bearing in mind that our exports have increased by 30 times in last five years. In 2016, our exports increased by 132.4% as compared to 2015. Serbia is keen on further improving overall economic relations with Saudi Arabia. There are numerous possibilities for establishing cooperation in areas that are mutually identified as promising: trade, agriculture, tourism, health and education, participation in infrastructure projects, and military-economic cooperation.</p><h4>What is behind Serbia's strategy in the Middle East and what is your vision for Serbia's cooperation with the region going forward?</h4><p>Work on building contractual and legal framework of economic cooperation with Saudi Arabia started immediately after the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2013. The first agreement between two states, on cooperation in the field of tourism, was signed in Belgrade in 2015 during the visit of HRH Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. Agreements on economic and technical cooperation and on mutual enhancement and protection of investments are currently in the process of negotiation, as well as an MoU on cooperation in the field of ICT. Once completed, they will open a vast area for improving bilateral economic relations, currently taking place exclusively through the trade exchange while maintaining direct bilateral contacts between the two countries at the highest level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Sarepta created and what has been its operations since?</h4><p>Sarepta was created out of a love for my continent and my country, and to promote a different image of Africa to the Western world. The image of Nigeria and Nigerians abroad is not always positive, and changing this image is the passion behind creating the company. I always loved the idea of business and making money, but that philosophy changed when I realized that if I could help better the lives of others through offering gainful employment, the rewards of satisfied workforce/employees will lead to greater motivation and better business results which will bring with it the rewards of profit, eventually. We started by approaching state governments that had ideas for projects but did not execute them due to a lack of funds or had elephant projects that needed revamping. These included MROs, hospitals, or power plants that were not completely finished. I used my resources and contacts in the US, many of who were Nigerians who have lived in the US for a long time and were looking for places to invest. I wanted to make an FDI prospectus that would showcase information that is vital for any investor, foreign or domestic. Information like what were the investment opportunities for a region, what were the markets for these opportunities, associated cost, risk, profit, and return on investment, quantitative and qualitative data that can help a willing and savvy investor make a decision. To my amazement, there was little or no data on most of the projects not even on potential markets or profitability. I said we could do it as a service but governments did not have the funds. Therefore, I made a small foreign investment directory that I funded with the help of family members and banks. We received the capital we needed, and from that I established the other lines of businesses that we have today, which are the transport line, paint manufacturing plant and the construction company, which has since, through the acquisition of Massimo Saverio construction set up as an SPV that has been officially licensed by United Africa Company under its UPDC division as contractors and vendors for construction and our paints and doors, respectively. We are also to set to launch, through a deal with Root-Hub (a major player in this business line from the south looking to enter the western market in Lagos) an affordable office hub space of 25-30 capacity for consultants and entrepreneurs in search of a space where creativity can thrive, in a corporate setting, but don't necessarily have the finances to dole out for office spaces within Lagos. We accomplished all this through our ability to network with existing firms that are key players in their line of businesses.</p><h4>How do you act as a bridge between Nigeria and the international business community to promote Nigerian investment opportunities?</h4><p>The documentary details the resources in a particular region and explains exactly how profitable a project is and what the market is. We focused on oil and gas and agriculture, where the byproducts can be used to produce a variety of valuable oils petrochemicals. For example, we have rubber plantations all over the south, so we detailed how the trees can be converted into rubber, which can be used to make tires and every other kind of rubber based product that drives manufacturing in other parts of the world and is a big contributor to their GDP. We explain to investors who the off takers are, for example, with one project, Cameroon was going to buy over USD1 billion of palm kernel from Nigeria just to receive the oil extract. I showed that setting up a factory is much cheaper in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world and here there is direct access to all the raw materials needed.</p><h4>Where would you advise investors to put their money into in Nigeria?</h4><p>I would direct them to agriculture. I wish oil in Nigeria was never discovered because it ruined our business models for everything. The UAE invested its oil revenues. Nigeria thought the cash cow was never going to stop delivering, but it is. Even if prices go up slightly in a few years' time, everyone will still be looking for alternative sources of energy. Agriculture is our most untapped and most valuable resource because from north to the south and east to the west there is something we can grow, mass produce, and export, which we are not doing. Before oil, we were exporting peanuts, and the Naira and dollar were one to one. It can sometimes take longer to realize the returns on investment, for example with livestock, but not if there is a plantation that has fully matured palm fruits, coconuts, or rubber trees. Cassava is an example from which the extract is used to make spirits, which Nigeria imports for its hospitals and retail; we can make enough in just my state to supply the whole of Nigeria, Cameroon, and neighboring countries.</p><h4>How would you describe the ease of doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>We are ranked by the World Bank as 162nd in terms of ease of doing business, which highlights the big problem of attracting foreigners to invest in our resources. To incorporate this company, we had to repeat several processes several times. In the US it took me one day, online. The government needs to improve the process of supporting entrepreneurs. The biggest resource in Nigeria is human capital, as we are a truly a country with an entrepreneurial spirit. On the other hand, however, starting a business does not necessarily favor entrepreneurship. The government needs to streamline the process of starting a business with a portal where a viable business can be registered online and then inspected. Our problem is not necessarily corruption but accountability. There is corruption everywhere in the world but when someone is given a task to do and they know they are accountable and responsible then they have to do it. If we want foreign and domestic investment we have to make the process less complex, in line with global trends.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2018? </h4><p>I am optimistic. I hope our President gets better so he can continue to fight corruption, and I am looking forward to the benefits. We are looking to see the dollar fall some more in a positive sense to get a stronger Naira (to ease the stress on Nigerians doing business in Nigeria, but also to level the playing field for being able to attract foreign investment without the stain arbitrage), and I am looking to see unnecessary tariffs, taxes, and bans being lifted on certain items and goods that help people make business possible in Nigeria. Some more reform for the banking sector and more fiscal policy that regulates the banking sector in an astute manner. Peace and stability is another important issue, as the feeling of security and safety needs to be restored to present Nigeria as a secure environment where business can thrive. I want to see more emphasis on the education sector as that drives not just entrepreneurship and business, but will lead the nation towards greater achievements in all facets that make up a strong nation and economy like; healthcare, science, research, and development and most importantly good and efficient governance. People in the most remote regions need to be able to have access to a standard and well-rounded education. In business terms, I hope for the simplifying of processes that are costly for businesses, from SME's to major corporations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Costa Rica for the company globally?</h4><p>We were recently acquired by ICU Medical. This means we are no longer part of Pfizer and are now one of the largest pure play companies in the Infusion Therapy business. In this facility, we manufacture dedicated sets, gravity sets, accessories, as well as several infusion pumps. From the Costa Rica site we supply all the world market requirements related to pumps and its sets, which makes this facility a very critical and important asset to the corporation. We also have operations in Mexico and Salt Lake City that are focused on the non-dedicated portion of sets, as well as many other monitoring and oncology products that are key to the company's portfolio.</p><h4>Where do you export your products?</h4><p>We export all over the world. We have different distribution centers in Europe, the Middle East Asia Pacific Latin America, the US, Canada and Australia. We are 100% compliant with all the regulations in all the countries we export. We compete across the entire world in terms of different geographic locations and free trade zones benefits, among many other things. We are extremely fortunate to have found a place that has the people with the required academic skills to develop this business. We are allowed to sell some of our production in the domestic market, but it is small compared to our biggest market, which is the US.</p><h4>Do you have any partnerships with universities to foster people?</h4><p>We do, though not officially; we are in close contact with students who want to work part-time and learn. We fully support such programs and they have become a great source of talent.</p><h4>What is the profile of your clients?</h4><p>This is a manufacturing facility and we supply the requirements to our own commercial organizations. In general, our customers are hospitals. These are whom we sell our products to, even though we make products that impact specific patients across the world and that is how we see it in our culture across the organization.</p><h4>What innovation strategies are being implemented in Costa Rica?</h4><p>In our world, especially in manufacturing, companies have to improve every year. We have programs to innovate and pursue continuous improvement. That is present in everything that we do and every year we are better than the year before. A great deal of innovation comes from our headquarters, although we have our own R&amp;D On Market Department here considering what the next step will be. We have many brainstorming sessions and are open to receiving ideas from our employees. Quality is also something that is very important as a main driver of growth. Once the entire workforce understands that all ideas are welcome to improve the quality, there is a side effect and we see the other financial benefits and processes flow.</p><h4>Medical devices production is one of the main exports of the country. What has made this sector so important for Costa Rica?</h4><p>We have experienced a form of domino effect in the last few years. Costa Rica has grown a great deal in attracting FDI, though in a strategic way. Costa Rica has an environment that has become a little more expensive and a company truly has to fight its battles to find its value added processes. The medical industry is perfect for that because companies can always bring more complex processes and products, which is our case, where we have in sourced the vast majority of our components. In addition, in Costa Rica there is not much investment anymore in simple assembly processes. The country is capable to carry out complex processes and extremely complex technology. We have the medical sector doing a great deal of R&amp;D; however, if we look at the profile of the country, we have to keep bringing higher technology products to survive long term.</p><h4>How do you stand out from your competitors?</h4><p>Our product is seen as one of the best infusion system pump in the world. There are many things that point to the fact that we are focused on quality and that is paying off. Compared to other products out there, we have customers saying they are extremely satisfied with ours.</p><h4>How do you see innovation focusing on new advances in terms of the exchange of information?</h4><p>We are excellent at that; this is why our products are seen as one of the best. We gather data in terms of wireless capabilities and drug libraries. We have a safety-focused software process for pumps and all the data is one of the many key assets that our customers get. That reflects in the medication errors that are significantly reduced in our systems. In addition, this is the time of being competitive in terms of getting into the technology era of computer systems. We monitor many things and have a large number of controls to guarantee the quality of the product.</p><h4>Regarding 2018, what plans or challenges do you have in terms of new products and growth?</h4><p>Next year will be an excellent year for us. We are starting with a new company and are revamping all our portfolio and logistic strategy as we are no longer part of Pfizer. Besides, there are several production lines that we are bringing from another facility. It will be very positive in terms of growth. We will bring in many people to do this. It is an interesting growth and we are being able to forecast a profitable year. We are aligned with the new strategy and vision of ICU Medical as a pure play company, which is all related to being the best in the infusion systems world. That gives us a great deal of focus to be the excellent in what we do.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[70% of young academicians complete postgraduate training in Canada]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[prof-mahmoud-shaheen-al-ahwal-dean-faculty-medicine-king-abdulaziz-university]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You are the head of the Medical section of King Abdulaziz University. How has this part of the University's work grown in significance relative to its overall mission?</h4><p>I joined the medical faculty in 1977, two years after it was founded. I have been with the college since the beginning. We used to rely on traditional curricula as our method of education and we used to have a well-known, world-class teaching staff, most of which came from outside of Saudi Arabia. At that time, the university hospital had only 250 beds and a basic layout and structure. However, the level of training was outstanding and the services provided were excellent. Since I returned to the Kingdom in 1992, we have not stopped developing. We went from an academic staff of around 50 to more than 400, and we have assistant, associate, and full professorships in all specialties and subspecialties. We send 70% of our young academicians to Canada to complete their post-graduate training, 20% to the US, and 10% to Europe and local programs.</p><h4>The university has become a leader in medical research, and has also been accredited to a high standard. How was this achieved?</h4><p>We have indeed become a leader in research, education, and community service. KAU was recently ranked 222 worldwide and number 1 out of Arab universities by The Times Higher Education. When I started, we had 50 academic publications a year, but now we are publishing an article nearly every day. Last year we had 472 academic articles published in peer-reviewed journals. We published in Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine, among others. We were the first to document the movement of Corona virus from camels to humans, a major landmark in understanding the mode of transmission of that epidemic. Previously, only 1% of students published papers before graduation, and now that number has risen to 26%. This is due to more commitment on part of the teachers and greater incentives. The more professors publish, the greater their chances of continued professional success. I am also proud of the fact that our faculty's articles have an acceptance rate 100% higher than any other university in Saudi Arabia at North American Journals. My students are experts at research. I was eager to support this aspect of the university and thanks to the great support of and dedication of my vice-deans and department chairs, we have been very successful. We created a roadmap, and followed it. The other achievement that I am proud of, on the hospital side, is our Diamond level of accreditation from Canada International. We have also achieved JCI accreditation, which we are proud of. We also have institutional accreditation from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Canada, and we are the first hospital in the Middle East to achieve this. We consider accreditation a tool, not an end in itself. It is a process that allows us to maintain the quality of care and service we are proud of. This is the key component of accreditation. It also has substantial benefits for our students because it allows them to be trained according to the most rigorous standards and procedures. This prepares all of our staff to work with any North American hospital.</p><h4>What role does technology and innovation play in your delivery of healthcare? The Ministry of Health has a sweeping plan to integrate more technology into the sector.</h4><p>Technology and education go hand in hand. Technology has allowed us to achieve our goals much more quickly. Many new techniques and practices in medicine rely on advanced technology and we are dedicated to staying at the forefront of the field. Our health information system is called Phoenix, and we built it locally with the help of Al Enayah. We continue to develop and modify this program to make it fit our needs. We are planning on developing a new program with the support of the university and Jeddah Valley Company, and this program will give us mobile capabilities. We are particularly proud of how advanced and effective our materials management system is at the University Hospital, and how it has allowed us to substantially reduce waste. The Ministry of Health really appreciates the system we have in place, and it is interested in how many resources it allows us to save. By ensuring that medicine and tools have not expired, we can save 20-30% of our operating budget. Technology allows us to do this, and digitalization is the key to long-term success. Per our suggestion, the Ministry of Health is working hard to implement nation-wide electronic medical records. This will increase nation-wide medical systems and allow us to improve our primary care on a national scale.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the plan to privatize the medical and education sectors in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Privatization had been a major question, and I have been consulting with the government on how best to implement it. Honestly, there are a great many things that need to be completed before privatization can begin. The lack of an electronic medical records system is an example of where we need to go. The ICD coding system for diseases for the entire country is also not well developed. Privatization may help. We partnered with the government not long ago to run a government hospital that was unable to operate due to staffing shortages. It was a win-win because we were able to provide doctors and proper procedures while they provided nurses. This model was successful, and the hospital has been running successfully for over a year. We went from 150 to 300 beds and have been trying to export this model to other hospitals. In terms of insurance, a lot of work still needs to be done. We need to create the system while also ensuring that the quality of services does not decline.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2017?</h4><p>We believe that the government and the university are on the right track. The government will be able to align society in the proper way, creating a self-sufficient system. We have to recognize that oil will not remain the core of the economy, and we need to determine the next step. Everyone needs to be thinking about the long-term. Those who saw that the economy and the society needed to change are in a much better place than those who refused to see it. From the college's perspective, we have started to think about business. In fact, we will be meeting today on how to leverage the medical facilities to increase revenues. We want to utilize all our research centers in such a way that we can generate funds while providing society with much-needed treatment and advances. We want to provide world-class services in every specialty, and we are looking at establishing a private college of medicine. This infrastructure already exists; we just need to figure out the timing. This will insulate us from fiscal pressures in the medium term. We have a large staff nearly four hundred that has begun returning from abroad, and we will be able to utilize them well. We have all the staff and infrastructure we need to provide the highest level of services, now all we need to do is commercialize some of these services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Female participation in labor market to rise to 30% by 2030]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[dr-huda-mohammed-al-ameel-rector-princess-nourah-university-pnu]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you worked to cope with the expanded capacity since this campus opened in 2011?</h4><p>PNU is an established university; the first college, the College of Education, was founded in 1972. For a time, the institution focused on preparing women to teach, and it was eventually transformed into a university with six colleges in Riyadh. It was called Riyadh University during that time in 2008. King Abdullah, our great former king, decided to establish this new campus and change the name to Princess Nourah University. Princess Nourah is the sister of King Abdulaziz, the founder of this great kingdom. She was a wise woman who supported and advised him, and she was passionate about educating women. When we moved to this new modern campus, we faced a huge challenge and a great responsibility. The expanded capacity means two dimensions. First, increasing the admission intakes without compromising quality. Secondly, changing the university theme to be educational-research based university. We had to be up to the standards of this campus and the expectations of our community. Therefore, we worked parallel into three major initiatives: staring a Preparatory Year Program, establishing new colleges namely health colleges and a community college, and finally launching new curricula in already established-colleges. Our plan to achieve the balance between expanding the admission capacity and maintaining quality of education was accomplished by launching these initiatives between PNU expertise with partnership of international experts and leading academic institutions. PNU strived to distinguish its students, faculty and colleges by adopting excellence in academic programs, empowering human capital, and enriching the research and innovation capacity. The Kingdom's Vision 2030 has established extremely ambitious goals for education in the country, and it also addresses women's empowerment and health specifically. We are glad that PNU is at the intersection of these fields, and we are working to do our part in achieving vision 2030.</p><h4>Has the vision or the KPIs established in the NTP changed your approach to curriculum?</h4><p>Indeed. We are glad that our recently launched 10-years strategic plan is very much aligned to Vision 2030 and NTP. In response to the vision's mandate of increasing the participation rate of women in the labor market from 22% to 30%, PNU established very distinguished projects that serve the NTP directly. We launched the Women Business Park in partnership with Wipro and Saudi Aramco, the project aims at linking females academic progress with the economic growth by creating more than 20.000 job opportunities for Women by 2025. We also restructured our Graduate Programs to ensure delivering unique and competitive programs that meet the demands of the labor market. Our Graduate programs focus on certain majors such as Business Administration — entrepreneurship-, advanced nursing practices, and information managements of data analysis. Our programs are delivered in partnership of leading academic university which is Dublin City University allowing our students to obtain two degrees from PNU and from the international university DCU. In addition, PNU offers a high diploma program with the National Institute of Education in Singapore, to improve the qualification of females teachers around the Kingdom in teaching science, math, and English. Moreover, in term of Professional training for Saudi women, PNU is offering three professional diplomas in Retail, Security, and Child Care. These programs are offered with Paris Academy to ensure high quality training and empowering women in the labor market. In Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University we believe that the role of the university is to educate, research, and serve the community, and our focus towards advancing women in all aspects is a key that contributes to vision 2030.</p><h4>Where do you stand on the running debate about how the curriculum should be adjusted to the immediate needs of employers?</h4><p>We have a balanced understanding of this issue here at PNU. We believe that the market needs are changing constantly, and therefore we must be ahead of such changes by forecasting the future of jobs and developing the skills of our students. In term of the changing jobs opportunities, we are offering new academic disciplines and redesigning the existing curricula to meet the needs of the market. We also have put a significant effort to connect our students with the labor market by offering them training and internship opportunities. Moreover, PNU focuses on lifelong learning skills that will equip the students for challenging endeavors in their future careers.</p><h4>What do you see ahead in your short to medium-term plans, and what are your expectations for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We shall continue to work on our strategic plan focusing in graduating distinguished female students, and building up our research centers and its capacity. Our realistic strategic plan is the pathway for the next 12 months to work on the existing projects and developing new initiatives. We also shall work to achieve financial suitability through diversifying our investment resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Costa Rica exports 4,500 products to 150 countries around the world]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[jorge-sequeira-director-general-cinde]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the country moved from being an agriculture economy to an industrial and services-oriented one?</h4><p>Costa Rica is an example to the rest of the world of how a country can make a real transformation of its economy. We were exporting four basic agricultural products with no value-added to a limited number of countries around the world in the 1980s. Today, Costa Rica is exporting 4,500 different products to 150 countries around the world, many of which are value added with a high level of sophistication. Products and services make up half and half of our exports, with USD10 billion of the former and USD8 billion of the latter. Looking at the transformation and how me have moved from a basic economy to a more sophisticated one, it is based mostly on IT and in IT-related and enabled industries, including software development, gaming, mobile applications, customer support, finance, accounting, HR, and cybersecurity. All of these new areas did not exist 15-20 years ago.</p><h4>What sectors are the most attractive for foreign companies right now in Costa Rica?</h4><p>We can divide them into four large sectors. One of the most popular is life sciences. It is a sector with a lot of dynamism that continues to grow, hire more people, increase its footprint, and cultivate its ecosystem here. Another is advanced manufacturing, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, and other types of industries. It is not volume-based, but rather low-volume, high sophistication products. We cannot compete with Mexico or China in terms of high-volume industries. However, we are delivering highly sophisticated electronic components for Tesla. In any industry that requires a great deal of human talent and availability of a labor force that can put together different electronic components, test them, and improve them, we are competitive. The services sector is split in two: everything IT related and enabled, such as software development and testing, internet, mobile, gaming, and cybersecurity; and everything that has to do with shared services, such as finance, accounting, supply chain, and customer support. And the last sector is light manufacturing and food industry. Those are the four sectors on which CINDE is focused.</p><h4>What is CINDE doing to promote the STEM areas of learning?</h4><p>We have an entire department dedicated to the investment climate. Its job is to work on all of the areas that help us improve the investment climate so more companies will come to Costa Rica. It starts at the human talent side of the equation. We need to work on infrastructure, electricity costs, bureaucracy, and red tape, but the most important area is human talent. If we continue to develop the right human talent, companies will keep coming. We work with the Ministry of Education closely through its programs to help improve the level of English taught at public schools and to bring STEM education into public schools and technical colleges so students graduate with a wider range of skills. All 70 private and public universities in Costa Rica are well known and respected. We also work closely with them to ensure students graduate with the skills needed by companies investing in the country. We help develop programs that encourage students to look toward the future. This ensures careers are aligned with the needs of the market.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges and opportunities Costa Rica has compared to other countries that may be less expensive to invest in?</h4><p>As long as we continue to develop the right human talent in the quantities that are required, foreign companies will continue to come. They are not coming to Costa Rica because it is a low-cost destination; they are coming here because they are not finding the right talent in their local countries. The quality of our education is high; it has been tested and has a track record to prove it. Costa Rica has become expensive to operate in because it is a small country with a small population, so people compete with each other for the talent. That means raising salaries is necessary. This has happened in the call center field, where Costa Rica is not competitive anymore. In the shared services sector, however, because we have increased costs and raised salaries, companies have transformed their operations here from lower value-added to high-level sophistication in order to justify paying higher salaries. In terms of productivity numbers, there has been a significant increase over the last decade. Yes, we are more expensive; however, we are producing much more. Instead of letting high wage earners go, the idea is to train them better and give them high value-added activity.</p><h4>CINDE was ranked the best promotion agency in the world in 2017. What were some of the successes that have led to that achievement?</h4><p>I believe it is our focus on the customer. Very few investment promotion agencies in the world help companies throughout the whole process—from the moment they are prospect to the moment they are making a decision, helping them install, and once they are here, helping them understand how to grow horizontally or vertically and expand their footprint, and never letting go. All companies that have launched operations in Costa Rica through CINDE continue to operate here. We have forms for them to participate in HR, training, and R&amp;D. That really sets us apart, because companies see us as their partner more than a government agency that is just doing what it is obligated to do. We use a lot of technology to provide better services and invest in innovation to be on top of the newest trends, but those are all part of a single strategy that is to be a good partner for growth and success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the biggest challenges that your international clients face when they make the decision to come and do business in Mexico?</h4><p>They may face many different challenges, but the most important ones, in my opinion, are the strictness in the formalities of law, ignorance on the real scenario in Mexico, bureaucracy and time-consuming requirements, and, in some cases, corruption. </p><h4>The past few years have seen a number of major structural reforms to the Mexican economy. How would you characterize the effectiveness with which these reforms have been implemented since they came into law?</h4><p>We have seen huge major foreign investments; however, for the regular citizen, the situation has not changed. Unfortunately, corruption has been a major issue on the implementation of these major reforms, and the results were not close to the ones wished for by the government and by the people.</p><h4>To what extent should issues like corruption and insecurity be a concern for international investors?<br></h4><p>They cannot be left aside. For a normal business, one may encounter some corruption issues; however, there are some businesses that from their nature are certainly subject to insecurity concerns and corruption. For normal businesses, insecurity may depend on the geographical area of business but would be normal for a country of more than 120 million people.</p><h4>What are the advantages of working with Uhthoff, Gomez, Vega and Uhthoff?</h4><p>Quality of service and closeness to our clients. For more than a century we have worked with major foreign clients and most of our clientele are from abroad, thus speaking the same language and understanding each other minds certainly is an advantage. Clients receive top-quality service for a reasonable investment, without sacrificing the knowledge and professionalism of the staff. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important are SMEs as part of your client base?</h4><p>More than half of our client base are SMEs right now. Many of them come to us because they are investing outside of Mexico, growing, professionalizing, and introducing corporate governance. Often they have been approached for a JV investment or are entering a project, in infrastructure for example, where there is a great deal of public and private participation while also requiring funds from international and multinational finance corporations. There is usually a turning point, though it may be the case that there is a succession issue or an open opportunity to enter the market. There is always a triggering event for all these companies that have been operating for several years. There is still plenty of room for growth in this segment in Mexico. Mexico has about 400 companies that have publicly listed equities or debts, compared to probably 12,000 in the US or 10,000 in Brazil.</p><h4>What is the biggest change you have seen in the Mexican economy in the last two decades?</h4><p>Mexico has enjoyed a great period of macroeconomic stability in public finance and there are bumps here and there in the road; however, overall there has been a clear direction of where the government wants to take the country and the economy, which is currently challenged by the new administration in the US. Mexico continues to be supportive of open trade and free markets, and if it has to turn to different markets, that is an opportunity. For a long time, we have enjoyed the benefits of these policies. Sectors that have been closed for quite some time and are critical to a mature economy such as energy and telecoms have opened, making Mexico more competitive.</p><h4>What is the biggest thing an investor should be aware of when coming to Mexico?</h4><p>The biggest thing investors should remember is that there are cultural differences when operating in Mexico; not every country is the same. Companies need to understand this because it is extremely important. Secondly, companies need to be careful about the risks in general terms; they have to be cognizant of the fact that they may need a change in management to change the culture within companies, and this may require investment. They may need to invest in processes, corporate governance, and IT, which is also an opportunity for these companies to introduce best practices from all over the world to Mexican companies.</p><h4>What distinguishes KPMG among the big four?</h4><p>We have sought to be innovative with our clients; we provide audit, tax, and advisory services, but have realized that clients seek to solve an issue rather than just hire a consultant for a project. Thus,  we try to be innovative with them and have technology solutions to improve the way we do things. We bring solutions from outside of Mexico and serve SMEs with the best practices from the US, Asia, and other parts of the world. Secondly, we seek to make things more efficient and try to differentiate the way we serve clients. Thirdly, we seek to improve the tools we use and are investing in artificial intelligence. We have, for example, an alliance with Watson to develop those tools for the delivery of services, namely robotic process automation. We are changing the way our clients demand services, and we have started to see clients request robotic process automation in their business processes, supply chain, and back office, and are bringing people from centers of excellence to improve and implement those strategies here. These companies will become digital, data-driven companies going into the future, and it is a challenge to also transform ourselves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[tourism-on-top]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of the government's goals in recent years has been to promote development in the south of the country. What role can the tourism sector play in that goal?</h4><p>Tourism already represents one of the main income sources for many southern communities, as it creates opportunities to benefit from their cultural and natural assets without having to migrate in search of a better life. Tourism has helped to significantly reduce poverty beyond the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico's most important touristic cluster. In the southern states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero, there are many municipalities where tourism has positively transformed the lives of inhabitants. The challenge we face is to bring these benefits, employment, quality basic services, housing, and so on to more regions. According to INEGI, the national statistics agency, those municipalities with significant touristic activity show better social and economic indicators than those with no or marginal tourism. We want to ensure that we not only have first-class tourism destinations, but also first-class and sustainable communities. We team up with companies and local authorities to take care of and enhance their particular attractions, helping to reinforce national and regional pride, a sense of belonging, and the common values that make a healthy community and a more appealing destination for modern travelers.</p><h4>Mexico recently rose to eighth place in the World Tourism Organization's global ranking. To what do you attribute this success?</h4><p>In 2016, we rose from ninth place to eighth, the highest ranking we have ever attained. This success is the result of many elements; however, above all, it has to do with the deep conviction of President Peña Nieto and all the relevant actors that tourism should be at the front of our country's economic and social development. This has allowed us, along with the private sector, to implement a series of coordinated actions and policies that go from large international marketing campaigns and hosting world-class sport and cultural events, to special financing schemes targeting SMEs that have the potential to participate and benefit from tourism activities. It is the combination of all these actions and a clear objective that have brought great results.</p><h4>How has the Trump administration's posture toward Mexico affected the tourism sector?</h4><p>Thus far, the impact, if any, has been minimal. In fact, the numbers show that American tourists still flock to Mexican destinations. Tourists arriving via the border have also increased by 3.3% YoY and account for 3.6 million. Up until March 2017 we received almost 2.8 million Americans via air, which is up 9.2% from the same period in 2016, which was by itself a record number. With a new Air Services Agreement between our countries, we have better air connectivity than ever, and Americans are as welcome as always to visit us and enjoy our increasing number of destinations. Clearly, people of both countries are conscious that our relations go beyond political issues and negative rhetoric.</p><h4>Mexico still lags behind many other countries in the development of the medical tourism sector. What steps can the country take to promote its development?</h4><p>Medical tourism does represent an important opportunity to increase the competitiveness of some of our destinations, and the changes that could take place in the American health system could enhance this potential. President Nieto has included this market segment in the country's tourism strategy. We have identified 19 medical clusters in nine states that together represent around 60 hospitals and medical centers with growth potential in Baja California, Chihuahua, Mexico City, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Nuevo León, Quintana Roo, Sonora, and Tamaulipas. To take advantage of this potential we push forward initiatives that ensure quality in attention, standardized services, and a more aggressive promotion of Mexico as a reliable treatment option for patients. In this matter we have already made advances, as the almost USD4 billion in revenue from medical tourism in Mexico can attest. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Hospital Sedna's role in Mexico's healthcare system?</h4><p>This year is Hospital Sedna's 10th year in the industry. We began as a hospital focused on women and women's health. In our second year of operation, we expanded and became a general hospital. We call ourselves an integral hospital because we provide all of the integral services for recovering health, from full diagnostics in imaging and laboratory facilities to specialized operating rooms and intensive care units. We are in a special position—in both a geographic sense and in terms of our operations within the broader marketplace. We are located in the heart of the healthcare industry in the south of Mexico City, and we offer a high-level service with a professional staff at a reasonable price. We might not be the biggest hospital, but we can have a lot of influence based on the way we operate internally. Our focus is mainly on developing a service and people-oriented business. We think that the transformation of the entire country begins on a small scale with exactly the kinds of things we are doing here.</p><h4>How people oriented is the healthcare industry in Mexico right now?</h4><p>It is people oriented to a certain degree, but not enough. Our main value here at the hospital is patient safety, but our next value is service in a human sense. Too many institutions do not put enough focus on the quality of service. We think this is a fundamental aspect of healthcare. Patient wellbeing is not just about physical health, it is also emotional and psychological, and in great service we can optimize these aspects. We build close relationships with all of our patients.</p><h4>Why does Hospital Sedna's geographic location allow it to offer a better service experience to patients?</h4><p>The area that we are located in is an area that specializes in health services. We have a lot of public institutions and excellent private institutions near us. This means that patients can find many services in this area. By being here in this part of the city, we can take advantage of having the best professionals and practices while raising the overall quality of all the players. We offer great services at reasonable prices.</p><h4>What is the role of the private sector in helping Mexico achieve universal access to healthcare?</h4><p>Only the upper class in Mexico has private health insurance, and we are working to change that. A large percentage of the population is uninsured or underinsured, and we as a country have implemented a number of policies to help these people. Private hospitals are working as subcontractors for the government, and they take clients that public institutions do not have the capacity to care for. This helps by giving people access to services and raising the overall level of care in Mexico. The demand for healthcare is large right now, and it will explode over the next 20-30 years. Having a strong demand and fewer supply, gives private hospitals the opportunity to grow and expand. We serve patients with and without private insurance. Many people with public insurance are willing to pay a little extra to receive a better service in a private facility. We also treat a lot of people from Seguro Popular. Approximately 15-20% of our clients come from this segment, especially those receiving treatment for breast cancer. Furthermore, we see growth in the area of people who do not have private insurance as a key part of our business expansion opportunity. There are many small clinics that are doing surgical procedures, but they do not have the infrastructure of a hospital. Our main advantage in this environment is offering these services and infrastructure. We have advanced units that are affordable and with a personalized service. These areas of specialized care are the areas with the biggest potential for future growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[University for Society]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[university-for-society]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What distinguishes IBERO's approach to education from other institutions?</h4><p>It is our commitment to society that other private universities do not have. We contribute to solutions that are relevant to society, particularly the thought and formation of ethical and social values among our students. A second difference is that we have an integral approach to help form their will, corporality, values, intuition, and creativity, for example—aspects of life not usually valued in a market-oriented university. The third difference is that we value academic quality in our research, teaching, and relationship with society, companies, and the public and social sector.</p><h4>How is IBERO's relationship with other international institutions, and how is it perceived on an international level?</h4><p>We are sending 600 students and receiving 250 students approximately from other universities each year; however, there is still room for growth. Our students are mostly going to the US, Spain, the UK, and Western Europe, the first two being the most important destinations. International students are coming mostly from France. We are also receiving some students from Asia, mainly Japan. We have sought to strengthen our relationship with 200 Jesuit universities around the world. We are going to have a meeting with deans next year to benefit from this network, rather than focus on a particular region.</p><h4>According to OECD's last PISA evaluation, Mexico occupies last place. What has to be done to advance in this field and what role can the education reform play?</h4><p>First, education needs to become a public matter, not a matter of state. It has been used for social clientelism and control; the matter has not been debated publicly but instead decided by small groups inside the government. This needs to be debated by the public and by private and social entities, communities, and families. Second, there has to be an in-depth reform that educates and incorporates new technologies and pedagogical and didactic assets. An indisputable condition is to incorporate the teachers into these reforms, which has not been done. The latest reform is authoritarian; therefore, teachers are rejecting it because it has not broken the logic of control and does not incorporate their practices and experiences.</p><h4>How would you evaluate human capital and what is IBERO doing to develop it?</h4><p>We are trying to improve mathematics programs because we have a lack of engineers in Mexico. On the other hand, there are too many programs that are not required, such as law, psychology, communications, and medicine. We still need to strengthen technical careers in the country. In Eastern societies, for every bachelor there are two or three technicians; here for every six graduates we have a technician. There is a field of work there; however, universities are still not contributing. At IBERO, we are strengthening our high-level technical programs: we have five now and will have eight in three more years. Now, we have 500 students in these areas, but we intend to have at least 1,000. It also contributes to social mobility.</p><h4>What are the priorities of IBERO University for 2017?</h4><p>Our priorities will be to have a university more linked to society and to strengthen mechanisms for interaction between the campus and the broader community. We think that a Jesuit university cannot be isolated, but must be in constant feedback with the society from which it springs. A second priority is to make our community an inclusive and plural one by strengthening one of our most ambitious scholarship programs. We plan to incorporate 2,000 students with full scholarships. A third priority is to increase research, graduate studies, and the impact of these theoretical-academic reflections on resolving the country's problems. It is important for us to have an inclusive, plural university that is respectful of different individuals and will contribute to a more democratic society and participatory citizenship. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your biggest achievements with Velsimex, and what is your trajectory?</h4><p>At the beginning, Velsimex was comprised of three Mexican partners. Later, we shared the ownership with Sanachem, a South African corporation, then an American company, and DVA, a German company. We started as the smallest of the 92 companies in the industry, but we are now one of the eight major agrochemical suppliers. In June 2018, we will celebrate our 30th anniversary. This year we are entering a new phase since our German partner just divested, which means that we are now composed of 100% Mexican capital. We now aim to expand more aggressively here in Mexico and in the region.</p><h4>What does it mean for the company to be 100% Mexican?</h4><p>In my experience, I have learned that having excellent partners is vital. When you and your partners have different objectives, planning becomes too difficult. Our German partner wanted to have more subsidiaries that were directly below them. We wanted to operate more as an independent supplier because there was a potential market for us to compete as a technical agrochemical supplier in Latin America. Because of our different objectives, we chose to part ways. We have a subsidiary in Panama. We are planning to operate in all of Central America through it with formulated products. Later on, we will return to synthesizing technical products to export to all of America first, and then the rest of the world. The plan is to be competitive against Indian and Chinese firms and products.</p><h4>How has social responsibility played an important role in your operations?</h4><p>I have always thought that if one has the good fortune of being born with the means and the abilities to thrive, they have a responsibility to give back. This is especially true in a country like Mexico. On one hand, we are one of the 15 largest economies in the world; on the other, 50% of our population is living in poor conditions. We have a commitment, as ones that have provided for themselves, to create something for others as well. We need to focus on helping Mexicans develop themselves. We spend more than half a million pesos a year on programs aimed at children and workers. Around 10% of our employees have a master's degree and/or PhD, and many of those have been possible thanks to the support we provide. We also have excellent opportunities for development within the company, and many people that join the company at entry-level positions finish their careers in more elevated ones. We prepare employees to work in many different parts of the country and the company. We are creating citizens that can bring real value to Mexico in many different forms. Employees who dedicate themselves to our company for many years are extremely valuable to us and we want to give back to their communities in some way. Social responsibility is vital. One of the most important responsibilities we have is to the environment. I believe social responsibility will play a key role in the sustainability of the whole world.</p><h4>What do you see as the biggest challenges facing Mexico's agricultural sector?</h4><p>The victory of Donald Trump in the US created consternation concerning the future of Mexican industry and agriculture. Though Mexico has many commercial agreements, it has to look for other markets and partners. This diversity is one of the tools that helped us develop our economy. We have become the economic powerhouse we are today in great measure thanks to these agreements. China, in particular, represents a great opportunity for Mexico. China is a huge potential market for Mexican agricultural products, and there is the possibility that they could be a real game changer for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Amistad Industrial Parks?</h4><p>Amistad is a family-owned company that our late father founded. He started the business in 1977 and with the initial idea of developing a small industrial park on the border city of Acuña, given the manufacturing operations and industries looking at Mexico for lower-cost operations near Juárez. He developed the first industrial park in the state of Coahuila in Ciudad Acuña, one of the largest parks today. He subsequently started looking at other areas, which helped the company evolve into a full build-to-suit construction and service company.</p><h4>What changes have you seen in the industrial sector in terms of the profiles of your clients?</h4><p>When my father started the business, manufacturing companies were labor-intensive operations that would import raw materials, do light assembly, and export back to the US. Today, there are state-of-the art facilities and complex operations from diverse sectors similar to those in the US, Germany, or Japan. That is due to the skilled labor now available in the country.</p><h4>Where do most of your clients come from?</h4><p>About 50% of our customer base is European or Asian, whereas before about 78% were US companies. We saw a major change in the early 2000s with more European and Asian investments looking at the border and cities like Saltillo and Bají­o. Our customer base was mainly concentrated in the north with US companies; now we see companies all over Mexico and from all over the world. Companies tend to follow their clients; Mexico is now a platform not only to service their companies within Mexico but all around the world.</p><h4>How have these changes affected the types of services you provide?</h4><p>The industrial park business in Mexico has truly evolved in the past 15 to 20 years. Today, some of these parks have their own free trade zones, such as Puerto Interior or Interpuerto Monterrey. However, we are seeing an increasing diversity of quality of services and infrastructure in these parks. Our parks are state of the art, have the best infrastructure, and are self-sufficient with their own substations for power, wells for water, treatment plants for sewage, and so on. These all have 24-hour security, are fully fenced, have great access to the main highways, and have a stable supply of labor within the general area.</p><h4>What differentiates Amistad from your competition when potential clients look for industrial space in Mexico?</h4><p>Our same customer base drives most of our growth; 80% of our clients expand with us so that is our best letter of recommendation. Most of our organic growth comes from our client base, which means we are doing something right. We can offer any geographic location within Mexico and are not limited to our industrial parks. We offer a guaranteed track record and flexibility, can build almost anywhere in Mexico, and are fully integrated. We offer a variety of services, such as real estate, construction, shelter, and logistics; customers can pick all or some of them.</p><h4>To what extent do clients ask for green construction?</h4><p>We see this more every day, and our parks were certified as green parks, though we are still working on getting all 15 certified. We were one of the first to become green certified from SEMARNAT through AMPIP and the first to recycle water. Our goal is to become a LEEDS-certified builder.</p><h4>What is the biggest source of your growth in the short to medium term?</h4><p>Alternate geographic locations. We were the first to build a park in the Celaya-Querétaro region, and now there are 10. We have a nose for cities not as industrially developed as they could be.</p><h4>What is your vision for Amistad?</h4><p>Already top ten, we want to consolidate our group into one of the top-five industrial developers in Mexico. We have been talking about taking our company public, so we want to build it up to a size that can generate interest. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the decision to branch out into the middle-income market?</h4><p>We saw a great need for people in that income bracket as credit mortgages were becoming more available and competitive. Mortgage rates were falling close to single digits; traffic in the city was becoming crazy, and every development was being pushed to the outskirts of Mexico City. We were one of the first developers to construct large projects with big living spaces, underground parking, recreational spaces and amenities, and tall buildings of 150 units per tower. It was quite risky; if a company has too much inventory it has to do a great deal of presales and it has to educate that market that presales are a great investment. It was common sense to enter this market, as there was demand and stability; we could give people something for a similar price within a great location and great amenities. We received another large push from our investors.</p><h4>Are the different parts of the business managed separately or are they integrated?</h4><p>They are integrated in the sense of mixed-use projects, which are strategic, especially in Mexico City. We are one of the leaders in mixed-use developments for the middle-income segment. Our middle-income development arm, Reside, is developing several large mixed-use projects while in the high-end market we are participating in a large mixed-use project in Santa Fe.</p><h4>What distinguishes a Copri project?</h4><p>In general, our philosophy is to improve the standard of living of our clients; that philosophy applies not only to direct clients in terms of our residential business, but also to the users of toll roads or our shopping malls. Mixed-use makes sense in terms of improving people's lives so that is our main strategy. We also do mainly large and sustainable projects, which is another way of differentiating ourselves.</p><h4>Why do you mainly focus on projects in Santa Fe?</h4><p>We are in Quintana Roo, Cancún, Playa Del Carmen, and Querétaro; however, 80% of our projects are in Mexico City because there is a great deal of opportunity there. We have expertise in Mexico City and it is one of the fastest-growing economies in Mexico, which is also one of the most stable and best places to be in terms of thinking in the long term. We like Querétaro, where we have new projects; we are starting our fourth project there.</p><h4>How would you characterize the environment for financing for the real estate sector in Mexico right now?</h4><p>In terms of banking, we have relationships, with the majority of the banks and our model has worked, so we have formed great relationships with them. We are becoming competitive in the sense that we get financing relatively quickly and on great terms. In terms of equity partners, we had a solid relationship with LaSalle investment management; we did several projects with them and are now in the final phases of certain residential projects. One is mixed-use development that includes residential and commercial. We are in the initial phase with Walton Street Capital and are doing interesting things with them as well.</p><h4>What current project are you most excited about?</h4><p>In the residential business, we are beginning to move out of Santa Fe; we have an exciting project in Las Flores near Periférico Sur. We are working on a 330-unit project where the average price for a unit is around USD400,000. For residential mixed-use, we have two new developments under construction for the middle-income segment. One is at Parque Jardí­n, which has a shopping mall and 1,800 units with great amenities. Then, we have Parque Sur in Periférico Sur, which has hotels, office building, 600 units, and a small shopping mall with a supermarket and service shops. That said, the most exciting project is a 23,000sqm-office building in Vasco de Quiroga. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the thinking behind your recent rebranding, and what does it mean for the company?</h4><p>It was a natural move given the changes of our business project. We first started as investors and then went into developing real estate and invited other partners to invest with us. In that transition, we decided to rebrand ourselves as Venit Investments since it better reflects the real purpose of the business, which is to develop real estate and find a good investment for our clients' capital. When we develop a project and go to the public to invite them to invest, we have to think about it as an option they are considering for their capital. If your project is not well thought-out or has unattractive returns on investment, potential investors will invest in other ways, but not necessarily in other real estate projects.</p><h4>How does your investor background define the strategy you use to identify investments?</h4><p>There are a different ways of doing it, but there are several key things we do. The real challenge today in Mexico is finding good projects, not the capital. The problem with this lies with the planning and layout of cities themselves. There are cities such as Monterrey that have a market that does not reflect the real driving force.</p><h4>What is the role of ego and prestige in making decisions about where and how to create new developments?</h4><p>Many developers began in the business not as investors, but as people who wanted to make something to reflect their ego. They want the glamorous part of being a developer, building the tallest towers in Mexico. That is reasonable if the developer is a large and experienced company and if there is a market for the project. We often wonder if developers are building profitable products when they do it with someone else's money. One of the reasons for changing our name was to reflect that we are interested above all in profitability; afterwards, we think about the aesthetic and size of the developments. It is about a product that is profitable and at the same time specifically designed for someone's needs.</p><h4>What were the three projects you closed this year and what made them different?</h4><p>They were really different projects, but the three are in Querétaro. Querétaro is interesting because there are many well-designed residential developments, and it is developing nicely into a large city. One of our projects is called Nova; it is a 10-year project of 100,000 rentable sqm of office, commercial, and residential space. It is in an area of the city that is growing quickly. We are developing one part of the land, and another company is developing a different complex. It is an interesting project because of the way it is structured: everything is seen in the long run. It is a project focused on developing the community. We are seeing more long-term projects that create a community where people can make their lives without having to cross the city in their daily routines. The second project is similar. We are developing the commercial and office space, which accounts for 20% of the entire project. This is a four to five-year project. The last is an apartment project we have been working on for years, condominiums. On the business side, it is attractive to develop in medium-sized cities such as Querétaro or Merida.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next few years?</h4><p>The main goal is to keep growing and develop projects that are profitable. My investors are happy, because the projects are working. This also creates value for the whole city and community. We are going to try to expand the apartment projects to a couple of other cities in the next couple of months and solidify the two big projects we are now working on. In the long term, we will try to replicate such projects in other cities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history behind IPS Seguridad and how has it transformed since its establishment?</h4><p>I joined the security sector after the crisis of 1995. Over time, I began to enjoy working in the industry, particularly the opportunity to help others. Today, our company distinguishes itself from others due to its human factor. We do not see people as a means of doing business. Instead, we focus on how to help people improve their quality of life. Later, I set up my own security company with a friend. It was not easy, because we had to gain the trust of clients and it was a learning process of five years, during which we had to understand management, law, accounting, and so on. Then from 2000, we included marketing and a corporate image. We started to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Amongst 8,000 security companies in Mexico, there is no other company like ours. We have had about 2,000 employees who have finished high school during their time with our company. Many of them have left because they went on to get their university degrees or found better positions elsewhere. For us, it is a great satisfaction to see our people grow. This led us to better understand the concept of social responsibility. We have learnt about protecting the environment and safety, which is a social issue. For six years, we have received the Mexican Philanthropy Center's award for socially responsible companies. In addition, three years ago, Great Place to Work Institute approached us for our social commitment and in 2016 we were certified by Great Place to Work. That is one of the achievements that makes us proud and has boosted our growth.</p><h4>What is the benefit for potential clients of working with a security company that has that certification?</h4><p>One of the main challenges in security companies is employee turnover. Turnover affects companies financially. To select a person, train him, provide uniforms, and put him to work involves costs a company about MXN5,000. If we do not invest in training and motivation, it is very likely that they will leave, affecting our finances and quality of services. Motiving and appreciating our employees will eventually positively affect our clients, because they will receive better service. In fact, turnover is one of the things our clients consider before hiring us. Our turnover rate is less than 10%, while in other companies it is 80% or more. We have achieved this by being a Great Place to Work company. We also have an internal newsletter with which we motivate and award our employees for their good work.</p><h4>How has your client profile transformed over 21 years?</h4><p>We grow by 20% on average. There have been other years that have seen greater growth because we had large clients. Some of our clients identify with us because of our human philosophy. We have for example, Pepsico, our largest client, which is a socially responsible company. Our clients include Citibanamex, Banorte, Kellogg's, DHL, Bombardier, Alston, Schneider, and so on, and their operations are characterized by social responsibility. We have around 300 clients, about 60% of them corporations.</p><h4>What are the challenges of working with large international companies?</h4><p>One of the biggest challenges is profitability. Some large corporations hire big volumes, but demand low prices. We have a small margin to maneuver, because 80% of our costs are payroll and benefits. Even with high volumes, those are costs we cannot lower. One of our biggest challenges is maintaining a profitable business in a competitive market. There is also a great deal of unfair competition, with companies that do not pay fair salaries, benefits, or taxes. Fortunately, large companies acknowledge formality, good salaries, and management. Small security companies focus on costs, risking reliability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Was it difficult to enter the ICT sector as a small company and grow into a successful business?</h4><p>We started when ICT was in its infancy. Telecoms were just arriving in Dar es Salaam, and service providers were still lacking focus. It required a lot of capital intensity; we had to compete with MNOs that were highly funded and boasted substantial infrastructure. However, we were also seeing that services were only being successfully provided within urban areas, specifically the capital city of Dar es Salaam. WiA's ambition was to integrate with existing network facilities, becoming a pioneer in that realm, focusing primarily on data and connectivity, as that was where more volume in terms of customers was to be found. We started primarily as an enterprise corporate service provider, with a strategy focused on the need to address true connectivity beyond city borders and provide full-unified communication. We wanted to move away from VSAT technology, since its high-cost was excluding many SMEs. I started lobbying heavily to teach MNOs how to leverage in each other's infrastructure, and to encourage more pairings between MNOs and ISPs. We had never previously seen the likes of an ISP-MNO integration, so there was uncertainty surrounding whether it could succeed. For us, the challenge lay in the next steps. If we were to succeed, there would be the question of then how to grow the sales, predominantly dictated in terms of e-1 connectivity, with capacity to feed data as opposed to voice. We aimed for a strategy of optimization. We spoke with the network, optimizing at 30%, and said we could bring in that 70%. It did not have to do anything other than give us capacity. In the end, we managed to achieve our goals, becoming the first ISP to integrate with an MNO in Africa. This is a substantial achievement, allowing us to be a major regional player. Now we have developed cross-border relationships with other companies as well.</p><h4>What have been the most recent achievements at WiA?</h4><p>Our focus on building mission-critical facilities has transformed us into without a doubt the biggest players in Tanzania today. Over the past few years, we stepped into a strategy underscoring ICT as an enabler for businesses, specifically when it came to edging competition. We needed to participate in mission critical services, not only in connectivity, if we wanted to drive this strategy forward. Prior to this, building connectivity was our core business. Now we are looking elsewhere in a bid to diversify and solidify WiA's prospects for success. For example, in the past year we have launched the largest data center in Eastern-Central Africa for one of the largest bank in the region, currently the largest player in the Tanzanian banking sphere, moving it from being a financial institution to an IT company that offers financial services. At the same time, we have been able to roll out the continent's biggest super-cluster. This is actually the world's first end-to-end Oracle super cluster that has been built from hardware to software. We also provide the largest aggregated financial network for banks and all their branches with complete end-to-end wireless microwave network. Now, they can provide online services outside of brick and mortar services for clients all across the country. We also launched the largest network in the country for a public institution, the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA). With our help, TANAPA has been able to expand upward into the service end, allowing customers to pay for their packages online.</p><h4>How do you view the impact ICT has had on business and services in Tanzania? </h4><p>ICT has moved from being a value-add to a necessity. ICT is increasingly becoming a major contributor to our GDP. In addition to concrete infrastructure like ports and roads, now we have to add network infrastructure to the must-haves in order to create a flourishing business environment in the country. Today, we cannot talk about trade without ICTe. ICT is taking on more of a utility role. It will be needed for anything and everything. Tanzania is beginning to demonstrate and market its capacity in the industry. Today, we have incubators all over the country, and a lot of young people that are becoming involved in the sector. These young people are providing solutions locally, and the next challenge will be to start driving these local content application internally and externally.</p><h4>What is your vision for the company in the medium term?</h4><p>In the past, we have been self-funded, however now we have reached a point based on our size, growth, and achievements, at which our funding structure will have to undergo some changes. The economic and administrative changes enveloping Tanzania at the moment are also impacting the business community, and we believe these changes will be a huge enabler for people like us to provide more services. We are seeing many organizations, enterprises corporates, and SMEs holding back a little in terms of spending, with people reluctant to invest heavily in IT, instead of focusing on their core services. Because of this, more companies are outsourcing ICT services, and WiA is responding to this with major projects this year to address the fully outsourced IT-model. We are going to be launching the largest cloud in Africa this year, as well as the largest data center that will act as a catalyst for SMB, corporate, and enterprise. We are working with partners to drive 4G/5G services. Finally, we are working on providing a state-of-the-art cyber solutions, which we believe is becoming more and more vital for businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[right-or-wrong-the-customer-wins]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Telefónica's current position and what are the biggest challenges and opportunities in the market?</h4><p>In most countries, Telefónica has typically been the incumbent—the former monopoly competing against other challengers. In Mexico, we are different in the sense that we are now the challenger. The company has solid foundations; its staff are extremely committed to the company. Second, we have a solid network; we are in 93,000 cities and towns in Mexico, covering more than 90% of the population. Telefónica has been innovative in providing different services in the last few years. We were the first to not charge customers by the minute, but by the second. We place our clients first; we got rid of international roaming fees and provided unlimited voice minutes. Later, the competition imitated our offers, which subsequently benefited their own clients.</p><h4>With over 20% market share and 15 years in the market, is Telefónica still not an established player?</h4><p>We are still in an offensive mindset in various ways. There is a huge market in Mexico and this presents a great opportunity. There are 120 million people in this country and only three operators. Furthermore, Mexico has a large number of young people. They love social networks and connectivity, and this presents a great opportunity. In Mexico, we are behind other Latin American countries in terms of mobile penetration. Finally, Mexico is economically stable. Despite issues with the US, we will still grow by 1.5%.</p><h4>What does a company need to do to be able to respond quickly to the competition?</h4><p>One of the most important moments in our market is the Christmas campaign. In the 2015 Christmas campaign, we had our entire campaign ready in the final days of November; suddenly AT&amp;T launched an aggressive price campaign. Two years ago, it would take us about one or two months to change our campaign; now we have shortened that to 10 days. Another example has to do with being agile; it is typical for a large company to make a decision at the board meeting, while two months later little has been done. We now appoint leaders for each initiative and follow up on the progress of each project every week.</p><h4>Where do you envision Telefónica being positioned in Mexico?</h4><p>We are currently living through a digital revolution that will help people live better lives. All these great things happen because connectivity exists, and we are the ones that create networks. We have three priorities for this company in the next few years. We are proud of our 27 million clients and want to increase that number, even with the entrance of AT&amp;T. We also have many products for SMEs, large corporations, and the government. This B2B sector is growing in double digits, including cloud and security services and IoT. This is a priority for us: accelerated growth in businesses with more value. Our second priority is to continue transforming the company with more digital processes. The third priority is having an offensive mentality. We are proud to manage 27 million customers with 2,000 colleagues.</p><h4>What sets Telefónica apart from other telco providers in the market?</h4><p><span></span>There are different aspects that companies and governments should consider when working with us. Our network and services are robust and are only getting better. We signed an agreement with Telcel under which it will provide us network services in places where we do not have a network. In terms of products and prices, Movistar is one of the most competitive on the market. The real reason people choose us is because we have the best customer service on the market. We have to provide the best of the world in terms of network, a competitive suite of products, and the best customer service is what has to take customers and these people to work with us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the automotive sector for this industry?</h4><p>In Mexico, we consume approximately 1.8 million tons of aluminum per annum. The automotive industry is one of the largest consumers in Mexico, with approximately 1 million tons going to that sector. Car engines are aluminum based, and we work with one of the largest engine companies in the world in Mexico so that a big part of our business. In addition, suspension parts and transitions and other car parts are growing. In Mexico, the automotive industry has been growing rapidly and depending on the US political situation the automotive industry could grow much more or not at all. In this facility, we produce aluminum alloys that fill companies that supply directly to the automotive industry. Organically, we grow in that fashion with more capacity in these different units. We also have some related projects in mind, where we will start producing aluminum flat sheets. These sheets are the most promising products in the future because the body of cars will be aluminum. These materials are currently imported in Mexico. This entails around 550, 000 tons per year; therefore, we foresee an opportunity to do something with that and start a production facility in Mexico to produce those sheets. We are in the process of analyzing different technologies to determine the most convenient and most productive in terms of cost and raw materials. </p><h4>What is the advantage of manufacturing and doing business in Nuevo León?</h4><p>Monterrey is near the US border and it is easy to export from here. Labor is abundant in terms of knowledge and technicians as well, which is not easy to find in other parts of the country. Additionally, there are over 20 universities here in Monterrey. We have energy here in terms of power and natural gas. The state government also helps to develop new companies. Companies in the canning and sheet manufacturing industry in Monterrey are large consumers of aluminum. In Monterrey, there are two lines in construction that are also large consumers. We have been in talks with them and they are keen to have suppliers; this is another reason why we installed our facilities here.</p><h4>How do you integrate environmental issues into your operations?</h4><p>A secondary foundry company like us does not use a great deal of power, though we use a large amount of natural gas. It is helpful to have a company like us when it comes to environmental issues because we use a large amount of scraps. We recycle and our raw materials are also recycled products. As a company, we are conscious about the environment and will keep that as a part of our philosophy for future installations. Right now, we are in the process of installing an expensive system to reach the standards of Europe in terms of air emissions for this facility. It is a huge investment of USD2.6 million; however, it is great for the environment and humanity. We are committed to society and will invest in things that will not increase pollution in the city.</p><h4>What are your other major goals for the company in the next few years?</h4><p>We want to be technology developers. Currently, we have a patent for a byproduct from the diffusion process in our melting furnaces. When aluminum is melted, not 100% of the product is of a good quality; there will be some dross. The dross cannot be used, but we have developed a patent in Spain and will use that specific facility to produce calcium aluminate that is basically used for steel companies. We realized this would be a profitable project and we will have a great community. We want to design new processes in other areas in the company and R&amp;D in order to seek better ways to use byproducts and better ways to produce the actual products. That will be our goal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did GIFAN first get started as a concept?</h4><p>
	<span></span><strong>ALBERTO REMENTERIA</strong> We started in 2002, selling closeouts and opportunity buys to Sam's Club and Wal-Mart that we found in the US—fragrances, watches, sunglasses, and similar products. Before we started with P&amp;G in 2006, it was an opportunistic business. P&amp;G had asked several buyers if they could recommend someone, and one of the buyers recommended us. We started selling Bounce, the dryer sheets, before they gave us Tide, the detergent brand. At that point, it was priced at almost 100% above the market leader, Ariel. But it started selling in certain stores, and we realized there was a niche for higher-end consumers. Therefore, that segment became our focus.  It took us about two to three years to fine-tune the model; now it represents almost USD30 million.
</p><h4>How do you decıde what products are appropriate for the Mexican market?</h4><p>
	<span></span><strong>AR</strong> In those years, we noticed there was an attraction for health and wellness, a growing trend in the world of food. Therefore, we started with 100% all-natural, no sugar, and non-fat premium products. We launched almost three times what the market wanted, as there is now a clear niche of people who want to eat healthy and exercise. We now have two brands of gluten free bread coming out next year.
</p><p>
	<span></span><strong>SERGIO AYALA</strong> We try to find the proper product for the proper market. We started with super foods and other products that may be fashionable right now, but at the end of the day Mexico is one of the most obese countries in the world, and we have a role to play in bringing healthier foods to the market.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What makes GIFAN different from a typical broker or distributor?
</h4><p>
	<span></span><strong>AR </strong>We are not a broker or  distributor, since these are ugly words. Many people will not work with P&amp;G directly, but at the end of the day we own the brand for Mexico. We have a full marketing department, a full regulatory department, a full logistics department, and a full sales team. We are now actually doing a full digital in-house department.</p><h4>What is the current appeal for the Mexican market for multinational consumer brands?</h4><p><span></span><strong>AR </strong>What has changed in the past 25 years is the growth and existence of a solid middle class. These are people that are making more money, scaling up a little in their purchases, and getting small luxuries for their families; the middle class wants quality. </p><h4>
	What do you see as the biggest growth goal for you?</h4><p><strong>SA </strong> It is a mix of everything. We want to expand our base of businesses with existing partners and start working with new partners and clients. We also want to grow our portfolio with existing clients. At the end of the day, we will try to bring more products that offer differentiation to the Mexican market.</p><p><span></span><strong>AR </strong>We are also looking internationally. P&amp;G has been talking with us to expand our model into Asia. We have pitched to work with them in Japan, which has a huge consumer base with discretionary income, loves American products, and wants superior products. They can and will pay for it, which is our first step. The last four years running we have won the Distributor of the Year; this year we won Distributor of the Year for the Future. This is basically where they want to go—to become a full service distributor.</p><h4>Where do you want to see the company in the next two to three years?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SA W</strong>e are currently working with six large and several medium-sized companies, for these tend to be the innovative ones. We also have several different products we want to bring to Mexico. We will try to grow the base and brands we already have with these companies. We will definitel try to develop this business into perhaps 50% of our total growth over the next five years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Jabil's presence in Mexico?</h4><p>We are approaching the 20th year of our operations in Mexico. The industries that we have served in this time have been varied. We have evolved alongside industries; some of them do not even exist today. The great thing about our industry is that companies change, but the need for technology remains constant. We do not have to invest in the next wave of product technology; we just need to adjust to the product technologies that change. The core business of Jabil has been contract manufacturing. Now, we have expanded it on the front end to design services and supply chain management for our customers and on the back end to logistics solutions, such as shipping directly to customers.</p><h4>What are some of the differences between the cities where you have business?</h4><p>Jabil is a large company and we are in the EMS sector. This covers only 60% of the company´s revenue. In Tijuana, we have a relatively large footprint in our healthcare business, and that is doing well. We have two small businesses in Ciudad Juárez that supply plastic products to a different set of products. We find Juarez not expanding nearly as fast as Guadalajara. The past history of Juarez still remains, though the environment is very much improved. Many customers are still not comfortable going there. Also, many of our leaders that started their careers in Chihuahua are playing a big role for us now in Guadalajara. Hence, Guadalajara is really our key technical center. Chihuahua has an aerospace and automotive background where we get our technical talent pool, but it certainly cannot compete now with Guadalajara.</p><h4>What differences in skill sets do you encounter in Jalisco and Chihuahua?</h4><p>We are technically stronger and our managerial skills are much more refined in Guadalajara. There is much more industry here and a large pool of skilled labor, compared to Chihuahua. Technically and managerially, the talent pool is larger in Jalisco. For companies, it is much easier to operate in Jalisco; however, the downside is that there is a great deal of poaching, or talent wars, unlike in Chihuahua. The scale of the city is much different; Guadalajara is six to eight times larger than Chihuahua. Air traffic to the US is much more available in Guadalajara, so it is customer friendly. In Jalisco, the government continually checks in to see how it can contribute. There is a great partnership and relationship with the government. In Chihuahua, the government is helpful, but not on the same level.</p><h4>Is there a positive relationship between the business community and the government?</h4><p>We have been here working for a long time and the government has been active in giving us incentives. With seven sites and 10,000 people, our stakes in Guadalajara are growing. When we have a problem, we have a direct line of contact with the governor, which we value greatly. The government also talks about its technical innovation center and trains numerous students who can later work here.</p><h4>What is your client profile?</h4><p>They are mostly American and European multinationals and start-ups with potential. When we started doing business in the automotive sector in Chihuahua, it begun as one small project and now is our biggest customer in Chihuahua. We are not the least expensive solution for customers, so unless a small company has the volume, it probably would be better served with a different partner. We sell a package of services that is a full end-to-end solution for customers—that is a huge investment that comes with a huge benefit for the customer. We do not do a great deal of work with local Mexican companies. We are a top-tier EMS provider, and perhaps local businesses target second- or third-tier companies. There has been some intent to work with local companies, but nothing has materialized thus far. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[42,000-student capacity over past 12 years]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[prof-khaleel-ibrahim-al-ibrahim-rector-university-hail]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the past decade, the country has undertaken a major expansion of its education system, a project that also stipulated specific specialties for each regional university. Where does Hail University stand today and what is your local specialty?</h4><p>In 2005 the late King Abdullah took the initiative to expand higher education. Five universities were established in one decree, with Hail being one of them. Since then the university has expanded rapidly. In the last 12 years we have almost 14 colleges across different disciplines and our student capacity has reached about 42,000 students. Half of our colleges are in the areas with the greatest demand in the labor market and important for the future of the country. We concentrated on the medical track, and have six colleges in different medical studies: medicine, dentistry, pharmacology, and other applied medical colleges. In addition, we have a college of engineering, with six major departments, as well as a college of computer science and a business school. Meanwhile, we have not neglected the disciplines of humanity, education, and law. We are a comprehensive university but are focused on medical and engineering. We seek to improve the quality of teaching in those disciplines without neglecting other disciplines. Hail University is considered one of the newest universities to have reached strong academic performance and research standards, and we are working to raising the quality even further. This year we have already the British ASIC Accreditation in addition to other accreditation and are working toward getting accredited on seven programs by the end of this year, which is a major part of increasing quality assurance.</p><h4>Do you plan growth in terms of student numbers?</h4><p>We want to focus first on quality; numbers alone are not our desire. We have done most of our physical expansion and today are focused on programs. We also want to establish a new discipline that will fit with the future of the labor market in line with Vision 2030 and the program related to this vision. Next year we plan to initiate the first engineering program for women in the country. We have a program in engineering design that will be mainly for females and will begin in September. We need female engineers and will perhaps go further on this track in the future; however, the problem with establishing a female department in engineering is that there is a difficulty hiring female staff to this department. Today, 30 students have already been accepted to the program.</p><h4>What is your position on curriculum being structured to meet the needs of the labor market?</h4><p>It is a tricky issue. Typically, universities establish programs to educate people and prepare them for their future lives, not for the labor market. We need 10 years to establish an academic program and get it running successfully, and trying to change this rapidly is thus difficult. Universities should prepare their students for the labor market, not only by changing the curriculum, but also by changing other programs that are presented to students outside of the curriculum in order to establish a labor culture and awareness among the students for the market and the soft skills required. The top priority for us is preparing the soft skills that are needed in the labor market rather than modifying the academic curriculum given that the market is not that static. We have many issues with our labor market with over 12 million expatriates, and it is not possible to compete with the labor market as it does not always seek quality labor, but low cost. This issue should be fixed through legislation to readjust the market. With longer working hours and the problems we face with getting work for female students, this means 70% of the those seeking work are female. We do not have such a problem with the male students; however, for females this is a large issue that needs to be addressed through our social system.</p><h4>Do you then believe that if the female employment equation can be fixed then the unemployment equation can be fixed as well?</h4><p>Yes, we have to address the main issue, which is helping people redirect their vision towards work. In the past, most graduates sought government jobs; however, with the large number of people seeking work there are too many for the government to accommodate. We have over 300,000 graduates from higher education every year and the government has now become inflated. As a result, the private sector is the main market for labor in the future. We have to prepare our students to look at the opportunities in the private sector, and enter the specialties that are most in need in the market. We initiated a program to help our graduates get jobs through training, both during their time in university and after graduation. We have programs for graduates and they can attend training courses free of charge. We have built an ecosystem for graduates and this year one of the programs the government granted us is a job accelerator that will help people get on track with jobs and prepare them. Such work is promising in terms of the number of jobs available across the country and not only in major cities.</p><h4>Is research a priority for the university going forward?</h4><p>Our first research center was established five years ago, and is concentrated in health. We initiated this advanced center for diagnostic and personalized medicine, which is now concentrated on advanced genetic research and research in cancer. We have research connections with Cambridge and Nottingham, running programs in different tracks of cancer research including working on breast cancer research. We seek to study the locality issue of this disease in Hail and to record local cases. We are also working with Cambridge on different tracks of research and in colleges, and have also focused on pushing research through our staff and increasing the volume of research being published. In the last years this figure has tripled, the majority in recognized journals. Funding is always key, and last year the Council of Ministers agreed to establish a research fund, which we are already working with. The fund will be mainly funded from outside money, donations, and endowment funds and this is a huge step for Saudi Arabia as we need to do more on the research side. What is spent currently on research is little and research is expensive.</p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for the next 12 months?</h4><p>We have three programs funded by the NTP next year. We have to work toward the new Act for Universities, which will hopefully be approved in the next year and give universities greater independence. Most universities will work on setting up programs and directions, and there is now talk about the privatization of public universities. All this will change the university environment and the way that we work. We are extremely ambitious.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has the recent change of brand and ownership meant for the company in your business in Mexico?</h4><p>We were a wholly owned subsidiary, which meant we had to follow strict disciplines, procedures, and policies even when the local business required a different strategic direction. In 2008, we moved the development of the business into a more service-oriented company; we never manufactured many things in Mexico. It was the best opportunity to capitalize on our knowledge and product lines and the opportunities in Mexico. We grew in the service business with a contract with Pemex from nothing to USD95 million in 10 years. We became so relevant as a service business that it presented a situation for the large corporation; we were a services company owned by a manufacturing company, so the interests were not equal. We began the process of selling the business in 2013, doing the financial and legal processes, and in the end we became a part of EMX, a medium-sized Mexican capital investment group.</p><h4>Did you provide a different experience to what EMX was used to?</h4><p>2016 was the year of transition; since we were tied up during the years of selling the company, we needed quickly to acquire the proper talent, back office, and business plan to truly transform the company into a completely service-oriented business. At the same time, we were delivering results, keeping up our contract with Pemex and, since the energy sector for oil and gas was declining, we needed to quickly move away from a dependency on Pemex. We now have a composition of sales where Pemex represents no more than 25% and we find ourselves facing what we knew; the rest of the market was not properly served and needed a large contractor for fire and security. We maintained a financial security arm to run multiple projects of a certain amount for large Triple-A companies, as this is our target customer. We only serve companies that are committed to fire safety and security and understand the proper norms, standards, and insurances that are around. This includes multinationals and some Mexican companies. We are in the process of re-conducting those to have the same level of security that they would expect in other parts of the world. We have changed from being a wholly owned subsidiary to a full business dedicated to doing mainly the following things: identify risks and engineer, install, and sustain the solution over time.</p><h4>What are the conditions like in Mexico in terms of fire security?</h4><p>We performed a market study whose results were astonishing. The compounded annual growth rate for each of the verticals that we did not look after was over two digits. Doing the right things in these other verticals would increase our chances of being successful. There have also been changes in regulations and many other aspects of the environment in Mexico. It was thus relevant that we became a wholly national company that can elaborate a strategy to increment the total integration of other companies getting into the energy sector, either for electricity or for oil and gas.</p><h4>What is the extent of fire protection regulation in Mexico?</h4><p>Major efforts have been put into the NOM002 since 2012, in which we had extensive participation. NOMs require a verification unit that polices the compliance with the standard, but these units do not truly make a big difference. The Secretary of Labor does spot audits here and there and is now cutting its budget. We work closely with the secretary to train some of its people to understand how to install the detectors. If NOM sends inspectors to ensure regulations are being followed, they need to know what to look for. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Innovation is Key]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[innovation-is-key]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What niche did you identify in the gas industry that you could serve?</h4><p>I was interested in LPG because Mexico has the largest residential consumption in the world; 80% of Mexican households use this gas. There is strong competition in the country and about 1,000 plants in Mexico. Hermogas applies new technologies for its customers. We are launching a mobile app through which our customers can request gas; this app is based on IoT technology and will show in real time the level of gas that customers have in their homes. When there is insufficient gas, customers will receive an alert to order a refill or our company will send it automatically. In addition, this app and sensor technology will detect gas leaks and activate a safety protocol. We go beyond traditional marketing and are making inroads in social media. There are nine gas companies in Sonora, and we have around a 30% market share.</p><h4>How do your competitors react to your innovative initiatives?</h4><p>We have seen other companies replicating our initiatives; however, we are at a higher level of innovation because we never stop developing technologies and improving our customer service. In this industry, it has been difficult to be different because, for a long time, Pemex was the only supplier; we had fixed prices up until December 2015. Thus, when other competitors offer a product at a similar price, we have to differentiate our company by the quality of service. We always seek this differentiator; that is why we are in a constant process of innovation.</p><h4>How has the energy reform transformed your business?</h4><p>The reform rapidly benefited the LPG industry, particularly in the northern states, because we could make inroads in the imports of gas as a result of our proximity to the US. In January 2016, we could import gas for the first time. Pemex will remain a supplier, and it is important to always have a national option without it being a monopoly. On top of this, the free flow of prices has benefited us; we can tell what is the proportion of the cost of molecules, logistics, and storage in the overall prices. This has helped us to increase the quality of our trucks, storage tanks, and service, ensuring safety for our customers. This also allows us have freedom in prices, helping us provide clients with quality of product and service.</p><h4>Are you concerned that safety and service have been disregarded with the liberalization of prices?</h4><p>There will always be a segment of customers interested in lower prices. We have state-of-the-art measurement technology, certifications, and training; these have an impact on our prices. However, a larger segment values companies that are responsible and professional and that offer a safe service. LPG gas is a hazardous material, and it always has to go together with a safe service in compliance with regulations.</p><h4>How do you integrate the protection of the environment in your operations?</h4><p>We are in the distribution segment and do not participate in extraction and exploitation; therefore, we are working in the cleanest part of the business. We handle small amounts of hazardous waste in compliance with regulations and are certified by PROFEPA. Also, there is a new trend of using LPG for vehicles instead of gasoline, so we will contribute with changing motors to function with this fuel. There are 30-40% savings to be made by using LPG instead of gasoline.</p><h4>What are your future plans and goals for the following years?</h4><p>We plan to continue growing in the vehicle carburation business; we have 25 carburation stations and plan to open 10 more stations this year in the areas where we are present. We aim to grow in this segment because of the transition of fuel for vehicles due to the liberalization of prices. For the moment, we would like to consolidate our presence in our current cities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is the liberalization of the retail fuel market important for the Mexican energy sector?</h4><p>In the last 13 years, Mexico increased its consumption of fuels; we went from being the eighth-largest global consumer of gasoline to the fourth largest. At the same time, for almost 80 years the development of infrastructure for storage, transport, and retail of oil products was subject only to Pemex's investment capacity. This led to the transport and storage system becoming insufficient to satisfy our increasing needs; today, we have barely three days' worth of inventory capacity. This is far below the international recommendation of at least 30 days and compromises the country's energy security. In logistics, the pipeline network to transport oil products has not been expanded in the past 17 years; therefore, we have been compelled to resort to other means to move fuels as auto-tanks, which is 14 times more expensive. Additionally, the number of service stations per inhabitant is low, compared to other countries. With the liberalization of the fuel and oil products market, we seek to create a competitive and robust market comprised of private investors and that coexists with Pemex. This opening will bring to Mexico three specific benefits: strengthening our energy security as a result of the extension of our storage capacity; allowing Mexico to rely on a more efficient, secure, and competitive transport system that will allow us to streamline logistics costs; and the ability to offer consumers a wide variety of quality options, services, and brands of gasoline stations.</p><h4>Three years after the initial implementation of the energy reform, how would you characterize its success? Has it brought about the desired economic effects?</h4><p>The successful results of the energy reform are a reflection of the confidence of the new operators in our regulatory framework, which guarantees legal certainty and a favorable environment for the developing projects. We have achieved joint investments in both sectors for about USD70 billion from 112 companies, which will invest in the development of oilfields, seismic research, expansion of the natural gas transport system, and clean electric power stations. These investments promote the participation of multiple stakeholders, and stimulate the construction of productive infrastructure that fosters economic growth, competitiveness, and the creation of high quality jobs. This also offers consumers the opportunity to choose the supplier of their preference.</p><h4>In early 2017, you signed an agreement with your US counterpart to ensure the reliability of the interconnected Mexican and American energy grids. Why is this important for both countries?</h4><p>The agreement signed on January 7, 2017 established the basis and framework for an important technical collaboration between regulators of both nations, independent electric systems operators, and authorities responsible for the design of public policies, among other relevant actors who will guarantee the reliability of our electrical interconnected networks. The exchange of information and adoption of best practices will strengthen energy security in the region. Today, this line of work is being assessed as a priority by Mexican authorities along with the new administration of the US.</p><h4>What are your goals for Mexico's energy sector between now and 2018?</h4><p>The main objective for 2018 is that processes unchained by the energy reform are set in full motion, and its benefits are consolidated regarding employment, human capital formation, new perspectives for young people, the re-boosting of regional development, as well as being able to introduce to the Mexican energy market new products and services that provide consumers more opportunities to choose who they are buying from and at what cost. To achieve that, we will continue focusing our efforts in four main elements: sparking greater public and private investments in hydrocarbons and electricity, consolidating the energy markets, stimulating new supply options for end-users, promoting clean energy in order to reach clean-power generation national targets, and expanding the National Gas Pipeline Network in order to provide this more efficient and less contaminating fuel to more regions of the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Fibra-E, and how has it performed over the past year?</h4><p>It is important. One of the reasons we have not had any Fibra-E on the market yet is that, when the regulations were created, many people thought they would be similar to those of other Fibras, especially fiscally, which they were not. It took several months for many investors, companies, and brokerage firms to be convinced that certain modifications should be made to the way that Fibra-E works on the fiscal side. While they did change it, too many crucial months passed, during which it was not attractive for many companies to implement a project within Fibra. Now, the situation is different: companies are on board, and we want to have the first project in October. This is important because there are many projects, especially the one with Pemex. Since they need resources, Fibra-E is a good way for them to get some projects off the ground that will bring in funds. Once it is on the market, we will be able to understand and modify it. Despite the Trump issue, volatility is not always bad—and just this week we have a new IPO issue. Grupo Cuervo will also go on the market in 2016. Many companies want to make an IPO, but are affected by the current volatility.</p><h4>What would you say is the biggest challenge facing Mexico right now?</h4><p>The reforms driven by the president are huge, but the benefits will not be felt tomorrow. Many thought a magic wand would induce thousands of companies to invest here immediately. While this was wildly overoptimistic, the reforms are still good. But they are profound and will take time to be implemented. Since everything is relative, investors are not that afraid. Mexico was recently ranked 51st in terms of the best country in which to do business, which is still terrible since we are much larger than the 51st economy in the world, so we certainly have work to do. Transparency and corruption are still major issues keeping us back. There is also depreciation, though we are working in the right direction, and Mexico is growing while many other countries are not. We will have elections two years from now, which will create a situation similar to that all over the world. Thus, while we are much better off than some and worse off than others, I am still optimistic about this country. We got the reforms that were needed, the effects of which will be profound and last long into the future.</p><h4>What is the importance of MILA for Mexico?</h4><p>MILA is something that was created before by Peru, Chile, and Colombia, and Mexico joined two years ago as these four countries combined significantly increased the total market GDP that our companies would now have access to. When investors go to another country in Latin America and buy shares, it is a challenge. Many do so through accounts in New York or Miami. Since the other three member countries are less developed, it made sense for them to band together to have access to one larger market. Our expectations were positive, though we knew from the beginning that it was going to take time and people were going to have to get used to it. The stockbrokers would also have to promote its sale on the stock exchange, which is not our responsibility; hence, there were some delays in getting off the ground. Yet at least one firm that listed with MILA in 2016 had a successful IPO. Thus, it is unfortunate that so few IPOs happen in the region, but they have also recently been low in the US. Eventually, we would also like to issue debt in addition to shares to firms that can sell that debt to MILA. Overall, the outlook is positive. </p>]]></richbody0content>
