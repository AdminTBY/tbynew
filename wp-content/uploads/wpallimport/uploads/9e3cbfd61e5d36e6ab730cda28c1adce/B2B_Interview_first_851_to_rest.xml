		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What growth have you seen in the industry?<br></h4><p><strong>JOSÉ LUIS URIEGAS U.</strong> We started as a very small company in 1956. At that time, Mexico was trying to promote import substitution in the industry. As we were importing a lot, the plants were quite small. After some time, we decided that we could do much more than just substituting imports, and so in the 1970s we began to develop larger plants with state-of-the-art technology. The idea was to begin exporting. This really took off in the 1980s and 1990s. Integration has always been a challenge. Some sectors, such as oil and gas, are in state hands, whereas the rest of the chain is in private sector hands. We have worked to find ways to integrate the chain. We also work extensively with Pemex, as it provides us with raw materials and basic petrochemicals that we then turn into different products.</p><p><strong>SÉBASTIEN MASSON</strong> Our products end up in anything related to mobility, urbanization, food, and water. These are the four mega-trends in the world and these needs all exist in Mexico. There is a need to feed a large population, provide it with logistics and transport, and get water to every household and industry using it. LANXESS offers high-quality materials for the construction, coloring, plastic, food, packing, mining, and wood industries, among others. We also provide water treatment solutions. Fortunately, there is a significant amount of water in Mexico; however, where there are people there is no water, and where there is water there are no people. Also, there is a problem with safe drinking water and contamination, though we do provide solutions for this issue. In agriculture, we provide the raw materials for agro-chemicals. Biofuel could also be a possibility in Mexico's future, and we can contribute greatly to that. Another market for us is cosmetics. We have expanded into various industries and we will continue to do so. We believe sustainability is good for business. We believe that to improve sustainability there is a need for chemical solutions. LANXESS is strong in developing sustainable and environmentally friendly materials and products for this purpose.</p><h4>What will the benefits of Etileno XXI be moving forward?</h4><p><strong>JLU</strong> We won a government tender for a 20-year ethane contract. It is the first step to producing petrochemicals. The contract can also be extended to 35 years, so it is a very important element to justify what we are doing. We have completed the basic engineering works and have all the necessary technology. Between 80% and 90% of the site is prepared to receive the equipment and a plan was formulated in 2012 to have the project online by 2015. It is a total investment of around $4 billion. It is a massive part of our expansion plans. We will also try to develop our other divisions, particularly logistics. In my opinion, the logistics chain in Mexico is not as good as it could be, and we have the opportunity to develop the segment starting with the port facilities. We envisage the same company moving products inland and possibly to the door of the consumer. There are no companies that integrate the whole process currently.</p><h4>Where do you focus your product supply for this market?</h4><p><strong>SM</strong> We have three basic segments of activity: the first is polymers, plastics, and synthetic rubber, which are all geared mainly to the automotive industry; the second is chemicals; and the third is specialty chemicals for all kind of applications, from leather to construction, coloring, water treatment, biocides, and others. In Mexico, our larger markets are in the automotive and construction sectors. The automotive industry is a key market as we are leaders in it, especially in synthetic rubbers, in which we are the worldwide leader. Synthetic rubber is used mainly for the production of tires, but also for other applications in automotive and other sectors. We are also leaders in supporting the tire industry in developing high-performance tires for the future of the automotive industry, tires that not only perform better than ever, but are also more environmentally friendly as they allow drivers to reduce fuel consumption.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your company's role in the sector?</h4><p><strong>CARLOS A. ARRIOLA JIMENEZ</strong> IGASAMEX is a leading developer of natural gas distribution systems serving the industrial sector in Mexico. Since its inception in 1996, IGASAMEX has developed 30 natural gas systems spread across 12 states. Our highly professional team has deep expertise in all steps of the natural gas transportation value chain including engineering, right of way acquisition, permitting (federal, state, and municipal), construction, operation, and maintenance. Our growth strategy is guided by a strong moral compass and is based on strict adherence to our safety, integrity, and partnership values and on a long-term view of our business.</p><p><strong>ÁNGEL LARRAGA PALACIOS</strong> Gas Natural Fenosa has three active business lines in the country: gas distribution, a segment in which we are the leading company with some 1.3 million clients of the overall 2 million; electricity generation by combined-cycle plants that can generate up to 2,000 MW—we currently have four generation plants; and wind energy, an area that is quite new for the company and in which we are developing a wind farm that will generate and supply 234 MW.</p><h4>What are the steps that should be taken in order to realize Mexico's potential in the gas industry?</h4><p><strong>CAJ</strong> Our current regulatory framework is the main hurdle for the development of the very abundant unconventional dry gas reserves. PEMEX, the only entity constitutionally allowed to exploit hydrocarbons, must allocate scarce resources across multiple projects and has prioritized oil production, which is considerably more profitable than dry gas production under current market conditions. Unless regulatory changes are made to allow greater flexibility in the development of natural gas resources, it is likely that our reserves will remain underdeveloped and that the gas production deficit will continue to widen. However, increasing natural gas production in the short term is not necessarily the main priority when it comes to regulation. It seems far more important to develop a framework that allows Mexico to leverage its abundant resources to contribute to the long-term stability of the highly competitive North American natural gas market. That would allow Mexico to construct a sustainable comparative advantage in industries with high-energy intensity. All that said, the main issue for the Mexican gas sector right now is transport rather than production. The existing transportation capacity restrictions, both in terms of coverage and availability of existing infrastructure, are the main hurdle for the industry's short-term growth and relieving them should be the sector's top priority.</p><p><strong>ALP</strong> The country needs to rethink its energy policies at the national level in order to give a boost to the gas industry. The newly elected government of Mexico has to decide whether to allow a greater participation of the private sector in the industry or, on the other hand, further develop the gas industry through PEMEX.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the short term?</h4><p><strong>CAJ</strong> Our 2013 outlook is very robust; we expect to sustain if not accelerate our current growth trajectory. However, our business is very susceptible to macroeconomic trends, particularly the overall growth of the economy and regional natural gas price expectations. Even though we expect the Mexican economy to continue to gain positive momentum, we will keep an eye on Europe and the US, where the most meaningful short-term risks reside.</p><p><strong>ALP</strong> In order to further develop, the natural gas industry in Mexico needs to start shale gas exploration activities, further invest in infrastructure, and also improve and strengthen the regulatory framework. This would help us and the other players in the sector better understand the parameters in which we can operate. In this regard, the government has held talks with all the major players in the sector. However, no measures have been taken so far and we expect that within the newly elected government's term to see the parameters within which we can operate. At the same time, I believe that the sector has huge potential growth. The year 2013 will be very important for Gas Natural Fenosa as we have key projects coming up, especially in Mexico City, where we are constructing hundreds of kilometers of pipeline.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some common problems companies face when it comes to software?<br></h4><p><strong>EDMUNDO ROBERT HERNÁNDEZ</strong> I think that many inefficiencies lie in the fact that there is a lot of software piling up. Companies need to solve this problem fast so that they don't have to stop and figure out what would be the best way to connect all of the applications. If they don't do this then you have to add patches, and when you have too many patches then you have a "babel tower." You have to know your company's processes in order get the desired effect when implementing a new feature. We were speaking to a client worried about the budget for one of their systems. That piece of software was not useful anymore. He was worried because if he could not get the budget to maintain the software, he might be out of a job. So, he was pushing to get the budget to keep the software running even though it was useless to the company. This is a company that has more than 2,000 systems. Imagine; it's impossible for any executive on the board to know what each of the 2,000 pieces of software does for the company. These companies have thousands of people working in the IT area, which is servicing the rest of the company; it is a jungle. They are very large corporations, and they have a lot of power in the market. Of course, when you go inside these companies, you find a lot of inefficiencies that are natural to human organizations.</p><h4>Can you tell me about your migration to the cloud?</h4><p><strong>ROBERTO MIKSE</strong> We have online cloud services, which we call Autodesk 360. We are offering these types of services so that the customer can leverage them. For example, we provide services that have "infinite hour service farms," where we have the software and the customers can access the services from their computers within our servers. We have a designer and an architect that work on the design, and once this is completed they do a process called rendering, which is where they have a digital photograph becoming a real photograph. This takes hours and you need a lot of CPU power for this process.</p><p>Our clients usually don't have the time or money for that process, so what they do is use the cloud, where Autodesk has its servers with huge amounts of CPU power. The customer can send the service to us, and it goes through a process here. A result that could take days on our customer's computers takes less than an hour here. That is the service we provide through the cloud. Right now, we are offering many services, which is where the cloud is. You can be anywhere at anytime, using a huge amount of power, and it doesn't matter where you are.</p><h4>How sophisticated is Mexico in general in terms of IT implementation?</h4><p><strong>ERH</strong> I am pleased with Mexico. I think that in Mexico it is possible to find the latest technology. One of our customers was looking for assembler language capabilities. After going to India, China, and Israel, they were surprised to find that it was in Mexico, and we have been developing with mainframes for 40 years. The main reason for that, I think, is that the US companies were actually focusing on the US market during all these years. Therefore, Mexico had to solve and develop its own capabilities in the IT sector.</p><h4>How do you foresee mobile and social media impacting your business operations?</h4><p><strong>RM</strong> It is happening already. You can create a design using a mobile phone or an iPad. One of our products is AutoCAD WS. It is part of the cloud services we provide. The customer can use an iPad to change the blueprints of a building in real time. When they do that, it automatically goes to the servers or the computers, which is a major benefit because they can do design anywhere, anytime. It is happening already.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The aviation industry in Mexico is starting to take off and companies are looking to the country to set up operations because of its lower labor costs and skilled workforce.</h4><h4>Why are so many tier one and two aerospace manufacturing companies establishing operations in Mexico?</h4><p>MAURICIO ROJO Our people are fantastic and organized. When manufacturers give our workers the opportunity to improve their lifestyle, they are eager to become better. The help of external and local industries has proven that Mexican labor is not only cheap, but is also a nice blend between lower costs, attention to detail, and a sense of gratitude. Workers can afford cars and housing, and many of my employees' incomes have increased substantially over the last 12 years—some have bought houses and cars and others are travelling for the first time to the US or Europe.</p><h4>How do strategic partnerships affect your operations in Mexico, and what types of joint ventures do you look for?</h4><p>STéPHANE LAURET The main joint venture we have is with GE to produce an engine called the CFM56, which is equipped in 100% of the Boeing 737 fleet worldwide and is one of the two engines available for the Airbus A320. We have a 65% share of the market for A320s. With new and recent orders, we are producing more than 31,000 engines; so it is a real success story. In terms of growth, our clear priorities are the new Boeing 787 and 737 Max. For example, 95% of the harnesses for the Boeing 787 are manufactured in our plants in Chihuahua.</p><h4>How has the corporate restructuring of Hawker Beechcraft in the US and the potential emergence from bankruptcy that was announced in 2012 affected operations in Mexico?</h4><p>MR I wouldn't say that we were completely unaffected, but when you evaluate the numbers, there has been very little change. We were great in 2011, and exactly on target in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, we implemented our budget, and revenues were 20% over target. The immediate problem was that many of our vendors removed credit, as often happens during a bankruptcy, because they do not want to be caught up in a financial crisis. We were then stuck with a very significant delay in terms of vendors getting parts to us. They often wanted cash on delivery from us, so this affected cash flow, but we were very quick to respond and assure them that we are legally and financially accountable and operationally independent from Hawker Beechcraft in the US. We control all of our payables, treasury, and numbers, as these have been great for years.</p><h4>Where are your operations focused?</h4><p>SL The group is based in five places: Chihuahua, Querétaro, the State of Mexico, Tamaulipas, and Mexico City, where the headquarters is located. In our Mexico City office, we have a company that is the world leader for helicopter engines. Our Chihuahua site, which has more than 3,000 employees, is the world leader for engine harnesses. We have two factories in Chihuahua, and then in Querétaro we have another four factories for engine and landing gear parts as well as maintenance support. Safran is, among other things, the world's leading producer for single engines and landing gear. We also have other another factory with about 100 people in Tamaulipas, which focuses on a mix of aerospace and automobile parts. Right now, Chihuahua and Querétaro are the two main sites where we operate.</p><h4>Do your customers mainly come from Mexico or do they fly in from elsewhere?</h4><p>MR Our main customers come from Mexico. Toluca is the general aviation airport for Mexico City. Most of the owners and corporations are located in Mexico City and have their planes located there. About 30% of our customers fly out of the airport in Toluca, and the remaining 70% come from all over Mexico, even the most remote places. We work with customers from Cancún, Mérida, and Chihuahua.</p><h4>How difficult is it to build a talented workforce in this industry in Mexico?</h4><p>SL There was not a significant aerospace industry presence in Mexico 10 years ago, but in the last decade the industry has attracted a lot of investment from abroad. There are some very strong players here today, but there is also a lot more competition as the industry matures. We are therefore creating a strong campus presence to prepare for the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates your department from that of other areas and countries?<br></h4><p><strong>ALAN JARA URZOLA</strong> Meta is doing interesting work in the areas of petrochemicals and fertilizer production. We need investors that want to transform production by building a refinery that can produce petrochemicals, fertilizers, and other products. Another field, tourism, is also a very interesting possibility for the development of our department. We still lack very good hotels. In the places with natural beauty in the form of jungles, waterfalls, and rivers, there are no hotels, making it very hard for people to visit these areas. This lack of hotels is an opportunity for growth. Furthermore, in agriculture there are also many opportunities. We have the ability to produce sub-products of agriculture, and we are seeking ways to begin processing more value-added products.</p><p><strong>RODRIGO GUERRERO VELASCO</strong> Fortunately, we have six rivers that flow from the mountains. Basically, what we have is a strategic position. That was not as important in the past when the economy was developing; it was more a source of protection. It made more sense to put factories in Bogotá because most of the market was there. However, now with the free markets and the opportunities to export products, Cali has a unique position. Colombia historically was designed to look north to the Caribbean. We always looked toward Miami and New York City. Now, the economy has changed; it is the Pacific that is making a difference. We have cheaper real estate and human capital, and we are now seeing people return to Cali. One big differentiator from other areas of the country is that we have a port that is fairly close, and it is the only Colombian port of any significance on the Pacific coast. Bogotá and Medellí­n do not have a port, and we are building two new highways to bring us closer to them, as well as looking at improving railroad and pipeline infrastructure. Cali is the third largest city in Colombia, and it has nine universities and some of the best hospitals in Latin America. It also has qualified human capital and a sophisticated industry.</p><h4>What is the potential of your department becoming a major tourist destination?</h4><p><strong>AJU</strong> There are very interesting tourism opportunities in Meta. In Sierra Macarena, there is an astoundingly beautiful river called Caño Cristales. The department also boasts biodiversity in the form of special flora, well suited for adventure tourists who want to see mountains and rivers, and fauna, especially in terms of bird watching. The Department of Meta is one of the richest places in the world in terms of biodiversity. Therefore, adventure and ecotourism are very interesting opportunities for this area. Beyond that, agro-tourism is also possible because there are many farms with pleasant houses for people to visit. Villavicencio, the capital of the Department of Meta, is very close to Bogotá at only 87 kilometers away. In a few years, it will only be one hour away from Bogotá. To have the capital just one hour away would be a huge plus, as it is the biggest market we can have access to. Domestic tourism is also developing along with international tourism, especially in the ecology segment.</p><p><strong>RGV</strong> Traditionally, long before Cartagena, we were known as a place for tourism. Nowadays, Cartagena has taken over and probably has a much better environment. However, there is something in Cali's air that makes it very attractive. Salsa has become a major factor for attracting tourists, as the salsa here is danced much faster. You see people moving frantically and it becomes acrobatic. It is part of the culture, which is a good thing. You can go to the slums and in every barrio they have a salsa school with boys and girls beginning to learn when they're small.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the state of development is the private healthcare sector in Colombia?<br></h4><p><strong>LEOPOLDO GIRALDO VELÁSQUEZ </strong>Colombia has gone from a little over 20% of people with access to the public healthcare system to over 90%. Today, access to health services for the poorest communities in society is much better than it was previously. Along with increased access, the network of public hospitals has become stronger, and it provides higher quality standards, thanks in part to increased spending in health care, which today stands at around 8% of GDP. However, even though there has been an increase in investment, I believe public health care should have developed further by this point; I believe that the regulatory and governing bodies in the sector should have a clearer vision of what the public healthcare sector needs to achieve, and a path toward where we want to go. I think that we should improve controls and monitor issues in the system, which in the end should also improve the flow of economic resources. I believe that the system needs structural reforms to improve the quality of services, promote more transparency, and make economic resources more accessible.</p><p><strong>ANDRÉS AGUIRRE MARTÍNEZ</strong> The sector is rapidly developing and most of the players are non-profit organizations that are focused on generating research, results, and know-how for the sake of the development of the healthcare system in the country. I would say that all the revenues private institutions make are fully reinvested in developing infrastructure and acquiring technologically advanced equipment.</p><h4>What potential does Colombia hold to become a major center of medical tourism in the region?</h4><p><strong>LGV</strong> Colombia has excellent practitioners at the surgery, transplant, and traumatology levels. Today, we have many foreigners coming to Colombia to receive organ transplants, as well as to have plastic surgery. Colombia has left behind its image of being an insecure and undeveloped country, which has contributed to boost tourism figures at the national level, including the number of medical tourists visiting the country.</p><p><strong>AAM</strong> There are currently many ongoing initiatives in this area, and the country is actively promoting the development of a health tourism segment. In fact, Medellí­n has a group of institutions that is leading the way to set up a health cluster in the city. Some 400 foreign patients were treated in the city of Medellí­n in 2000, whereas in 2010 the figure went up to over 7,000 patients. The growth is starting to become more relevant due to the increase in services, higher standards, and relatively low price when compared to services in their home countries. In addition to this, the country is rapidly growing and has a vast and long tradition in training high-level medical professionals. Also, in the last few years we have seen an important increase in the number of Colombian doctors educated abroad that come back to work, and that is clearly benefiting the development of the healthcare sector.</p><h4>How would you assess the sector's workforce?</h4><p><strong>LGV</strong> Health education in Colombia is strongly focused on clinical processes, and over the years we have lacked emphasis on public health care at the educational level. I believe that young professionals are not being educated in a way to ensure that they can fit into the system. This is something that needs to be addressed.</p><p><strong>AAM</strong> There are several institutions specialized in training highly skilled and professional doctors nationally. However, many Colombians have been, and are, educated abroad. Once they finish their studies, they come back to work in Colombia. For example, we have many professionals here that studied in the Hospital Clí­nic de Barcelona, a leading institution internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the potential behind ecotourism in Colombia?</h4><p><strong>JAVIER GÓMEZ</strong> Today, 25% of the 2.8 million foreign visitors come here to enjoy our natural wonders. In terms of national tourism and ecotourism, we can talk about 25% of 10 million people. However, this figure is constantly growing and Colombians are becoming increasingly aware of the beauty of our tourism and nature.</p><p><strong>JUAN LEONARDO CORREA JARAMILLO</strong> I honestly believe that this is one of the segments that offers the greatest potential, because Colombia is very rich in terms of nature and natural resorts. However, we lack the expertise on how to exploit this potential. Colombia needs to step up its work in this particular segment, and closely work with local communities to make this product something more tangible and real for the future. In addition, we need to develop eco-friendly infrastructure to better attract visitors. Basically, we need to go from words to actions.</p><h4>What challenges is Colombia facing to further develop the tourism industry?</h4><p><strong>JG</strong> I believe one of the main challenges is language. Colombia lacks the tradition of welcoming worldwide foreigners, and therefore there are very few people who fluently speak a second or even a third language. We must boost training opportunities at the language level. Also, we still need to change the stereotypes about Colombia at the global level, because we have come a long way but people still believe that we are a very insecure country. Finally, there are emerging destinations within Colombia, and we need to know how to capitalize on such potential to make it a reality. We have high hopes for the future and for the peace process, and we believe that it will contribute to promoting the image of Colombia, along with other initiatives such as nationwide tourism promotional campaigns and strategies.</p><p><strong>JLCJ</strong> The greatest challenge ahead is the development of road infrastructure, because that would boost other economic sectors. I believe that the implementation of a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme for the development of infrastructure projects nationally would work. That is something the current government is highly aware of, and is already working toward. At the same time, the government is tackling past patterns and mistakes in terms of corruption and the breach of legal agreements. I am very optimistic for the future; however, we cannot rest on our laurels, as we have to keep pushing the above issues because they hold the key for the development of all economic sectors. In addition, we need to further work on international air connections with all our airports, because that would boost the arrival of larger numbers of tourists not only in Bogotá, but the entire country. Finally, I would like to stress the importance of keeping up with the security efforts that have contributed to change many old stereotypes about Colombia. We have many opportunities ahead, and we need to keep working in the same direction that the last two governments were heading.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Colombia as a tourism destination?</h4><p><strong>JG</strong> The country has a variety of traditions, cultures, natural spaces, ecosystems, and also people. Colombians are very friendly and welcoming, and that makes us stand out against competition. I truly believe that if Colombia hadn't been affected by social conflicts, we would be the leading tourism destination worldwide thanks to our natural richness and variety.</p><h4>How has the number of tourists visiting Colombia evolved over the years?</h4><p><strong>JLCJ</strong> President Santos set up an ambitious goal for the country and the tourism industry to reach 4 million visitors per year, and the entire industry is very committed to it. I believe that we will close 2013 with around 3.2 million tourists. Such a figure is very positive; however, the growth of the hospitality sector is much higher, and if we want to make the new hotel infrastructure profitable, we will need to attract more than 4 million visitors per  year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the mining sector in Colombia and its future potential?<br></h4><p><strong>EDUARDO CHAPARRO </strong>Many people say that this isn't a mining country, but a country with mines. In my opinion, they are wrong, because for more than a millennium people in Colombia have been developing mining activities for various purposes and different targets, whether religious or military, or for the production of salt, coal, gold, copper, and semiprecious stones. From the 16th until the 19th century, the Spaniards were in Colombia looking for gold and silver. Gold was the principal metal used in ritual and political activities. At the beginning of the 20th century, Colombia was one of the biggest players in gold production in the entire world. However, as a result of the civil war at the beginning of the 20th century, the economic crisis led to very poor technical conditions for many economic activities. Furthermore, social conflict and military activity in many areas of Colombia stopped international interest in exploration for metals for many years. But at the same time, we established a new mining law, which is the current legislation. Colombia has, along with Venezuela, the greatest potential for metals and minerals in all of Latin America.</p><h4>What segment of the mining industry holds the largest potential?</h4><p><strong>CESAR E. DÍAZ GUERRERO</strong> Colombia is a worldwide superpower in the coal segment. It is the fourth largest exporter and has the largest reserves of coal in the entire Latin American region. In addition, Colombia is one of the main producers and exporters of emeralds in the world, where there are plenty of opportunities for investors, and produces one of the highest quality emeralds known. In the gold segment, Colombia used to be among the top three producers and exporters in the world many years ago, but today we are not even in the top 10. However, I believe that if the right investments are made and the right measures are taken, the country can get back to the old days. In addition to all that, the country holds extensive reserves of copper, platinum, nickel, and other minerals that have yet to be explored and exploited. At the same time, Colombia has huge potential in other mineral segments.</p><h4>What are your expectations for coal production this year?</h4><p><strong>EC</strong> Our highest production is in coal, and we will probably reach 90 million tons this year. The legal production limit for gold is 12 tons. We are one of the four producers of ferronickel in the Americas. Colombia produces more than 300 million cubic meters of sandstone for civil works. And obviously, parallel to this are raw industrial materials such as cement. We have investments in Ecuador, Venezuela, Central America, the US, and Mexico. At the same time, Mexican investment in the cement sector is targeted towards Colombia.</p><h4>What measures need to be implemented at the governmental level to further develop the sector?</h4><p><strong>CDG</strong> The sector needs a clearer regulatory framework, as well as a longer-term vision, because investments in the mining industry are always made with the future 20 years in mind. In addition, much pedagogic work needs to be done at the national level in order to explain to Colombian citizens the new mining industry, the use of advanced technologies, its compromise with the environment, and so on. This is because many people still link today's mining industry with old methods. Such a step would positively contribute to achieving greater social acceptance. I believe that these three elements are key for the further development of the industry, and I would like to stress the importance of such strategies at all the levels, both state and private. In this regard, the government of Colombia is to implement, by the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013, a new mining code that will set the pace and the scene for the development of the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has new technology played in increased oil production?<br></h4><p><strong>FERNANDO I. SANABRIA</strong> The use of new 3D seismic technology has enabled more efficient evaluations of the subsurface, and led to the identification and production of new fields in Colombia in recent years. This and the application of technologies such as horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic stimulation should enhance production in the country, particularly in unconventional oil and gas. On the other hand, ExxonMobil's reputation as the industry leader is supported by the fact that we develop proprietary technology to explore and produce oil and gas resources  around the world. We believe that we can bring value to Colombia, and help the government achieve production goals.</p><h4>How would you assess the investor climate in the oil and gas sector in the country?</h4><p><strong>CAMILO F. DURÁN MARTÍNEZ</strong> These are interesting times in terms of FDI and the arrival of new investors. The country decided to change the investment conditions governing the sector a few years ago, and that attracted a lot of interest from large players in the sector. Today, Colombia has a very accessible government, a good reputation for respecting contracts, and serious financial institutions. It is very open to business and that makes it stand out in the region. In addition, the old picture of Colombia that everyone had, especially investors, has also changed for the better. Colombia has gone from almost being a failed country back in the late 1990s to a place where everyone wants to be, and members of its political elite are well educated and very competitive professionals that know where they want to take the country. Such parameters do not only apply to the oil and gas sector, but to all sectors.</p><h4>Where do you see ExxonMobil in the next 10 years?</h4><p><strong>FS</strong> We believe that Colombia has attractive opportunities for investment in the upstream sector. At ExxonMobil, we are particularly looking forward to continue growing in the upstream business by developing long-term partnerships to advance the country's overall energy needs. We are very pleased with the results in the past Colombia 2012 Tender Round, where ExxonMobil and Ecopetrol were the highest bidders for three blocks, namely COR 46, COR 62, and VMM29, which were awarded on November 21 by the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (ANH). Jointly with Ecopetrol, we look forward to our future exploration efforts and participation in the development of Colombia's natural resources. Additionally, ExxonMobil has participation in the CPE-3 block in Vichada, and we are in the process of obtaining ANH assignment approval in order to formalize our participation in the VMM2 and VMM37 blocks in the Middle Mag.</p><p><strong>CDM</strong> The business is getting very competitive, and there are plenty of opportunities for growth. In Colombia an average of 350,000 new cars are sold a year, whereas in Argentina this number is above 800,000. This shows you the opportunities the country offers in the downstream segment. However, we need the infrastructure to make these things happen, and I believe it is just a matter of time. At the same time, Ecopetrol is currently upgrading its two refineries, and that would enable the market to grow further. We see a lot of activity also in the upstream sector, for we have seen a lot of interest in developing the potential Colombia has in this area. There are tremendous opportunities, and my only concern is whether the government understands that since this is a long-term business, it needs to maintain stable rules and put up the required resources to be able to manage the expected levels of investment that are coming in. In this regard, ExxonMobil is ready to further grow its participation in the sector, because we have been here for many years now, both in good times and bad, and we are highly committed to the development of the sector and the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Colombia's economy and the energy sector in the medium term?</h4><p><strong>FS</strong> Ecopetrol has played an important role in the Colombian energy sector due to its expansion of E&amp;P activity in the country. We believe that Ecopetrol will continue to be a key player in the years ahead. We also expect that investments in the oil and gas sector will continue to grow as ANH promotes exploration in the country through public bid rounds. As in any business, we do face challenges. Efficient permitting processes and infrastructure are key to developing our projects in a cost-effective and timely manner. We believe that the industry and government need to work closely together to ensure that the benefits of current and future activities are fully realized, by having more efficient permitting processes.</p><h4>How would you rate Colombia's workforce in the sector?</h4><p><strong>CDM</strong> Colombian executives are very well educated at the international level, and they are fluent in English and other languages. Education is seen as the most important investment for Colombian families, and at the moment there is an influx of young Colombians moving back to the country after having studied abroad. However, despite the labor market being pretty hot right now, we have a shortage of petroleum engineers, for we lack the tradition and the institutions to teach in that area. Colombia needs that local expertise in the field if it wants to further develop in this area. Venezuelans educated in the petroleum industry that have migrated to Colombia are helping us to fill the gaps.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We are present in the country with two lines of services, which are directional drilling and contract drilling. We are just starting our operations in Colombia, so it will take some time to develop them. For the time being, we are involved exclusively in exploration. The construction of pipelines is very strategic for the country, and will definitely affect our business, but not in a very direct way. Nevertheless, the Colombian market provides an increasing number of opportunities. There is also the possibility to improve the pipelines, which would be very interesting from a strategic point of view. If these lines connected the Atlantic Ocean over the basin of Venezuela with the Pacific coast, it would also be very strategic. However, there are certain conditions that are not favorable for investing in the country, such as the fact that negotiations take a very long time, and this will affect operations.</p><h4>What advantages does CAMPETROL offer its affiliates?</h4><p><strong>HERMES AGUIRRE</strong> We have been gathering an understanding of the service industry in Colombia for a long time. For every employee the service company hires, there are 3.5 employees that are getting work outside of the industry, such as in hotels and other services provided externally. That is a huge impact. We have been trying to get the government and operators closer to the service industry. If we can execute and do our job better, then that brings benefits to both communities and operators. We are the link. We also work with royalties to get the best alliance with operators. In the past, each operator worked with 20 or 50 different service companies with 20 or 50 contracts. Most of them were related to the same areas in terms of risk, regulations, and legal formalities, but were not necessarily the same service. Some service companies, because of a lack of understanding or competitiveness, surrendered some of their rights, creating an unequal balance in the industry. CAMPETROL has been working very closely with Ecopetrol and other operators in order to create a framework of contracts more aligned with the development of the industry.</p><h4>What are your expectations for oil and gas production in Colombia in the medium term?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong> The country has huge potential and there is a political willingness from major institutions to develop new projects. Everyone wants to achieve the goal of reaching 1 million or 500,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) in the next five or six years, but it is a challenge because alongside this goal we need to improve a variety of processes that are not yet ready. I see the country moving rapidly, but not all sectors are moving at the same speed; there are some parts that still need to improve. I believe that Colombia should increase its capabilities in refining, which is being done through the development the new refinery in Cartagena. Considering the quantity of oil produced by the country, we will need to build higher capacity facilities. There have been strong efforts in the country to implement new technology and achieve more advanced equipment for exploration and production, but my main feeling is that the highest increase in production is due to the improvement of security, which is the key point that paved the way for growth in oil production.</p><h4>What main challenges are service companies facing?</h4><p><strong>HA</strong> Colombia has a number of topographic challenges, and this obviously has an impact on the industry. There has also been a lack of proper investment in infrastructure, making mobility an issue. For example, trying to get hold of the necessary equipment is a huge task. The equipment we manage at Campetrol is heavy in nature, and we encounter a lot of challenges moving it around the country and accessing specific areas. At times it is very costly, or almost impossible. In addition, security is obviously a challenge as well. When we talk about security, we mean industrial security and physical security. We face security challenges every day because we do not have the necessary facilities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Cenit's main investment plans in the short term?<br></h4><p><strong>CAMILO MARULANDA LÓPEZ</strong> The oil industry has changed significantly in Colombia in the last few years; previously, there used to be only a small number of players, all of them large companies that were developing infrastructure as they needed. Over the last three years, Ecopetrol's group has invested around $4 billion in the mainstream segment, and we planned an initial investment of $2.2 billion for 2013. We foresee three priorities in terms of projects: the finalization of the bicentennial pipeline, the expansion of the Colombian and Ocensa pipelines, and the strengthening of secondary pipelines that transport oil to the trunking pipelines. It is important for the company to target between three and four large projects in its first year of operation, and we aim to achieve that through our strategic plan.</p><h4>How do you assess the infrastructure for pipelines in Colombia, and what are the main challenges you are facing in this sector?</h4><p><strong>JOHN GEREZ</strong> Infrastructure is a major issue. Our business is pipelines and there are currently restrictions. There is more oil to be transported than there is capacity. There is a lot of oil that is either being transported by truck or not being transported at all. The most efficient way to transport oil is by pipeline. We expect that there are many opportunities here for new pipeline projects. Colombia has recognised that there is a need to develop its infrastructure. Ecopetrol has been actively involved in the development of new pipeline infrastructure. We see the creation of Cenit, the new transportation arm of Ecopetrol as an independent company, as a very positive step and we think that there is room for other players as well to fill the gap and the needs in transportation infrastructure. That is why we are here.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Colombian energy sector in the medium to long term?</h4><p><strong>CML</strong> The challenges the sector faces can be categorized into the following areas: environmental licensing, social responsibility with minority communities in the region, and security. The sector has a strong and stable regulatory framework and profitable activity, and that is generating high levels of interest among foreign investors. Over the medium term, we foresee the arrival of specialized players, and at the same time the companies already operating in the sector will consolidate their positions and activities. I believe that there are plenty of opportunities in the sector, as there are important investment projects such as new pipelines. That could lead to the creation of synergies between different companies in the near future.</p><p><strong>JG</strong> I think that Colombia has a lot of prospects with a lot of potential in a number of different areas, not just in production. Now, there is great potential for heavy oil production in large areas that are unexplored or have no infrastructure. I believe that, as with any country that has gone through rapid growth in an industry, there needs to be some readjustment. There are issues, certainly with regard to environmental licensing, and there is also the issue of management of communities and social expectations, as well as security issues that need to be managed. There have certainly been lots of discussions about transporting Venezuelan crude through Colombia. The Venezuelans are interested in transporting through Colombia, and the Chinese are certainly involved in that. There have also been discussions and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ecuadorean government regarding some sort of connection. Also, having a Pacific export terminal and the option of transporting either to the US gulf coast or to the Pacific is very attractive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for the premium sector?<br></h4><p><strong>ANDRÉS FUSE</strong> In recent years, the automotive sector has been growing very fast. We broke records each year until 2011. Now, there is a slight slowdown in growth across the market. However, the slowdown in growth has only been about 0.2%. Nevertheless, it is at least a different pace from what we had experienced in previous years. Despite that, the premium segment has been growing above the rate of the market, and we have been increasing our penetration level. Compared to 2011, we are steady, as the premium segment continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate.</p><p><strong>MATHIAS HELD</strong> The industry in Colombia, in terms of per capita vehicle sales, is well below the average in Latin America. If it reached per capita volumes similar to that of Brazil or other regional countries, this would mean doubling the whole volume of services per year. In 2012, the whole industry was expected to make around 300,000 vehicles, and I expect this to at least double in the next 10 years. Between 2015 and 2018, we will see 500,000-600,000 units produced per year. The premium segment will be growing above average.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the demand for automobiles?</h4><p><strong>AF</strong> The 3 Series is the most successful model in the BMW line up, and a mirror of what happens worldwide. This year was, in a way, a bridge year as we recently launched the sixth generation of the 3 Series. In addition, the 1 Series is picking up significant volume. Due to the kind of roads in our country, SUVs have also become a desired car in our portfolio. The X3 is the most preferred in the X range. Also, a few years ago people were trying to keep a low profile here. You never knew what was going to happen in Colombia if you showed off too much. The good thing is that now having a BMW or a premium car is no longer contrary to keeping a low profile.</p><p><strong>MH</strong> We are identifying a market niche that is growing above the industry average because we are seeing that, on the one hand, the strength of the currency is making even luxury imports more accessible for many people in the country, and on the other hand, we have a strong reduction in financial costs and interest rates that makes the financing of these vehicles more affordable. We are also seeing a reduction in import tariffs due to the free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US and Europe, which will also lead to a reduction in prices. It makes vehicles in the luxury segment, which have always been an aspiration, more accessible.</p><h4>What impact will the FTA boom have on the automotive segment?</h4><p><strong>AF</strong> We import cars from the US and Europe. As a result of FTAs, customers in Colombia will see a decline in the cost of cars over the medium to long term. Nevertheless, it is 100% dependent on what the exchange rate is going to be at that point in time. There will be a reduction in import tax, which is going to be progressive. In the case of the US, it is going to be 3.5% over a 10-year period. That means that on a yearly basis, the government is going to reduce import tax by 3.5%. At the end of the 10-year period, it will have dropped to 0%. Nevertheless, the exchange rate will still affect affordability. A similar system will apply to the EU, except the import tax rate is going to drop from 35% to 0% over seven years.</p><h4>What role do services such as financing play in the industry?</h4><p><strong>MH</strong> We are working on bringing our financial arm, Daimler Financial Services, here to hopefully start operations within the next couple years. We will be expanding our service network according to volume growth. There is a need for more dealers, workshops, and service points around the country, and we have a development plan for the next couple of years. This is not direct Daimler investment because we nominate third-party dealers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Colombia's port infrastructure?<br></h4><p><strong>MAURICIO SUÁREZ RAMÍREZ</strong> The government came to concession companies, such as the one we have in Santa Marta, and negotiated significant investments of over $1 billion for the four main port terminals. In Santa Marta, we made a compromise for $127 million, $100 million of which had to be invested between 2008 and 2013. The same had to be done at the three other terminals. We are now finishing the first stage of the second phase of concessions. We were also paying royalties to the government of $2.5 million. Now there is new technology, more efficiency, increased investment, and better infrastructure—it is an entirely new system as a result of these investments. The success has been complemented by the government, which has made investments outside of the terminals, specifically in terms of connectivity between them. More than 70% of the Colombian market is located over 800 kilometers from the coast, and it is very expensive to transport goods because of the topography and roads in Colombia.</p><p><strong>RENE PUCHE</strong> Since the privatization of the Sociadades Portuaria back in 1993 there has been a complete turnaround and change in the way the ports are servicing the community. The profitability of the port is higher than it was before, and the productivity and efficiency of the port's facilities have increased dramatically. The change has been fantastic in terms of facilities and in terms of the infrastructure inside the port. The limitation, however, comes once you leave the port. That is where we are still lagging behind. We do not use the rail or the Magdalena River because there is a lack of infrastructure in Colombia. To give an example, to bring a vessel from the Baltic with 25,000-30,000 tons to Colombia will cost you $35 or $40 per ton. To bring one truck from Barranquilla to Bogotá will cost you almost $100 per ton. You are talking about 1,000 kilometers versus 10,000 kilometers.</p><h4>Do you have any new alliances on the horizon?</h4><p><strong>MSR</strong> There is one potential alliance that is very promising, and we are betting on its formation. It is with a Colombian logistics company, OPL Cargo, which handles more than 2 million tons of cargo in Colombia. It operates trucks and coordinate logistics for its customers. We are working to make an investment with it, and bought 300 acres of land with 2.4 kilometers of river for a dock terminal. It is 400 kilometers south from the mouth of the Magdalena River. Railroads cross over the 300 acres we bought, so we expect to build a multi-modal terminal for the railway to connect with Santa Marta as well as a river to connect to our terminal in Barranquilla. There, we are making new investments with SSA Marine in a container terminal, a project slated to begin in April 2013.</p><h4>What are some advantages of having the Rio Magdalena to transport goods inside Colombia?</h4><p><strong>RP</strong> The farthest you can go by the river is Barrancabermeja, but you cannot go everyday of the year. For example, in February, there is no water there. You have to wait for the rainy season. We have to work on the port. If you look at Barranquilla, it is not facing the river. It would be more efficient and cheaper to go from point A to point B, because no one else has that. Santa Marta or Buenaventura don't have that. We should be able to transport goods around the country cheaper, but we need to work together.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most significant routes?</h4><p><strong>RAíšL DONADO OSIO</strong> The most popular route is from Barranquilla to Bogotá. Many companies consider Bogotá a hub and as soon as the city experiences a traffic jam, the entire country is affected. Barranquilla has a 3,000-meter runway and an excellent geographic situation. As the bridge between North America and South America, we are one of the most important airports in the region. However, we need to create an acropolis to complement and encourage the growth of the airport. Although we can give the people of Barranquilla an excellent airport, if the government does not create different attractions for the city, it will go largely unused. Major airlines don't decide to fly to Barranquilla because we have the best airport; they come here based on the amount of passengers traveling to visit the city. The best example of this phenomenon is in Cartagena. Although the airport is not as efficient as ours, Cartagena has many attractions in the tourism, finance, and education sectors. </p><p><strong>MARIA CLAUDIA GEDEÓN</strong> In 2011, we moved 2.15 million passengers, and in 2012 we moved 2.88 million people. In 2013, we are expecting to transport 3 million people. We expect an increase in passengers from the East Coast of the US, and also from the EU that will use the connection in New York to come to Cartagena. Nationally, it is Bogotá. That is our main market. Medellí­n is second, and Cali is third. Fourth would be San Andrés, Pereira, or Bucaramanga. Internationally, we have 18 flights a week to Panama, which is almost three daily. We have a daily service to Miami. We have four or five flights a week to Fort Lauderdale and three flights a week to New York through JetBlue. We are negotiating to bring airlines from South America to connect the south directly to Cartagena. We are also looking for more US carriers and maybe one from Europe, hopefully from Spain. However, that is on hold currently due to the economic crisis. I think that Cartagena is going to become the main tourist attraction of Colombia. Right now, the large US hotel chains are building their hotels there now. We have Hyatt, Sheraton, Hampton Inn, Radisson, and others. They are all opening within the next two years, which will help put Cartagena on the map for the US market.</p><h4>How do you see the air transportation sector developing in the country?</h4><p><strong>RDO</strong> The airport is also working to convince an airline to establish its hub here in Barranquilla, which would be an excellent point from which to distribute passengers and cargo to the Caribbean islands and Central America. We can make agreements with airlines such as Avianca to become feeders of a company that has a hub here and operates both inbound and outbound flights. At the moment, the only international flights from our airport are to Miami and Panama. If passengers are headed to Aruba, it is necessary to first travel to Bogotá. This is inefficient because Aruba is so close to Barranquilla. This is why we need to convince at least one company to establish a hub here. It doesn't have to be huge carrier—just a medium-sized airline with planes capable of transporting between 50 and 100 passengers on a craft such as the Airbus A318.</p><h4>How important is this airport for Cartagena and the Colombian economy?</h4><p><strong>MCD</strong> Cartagena is very important for the Colombia government as a tourist destination; we are the second city to visit in the country and the main destination after Bogotá. The Colombian government wants to have 4 million international passengers by 2014 when President Santos ends his term. Because the port of Cartagena is the most efficient one on the Caribbean coast for the last four or five years, it helps Cartagena's economy and the industry here. Also, Cartagena is a place where many foreigners are buying second houses. That helps the Colombian economy and is making Cartagena become a main destination for tourism.<span></span><br></p>]]></richbody0content>

QUINTANA</strong> Over the years, Maersk Colombia SA has achieved a high level of quality in its services; we are the leading company in the market in terms of schedule reliability and volume transported both in imports and exports, which makes us a very competitive company in the industry. In addition, Maersk operates in a special terminal in the Buenaventura port, which is a part of the main maritime infrastructure in Colombia to ship goods to and from Asia, making us more efficient in our services than any other shipping line in the country. We are clearly moving in the same direction as our customers demand better efficiencies in their logistic chain. Since we are an international company, Maersk's fleet is comprised of more than 600 vessels that can carry 3.8 million TEUs with a very reliable and comprehensive worldwide coverage.</p><h4>How is the recently ratified free trade agreement (FTA) with the US affecting Maersk's operations?</h4><p><strong>NÉSTOR AMADOR</strong> We have reviewed a number of our internal studies and discovered that when an FTA comes into effect it takes two to three years to start seeing any major developments. However, it might vary from segment to segment depending on commercial activity. Logistic segments outside the container businesses, which are what we focus on, tend to have a much quicker response to commercial agreements between countries. In our particular segment, we have seen no immediate trigger effect. However, we are very much looking into the matter to further increase and consolidate our position in the market with the US specifically.</p><h4>What is behind the company's strategy to increase intra-American tariffs?</h4><p><strong>FHQ</strong> Considering Maersk's freight tariffs, it is clear that our rates are below 2008 standards. Over the years, we have maintained our freight rates, and we needed to increase our tariffs due to high oil prices. In the last few years, we have grown significantly and our strategy is to incorporate larger vessels, gaining economies of scale making us more competitive at the international levels. In this regard, increasing rates is one of the decisions we have made to try to improve economic results; something the entire industry is aiming at.</p><h4>Which routes are the most important for Colombia?</h4><p><strong>NA</strong> From our business activity, we can say that Asian import routes as well as the intra-American markets are the most significant. In fact, 42% of our 106,000 TEUs belong to Asian markets—38% imports and 4% exports. In terms of the intra-American segment, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama are the main markets we work with representing around 30% to 35% of our current business. The automotive sector, including cars, motorbikes, and trucks, is one of the most important sectors for our company's activity in the country.</p><h4>How would you assess Cartagena as an international hub?</h4><p><strong>FHQ</strong> Cartagena is clearly becoming a center for transshipment infrastructure and showing a significant growth rate. Cartagena's port will close 2012 with around 2 million TEUs in transshipment, a figure very close to MIT Panama, although Cartagena does not have the same resources as Panama in terms of cranes. On top of that, Cartagena does not have the labor and trade unions problems Panama does. However, the Buenaventura port is more important for Maersk's activity today as a result of our cargo flows, especially in the Asia trade to Buenaventura.</p><h4>What have been the main import-export trends you have observed in the market over the years?</h4><p><strong>NA</strong> The balance for our flows is 70% imports and 30% exports. Within the last few years that Maersk has been in the country, we have experienced substantial growth in both trades, especially in the imports segment. Maersk is expected to close 2012 with an overall annual growth of 12%. In 2012, we have made a variety of special network changes in the exports segment, and we will end the year with flat growth in this particular area, as a result of some services being close.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for the coffee and chocolate sectors?</h4><p><strong>CARLOS E. PIEDRAHÍTA A.</strong> The consumption of coffee in Colombia has only grown 2% or 3% in volume terms. The problem is that the Colombian crop has decreased in size. We have entered a deficit regarding local coffee producers, and we are forced to import coffee from other countries. The Peruvian bean is the closest to Colombian tastes, so we import most of our coffee from Peru. It is a high-quality Arabica coffee, very similar to Colombian. In a blend, it keeps the same profile as Colombian coffee. Even other Colombian producers are importing from different countries. This is disappointing because Colombia used to produce nearly 13 million bags, and now we are down to 7 million. There are many commitments to export coffee, and this has created a shortfall from the producers.</p><h4>How has the bank's product portfolio evolved over the past five years?</h4><p><strong>EDUARDO PACHECO CORTÉS</strong> We had a crisis at the turn of the century, and at that time Colpatria had 75% of its business in mortgages. What we learned from that was that we have to be much more diversified. The dynamics of consumer credit are very good. Even though we are a mid-sized bank in the country, we are the largest issuer of credit cards. We have been working with credit cards for many years, and it is the jewel in our crown. That has been the part of the business, which has grown the most.</p><h4>How do you see Nutresa evolving over the next decade?</h4><p><strong>CP</strong> If I look 10 years in the past, Nutresa was much more domestic and had a small footprint in other countries. In the last decade, we have expanded a lot, and I expect we will continue to expand in other parts of the world over the next decade as well. Our international sales are close to 30% of our total sales at the moment, and we hope to increase this number to around 50%. We are also committed to sustainable development. Nutresa is one of the nine food producers in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and its vision includes geographic expansion with a balance between the social and environmental dimensions. We will be a global company, but a sustainable one, and hopefully one with a carbon-neutral footprint.</p><h4>Do you have any further plans to expand abroad?</h4><p><strong>EPC</strong> We are in Mexico and Peru already. We have been in Mexico for almost 10 years, and we are planning to expand into two other cities. Our short-term strategy is to move into Puebla and diversify into other cities. Peru has been a different experience because we are in the housing sector, which is why we went to Peru. We do housing in Mexico too, but in Peru it is different because we also do some retail construction. We were part of a group that won a major contract that brings all the minerals in from the mountains to Lima. Peru has become a much more amplified portfolio than what we have in Mexico, and we expect that to continue. I do not see Colombian local banks being sold to foreigners in the near future. In the next five to 10 years, 7%-8% of the Colombian banking sector is going to be run by Colombians. BBVA is the biggest foreign bank here, but it should be Colombian run. We grew at a rate of 5% in the second quarter, and it is a reasonable rate compared to the rest of the world. However, we need to grow at rates of 8%-10%. The biggest challenge of Colombia is for people to realize that we are all equal. It is a question of education. It is easy to say, but not easy to do.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the insurance sector in Colombia?<br></h4><p><strong>MAURICIO GARCÍA</strong> Ortiz The penetration of insurance products among the Colombian population is still very low, and therefore it holds huge potential for future development. Although only 26% of Colombian vehicles have insurance, compulsory insurance for traffic accidents is only offered by seven companies in the market, and penetration rates stand at 75%; the demand for these products is very high. In addition, home insurance against earthquakes and fire is one of the products that has the highest penetration rate, because it is a compulsory line and banks offer it. However, Colombia still faces a long road ahead in terms of strengthening the insurance culture among the population. At the same time, the industry is very well regulated, and thanks to intensive market research, it is increasingly integrating services and standards to meet international levels. For example, we have learned much from the Spanish insurance market in terms of products and initiatives. Last but not least, the recent free trade agreements (FTAs) will have a very positive impact on the further development of the industry in our country. In this regard, we may see new foreign companies entering the market in the near future.</p><p><strong>ALEJANDRO SAMPER CARREí‘O</strong> The insurance sector has been growing dynamically in the past few years. Actually, statistics show that insurance premiums grew about two times faster than real GDP growth in Colombia, which is more or less in line with the rest of Latin America. That translates into a larger penetration of insurance today. However, there is still very low penetration and a low density of insurance in Colombia compared to some other countries and markets in the region. There are positives in the growth of insurance and our economy, which translates into opportunities for companies involved in the insurance business. When it comes to culture, unfortunately, insurance is not common. There needs to be a large education effort, which, if done correctly, will mean huge opportunities. As a company, we offer education but it has to be something that really reaches larger amounts of the population. We all have to continue with our best efforts education-wise, but unfortunately people learn most when some radical event takes place.</p><h4>What role does diversification play in creating a wider insurance culture in Colombia?</h4><p><strong>MGO</strong> Demand for insurance products has grown marginally in the last couple of years. However, we have been able to target a wider spectrum of society by offering new and more tangible products, as well as providing more services along with insurance policies, so people can realize the benefits of having an insurance policy. For example, Liberty has focused heavily on developing its micro insurance segment in the last few years, and we have been a pioneer company in the industry. We have always prioritized consumer positions and needs in each particular case. Overall, we have seen very significant growth in the past year in this particular segment, and I firmly believe that insurance has a huge potential for development in the near future.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy?</h4><p><strong>ASC</strong> Going back five to seven years, this company had a large concentration in government business. Approximately 80% of our business was with government and 20% in the private sector. We have changed significantly over the last four years; the breakdown is 60% private and 40% government. Over the past five years, we have been increasingly participating in the private insurance business without decreasing our business with the government. The company has grown more or less in line with the market. In 2012, the market grew around 11% in general insurance, and we grew around 4%. This was mainly because we did not grow in auto and mandatory auto insurance. Both of these categories make up about 42%-45% of the industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led the company to invest in Iran?<br></h4><p><strong>OSMAN AKSOY</strong> The relationship between Hayat Holding and Iran started many years ago. One of the companies in the holding, Kastamonu Integrated Wood Industry, has exported its products for around 15 years to Iran. Kastamonu Integrated is the sector leader in Turkey and a well-known brand in Iran as well. Due to this strong relationship, the decision to invest was made. There are very deep cultural connections between Iran and Turkey. Iran enjoys stable management with a population approaching 75 million. There is a visa exemption between the two countries, and this provides a level of trade that has continued to increase. Eventually, the holding decided to invest in Iran via Hayat Chemicals, which is also present in Algeria, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. It produces cleaning products under the Bingo brand, the hygiene products Molfix and Molped, and the Papia, Familia, and Teno cleaning products. Pars Hayat was established in two phases. The first phase of the investment was completed at Abhar in Zanjan Province in 2011. We started the production and sale of diapers under the Molfix brand and hygienic pads under the Molped brand. Currently, we have a significant share of the Iranian market. The second phase of the investment has started and is focused on tissue paper.</p><p><strong>JAN WAGENSVELD</strong>  Danone has been looking at Iran since 2005 or 2006. Eventually, Danone struck a deal with a local partner with whom it set up a joint venture in August 2008. Basically, the facilities were already there, as the partner had already built the factory in Mashhad a couple of years earlier. Around that time, it started its own business producing milk powder for babies and adults. Various companies began looking at this plant in order to enter the Iranian market because of the country's high population, which sees the birth of around 1.5 million babies every year. It is one of the most populous countries in the region, and so there was a real long-term strategic intent from the side of Danone to make an entry into this market. There are actually four Danone divisions here in Iran, including water, dairy, and medical nutrition. Danone signed the deal in August 2008 with the local partner, forming the new company called Nutricia-MMP. MMP stands for Mashhad Milk Powder Industry. Its first product was launched in April 2009, while the long-term goal is to achieve profitability through targeted investment. We are marketing two global Danone brands here: Bebelac and Aptamil.</p><h4>What innovations have you introduced to the Iranian market?</h4><p><strong>OA</strong> We use the highest technology in the hygiene sector. We utilize the most modern machinery and produce the most modern products. We pay high importance to this matter in Turkey, too. We highly appreciate innovation and are always ready to invest. When people wanted to save money for the future, they used to do it "under the pillow." Now, that money is spent on new investments. We also invest in increasing capacity.</p><p><strong>JW</strong> Bebelac is, from a product point of view, innovative in its category. One of the key problems with babies is digestive issues. This is always a concern, especially in their first year. They can also suffer stomach problems, and that can result in colic pains, regurgitation, and so on. We have a specialized product for regurgitation, for example, called Bebelac AR (Anti-Regurgitation). Digestive problems, like constipation, are also among the main concerns of mothers. In order to help mothers, we have specialized products in the digestive area under the Bebelac platform. Aptamil is more about increasing a baby's immunity level, which is basically built up during the first five years of life. That is when you become strong and are able to resist bacteria and overcome certain illnesses. Aptamil's specialized product range focuses on things like allergies. Many babies have allergies, and we have a number of specialized products under the Aptamil umbrella to address this area. Rather than bringing out just another general type of infant formula, we came up with a number of specialty products, in addition to our regular product lines. We have some very specialized products for babies that have problems, either in the area of digestion or in the area of allergy and immunity. However, when the baby is normal and healthy, then it does not need these products. For these babies, we also have the normal range, which are staged according to age. There is one from 0-6 months, one from 6-12, and one from one year to two years. We even have one called "Bebejunior," for infants above two years of age.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has made Iran so attractive to your company?<br></h4><p><strong>VINCENT LARNAUD</strong> When the Danone Group decided to take a majority stake in Damavand, the bottled-water market was underdeveloped and growing fast. Three years later it is still underdeveloped, but it is still growing fast. If we look at the past three years we experienced a volume growth rate of 10% to 15%, which is quite attractive for an FMCG company. When I say the market was and still is underdeveloped, I mean that the average per capita consumption of water is roughly 13 liters per capita, so it's a market of roughly 1 billion liters a year for 75 million Iranians. Turkey has a similar population and a market of 7 billion liters, seven times the market of Iran. Therefore, we know that this market is going to continue growing; the economy is a medium-large one and purchasing power is in the middle range. People will consume more bottled water, and we expect this market to keep on expanding the way it has been growing recently.</p><p><strong>MEHDI JEDDI</strong> As a brand, we are a household name, and nobody can deny that. The reason we've been very successful in Iran is because we filled a void at the right time. It's been close to 10 years since our product first entered the Iranian market, and when we entered the market, the fruit juice and drinks supply options were limited. Therefore, we were in the right place at the right time, and we continue to provide an excellent offering to the consumer. We offer the consumer actual fruit as part of the beverage experience, which is rare.</p><h4>What level of brand awareness have you developed?</h4><p><strong>VL</strong> The awareness of the brand is very high. When you go to a consumer and ask for a mineral water brand, 92% or 93% of them will say Damavand. We also aim to foster awareness of our specific formats, so whenever we launch a new format we advertise. The awareness of the brand is fairly high, which is exceptional. If a consumer asks for our product, it will be much easier for our sales team to put it on the shelves. The sports cap format experienced major success in the north of Tehran, the wealthiest part of the city. Stores actively ask for our product, and if I visit any shop in the area, the shopkeepers complain that they need more supply. Our company's main focus is on Tehran and the Caspian region.</p><p><strong>MJ</strong> I'm pleasantly surprised about the amount of awareness that we have achieved as a brand in Iran. Upon joining Aujan and heading the business unit, I realized that the brand has developed a very solid and admirable reputation. However, it is early to say what we have accomplished, and we have to remain focused on the major challenge at hand, which is the currency devaluation. Obviously, since we have to import most of our raw materials, the devaluation of the currency has directly impacted our bottom line. Hence, managing the devaluation has been our biggest focus area. Fortunately, we have a very good team and we are analyzing the bottom line consistently.</p><h4>What are your upcoming strategies?</h4><p><strong>VL</strong> In this market, competition is not a serious concern. I'm not saying that we are not looking at the competition or that it doesn't interest us. But, unlike what happens in Western Europe, we are not constantly comparing and benchmarking. We have so many operational challenges to overcome that we really focus on our own production, and we know that if we execute things well our business is going to grow. We aim to maintain our position at the top in terms of quality, packaging, customer relationships, and delivery. We would welcome the competition to do what we do—invest and develop the market. Everybody can benefit from overall market growth.</p><p><strong>MJ</strong> As previously mentioned, Iran is now  an independent unit with a sovereign shareholding from the Aujan family. Therefore, global strategies come into play in terms of trademark registrations and copyright protection. Apart from that, the business has to be managed independently. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Aujan is going through a very fast-paced and effective makeover. But the company has already envisaged its organizational transformation path, and is now fully on the international radar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize your company's services over the past few years?</h4><p><strong>ALIAKBAR HAFEZI MANSHADI</strong> During the last two or three years, our government has succeeded in bringing many oil and gas projects to domestic companies. With this policy, we have been busy with our new projects, especially in the South Pars gas field. We provide our clients with consultancy services, mainly for EPC projects, and we separate our company from our joint-venture partners. Normally, we provide the engineering part of the project. Based on the new government policy, we have been offered some big new projects. Around 7% or 8% of our projects are international, and we worked with French companies and players from the Netherlands, which supported us in specific areas of our projects. Our market has been growing during these years and we are very happy about it.</p><p><strong>BEHZAD MEHDIPOUR</strong> We are strong in the construction of dams and roads. We record a high demand in Iran for these services. We would like to work more on road construction, pipelines, and hydropower plants. Pournam is currently carrying out a construction project in the Kurdish region of Iraq, which will feature 80 kilometers of roads. In Iran, we have implemented projects in three main areas. Currently, we have two dam projects, three ongoing tunnel projects, and three irrigation and water channeling projects, covering areas of up to 7,000 hectares. We classify these three projects into two different categories; two of them involve pumped irrigation, but water channeling does not. In terms of construction, we are building 162 houses in Tehran for members of government so they can stay very close to the parliament building. Each unit has four floors; they are first-class apartments. As in most countries, we are obligated to build high-standard apartments for members of the parliament, largely for security reasons. The complex will have 185 units, designed to host members of various commissions and offers a common parking lot. This is a very special project—we prefer to focus on earth and concrete dams and hydro power plants, which is what our company was established to do. We have gained significant expertise and experience over the years in this particular field, and in the years to come we aim to expand and focus on water projects even more.</p><h4>Among your 479 employees, 31% of them are engineers in the oil and gas engineering department. How do they represent a source of value-added for your company?</h4><p><strong>AHM</strong> We have many experts in all the engineering fields and experience shows that we are capable of doing our job well compared to our competitors. It's not easy to compete with international engineers, but in our market we have no problem, and during these years we have been collaborating with many good companies all over the world. We have a very good base in absorbing technical personnel; we have many university professors as advisors that review the work of our employees. They have studied and worked abroad so they are aware of the latest technical matters. The high quality of the technical proposals we provide to clients is a very good source of value-added for our company; the technical matters we normally provide support them and meet their requests. This is where our employees make the difference; when they were reviewing projects for Phase II   of South Pars, they found that Sazeh Pardazi Iran had more capabilities than technicians from France. Our capabilities go beyond technical matters, though. Other than having a reliable project, our costs are half those of our main competitors. For our projects, we always buy the latest software and technology, too, as we want the best for our clients.</p><h4>Which markets are you interested in?</h4><p><strong>BM</strong> We are working diligently to enter the African market, especially Senegal, which is one of the most stable countries on the continent. I believe that the political relations between Iran and African countries are stable, but it is fairly complicated to transfer money there. We would like to enter these markets, but we have to consider the profitability of our projects. In Iraq and Afghanistan, it is quite simple to carry out projects, but African markets can be complicated. We usually work alone, but in new markets we prefer to create partnerships with local construction players in order to ease the process of entering a foreign market. These local partners are more accustomed to the culture and understand the mechanics of a specific market. In the Kurdish region of Iraq, we partnered with a local company. However, we prefer to work independently because we have the strength and the expertise to do so efficiently.</p><h4>What are the major projects you are involved in right now and which ones do you consider the most important?</h4><p><strong>AHM</strong> We recently started a maritime and coastal project on the Caspian Sea in conjunction with the development of Ramsar city. By the end of May 2012, they had started construction work, and we are going to have three islands connected to each other by roads and bridges. In about seven years, it is going to be a touristic area with hotels and residential areas similar to the Palm of Dubai. The value of the project is about $2.5 billion, and this is very important because it's on the waterfront and the water part is a priority. This is the project I feel the most attached to because the city is one of the most beautiful in the world, and the project is extremely gracious.</p><h4>You have a joint venture with HEPCO. What are the terms of this partnership?</h4><p><strong>BM</strong> We have a joint venture with HEPCO exclusively for machinery supply; it is an excellent producer and its machinery and equipment are extremely reliable for our type of construction projects. In addition, our company is the only Komatsu agent in the country. HEPCO is adding value to our projects with the machinery it supplies. Since we need significant investments, HEPCO is investing in a way by providing valuable machinery that allows us to accomplish our goals. As long as a company is adding value to one of our projects, we are happy to engage in a joint venture. Currently, we are seeking partners in the large market of Turkey, and I believe we can easily find a suitable company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Knauf establish its operations in Iran?</h4><p><strong>AFSHIN MADANI</strong> Knauf started operations in Iran back in the 1960s, though it was not a direct investment at the time. The founder was delivering equipment to gypsum producers. Knauf is now a producer of construction material, gypsum, and byproducts of gypsum, such as gypsum board, which is a very useful construction material. In the 1960s, it delivered equipment to Iranian gypsum producers like Iran Gatch, which was at that time the biggest gypsum producer in the world. The direct investment took place about 14 years ago when Knauf bought three plants. The Knauf-Iran plant was one, and it produces gypsum board and accessories including profiles and other necessities. Then, Knauf bought Iran Gatch, which is publicly traded on the stock exchange. We have more than 97% of the shares, so it belongs to the Knauf Group. Then, we bought Saran-Gatch, which is now Knauf-Gatch, a producer of gypsum. These three plants were bought in the last 14 years. We have modernized all of them and they include state-of-the-art technology. These three plants are now operating at full capacity and there is a big market for our products in Iran. The average age of houses is more than 20 years, creating demand from both the renovation and new housing markets. That was the reason why Knauf invested in Iran. Knauf has a very long-term view for investment in Iran as it is a strategic country that has a huge potential for growth.</p><h4>How would you characterize the regional cement market and Iran's role as a major producer?</h4><p><strong>ALIMOHAMMAD BOD</strong> The need for cement in neighboring countries is high. For example, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey, and Afghanistan all need huge quantities of cement, and Iran continues to be the major cement producer and supplier for the region. Because of the investments that have been made in Iran in terms of production facilities and transportation channels, we can complete and create other projects in different countries because the energy price is still low locally.</p><h4>How important is technology and R&amp;D in the sector?</h4><p><strong>AM</strong> Knauf is a very innovative company that is well established in Germany and Europe. It is almost the market leader. There are also many serious competitors like La Forge and British Plaster Board (BPB). However, because of the innovation that Knauf boasts, we are carrying products that almost no other competitor can produce. Regarding quality and performance, we are producing products for customers for special markets. For example, in the Iranian market, we have products developed especially for local conditions that fulfill the requirements of the country. Knauf's strategy is to produce customized products for specific markets, and that includes Iran.</p><p><strong>AB</strong> I would say that it is very important. In order to increase production and capacity every year, we use the latest technology. Every day we need to learn and understand new methods for producing cement in a more cost-effective manner. We have, as the country has, the highest standards of cement production in terms of quality and technology. We are actually working on a new R&amp;D department for our holding group, so we can stay up to date with the latest technology available. Every year we spend 3% of our capital on new methods of production.</p><h4>What is your economic forecast for 2013?</h4><p><strong>AM</strong> The sector is booming. It is a very safe investment. There is also huge demand for buildings; many people are now investing in housing. We expect that we will have at least 20% to 50% growth over 2013.</p><p><strong>AB</strong> According to our estimates, with our new projects we are going to increase our production by another 10%. In 2013, we will introduce white cement into the market, and we are working on environmental issues to protect the environment from pollution. Although we are allowed to emit a maximum of 150 parts per million (ppm) of dust in Iran, we've been working on this issue and now we produce a maximum of 50 ppm.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your expertise in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)?<br></h4><p><strong>F. EKHTERAEI</strong> We launched the production of APIs in Iran after the victory of the Revolution in order to cease the importation of them from overseas. We then began to produce simple mineral products such as sodium, salt, and magnesium sulfate, which were easy to produce in Iran. Little by little, the amount of API manufacturing increased. Currently, there are more than 62 API manufacturing plants that are the members of a larger syndicate. This group is manufacturing more than 200 APIs at present, which supply 60% of total domestic demand.</p><h4>How are you emphasizing the integration of new and advanced technology in your distribution network?</h4><p><strong>S. E. HASHEMI </strong>We are the best distribution company in Iran in terms of technology. I personally travel to Europe several times a year simply to learn about new advancements in distribution networks. We would like to establish a direct link with pharmacies through the internet so that they can place orders that we would then deliver. I recognize that the internet is not a part of pharmacist culture yet, but we are ready to implement an e-distribution network. Hejrat's system is state of the art and IT based. We built a modern warehouse and central distribution center, which is now recognized as the best in the Middle East.</p><h4>How are you planning to increase supplies for the local market?</h4><p><strong>FE</strong> With regard to the recent rates of hard currency fluctuation in Iran, the export of APIs has become more feasible. The existing regulation in the pharmaceutical sector has made the exportation of APIs much easier than the exportation of finished products. The recent hard currency rates have motivated API manufacturers to prefer exporting their products rather than selling them on the local market. Although the API manufacturers import their required intermediate materials mainly from countries such as India and China, in line with the government's subsidation policy, more API manufacturers are benefiting from very special low rates for the purchase of intermediates. Thus, Iranian exporters can compete with Chinese and Indian competitors.</p><h4>How is Hejrat educating its customers to be more technology friendly?</h4><p><strong>SEH</strong> I graduated as a pharmacist from Tehran Medical University, and after that I studied economics. I have always emphasized the importance of IT in this sector. When I arrived at the company, all the branches were isolated islands lacking effective communication. We implemented IT infrastructure and the best communication practices to better connect the branches. The most important issue we still have to solve is educating managers about the importance of IT and new technology. Many of the managers we are dealing with lack a solid computer education, and if we solve this problem we will create a perfect network. This would allow us to make informed decisions with positive spillovers in terms of revenue.</p><h4>What is the reason for expansion in the production of raw materials and APIs?</h4><p><strong>FE</strong> We utilize state-of-the-art technology in Iran, and our workforce is highly trained. Our chemical engineers and pharmacists have a high level of experience. Since the consumption of medicine in Iran is lower than the average figure in the region, we are able to produce enough to cover all of Iran's demand with very small investments.</p><h4>What are the terms of your partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies?</h4><p><strong>SEH</strong> Our partnerships function in several ways. First of all, we have two stockholders. The first group is comprised of companies that fall under the umbrella of Tamin Pharmaceutical Investment Company, and the second group contains private companies.</p><p>In the case of supplier relationship management, we separate them into two main groups: pharmaceutical producers and importers. In order to select suppliers, we have a comprehensive assessment model based on economic indices for profitability and quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the advances made in ophthalmology procedures in Iran?</h4><p><strong>DR. M. JABBARVAN</strong><strong>D</strong> Iran is categorized among developing nations in terms of economic development and global health care indices, but when it comes to eye health I believe that we are in a similar position as developed countries. Blinding ocular infections are very rare and infections are mostly caused by contact lens wear, or as a result of the herpes simplex virus. We do not just treat patients, we improve the quality of their lives. Refractive surgery, which allows you to set aside contact lenses and glasses, is very common in Iran and probably the second most common procedure at Farabi Hospital. Why? Because it's a life-changing procedure and not purely therapeutic.</p><p><strong>HASSAN HASHEMI</strong> Iran is a country of some 75 million people, and there are a wide variety of eye-related diseases and ailments. There are currently 1,500 ophthalmologists working in Iran and almost 2,000 optometrists. Around 5,000 optician shops are also providing care. In clinical practice, the level of health service provided by Iranian ophthalmologists is not that different from modern countries. Various services are provided and performed in Iran and highly qualified surgeons are specialized in different sub-specialties. Standards across the country are extremely close to international standards. With our expertise, there is no doubt we can easily compete with other countries in the field of ophthalmology.</p><h4>How does your institution differ from its competitors?</h4><p><strong>MJ</strong> Our distinctiveness lies in our variety of research activity, education, and services. If you compare Farabi to a private hospital, they're generally not that active in education and research because they essentially do business. We have a great amount of responsibility educating future ophthalmologists. We are one of the oldest hospitals in Iran, established over 70 years ago. Now we have around 72 residents, 18 fellows in different subspecialties, and a high number of medical students who came here for their ophthalmic rounds. In terms of research, we publish over 100 peer-reviewed publications a year that are indexed in reputable bibliographic databases. We have established research labs, including a chemistry lab, a lab for animal testing, a genetic lab, and a clean room.</p><p><strong>HH</strong> Around 20 years ago the Noor Eye Hospital started its business in the field of ophthalmology. We were pioneers in this respect because many new surgical procedures in the country, such as modern "sutureless" cataract surgery, laser refractive surgery, lamellar keratoplasty, and phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) implantation were performed here for the first time. In Iran, people who want to have eye surgery  or need eye care choose to go to pioneers like us because they know we offer high-quality service. We use the most advanced equipment and devices we can find in the world and we recruit the best surgeons to provide patients with the finest care. Considering these two aspects, I think we are the best the market can offer. In terms of costs and the provision of eye care for patients, we always try to consider our patients' expenses and we offer the best treatment at lower costs.</p><h4>How do you work to grow and remain competitive?</h4><p><strong>MJ</strong> We had 600,000 referrals last year, 10% of which needed surgery. Despite the ever-increasing load, we are proud that we do not have waiting lists. We have tried to keep up with demand through major infrastructural investment in new laboratories and spaces for diagnostics and operations. The academic staff is not only active in research, but also in service. We are competitive in the market because the price of our service is several times less than in the private sector, despite being of a comparable quality, and also because we have a good relationship with the media. The hospital is synonymous with responsiveness, which is an area that our management has worked hard on.</p><p><strong>HH</strong> We have three key elements that help us grow each year. The first and foremost is technology. We have high standards in technology not only in Iran itself, but in the whole region.</p><p>The second is the quality of treatment patients receive. The third is cost. Our costs are lower compared to other private hospitals in the region. These three key points help us maintain and improve our services in the field of ophthalmology. We perform about 2,500 refractive surgeries and 1,600 other surgical procedures, such as cataract surgery, retinal surgery, and corneal transplantation, along with other products every month. We have to satisfy each and every patient we admit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main characteristics and requirements of your exchange?<br></h4><p><strong>ALI SALEHABADI </strong>The requirements for being listed by the Securities and Exchange Organization of Iran (SEO) are easier than those of the TSE. There is more flexibility in the new market we have established. The SEO issues licenses to these stock exchanges and commodities exchanges, and recently we established an energy exchange. Now we have an Iran Stock Exchange and the Iran Farabourse, which are in competition with each other to absorb listed companies. Iran Mercantile Exchange is designed for those listed companies in larger markets, and we have a strong energy base in Iran, which is the 16th biggest electricity producer in the world, with a capacity of more than 50,000 MW. We established this market to exchange electricity among producers and consumers in the local market. There are time zone differences between Iran and Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, meaning we can exchange electricity with these countries easily. For example, power plants cannot be turned off—all the electricity being produced must be consumed and it cannot be stored. The time zone differences allow us to export energy to other countries at a good price for both buyers and sellers in this market.</p><p><strong>HASSAN GHALIBAF ASL</strong> The TSE has been one of the best-performing stock exchanges internationally for several reasons. First, Iran is an emerging market with a lot of potential. The most valuable and relevant Iranian industries and corporations are listed on the TSE. These include steel companies, telecommunications companies, oil producers, and automakers, and they represent crucial sectors in the country. These companies register high growth, and the new regulations helped both these companies and the stock exchange. In recent years, the government has been utilizing Article 44 of the Constitution in order to privatize large companies that belonged wholly or partially to the government. Iran also has a new capital markets law, which helped enhance the market's development. The regulation established new instruments, mutual funds for example, creating new opportunities for investors. Until two or three years ago, the only instrument we had was a share; stocks that companies would issue in the capital market. Now firms can issue participation certificates and futures among other instruments, and this is one of the main reasons for the TSE's success over the past few years.</p><h4>What new financial instruments can be introduced to the market to improve the local financial sector?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> While price discovery has many benefits for the market, the financing of issuers and producers is also a very important factor. In order to help producers obtain capital, corporations list on the TSE. They can add to their capital by issuing shares and raising money for their development. Companies that have been listed on the Iran Farabourse can also add their capital by issuing shares. The SEO has provided new financial and Islamic instruments, which is mandatory in Iran. A while back we introduced participation papers so that people could form partnerships and at the same time finance a special project. There are significant differences between bonds and participation papers. For example, when you issue bonds you can obtain money and invest in any project, and the predetermined interest must be paid to the investors. However, with participation papers, at the end of the project the profit must be calculated and can then be distributed among the shareholders. During that time, dividends or interest can be paid. It is not just for municipalities; this style can be used by the private sector or the government. It is a form of asset-backed security.</p><p><strong>HGA</strong> The company has done research and completed studies analyzing the needs of the market and investors. What we learned is that, especially on the investment side, investors need instruments for risk management. For this reason we launched single-stock futures, and last year we worked on stock options and finalized it on the TSE. We are now working on the trading system for options, and we are studying index futures.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the global economy, and will this affect prospects on Iran's capital markets?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> The global economy is fragile and the stock markets are suffering. However, in Iran we can survive because our operations are based on the capabilities of the local economy. I believe that we can continue at this level of quality performance. However, this will depend on international commodity prices, because we are influenced by a variety of listed companies that are affected by international prices, especially those working in industries such as steel and copper. Commodity prices in the international market are important for the Iranian economy, but overall our diversification and the offerings we will have in the future in the energy sector will entice huge companies to launch IPOs. I believe that the stock market will continue to enhance the market with its specialized tools.</p><p><strong>HGA</strong><strong> </strong>Globally, the economy is having hard times. It is a rough time for almost every economy in the world, from the US to Europe and China. Looking at the situation, it is hard to have a positive view about the condition of these markets, mostly due to the debt crisis. The TSE has many programs, and we are one of the stock exchanges in the world right now implementing new programs, creating the basis for a better future for the capital market. The privatization plan plays a major role in this, but the changes we are witnessing are important for the economy. The Iranian economy was bank-based, but the government decided to help the capital market and enhance its position in financing companies and entrepreneurs. The economy, the private sector, and the government all need the capital market. For all of these reasons, I think the future of the TSE will be bright and positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the largest obstacle to overcome in the development of the business environment in Mozambique?<br></h4><p><strong>CARRIE DAVIES</strong> Uncertainty is quite simply the single largest issue. Legal certainty is essential for businesses to invest, grow, and develop. Businesses can manage in a legally complex environment, but uncertainty, such as regular changes to legislation, uneven implementation, and high levels of discretion are extremely detrimental to them. The level of uncertainty in Mozambique's legal framework is the single largest obstacle.</p><p><strong>ROGÉRIO MANUEL</strong> We are fighting to solve the problems and overcome the challenges we face year after year; one of them is the integration of local and international companies. Businesses operating in Mozambique can be from the US or UK for example, but if the company is registered in Mozambique, the CTA defends that company. The first problem is communication. For example, if there is a large international drilling company looking for catering, it may have difficulties securing the most appropriate local partner. There is often an international tender that is poorly advertised to companies in Mozambique, and thus no one bids for the contract.</p><h4>What sort of regulatory changes do you think still need to be made to improve the business environment in Mozambique?</h4><p><strong>CD</strong> While regulatory changes to reduce the centralized control of the business environment and reduce government interference in business activities would be welcome, above all a reduction in the number of changes to legislation thus creating stability would be more important. There is a need to reduce the uneven application of legislation and new legislation should be drafted in such a way as to limit the amount of discretion available to the public administration.</p><h4>How does the CTA work with international companies that invest in Mozambique?</h4><p><strong>RM</strong> The CTA is a promoter of business in Mozambique, and our budget comes from the government. What we are doing is selecting special companies, often the largest companies in Mozambique—Vale, Rio Tinto, and Mozal—that are all members of the CTA. We have invited them to be part of a smaller group of the 25 largest companies along with the CTA, which is called the National Business Council (CEN). These companies advise my board on issues private businesses face. We participate in meetings with them about once a month, where we sit down and discuss the issues, as well as being in constant touch by e-mail. Every day, the government is bringing up new issues to be discussed or laws to modified through the CTA.</p><h4>What trends can you identify with regards to the development of local SMEs, and to what extent have SMEs benefited from megaprojects?</h4><p><strong>CD</strong> There is some development in the SME sector. However, the changeability and uncertainty of the business environment makes it relatively unwelcoming for SME level investment. The growth of the economy based on large-scale investments depends on a trickle-down effect, with SMEs potentially providing products and services to other business several tiers below the major investors. There is significant focus in this area currently and in 2013 ACIS is introducing an online procurement platform that will facilitate access to local suppliers for major investors and access to markets for SMEs.</p><h4>How is the CTA working to improve Mozambique's ranking in the World Bank's Doing Business report?</h4><p><strong>RM</strong> We have identified 12 points that caused our ranking to fall, which we have shared with the government. These points have nothing to do with the writing of policies, and in fact we simply struggle to implement the policies we have amended. The relevant ministries are listening and working to rapidly address the points; they have set strict deadlines. On those dates we are going to check if each point still needs to be looked at or solved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is your company helping to development the regional agriculture sector?<br></h4><p><strong>EMERSON ZHOU </strong>The Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC) is not like the ordinary projects that people are implementing around the country—it is a long-term initiative that aims at facilitating the development of commercial agriculture and agribusiness with targets leading up to 2030. It is an institution built up through a partnership between the government, the private sector, and donor organizations.  The BAGC is the only private sector-led agricultural development corridor institution that is in operation to date. We have been able to rally stakeholders around the plight of commercial agriculture. We have brought to light that there is a problem with commercial agriculture throughout the country. We have managed to mobilize a significant amount of resources to support public and private sector investments in the corridor. In terms of new resources, so far we have been able to mobilize $20 million for the Catalytic Fund and another $32 million for agriculture investments in the corridor. Within the framework of this initiative, the government, with support from the World Bank, is investing $70 million in irrigation development.</p><p><strong>CHRIS ISAAC </strong>AgDevCo came here in 2009 working with the government of Mozambique to put together the BAGC initiative, which set out a 20-year vision of how to achieve the huge agricultural potential that this country has. Its potential is well understood, but not yet realized. As a result of that, two things happened. Firstly, the BAGC Partnership was established, which brings together the government, Mozambicans, the international and local private sector, and development partners to sit around the same table to identify key policy and infrastructure constraints. Secondly, it set up a $20 million investment facility, the Catalytic Fund, which is designed to make investments both in SMEs and in larger irrigation developments that can boost agricultural productivity and create sustainable, commercially viable businesses. It's still early days, but we are already seeing some results on the ground. The fund has made over a dozen investments to date, many of which are complementary. Working with the government and other partners, we have already seeing made some practical progress on some of the infrastructure and policy constraints, whether it be working with the electricity company to put in new power lines to a farm or as addressing a phytosanitary challenge like the fruit fly issue in Mozambique. Together, the Partnership and the Fund can make change happen on the ground.</p><h4>How would you describe the investment climate in the sector at the moment?</h4><p><strong>EZ</strong> The opportunities are there for people to come in and invest, which they are doing. What we see is that opportunities for socially responsible ventures are increasing, and over time we expect more to emerge. The difficulty that most investors face today is the availability of agricultural infrastructure. Potential investors need to, in addition to making on-farm investments, take into account that electricity is available a number of kilometers away, and bulk water systems. Access roads should be built; these are not investments that one ordinarily wants a private partner to be making.</p><p><strong>CI</strong> There is clearly huge potential; however, one does need to learn how to operate in a market such as Mozambique. People should come in and start something on a relatively small scale, then look to expand that once it is working. People should not be afraid of investing, but be aware of the practical challenges to getting started and have a plan to address those. Patience is key. As for funding, it is often a matter of partnering with development agencies to access concessional capital for irrigation and last-mile infrastructure. For example, there is huge potential in Mozambique for rice. It imports over 400,000 tons a year, but has the perfect soil and climatic conditions to grow the crop. There is an attractive investment opportunity there, but there are large upfront costs to getting started, especially in irrigation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Mozambique for your overall operations?<br></h4><p><strong>EBBIE HAAN</strong> Sasol started onshore in the Pande and Temane areas in two blocks. One is the Petroleum Production Agreement (PPA), and there was a large block around it that was covered by a production sharing agreement (PSA). The PPA represents two fields that were discovered nearly 60 years ago by the prior operators. In those days, the main objective was looking for oil. They didn't know what to do with gas, because gas requires a specific base-load market. There was no internal market in Mozambique at that stage; it had just come out of a civil war. The key was to link that pipeline to a base-load market. The investment in the pipeline was the nucleus for development. It is like tying water resources to a city; until the pipeline is there, the city is out of water. The initial project was sanctioned for an annual consumption of 120 million gigajoules. That equates to about 300 million standard cubic feet a day of gas production. If this were in one country, it would have been easier. But the main thing is that it had to cross a national border. We have quite a rich inventory of small gas pockets, and it is quite close to the processing plant. In 2012, we also found a small banana-shaped field of an oil rim and gas cap. We put the oil rim through an extended well test that flowed at a steady flow-rate and supported our submission of an Appraisal Report for the potential development of the PSA license area to the Mozambican authorities in November 2012. This is the first oil discovery in Mozambique. This is liquid gold.</p><p><strong>HENRI LOUBSER</strong> Sasol New Energy was formed to develop sustainable new energy growth opportunities for Sasol to prosper in a carbon- and water-constrained world. Given that purpose, we are developing a third value chain for Sasol, along with its current liquid fuels and chemical value chains, namely a low-carbon electricity value chain. Given that Sasol consumes almost 2 GW of electricity, it makes sense to focus our attention on replacing some, and eventually all, of the electricity that is generated internally with carbon intensive technologies (coal) as well as imports from Eskom, with electricity that is generated from low-carbon sources and thereby offsetting a substantial portion of our carbon emissions. Given the growth in electricity demand in South Africa, the Southern African region, and the connectedness of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP), it is natural to then also look at neighbouring countries in order to grow our portfolio. In addition, Sasol already has a strategic interest in Mozambique given the gas interests of Sasol Petroleum International. It is therefore a natural extension of our business to also consider electricity generation in that country.</p><h4>What is the status of the Ressano Garcia project now?</h4><p><strong>HL</strong> The groundbreaking ceremony took place on the Ressano Garcia site on November 29, 2012. The Mozambican Minister of Energy, Salvador Namburete, signed the concession contract on January 29, 2013. Having gone through all the required approvals already, construction has already begun, and we plan to start up the plant—what we call the beneficial operation date—in May 2014. This is a stretched, but not unachievable, target, and we have communicated it as such to our Mozambican partner. In Sasolburg, the plant was producing the first electricity within 16 months of the start of the project. We are working with a technology partner, Wí¤rtsilí¤, that has proven that they can deliver a plant like this within a tight schedule.</p><h4>Are you looking for international partners for the Sofala block?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> Onshore, we have Area A, and then there's Sofala. We just completed a large 3D seismic survey. We acquired 1,600 kilometers of 3D imaging in 2012, and the results looked very encouraging. The block's previous operators drilled wells and, according to the old data in combination with the new data, it looks like gas may have been discovered. We are very enthusiastic, but we don't want to do this on a 100% share basis. It goes back to our belief in partnership and leveraging partners to mitigate risk. At the moment, we are brokering a 35% interest in the block via a brokering firm, and the data room is about to open. We are very actively seeking a partner. We will be drilling there in 2014. It is looking very good. It is in shallow water, so you can drill there with a so-called jack-up rig, meaning it is less expensive. Some of the prospects we hope to drill are at the mouth of the river in Beira. It doesn't get better than that. In 2014, it's all going to happen.</p><h4>What plans do you have to ensure there is knowledge transfer to the Mozambicans who will be working on the project?</h4><p><strong>HL</strong> We will be using a similar model as the one we are using in Sasolburg, that is, we will enter into a three-year operation and maintenance agreement with Wí¤rtsilí¤. In that three-year period, Wí¤rtsilí¤ works alongside local employees to transfer its knowledge about the operation and maintenance of the plant with the end goal of having the plant operated exclusively by Mozambicans.</p><h4>What kind of potential is there for your Mozambican projects to attract some of Sasol's more diversified portfolio in terms of fertilizers, petrochemicals, and clean energy projects?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> That is at the heart of our strategy. An LNG plant produces a product that is merely loaded onto a tanker and shipped out. There is no pipeline required. So what does that mean for Mozambicans? In the construction phase there is a bubble of activity, but then once the plant is in operation you create about 500 jobs or so and pay taxes. Our view is to have a more meaningful relationship with our host country; we want to do more in terms of local monetization, like power generation. We are also doing studies on a chemical complex and gas-to-liquid (GTL) plant, one of the mainstays of our technology. We are doing a number of studies, but it needs to make economic sense. I am convinced we can do more in Mozambique than we currently are, and we will, but it must make economic sense.</p><h4>What role do you envision Mozambique playing in other New Energy ventures?</h4><p><strong>HL</strong> We are investigating various other opportunities in Mozambique. In addition to more gas to electricity projects, possible hydroelectricity opportunities are also being investigated. We also see Mozambique as having potential for the development of biofuels projects. The production of biofuels requires ample water and arable land. Most of Africa is quite dry, but Mozambique has large amounts of arable land and water. This is therefore a business opportunity that we will explore in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role will working with smaller companies in Maputo and the north play in your expansion strategy?<br></h4><p><strong>ALEXANDRE ALMEIDA </strong>We work with subcontractors; most of them are new and moving in from Portugal. Since Mozambique has a coastline of more than 2,500 kilometers, we are trying to identify smaller companies in the infrastructure segment with which to carry out larger contracts. I believe we can add value if we look for these small local companies that are in the field. Of course, it's difficult to find these companies; however, we need to try.</p><h4>Will the large amount of revenue expected to come to the government from gas and coal allow investment in the larger public infrastructure works?</h4><p><strong>EDUARDO SAMUEL</strong> In the future, we'll see more public works. We have companies doing roads in Gaza of 150 kilometers in length, and those are huge contracts. In my portfolio, I have contracts of $46 million up to $200 million. It's a question of scale, and in a country like Mozambique, you're going to need any infrastructure possible. Today, we don't have construction companies doing huge contracts; they don't do roads, hospitals, or office buildings, but they do small villas instead. There is money for development in Mozambique, but not enough to do every single thing that is requested, and that's where we come in.</p><h4>How exactly is the company looking to position itself in this market?</h4><p><strong>AA</strong> BRITALAR Moçambique will have two roles. One is a constructor that bids for tenders, and the other will seize opportunities as an investor. Over the last 15 years, we've had this kind of model, and in Portugal we employ it in the energy, water, and railroad segments. There is a need in the market, and if someone goes to the government and has a business model, much of the work happens faster. We are not just a construction company; we also have investments in hotels and construction.</p><h4>What are you expecting in terms of growth and turnover in the medium term?</h4><p><strong>ES</strong> By the end of 2012, we'll have a turnover of $22 million, and in 2013 we'll have almost a 100% increase to around $45 million. If business runs as we expect, probably by the beginning of 2013 we expect some large contracts with companies for the construction of offices, hotels, and apartments. If we win these contracts, they will last two years. Once we start working, the projects will continue through to 2015.</p><h4>To what extent does value-added production allow you to be competitive against other companies?</h4><p><strong>AA</strong> We are in the process of identifying products that no one is currently offering. For example, there is a huge opportunity to produce prefabricated concrete products for infrastructure. It will be our own initiative to identify what we can do at our plant, and we've already identified two or three places where there are great opportunities. There are huge investment prospects in ceramics bricks. At the moment, we're in the process of negotiating a loan to buy all of the equipment of a factory located in Matola.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the agreement signed between the banks and the Ministry of Public Works to ease access to credit for mortgages?</h4><p><strong>ES</strong> The problem right now is that Mozambican people, even if you are an engineer or a doctor, are paying huge rents for houses they are not buying, because they cannot afford to buy. With this kind of agreement people will have the means to buy a house in 20-25 years. They can buy a small 90-sqm house in Maputo whatever their wage. The market for cheaper small houses is performing far better than the higher standard market. That's why we are pondering smaller houses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Mozambique's significance to Odebrecht both regionally and globally?<br></h4><p><strong>MIGUEL PERES</strong> Since we re-launched operations here in 2006, Odebrecht has prioritized Mozambique. Odebrecht has been here for six years now, and it has been involved in the one of the most important projects—the Moatize Coal Project with Vale—with works developed in Moatize and Beira. The opportunity to develop other projects, such as logistics for the mining, oil, and gas sectors as well as in the agribusiness and energy sector, makes Mozambique extremely important for our strategic growth in Africa for the next few years.</p><h4>What are the key logistical challenges presented when working on large rural projects?</h4><p><strong>RUI CARRITO</strong> Transportation is very difficult in the interior of the country. We also have another problem with the skill of the labor force. Unfortunately, for very specialized work such as bridgework, we have to bring in skilled labor from Portugal. We have around 700 people working for us in Mozambique, and between 80 and 90 are Portuguese; however, our target is not to increase the workforce in general, but decrease the amount of Portuguese labor. There are many difficulties in bridge construction. Everybody has to make a huge effort to improve the labor skills in Mozambique over the next few years.</p><h4>How has Odebrecht taken advantage of working with Brazilian mining giant Vale to leverage further business opportunities in Mozambique?</h4><p><strong>MP</strong> Our relationship with Vale started more than 30 years ago in Brazil; being part of the company's first greenfield coal mining development outside of Brazil was of the utmost importance to us. Now, we have been able to get to know the market better, create opportunities, and make the most of the good relationships between the governments of Brazil and Mozambique. Our next project will be an industrial duty-free zone in Nacala. It will establish the infrastructure for companies and provide water, power, and all the services needed. This should be ready in two years.</p><h4>The second bridge going over the Zambezi River is very important to development in the country. What will be its impact on transportation in these areas?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong> All of that northern area has become more important in the last three or four years. It has only one bridge and the traffic is not only from mining companies, but also from countries like Malawi, Zimbabwe, and traffic in general from the interior of Africa. If you look at a map, Swaziland, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe depend on Mozambique to have connections to the sea. Mozambique has roads, railways, and ports. I look at the country and see many possibilities in mineral resources, gas, and petrol; however, the mining resources can only last for 20-40 years, and eventually they will end. Until then, the geographic location of Mozambique and its infrastructure are very important for all the countries of the African interior.</p><h4>How can your company tackle associated challenges in developing and financing large-scale infrastructure projects?</h4><p><strong>MP</strong> Given the country's political and economic stability, it has attracted the attention of various stakeholders interested in developing not only mining, oil, and gas-related projects, but also in infrastructure, such as ports, railroads, and airports. A public-private partnership (PPP) legal framework is in place, which gives investors more confidence. Nevertheless, the learning curve is still there, so it may take longer than we would like, but we are optimistic that the country is on the right path in creating solid foundations for the development of badly needed infrastructure.</p><p><strong>RC </strong><span></span>The investment in schools, hospitals, hotels, and houses is still important to us, and it is improving. Public infrastructure is also improving a lot. We look at infrastructure such as roads, railways, and also dams. Mozambique has a lot of activity in the energy sector, and dams form a large part of that. For us, there are many possibilities with schools, hospitals, hotels, roads, and harbors. The larger infrastructure projects are more visible because the investments are larger. Of course, a $40 million project is more important to me than a $2 million project. However, we are still working on the two sides.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the sectors that Intelec is focusing on for investment?<br></h4><p><strong>SALIMO ABDULA </strong>We invest wherever business opportunities exist, although energy and telecoms remain our core businesses. We had an opportunity to build a mine in 2012, and were involved in five bids on behalf of Intelec and Electro Sul, but were successful in just one of them. This will be our first foray in mining, and now we are now working in partnership with a Canadian company. We're still working on drilling at the moment. We don't know the results, but the signs are good. If we are successful, then we intend on forging further partnerships with international companies.</p><h4>How would you characterize the level of Indian investment in Mozambique compared to when Mozambique Holdings entered the market in the 1980s?</h4><p><strong>J</strong><strong>OSE PARAYANKEN</strong> Interest in Mozambique from Indian companies only started about five or six years ago after developments in the mineral and energy sectors. I arrived in the 1980s, when the country's economy was changing from a socialist structure to the one we recognize now. Today's economic structure is based on the development of basic infrastructure for services and government functions, and resources development in the mining, energy, agriculture, and tourism sectors. The civil war destroyed most of the transport, production, and communication infrastructure, so most businesses in the early stages were engaged in the repair or rehabilitation of essential infrastructure. Mozambique Holdings concentrated on repair and the servicing of basic infrastructure, like roads and ports, and participated in the privatization program to restructure and reactivate public sector companies in the infrastructure sector.</p><h4>How attractive is the Mozambican market for young entrepreneurs?</h4><p><strong>S</strong><strong>A</strong> Mozambique is a country full of opportunities. Ideally, one would have to self-finance. The financial sector still has to mature, as at the moment interest rates are prohibitively high. Many people resort to finding financing from abroad, which is why we find many companies here in Mozambique that have foreign partners. In the future, when our financial sector matures, it should not be difficult to raise finances if you have a good project. Sometimes, it's better to go into a partnership because the probabilities of risk being reduced are bigger, and then there is also the advantage of sharing the risk. However, it is important to be actively involved in the management of the company. I have seen so many projects fail in Mozambique because the ownership is not present.</p><h4>How can social development investment be converted into a successful and profitable business?</h4><p><strong>JP</strong> In the initial stages of planning and development, the concentration was on urban areas. We concentrated on the rural sector, where most service providers were ill equipped. Initially, we concentrated on drinking water for rural and semi-urban areas, which was a major problem since the civil war destroyed most of the water sources and delivery chains. We prepared a detailed project report based on technology, drilling equipment, and mechanical pumps from India, since that country had been through a similar phase of development in the 1950s and 1960s. We appealed to the government of India through the government of Mozambique to provide funding for the project and the government of India sanctioned $20 million for the rural water project for the most populous provinces of Nampula and Zambezia, accounting for nearly 50% of the population of Mozambique. It gave us the opportunity to create a sustainable rural drinking water program that became a model and example for a very effective social development project that at the same time is a successful business. Based on the success and social impact of the project, the government of India sanctioned $20 million each for two extensions of the project, which has now increased the rural drinking water coverage in Zambezia and Nampula from 26% and 29% when we commenced the project to current levels of over 60%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do Azerbaijani universities interact with their peers in the international higher learning sector?<br></h4><p><strong>FARIZ ISMAILZADE </strong>We are seeking ways to build our curriculums and teach in accordance with the Bologna Process, which means we are using the European 10-credit System and are entitled to exchange programs with a number of European universities. We signed partnership agreements with about 20 European universities, and the Bologna system is working very well for us. We also joined the EU's Erasmus program, making credit transfers possible. The management of the academy strongly believes that it is important to build an international and diverse campus here in Baku, with the benefits of exposure for students. This is important in today's globalized world; if you teach students solely within one country's borders, it's nearly impossible for them to later adjust to the real world, which is highly globalized. We are aiming to teach our students how to live and work successfully in an international, multi-ethnic, and multi-cultural setting.</p><p><strong>SIYAVUSH F. GARAYEV</strong> Currently, we have 518 foreign students from 20 countries that are studying at seven basic faculties, and 70 candidates are observers at the preparatory faculty for foreign citizens. With some countries, such as China and Vietnam, this preparation is conducted according to agreements made with large state oil companies. Within the framework of the "State Program of Azerbaijan Youth Education in 2007-2015," led by President Ilham Aliyev, students continue their education in leading European, Asian, and North American universities. Among the more than 800 Azerbaijani students selected for training in technical sciences abroad, ASOA students comprise the majority. This is because, from year to year, we maintain the highest rating among the technical higher schools and our student body is filled with those who had the highest scores during the entrance examination. We look forward to the graduates of foreign universities for whose creative development is expected to meet all of the necessary conditions.</p><h4>How are your universities evolving in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><strong>SG</strong> Established in 1920, ASOA has played a special role in the development of industry, economy, science, and technical progress in Azerbaijan. Most of the innovations and changes in the educational system of the country began with our educational institution. In terms of the improvement of staff training specialization, some independent higher educational establishments have been created as faculties of our institute: Azerbaijan Technical University, Azerbaijan University of Architecture and Construction, Azerbaijan State Agricultural University, Sumgait State University, and Mingachevir Technical Institute. However, ASOA remains the leader in technical education in Azerbaijan, leading purposeful work related to the integration of European education norms, the adaptation of curricula to Western standards, and introducing modern technology to our educational processes.</p><p><strong>FI</strong> Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy (ADA) is a young institution—we are only six years old. Although the school was originally established to train diplomats, our Rector Hafiz Pashayev's vision and thinking was that we could follow a larger mission and begin providing our students with Bachelor's and Master's degree programs in international affairs, diplomacy, business administration, public policy, and economics. This was part of an idea to move beyond diplomatic training, which was strongly supported by President Aliyev. We truly believe that Azerbaijan is changing and needs more educated young professionals. Therefore, we are also considering expanding our course offering to education management, public affairs, communications, and even computer sciences or IT. In that respect, the name of the academy is slightly misleading—we are becoming a full university that offers training in a variety of disciplines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your key target groups?<br></h4><p><strong>RAFAEL BLANCO</strong> Our firm primarily targets middle-class families. We have a very strong family product in all of our resorts. Viva Wyndham has kids clubs in all of our resorts. Also, the company has very strong animation and sports. This provides the possibility for young couples to come with their children and enjoy their vacations. Guests have the freedom to spend time apart from their children and know that their young ones are being taken care of. That is a very important aspect of our product.</p><p><strong>THOMAS SIMONNET</strong> Currently, our primary target group is business travelers, meaning we must be close to the center of the city. Business hotels not only focus on business and leisure, but also on individuals. We are not doing all-inclusive hotels; it is not our core business. If in the future we have that opportunity, we will develop this market. But for now, we are not targeting that specific consumer group. We are really targeting the business segment. As a company, we believe in cities, and most of our hotels are downtown. The hotels can be in the city center, or elsewhere in the city, but we are not usually developing in the middle of the countryside or near beaches. Although our primary focus is business customers, the company believes that business travelers desire leisure too. And today the business traveler market in the city of Santo Domingo is as important as ever.</p><h4>How have you developed your brand in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p><strong>RB</strong> Our firm applied for the Green Globe program and for Crystal in order to maintain quality controls over sanitation and other environmental standards. The company applied for Blue Flag accreditation in order to make sure that we are protecting the beach, which is our main resource, as well as our destination. We participate in the local hotel and tourist associations in all of the destinations that we are present at.  We support not only green initiatives, but also local communities. The company has also worked with Indiana University in order to preserve underwater and coral reef life. Two ships have already been sunk in the Dominicus area in order to generate coral reefs. Also, we have created an underwater museum with many artifacts recovered from Spanish galleons that sank in the area 500 years ago.</p><p><strong>TS</strong> Since 2000 we have been represented by the Mercure brand, which has more than 700 hotels around the world and is very well known. A few years ago, we reorganized our brands. In the process of developing and classifying our different brands, whether four-star or five-star, we realized that we had a certain number of hotels that were truly exceptional. These hotels were difficult to classify in comparison to our other brands. We created the MGallery label for them, and there are about 40 hotels in this collection around the world. We hope to have 50 by the end of 2013.</p><h4>How has Accor contributed to the development of Santo Domingo's historic Colonial Zone?</h4><p><strong>TS</strong> We have brought in new standards as well as international hotel brands. The Colonial Zone is quite a special place. Another way we contribute is as a member of the Association de Ovando, which is a non-profit group that exclusively promotes the development and the interests of the Colonial Zone. Convinced by the high potential of the destination, we are simply trying to help the city develop. We want to demonstrate that it is possible for a large company like us to run an economic activity on a long-term basis.</p><h4>What kind of private sector involvement do you envision?</h4><p><strong>RB</strong> The private sector should be involved in the planning process for tourism promotion. We do not want to participate in contracting services; that is an issue for the government. In order to bring a larger number of tourists to the Dominican Republic, we will need to build between 50,000 and 70,000 new hotel rooms. That means that the Dominican Republic needs to attract approximately $1 billion in new investment. This is not an easy task. In order to do this, we have to make the investment profitable compared to what potential investors could earn in Colombia, Panama, or Mexico. A competitive fiscal package is very important in order to obtain this objective.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In particular, I believe Samaná is one of the most beautiful areas in the country, yet its infrastructure was not fully developed. I was also inspired to get involved in tourism after traveling around Europe and observing the tourism industry there. Therefore, after many meetings, I decided to start a business with some colleagues in 2006. Puerto Bahia Marine &amp; Residences is a beautiful getaway in the Caribbean surrounded by mountains, the sea, and a beautiful marina. In Samaná, summer lasts all year long. We offer the highest quality and luxury, whether it is in our exclusive Bannister Hotel or any of our different offerings in terms of apartments, villas, and townhouses.</p><p><strong>GIANFRANCO FINI</strong> When I first arrived here, there were golf already courses and many people living in the higher part of the complex. However, there was no marina area and I developed the proposal of the marina in Casa de Campo. It was a very innovative and unique project in the country that raised many doubts about its viability. It was a tough project in which I have truly believed since the first moment because infrastructure is a must when aiming to attract tourists or investors. Over the years, the marina has become a key element in this complex, and today there are many shops and restaurants on the marina's promenade. In fact, we expanded the area due to its success, and that provided Casa de Campo with higher value-added. Since developing the marina we have seen similar projects in other areas of the country, such as Punta Cana. I have to say that when I first came to the country some 25 years ago to develop a particular project for a friend, many things were lacking, and over the years I have seen a huge improvement and development in the country's infrastructure and economy. There's not a day that goes by when I'm not amazed by the speed and pace of development in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>How is the project developing?</h4><p><strong>JB</strong> When we developed the idea in 2006, we envisioned four stages of development. We finished the first stage in 2010, which included the construction of luxury apartments and 3,000 sqm of commercial areas, including about 50 hotel rooms. So far, we have sold 90% of the 185 housing units we built in the first stage for approximately $100 million. The real estate crisis has affected our plans, however, and that's why we decided to include a hotel in the business model. The hotel diversifies our business so that we do not have to depend as much on real estate. The next stage of development will include a larger hotel as well as an additional commercial area. We have about 80 hectares under development in Puerto Bahia over the next five years. After the development is finished, Puerto Bahia will consist of about 400 housing units in total.</p><p><strong>GF</strong> The entire proposal process was endless, and I had to modify the initial project proposal up to five times due to budget issues. After almost five years of negotiations and project modifications, the company gave the green light to the marina project. In only eight months, everything was sold out, even though we still had to find a construction company that would build the project. Due to the success of the marina area in Casa de Campo we had to expand its commercial areas, and, for example, a shopping mall was placed within the complex. The residential units around the marina were fully developed in the first stage of construction. Over the years, the marina has become a key element within the complex, and the transit of ships and boats in the area has considerably increased due to the attractiveness of the area. Also, another of the advantages of investing in the harbor here is that it will always be yours.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does organic coffee play in the overall export figures of the industry?<br></h4><p><strong>JOSÉ FERMÍN Níší‘EZ</strong> Traditionally, organic coffee has always played a key role in the industry. In the past, exports of organic coffee were the largest and most significant in the industry. However, the situation has changed in the country, and we think that it will further decrease in the near future due to the industry's current state of development, in which strong brands have taken over and are becoming more relevant in international markets. At the moment, CODOCAFE is focusing its work on diversifying the products in the industry while contributing to its development by conducting research projects and investigations to make production more efficient.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of competitiveness in the Dominican sugar industry?</h4><p><strong>JOSÉ CASIMIRO RAMOS</strong> The country has a long and vast history of sugar production. In fact, Central Romana, a local producer, is among the best and largest sugar producers in the world. We have a wide range of production varieties with a good level of technological advancement, something that has enabled the industry to take a step forward, because in the past the lack of such technologies clearly limited our development. We are focusing on boosting our exports to several European countries. However, we need to improve distribution links with these markets as well as production efficiency among local producers, which should lead to a decrease in production costs.</p><h4>What value-added can help to increase exports?</h4><p><strong>JFN</strong> The protected designation of origin (PDO) can contribute to give added value to the products. In many countries, similar to wine and olive oil, coffee is a product with a PDO. The Dominican Republic is in the first stages of differentiating the coffee produced here using the aroma and the area where it comes from. CODOCAFE is already working with some producers in specific areas of the country to continue this process with their products for the benefit of the national industry. Today, we can proudly say that the Dominican Republic already has its own coffee with a PDO, Café de Valdesia. This particular coffee is being sold at higher prices on the international market thanks to the added value of having a PDO. Also, Café de Barahona is another Dominican PDO, while Café Monte Bonito has its own certification brand. In addition, we installed a coffee laboratory that has already received three ISO certificates and we are in the final stage of recognizing the Dominican Coffee brand in our coffee sold in the EU, becoming the first developing country to acquire such a status in the coffee industry. These two latter elements will boost the international recognition of our coffee and hopefully open many doors into different EU markets. The Dominican Coffee brand has been developed as a support tool for local producers and exporters. As a national institution, we envisage the Dominican Coffee brand to work as an umbrella, meaning Café de Valdesia will be recognized as Dominican coffee with a PDO. Our aim is to promote all the coffee produced nationally, because the country is the main beneficiary of the success. Today, Café de Valdesia is the most recognized coffee in the Dominican Republic, and has the greatest presence in the coffee industry abroad.</p><p><strong>JCR</strong> Although there are some relevant projects focused on value-added—such as Vitamin A being added to sugar—I do not believe that it plays a significant role in the industry. Nowadays, the great advantage for producers in the sector is production volume. Many companies, such as Central Romana, have become role models for other enterprises. In fact, Central Romana has a production capacity of 500,000 tons of sugar, and it is currently producing around 350,000 tons. That means there is room to grow in the sector, because the country used to produce up to 1 million tons of sugar, whereas now the country's production might be around 50% of that figure. The industry is on the right path to boost production figures in the near future, and along with the increases in production will come the need for a larger labor force. Today, the industry employs around 50,000 people and we foresee the need for more people to cover the future needs of the sector, which could be as much as twice the current figure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the quality of the infrastructure in the Dominican Republic for DHL's operations?</h4><p><strong>OLMAN CASTILLO </strong>The Dominican Republic has very sound infrastructure compared to other countries. The highways are in very good condition. You can travel to Santiago from Santo Domingo in two and a half hours. Six months ago, it took four hours to get to Punta Cana, but now with the new highway it takes only two-and-a-half hours. This helps us give the customer in Punta Cana and La Romana a better service. We collect materials in La Romana, and they can fly the same day to the US. We are very happy with the highways and ongoing road works. Regarding the airports in Santiago and in Santo Domingo, we are generally happy with the service. The air cargo area in Santo Domingo requires import renovation, which the administration is already working on a project to improve. The information platform used by customs has had some quality improvements and is still progressing, and I know we are heading in the right direction in developing an integrated system that reduces red tape and transfers greater responsibility to the operators. The taxing and tariff processes are managed very well here as well. I was very impressed when I came to the country to see how easy the taxes and tariffs were processed.</p><h4>What special services are dedicated to your corporate clients?</h4><p><strong>JOSÉ VELA PELLERANO</strong> We currently handle over 275 corporate customers, from banks to telecommunications companies. We offer a wide variety of services to those companies, such as shipping services and exports via FedEx, UPS, and DHL. We also provide document services. If a large company has a training program scheduled, we handle its trading material—binding and laminating—and ship it to its corporate office, hotel, or convention center. Thus, if an international company comes from the US to conduct a seminar here, we can do all the shipping, receiving, and document reproduction.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for the Dominican Republic to serve as a regional hub?</h4><p><strong>OC</strong> If you think about the Caribbean and Central America, the Dominican Republic has many excellent facilities to make it a hub for the region: a strategic location, free trade agreements (FTAs) with many countries, good infrastructure, and the willingness of government. The project to improve airfreight at Las Americas airport will help, especially in terms of increased warehousing facilities, which is the next step to becoming a regional hub.</p><h4>Being part of an international company, did you encounter any specific challenges while working in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p><strong>JVP</strong> As far as a franchise goes, it is really not the same as starting a business from zero, because you come with know-how. I went to a six-week training course in California and completed my training in Venezuela. Our opening was as smooth as could be for a new business. We recently sold a franchise in Santiago, for example. The city is very excited with its new store, with high expectations and excellent potential for the business model in that market. MBE has currently over 1,350 stores worldwide in over 30 countries. This concept has worked all over the world. We have the know-how and the experience. When we started the first Dominican Republic franchise, we had three people. I first worked in the store at 21 years' old. Now, we have over 70 employees with 10 stores—growth has been good and steady. We have basically opened one new store every year. We are happy, and believe that this market has tremendous potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What level of competition do you expect in the shopping mall sector?</h4><p><strong>FERNANDO GARCÍA</strong> Crespo It is going to be fierce. If you look at the recent history of the country, we had problems in 2001 and then a big financial meltdown happened here in 2003. Then, in 2008, the second financial meltdown occurred, although that was worldwide. I call this the champagne bottle effect. We fell behind in many of these developments in retailing and also in other areas. However, we have a very agile economy that is quick to adapt and caught up. Suddenly, everyone decided to have the same idea and all these malls went up. Are there too many malls? No, not really. We have conducted studies on countries similar to ours and the number of malls to be built in Santo Domingo is not excessive over the long term. What we have been doing over the last three or four years has been done in other countries over the last 20 years. People are going to be very happy with the new offerings. They are going to have what they have never had before. Previously, they had very few options, whereas now they almost have too many options. It is going to be tough on some retailers.</p><p><strong>SALOMÓN COHEN</strong> Bouchara Everybody is talking about competition because three shopping centers are under construction at the same time. We are from Venezuela and can bring in a lot of our experience in the retail industry. Competition is good for us, because many retailers don't want to just open one store but five or six in different locations. If we can find a place for all these stores, then we can expand even further. We bought the land and in three months we started working on construction. It was a very simple process and we received a lot of support. It is a big project—it will be the largest shopping center in the country.</p><h4>How many brands or retailers have you attracted?</h4><p><strong>FGC</strong> It changes every day. Right now, I think we have about 75 to 85 signed. We are moving toward 90, which is full occupancy. A couple of them are new. Fuddruckers is new in town. Gatsby is new and is going to be a mini-anchor; it is a 1,200-sqm clothing store for young people. Casaideas, which is a home center operator from Chile, is also new. We have some new novelties for the market, but not just for the sake of novelty. We want to offer a little bit of everything.</p><p><strong>SCB</strong> We work with many international brands, with Victoria's Secret being a good example. The person who has the rights to the brand in Venezuela wants to come to the Dominican Republic, and we can help him to do that. There are many companies from all over the world, from Spain and the UK for example, that are in a similar situation to Victoria's Secret. Their entry will be good for the whole country, as they don't want to open just one store but are looking to expand across a number of locations. Right now, we have 60% of the shopping center filled, which is quite good for a center with 365 stores. We have filled a lot of the available space, but we don't want to completely fill all the stores because we are looking to attract some US brands such as Forever 21, Gap, and Old Navy. We need to be able to offer such major brands enough space if they want to come, because they need large store sizes.</p><h4>How will your mall's concept be unique?</h4><p><strong>FGC</strong> It will be a racetrack system, consisting of one floor with all the shops present on a closed loop. One of the big disadvantages we found about malls in the Dominican Republic is that they all have many floors. When you have many floors, the efforts of the retailer are compromised. For example, the second floor could be full of people, but your store is on the third floor and nobody passes by. That is why in Europe and the US most malls occupy only one floor, or at the most two with a canyon design, so that when you are walking around on one floor you can see all of the stores on the other floors.</p><p><strong>SCB</strong> Sambil Santo Domingo Mall has a strong marketing department for the center, and every week we aim to hold an event. For example, we may have a cooking course that everybody can watch. We will hold culture days as well. We will do something everyday, including fashion shows through which the winner can win the opportunity to represent the mall for a whole year. The mall will also boast facilitates for children, including bowling and a pre-historic-themed restaurant. Entertainment is very important. It is a concept we developed in Venezuela, and we want to introduce it here, too.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess your port's main advantages?</h4><p><strong>ERIK ALMA</strong> Haina International Terminals has spent more than $60 million on a very comprehensive infrastructure improvement plan. All access ways have been rebuilt and repaved, the terminal storage area has been completely re-surfaced using concrete blocks, two additional container port cranes were purchased, more than 650 meters of piers have been totally reconstructed, a new multi-lane commercial gate was built, the world's top terminal operating system was implemented, a comprehensive CCTV system was installed, 3 kilometers of perimeter fencing was erected, and the list goes on and on.  In short, what we have today is a completely new port that provides significant improvements in security, efficiency, and reliability for all users.</p><p><strong>MORTEN JOHANSEN</strong> Caucedo is different from any other port in the Dominican Republic. The port has very modern infrastructure, similar to what is seen in European or Asian ports. At the same time, the infrastructure is unique in terms of the land and equipment. At Caucedo, we enjoy naturally deep water with hard rocks below, so we do not have to carry out heavy maintenance or dredging. As a result, we can support big business without any issues. That is a challenge for other ports in the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>What have been your main actions in preparing for the expansion of the Panama Canal?</h4><p><strong>EA</strong> For us, it is matter of maintaining a clear vision of our target market and deploying the right resources to service them with excellence. The reality is that all economies in the Caribbean and Central America including Dominican Republic are relatively small. You do have some large transshipment ports in the region that can service the long haul and larger ships that will now be able to cross the Panama Canal, but these are unrelated to the scale of the local economies  where they reside.  At Haina, our focus is on providing a world-class service to local import/export customers, the regional shipping routes, and the feeder vessels from other transshipping points.</p><p><strong>MJ</strong> We are getting ready to service the types of vessels that will now come through here. The trend of shipping lines is based on economies of scale. The ships are getting bigger and bigger. That requires us to establish the right infrastructure at the terminal, including the right draft for the vessels to call and the right cranes in order to be able to service such vessels. That normally requires large investments, and in some places it is not possible to do. At Caucedo, we are prepared to handle more volume. Should the demand be there in the future from our customers, we also have the possibility to extend our berthing facilities. Today, we have close to 1 kilometer of berth. We can handle another 500 meters at least.</p><h4>What are your port's future investment priorities?</h4><p><strong>EA</strong> We are right now at the tail end of a very intensive reconstruction phase at the main terminal on the east side of the river. With 1,600 lineal meters of berths, 250,000 sqm of container storage space, low-density layout, and areas still in reserve, we have enough room to accommodate future growth. We will now turn our attention to Haina West, starting with the total reconstruction of 250 meters of berth for general cargo and bulk vessels. With the base infrastructure almost completely revamped, we will also redirect our resources to renovating our mobile equipment fleet in support of our efforts to achieve continuously higher levels of efficiency.</p><p><strong>MJ</strong> We are considering the development of a logistics center in connection with the port. The port is a free trade zone (FTZ), which is very attractive. To have a FTZ logistics center as well is also very attractive. There are many international companies arriving in the FTZ and operating here. There is a huge local market with good connections from the country to other points in the Caribbean basin. We are looking at developing our logistics center in this very unique location. Having an airport, a logistics center, and a large and modern port is very advantageous.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you see opportunities for expansion in the region for the activities of your company?</h4><p><strong>JEFFREY RANNIK</strong> In the coming years, we expect other projects to be developed in the country to support the needs of the cruise industry. As far as cargo is concerned, there is always a need as the economy grows to expand the existing ports; as those reach their maximum capacity, maybe in the next 10 years, I would not be surprised to see other projects arise. We expect an increase in activity on the industrial side and in the energy sector. Furthermore, the expansion of the Panama Canal will be underway. As soon as we get larger ships coming into the Caribbean basin, there will be a demand for more port capacity.</p><p><strong>TEDDY HEINSEN</strong> We will have to expand in Caucedo. We are dredging up to 15 meters, building another 400-meter pier, and installing an additional 4-5 cranes, which comprises Phase III of Caucedo. We will take the port up to the capacity of about 2.5 million TEUs. The current volume is 1 million TEUs, so we will more than double our handling capacity. Through this, we will attract larger ships that are headed for the Panama Canal. Those who choose not to expand are committing commercial suicide. If we intend to remain a hub, we have to update the port and take care of everything; the widening of the Panama Canal will allow ships carrying 12,600 TEUs to pass through, and we must be prepared.</p><h4>What has been B&amp;R Group's commitment to the development of the port industry in the Dominican Republic?</h4><p><strong>JTR</strong> We embarked on a number of projects to improve the port infrastructure in the Dominican Republic. One of these projects was the development of the Port of Caucedo. Our group was one of the original promoters of the Port of Caucedo, and in collaboration with a local investor group in the private sector we partnered with what is now DP World, our 50% partner and operator of the port. We are also partnered with our colleagues in the shipping community for the operation of Port Haina. In exchange for an investment commitment over a 30-year period, the local partners put together an investment plan for Port Haina and assisted in organizing port security and infrastructure for the sustained development of that port. More recently, B&amp;R signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in June 2011 with Carnival Corporation for the development of a cruise terminal on the north coast of the Dominican Republic in a bay called Bahí­a de Maimón, which is in the province of Puerto Plata. The development of this port is a joint venture that is being led by Carnival Corporation directly with our  local team.</p><h4>How competitive is the Dominican Republic compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p><strong>TH</strong> The country is very competitive, so much so that one of our ports, Caucedo, is currently being utilized at almost 95% capacity per year. That means that the port is doing very well and is also very competitive. We have to compete with ports that have enjoyed much greater investments than those made in Caucedo. Our competitors include Kingston, Panama City, Cartagena, and Freeport, which are internationally recognized ports.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the cruise industry at the moment?</h4><p><strong>JTR</strong> The cruise industry needs to develop new destinations, with many repeat customers who do not always want to go to the same ports. At the same time, there is a need in the industry at large to develop new ports and terminals, many of which have certain limitations with respect to water depth and size of the ships that can be handled.</p><h4>What added value does E.T. Heinsen offer as a shipping agent?</h4><p><strong>TH</strong> We are mainly container operators that represent three principle shipping lines. One of them has a hub here. The other is a specialist in container traffic from the Far East to the Dominican Republic, and the third is an operator from the Mediterranean, carrying heavy lifts and so on. We carry all the metro and big carts from Spain. I think our primary asset is our people and the education we offer them, because we provide everything so that they are able to serve our representation and meet the needs of our clients. Employing qualified, well-trained people is probably our best asset.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Several international institutions, such as the IMF and the World Bank, advise the Dominican Republic to increase electricity tariffs. What is your take on the debate?<br></h4><p><strong>HIPÓLITO Níší‘EZ MARTÍNEZ</strong> The Dominican people are very much against an increase in electricity tariffs, because they compare price and services with other regional countries and argue that we already have the most expensive tariffs in the region. This statement is not entirely true. I am a representative of the country at the Latin American Energy Association, and can say that this country is currently at the medium to high level in terms of tariffs. However, in the residential segment we are at the medium-low level. In fact, in the range of clients below 400 kWh consumption, we lose money, and the segment has been subsidized for many years now. It all comes down to the high costs of energy production in the country, as well as efforts to protect the poorest segment of clients through the implementation of a so-called "light bonus" card that helps people pay for part of their consumption. This initiative also helps to make as many as 800,000 people committed to pay their monthly electricity bill through this "bonus light" card, because if they do not, people will not receive other types of benefit. The initiative will enable us to promote a culture of commitment to pay for services in the lower-income segments of society.</p><h4>Why is electricity in the Dominican Republic more expensive than in other countries in the region?</h4><p><strong>LUÍS ERNESTO DE LEÓN</strong> Many contracts were signed during the financial crisis and those agreements have resulted in high energy prices. To further understand the issue, we have to look back to the 1940s, when the first contracts were signed at the national level and the first electricity company was founded. In 1996, the capitalization process for electricity companies began with the objective of bringing in investment and reducing the cost of energy, thus meaning the government would not have to cover the deficit. The state electricity company was then split into three parts: generation, transmission, and distribution. This brought in new investment, while the government kept 49% of the shares in generation and distribution and kept 100% of the shares in hyrdro-generation firms and transmission companies. Long-term contracts with the private sector that were not subject to modification then resulted in better prices for the distribution companies. This process brought more investment into the generation segment, but the distribution companies have not been able to reduce losses and the government has to put more money into the sector to keep services in the country. However, the turning point in this entire situation was the signing of the so-called "Madrid Agreement"—contracts with electricity producers were extended, keeping price rates at a high level. In addition to that, we have to consider that the usage of petroleum derivative fuel in the production of electricity has driven prices up.</p><h4>Since you were appointed to your current position, what have been your main goals?</h4><p><strong>HNM</strong> The company currently has losses of around 39% in terms of the energy we buy from producers and the energy sold to consumers. At the moment, we are in the process of developing a general strategy involving the entire company. We have established a working group to come up with specific action points that will enable us to improve our situation and balance our finances. We aim to reduce our losses by 4%. We have refocused the company's administration on generation centers, which would enable us to better identify the origin of our economic losses in order to take measures to address the situation, become more efficient, and understand where we have to strengthen relationships with our consumers.</p><p><strong>LEL</strong> I hope to arrive at 2016 with the lowest rate of loss possible and better service to our customers. If we achieve our objectives through hard work we believe that the loss could be around 12%-13%. However, since the sector needs large improvement, I will focus on reducing loss on a yearly basis, making this goal more realistic. We need to increase the collection of unpaid bills, diversify our customer portfolio, and increase the levels of distribution. The company needs to be restructured because most of the services are outsourced, and we need to improve our efficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges is the country facing based on the high prices of fuel internationally? How can the high price of oil interfere with national development plans?<br></h4><p><strong>OTTO GONZÁLEZ</strong> The authorities are aware of the necessity for a diversified fuel matrix of hydrocarbons and coal in the electrical industry. This means that we should lower the risks associated with fuel price variations by making more use of coal and natural gas. We can further balance the risk by developing renewable energy sources. There is a large potential on the island for wind and solar power, and to a limited extent also in hydroelectric energy. The Dominican Republic is one of the few countries in the Caribbean region that has a more balanced matrix given that besides petroleum fuels, we also use natural gas, coal, some hydro, and now wind power. We need more gas, coal, and renewable generation to gradually substitute petroleum fuels. However, I believe the financing of coal projects is not being supported by multilateral organizations due to the greenhouse effect on the atmosphere. In any case, for developing countries that do not have certain energy resources, there is little choice but to develop a portion of thermal generation based on coal.</p><h4>What were the main factors behind EGE Haina's impressive revenues in 2011?</h4><p><strong>TITO SANJURJO</strong> The company has invested in technologies that allow us to generate energy more efficiently. I think that has been the key to our success, and although we are still burning oil, we are burning it in a very efficient manner. Additionally, the company has invested in building a coal facility that was a part of the acquisition when we purchased shares of the company from the state in 1999. We now have a coal plant that allows us to divorce ourselves somewhat from oil. In 2011, EGE Haina installed the first wind farm in the Dominican Republic. That shows our commitment to continuing our investment in energy despite the challenges that are associated with doing business here in the energy sector, as well as our focus on renewables as a way for the Dominican Republic to, as whole, reduce its dependency on imported oil. In December 2011, we kicked off the construction of a new plant, which will be a duel-fuel plant burning either oil or natural gas. That will give us the flexibility to use the best-priced commodity at the time.</p><h4>What is your statement about the measures that have been taken to adjust the energy matrix?</h4><p><strong>OG</strong> One significant step was taken by declaring a renewable generation law that promotes these technologies—like wind and solar—and that is already in effect. Companies such as EGE Haina with the Los Cocos wind farm have taken advantage of that law. That is one definite step. In addition, the price structure offered to a developer is attractive and competitive. This law has been a good way to promote the installation of renewable energy generation systems. The incentives should be kept in place to promote this type of generation.</p><h4>What is the potential for wind energy in the country?</h4><p><strong>TS</strong> We inaugurated the first phase of Los Cocos in October 2011. It was a 25-MW power plant investment of over $100 million. This investment has been very successful. We are meeting our production expectations and continue to see good results from the wind farms. For that reason, and because the wind resources in this area are world class, the company decided to expand the wind park. We are investing another $100 million to expand the capacity of the plant to 77 MW, because we already have the infrastructure. In the first phase, we had to put in the infrastructure of transmission lines and substations, and we had to do some roadwork, but that is already in place. Now, it is just a matter of the wind turbines and some internal roadwork to the wind park. That allows us to grow incrementally with marginal investment. As a matter of fact, we are installing 52 MW for the same price that we were producing 25 MW before, so that helps us tremendously.</p><h4>Generadora San Felipe's only customer, the Dominican Government, through the Dominican Corporation of State Electricity Companies (CDEEE), recently paid $500 million against the debt to various generating companies. How would you characterize the situation at present?</h4><p><strong>OG</strong> This is the first time that the debt has reached such a high level. The CDEEE's total debt has hovered around $400 million-$600 million. For many companies, this means that the return on investment is partially captured in this debt, and most companies have not been able to generate their expected returns. For various reasons, this problem has not been solved since 1999, when the government implemented a privatization of the electricity sector. The authorities created a new set of rules with an electricity law and regulation that came into effect shortly afterward. The framework for a fair playing field came into being. Nevertheless, those laws and regulations have not been fully observed. Part of the problem lies in not allowing the real price of electricity to be passed on to the consumer. Essentially, there is no real price signal for the consumer, and the prices to them do not reflect the actual production costs. The other major problem is that energy losses at the distribution level are too high at around 35% of the energy generated. As long as the government does not tackle these issues and plays according to the rules, the situation will be difficult to manage.</p><h4>What are the savings of oil that the country will get from EGE Haina's investments in wind energy?</h4><p><strong>TS</strong> Phase I will probably mean about 200,000 barrels of fuel savings annually. At today's prices of close to $100 per barrel, that is $20 million worth of savings. Phase II will be more than that at close to 500,000 barrels worth of savings. More importantly, however, is the CO2 emissions savings. We are saving 70,000 tons of CO2 emissions in Phase I and double that for Phase II at 150,000 tons. These are very significant savings and this is very good for the environment, too. Those are the kind of non-monetary results that are also present.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does domestic and international demand play in your business activity?<br></h4><p><strong>HENDRIK KELNER</strong> For Tabadom, the local market is not important. We only sell cigars to stores that have the conditions to preserve their quality, which sometimes can be a problem because there are not many stores that meet our requirements. In the Dominican Republic, our biggest demand comes from tourists, but that is still a small market for us. Tabadom now has a distribution company that sells in the Dominican Republic; however, it is very limited. Our cigars are expensive, so not too many people in the Dominican Republic are able to afford them. There are a lot of other factories that produce less expensive cigars, and I think they play an important role in the industry.</p><p><strong>JAVIER ELMUDESI</strong> Today, 97% of our production is exported, with the US and Europe our main markets. We are entering the Asian market, and I believe that our exports to this area will become important for our foreign activities in the near future. Every year we launch new products in our existing markets, because it is important to diversify the product portfolio and consolidate our presence in those markets.</p><h4>What trends have you spotted in the cigar industry recently?</h4><p><strong>HK</strong> The strong cigar has a greater advertising appeal; people talk more about stronger cigars. However, the biggest sellers are not the strong cigars. Consumers are very loyal and they don't often look for different experiences. In the US, it's a less mature market. There are more people that like a strong cigar. Something that is clear in the market is that people prefer cigars with a bigger ring gauge and shorter length; this is because people don't have time to smoke anymore and especially because in many countries it's difficult to find a place to smoke.</p><h4>What is the touristic potential of the cigar-making industry?</h4><p><strong>JE</strong> Over the years, we have come to understand the importance of our production infrastructure, the area we are based on, and the opportunities we have to show how cigars are made to many of the tourists that visit the Dominican Republic every year. For that reason, we offer limited tours around our production facilities, which has actually allowed many people to discover the wonderful cigar-making industry and the many people that it employs. In this regard, we are very proud of our history, culture, and tradition, and being able to show people how we work and how important the staff is provides us with unique feedback.</p><h4>How will changes to the labor code and tax reforms affect the industry?</h4><p><strong>H</strong><strong>K</strong> This will affect us in two ways. The first is the government proposes changes to free trade zone (FTZ) regulations. One is an increase in the sales tax on the local market. However, this is not so important for the tobacco industry. The other is that the government proposes a tax of 10% on dividends, which again is not too important because the majority of the industry doesn't make a profit, meaning there are no dividends to tax. These are not important to us, but it is a change. When companies come to the Dominican Republic, it is because they analyze different countries and they decide to come here because of the conditions of the FTZs; however, if they change the rules, it could affect investment.</p><p><strong>JE</strong> In the US we have seen an increased demand for more complex cigars in terms of flavor and aroma, prioritizing stronger varieties. In terms of packaging, it depends on the marketing strategy—we produce boxes of 10, 20, or 25 cigars. Behind the success of any company there is a good stock of tobacco, and Tabacalera de Garcí­a possesses one of the best tobacco inventories in the world, both in terms of quality and quantity. For example, we have at least two years' worth of stock in order to address an unsatisfactory harvest year. The experience the company holds in the industry and its vast network of international ties and agreements sets it apart from the competition.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the cigar industry over the next few years?</h4><p><strong>HK</strong> Because of the high price of handmade cigars, we will maintain our market share. However, machine-made cigars are in huge demand and that demand is growing every year. Santiago is the number-one producer of machine-made cigars, and that's a product for the US market. This is good because it increases employment, and also because those types of cigars use the tobacco from poor farmers. For me, this is more important because today the industry is growing too fast; only 15% of the tobacco is Dominican. Much of the cheap tobacco comes from India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh. This is a big opportunity for the Dominican Republic, and this is where the future of tobacco is. While machine-made cigars are not our business, it is good for the country.</p><h4>How significant is the company's investment in workforce capacitation and training?</h4><p><strong>JE</strong> Training and capacitation are key elements of our industry, and we place heavy attention on the recruiting process. In fact, Tabacalera de Garcí­a has its own training school, and we only hire cigar-making professionals after a six-month period in which they are assigned experienced mentors that monitor their learning process. Therefore, we strongly invest in workforce capacity, putting a lot of emphasis on the cigar-making culture of the company. About 65% of our employees are women. Although we do not have any preference when hiring cigar-making professionals, most of the industry's workers are women.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did Viamar Group decide to introduce Jaguar in the Dominican Republic?<br></h4><p><strong>FERNANDO M. VILLANUEVA</strong> Jaguar became a member of Viamar Group in 2000. At that time, the group was experiencing growth in market share and the market itself was increasing. In 1988, Ford Motor Company bought Jaguar Motors, so it was a natural progression. We were offered Jaguar in 2000, and the timing was perfect because the company was booming and the market was expanding. It was natural for us to venture into luxury cars for the first time. We had some experience with the Lincoln line, but as Lincoln has always been perceived as a US brand, Jaguar fit perfectly into our mix.</p><h4>Grupo Ambar distributes Nissan and Chevrolet. What new lines are on the way?</h4><p><strong>MIGUEL BARLETTA</strong> We recently incorporated the Infiniti brand of vehicles and the luxury brand of Nissan Motors, making us one of the first countries in Latin America to do so. It has a standalone full service facility on the grounds of Santo Domingo Motors.</p><h4>What is the customer profile for Jaguar Dominicana?</h4><p><strong>FMV</strong> One of the misconceptions about Jaguar is that it is too pricey or aristocratic, in that it is one of the few cars used by the monarchy in the UK. In reality, Jaguar offers competitive prices. We do not exalt or emphasize our brand or try to sell the vehicle based upon its price. The competition innovates and innovates, often losing the essence of luxury. Our customers are curious about Jaguar because we present vehicles that maintain that hard-to-get sense of luxury. I am confident that we are one of the last brands that do not compromise when it comes to offering our customers the luxury they seek. Our true customers value that and the services we provide. We are blessed in that we have a small house; we know each customer by name and tailor to each one. We relate to our clients on a first-name basis because we pay attention to detail, as does Jaguar.</p><h4>What is the car industry doing to reduce sales volatility?</h4><p><strong>MB</strong> Automobile markets in Latin America have traditionally been volatile and cyclical. The Dominican Republic is no exception, and in our particular case it strongly impacts the government's revenue perceived through various taxes that are paid at the various stages of the sale process. The majority of the time, factors are external to the local industry but on occasion the numbers are volatile on account of specific imports for numerous private and public programs. In essence, there is very little that the industry can do to impact the volatility, but it would be in everyone's interest to reduce it.</p><h4>What success have you experienced over the last 12 years?</h4><p><strong>FMV</strong> When Jaguar was introduced, we experienced a distinct boom in sales. We were expecting around 100 sales per year for the first five years, but we achieved 100 sales in the first two months. There was an initial boom with the introduction of new lines such as the S-Type and the innovative XK type. However, the designers rested on their laurels and did not change any significant parts of the S-Type for five or six years. For that reason, the brand suffered from saturation. When you see the same car for five or six years, you are not going to want to buy it. With the advent of new models of Mercedes, BMW, and Audi, our sales started to shrink—not only in the Dominican Republic, but also worldwide. In 2008, Jaguar introduced the XF, which replaced the S-Type, and again we saw a huge sales boom, coupled with the fact that Jaguar Motors was sold to Tata Motors. This was beneficial for us; we were able to enjoy a dedicated company that did not have other luxury brands taking away some of the funding that should be allocated for technology, design, and R&amp;D. The XJ vehicle, which was one of Jaguar's flagships and was released in 1968, never changed. They would tweak it here and there, but the shape did not change.</p><h4>In 2012, Chevrolet celebrated its 100th anniversary, and Grupo Ambar got a mention for being the top seller of the brand in the Caribbean region. What is the position of Chevrolet within the local market?</h4><p><strong>MB</strong> Traditionally, Chevrolet has been the leading US brand and over the last couple of years it has consistently increased its market share in the Dominican Market to be one of the top automotive makes in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4><strong></strong>How would a future business partner benefit from participating in the development of the port of Manta?<br></h4><p><strong>ROBERTO SALAZAR </strong>The main advantage of the Port of Manta is that it is increasingly playing a more important regional role in the sector, which at the end of the day is vital, because it offers huge growth potential. Guayaquil is today the most important commercial port in Ecuador, but it has a lot of limitations regarding depth and infrastructure; to solve these would require huge amounts of investment. However, the port of Manta can easily develop and improve its infrastructure, as well as its position at the regional level. For that reason, we need a commercial partner that could facilitate agreements with the  largest maritime freight transportation companies, and at the same time develop our future commercial strategy, the key for our growth and success.</p><h4>What are the main challenges associated with your work?</h4><p><strong>RUBÉN MORÁN</strong> The port is close to the city, but not close to the ocean. Exports and imports are carried through the 90-kilometer channel of Guayaquil, which causes frequent structural problems and represents a big issue. The navigation channel's depth is 9.5 meters, which was fine for ships in the past, but it is not deep enough for the next generation of vessels. We are planning to dredge the channel in order to make it deeper. We're conducting research and hiring consulting companies specialized in the area in order to find out what procedures we should follow to determine the appropriate depth for the current shipping industry and foreign trade.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for 2012?</h4><p><strong>RS</strong> There is $15 million worth of planned investments for 2012 that will go to the reinforcement of International Port No. 2 and the dredging of the port. These projects are designed within a larger development plan that foresees an overall investment of $281 million, of which the government of Ecuador will contribute $105 million and private businesses another $100 million in the first stage of the project to upgrade our machinery and infrastructure. The main target of this first stage of the project is to achieve a capacity of 300,000 TEUs. The second stage, which amounts to $75 million worth of investment, will be independently raised by private business.</p><p><strong>RM</strong> Our main goal is to finalize our plan for the dredging project in Guayaquil. There are also infrastructure projects for small expansions, such as developing the logistics area, consolidating cargo, building warehouses, and conducting inventory operations that help facilitate and develop the import-export business from a technical standpoint. But first and foremost, we will focus on dredging.</p><h4>What is the potential to encourage a higher level of cruise ship traffic?</h4><p><strong>RS</strong> The tourism industry is rapidly growing and developing in Ecuador, and I believe such growth will boost the arrival of a larger number of cruise ships to the port of Manta. Today, we host around 25 cruise liners every year, and one of our advantages is that we can host two ships of more than 200 meters in length simultaneously. I believe we can further improve our infrastructure to attract more cruise ship operators, but at the same time the city needs to grow and offer more tourist attractions like tourism packages promoting longer stays in Ecuador rather than the usual 24- to 48-hour stays. Depending on the development of the industry, we could even consider establishing the commercial port in one area and the tourism port in another.</p><h4>How will the future expansion of the port have an effect on Ecuador?</h4><p><strong>RM</strong> Dredging is our main project, and it's closely related to the expansion of the Panama Canal. Once the Panama Canal is expanded, larger ships will be coming through to the west coast of the Pacific. If we're not prepared, we will have higher costs for imports and exports, and potentially lose part of our business and a number of direct routes. Shipping lines would begin using alternative routes, which would hurt business and trade overall. We're also planning on establishing a logistics center in the area, which would attract many companies dealing with international transport goods.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the civil aviation sector changing?<br></h4><p><strong>CARLOS JÁCOME </strong>There is a national project being implemented by the government and every party in the civil aviation field. The reforms aim to strengthen the National Civil Aviation Council's (DGAC) position as a regulatory body. Starting within the government, we are creating a regulatory agency called the Agency of Regulation and Control. This organization will grant the management of national airports to either public companies or private operators, which will improve the quality of our infrastructure. We will prioritize private tenders that bring good management knowledge and commercial experience to the table. Every airport managed by the government is lacking in some way; the best management examples are at the Quito and Guayaquil airports, which are privately operated. The council has regulated the fuel subsidies system for national carriers, contributing to the development of three large Ecuadorean airlines. We have also improved air legislation to strengthen passenger protection in situations such as delays and cancellations, establishing a framework of sanctions on carriers and various compensation options for customers.</p><p><strong>FERNANDO GUERRERO</strong> We are in the process of the modernization of the civil aviation industry in our country. First of all, we have to invest in restructuring our airport infrastructure. For example, in 2011, we were simultaneously working on 10 airports in locations including Latacunga, Galápagos, Macas, and Santa Rosa. Tena is also very important for tourism. All of these airports feed into the principle airports of Quito and Guayaquil. We have 28 domestic and international airports in Ecuador, but all air traffic at some point interconnects with Quito or Guayaquil. We do not have traffic traveling from one province to another without transferring through one of these two principle hubs. Our vision is to modernize these very important airports.</p><h4>What is the status of the airports in Cuenca and Baltra in the Galápagos?</h4><p><strong>CJ</strong> The airport of Cuenca represents a specific management model; in the past we delegated the airport to the town of Cuenca, which later on allocated infrastructure to a non-profit organization; the Airport Corporation of Cuenca. For Baltra Airport, the situation is similar, but the tender was carried out under different circumstances. A very attractive infrastructure model was designed, and now the islands are developing an ecofriendly airport key to the economic and social development of the country.</p><h4>What specialties will the new airport on the Galápagos Islands feature?</h4><p><strong>FG</strong> The company building the Baltra airport is part of a US corporation that also has the concession for Quiport. The airport on Baltra will be the first ecological airport in the world, and we are very interested in the project because it will be the main airport for the Galápagos Islands. The company is investing $24 million in a new, concrete runway that is easier on the environment. Furthermore, there will be a new passenger terminal and all the materials being used are environmentally friendly.</p><h4>How would you assess the overall development of air transportation over the past years?</h4><p><strong>CJ</strong> The past few years have been very positive for the air transport sector; we increased the number of local and international passengers by 5%, whereas the average growth rate worldwide was about 4%. In terms of granting subsidies, we needed to reorganize the system. We were offering subsidies worth $60 million and not seeing the returns in terms of passenger services, salaries, new fleet investments, and training for employees. In restructuring the system, we did what was best for the population. Overall, we are pleased with the growth rate the sector is experiencing, but we need to strengthen the figure by implementing new measures.</p><h4>How will the government's decision to remove the fuel subsidy incentivize the development of alternative airports?</h4><p><strong>FG</strong> We analyze this issue constantly. We are aware that the government made an important decision, and that ticket prices for customers have been affected. Previously, companies were making business and not passing the benefits on to the customer. We can understand why the government is making the effort to institute more benefits for both airlines and passengers. We removed all the subsidies from our airports in Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca, and the Galápagos. It was difficult, but we have formulated very strong policies regarding the new law.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Ecuador compare to other countries in terms of investment in the tuna sector?<br></h4><p><strong>BRUNO LEONE </strong>Tuna is a very capital-intensive industry. To establish a tuna factory that can process 200 tons of tuna per day takes an initial investment of about $30 million. There are three very clear steps in the tuna value chain: fishing, processing, and marketing.</p><p>In terms of fishing, I have an Ecuadorean-flagged fleet, which means I need to adhere to quotas and regulations; you cannot just buy a boat and catch fish in Ecuador. Within the area regulated by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, there is a finite capacity. The only way to get around that limit is to sail to another ocean, which is something Ecuador cannot do because its fleet is almost 40 years old. The Ecuadorean fleet was the first fishing fleet in the Eastern Pacific. A new medium-sized boat, capable of catching 1,000 tons of tuna, would cost about $20 million. Most of our investment has been focused on upgrading our processing capacity. We can process about 400,000 tons of tuna per year, which is a lot. Worldwide, the tuna processing capacity is 4 million tons. Ecuador can process 10% of that, which is significant given our size. We have 13 or 14 facilities capable of processing 150-200 tons of tuna per day. Marketing is a different story, though. The key is to form alliances with big buyers in the EU and US. We produced about $970 million in tuna exports in 2011.</p><p><strong>ISABEL ANDRADE</strong> Tecopesca was established 12 years ago as the daughter company of a larger enterprise that had been operating in Ecuador for quite some time. The development of the market and its demand, which was constantly growing, led to the establishment of Tecopesca, a 100% Ecuadorean company.</p><p>It all started with the establishment of one processing plant. Over the years, we have gained the trust of Ecuadorean consumers, our suppliers, and banks, for they have played a significant role in the expansion of our activities. Our principal activity is the processing of food products with high value-added, and we can proudly say that today we have become one of the leading food companies in South America. When we first started, we were processing 26 tons of fish a week, whereas today we process 78 tons of fish a day, and we have five different lines of products. In 2011, our revenues reached $130 million. We have heavily invested in infrastructure during these 12 years, doubling the plant's processing capacity and expanding the storage capacity. Right now, we have 13,000 tons of warehousing capacity.</p><p>Our main asset is our workforce; we are committed to integrating our staff into our work culture by providing them with the right tools to broaden their professional skills.</p><h4>What are the main foreign markets your company is active in?</h4><p><strong>BL</strong> The fishing industry in Ecuador provides a lot of aggregate value to the economy. In addition to creating jobs and paying taxes, it is a significant source of dollars for our trade balance. The tuna sector is the most active in the industry.</p><p>Our main markets are Europe, which imports about 60% of our tuna, South America, and the US. That is why it is extremely important for us that Ecuador can reach commercial agreements with our main export markets, the EU and the US.</p><p><strong>IA</strong> Tecopesca currently exports 99% of what it produces, and in this regard we have two main markets: the EU and Latin America—especially Venezuela. The government of Ecuador has positively boosted the development of the industry, and in our particular case, it has done a lot to strengthen commercial relations with Venezuela, our main market in Latin America. The Unitary System of Regional Compensation (SUCRE) has played a significant role in boosting trade relations between Ecuador and Venezuela, and today Tecopesca is the private company with the highest level of commercial transactions between both countries.</p><p>For that reason, we believe it would be very important to implement similar agreements with other regional countries. As for Europe, although negotiations on the trade agreement between Ecuador and the EU have been a bit confusing, we believe they are back on track now and we will see positive developments in the near future, especially regarding custom tariffs, which will enable us to have a better position than our competitors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the pharmaceutical market evolved in Ecuador, and in which ways has your company contributed to its development?<br></h4><p><strong>ANA DOLORES ROMÁN </strong>The Ecuadorean pharmaceutical market is very diverse and has been growing over the last few years at a rate of 8%-10%. The overall business activity of the sector is worth $1.5 billion. The pharmaceutical industry is generating greater access for the population at the base of the pyramid through government and private sector initiatives. Pfizer's main goal is to maintain growth at a double-digit pace, as we have succeeded in doing over the last few years. As an example, we have a patient support plan, in which we provide the market with innovative and high-quality products and a significant number of primary health products. I would also like to mention our contribution to the biological, oncological, and vaccination spheres of the market, where Pfizer has played the leading role. Our R&amp;D activity has also been an important part of our contribution to the Ecuadorean market.</p><p><strong>HÉCTOR ENRÍQUEZ </strong>Over the last four years, the government has shifted its focus to invest in health services and needs and has made important investments in the sector. Pharmaceutical products have played an important role, and we have had the opportunity to make higher sales and grow our share in the public business. Additionally, we look for other areas that may have potential, invest in those segments, and provide and supply the products that are needed in the country. We foresee the government continuing with this strategy. The percentage of people that are covered and are receiving health services in our country is very low compared to other South American countries. In order to enhance health care, we need to be prepared in terms of human capital, technology, equipment, and new products. These are going to be our needs in the future.</p><h4>How significant is Ecuador to Pfizer's global operations?</h4><p><strong>ADR</strong> Ecuador is part of Pfizer's Latin American regional area of activity, and up until 2011 we shared regional coverage with Peru and Bolivia. Since January 2012, Pfizer's regional operations have been divided; we are now reporting our activities to the head office in New York City. Today, Ecuador plays a significant role within Pfizer's regional operations in terms of innovation and investment because we are a fairly small country that is able to develop projects in a wide variety of fields. In addition, we are taking advantage of the company's global R&amp;D activities to launch new products and lines in the Ecuadorean market such as biologics and vaccines. Pfizer is fully committed to Ecuador and its market needs, providing many people with access to safe, high-quality, and innovative pharmaceutical products.</p><h4>What are LIFE's strengths when competing with multinationals?</h4><p><strong>HE</strong> We are oriented to satisfy the needs of the local market. We have worked toward developing new formulations and products specifically tailored to solve issues pertaining to Ecuador and support the country, and our efforts have been very successful. We also consider the quality of our products and manufacturing facilities as a strategic capability. Furthermore, our products are more accessible cost-wise than the multinational variants, even as we maintain international standards of quality, safety and efficacy. The creativity of our team has been another strength. We have 350 employees, and around 130 of them have college and postgraduate education in a number of fields. Our group has been working with LIFE for many years.</p><h4>What have been Pfizer's key investments in Ecuador?</h4><p><strong>ADR</strong> Between 2006 and 2011, Pfizer invested more than $10 million in infrastructure, warehousing, and job creation, both directly and indirectly. At the moment, Pfizer Ecuador does not have a manufacturing plant, as we benefit from economies of scale at our other operations. Nevertheless, Ecuador has all the high standards required for the distribution and logistics network to achieve business success.</p><h4>What is your growth expectation for 2012?</h4><p><strong>HE</strong> LIFE has been investing in facilities, technology, and equipment. We will continue to be focused on the development of our people and new products. This is our strategy to remain competitive. Over the last three years, we have been revamping and remodeling some areas, as well as buying more equipment because we are committed for the long term. The percentage of people that demand good health services is still large. We hope that, as in the last 72 years, LIFE will continue to be the biggest Ecuadorean pharmaceutical company, and increase its market share.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the evolution of the real estate sector in Ecuador?<br></h4><p><strong>TOMMY SCHWARZKOPF </strong>The real estate sector has been very stable, and we haven't been affected by any crises. Now that the government is working to improve the credit lines, we believe that this stability will be maintained.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the government's policy to address the housing deficit and attract investments?</h4><p><strong>EDUARDO CRESPO</strong> President Correa will be remembered for his landmark housing policy. He has injected a large amount of funding into the construction business, and the benefits have been excellent. The local construction industry is based on hand labor, which boasts the largest employment multiplier effect but is the least-favored option. What the government has done concerning construction is spectacular; we have enjoyed incentives and bonuses to support the down payments our customers make. This funding has not been consistently strong due to a lack of liquidity, but the government has a clear vision to support construction. We have seen the construction of excellent roads that have improved transportation and shortened distances. We have also been thrilled to seen the government support housing and the labor force, as credits are being granted for longer periods of time. People now have solutions to credit history problems; creditors analyze an applicant's history for up to three years as opposed to the previous 10-year policy. People can now recover their credit faster and in a better way. This is part of the government's strategy to make it easier for potential homeowners.</p><h4>What was behind Uribe &amp; Schwarzkopf's innovative "housing express" idea?</h4><p><strong>TS</strong> The concept of vivienda express (housing express) reminds the public that it is very easy to purchase a house, and our company can both handle the customers' credit and complete the paperwork needed to make the transfers. We have agreements with several banks that qualify the client for a loan, and we have a credit team that rates clients and matches them with the right bank. Our firm has different products that suit every budget. The high demand from the middle class is a result of our system. Houses can be purchased with anywhere from $40,000 to $200,000, depending on the number of members in each family. In 2010, we sold more than 1,000 residences, and in 2011 we completed around 1,300.</p><h4>What makes FERROINMOBILIARIA's Ciudad Jardí­n project different from other real estate developments in Quito?</h4><p><strong>EC</strong> We are located next to the Metropolitan Park, which makes the project very attractive. It is the largest park in the city. We call our complex a "city" because it provides every service needed. A park is one of the most important things a city can have, and the project surrounds the park in the shape of a horseshoe. The complex also has a spectacular school with green areas and adequate climatization. As 85% of the Ecuadorean population is Catholic, we also included a church in our design plan. We are building a day hospital that will have 12 specialties and an operating room for emergencies. Furthermore, we are including a daycare center or preschool. Finally, we are building a shopping mall that could be the largest in Quito, hosting a variety of stores from car dealerships to supermarket chains. We will also have several recreational and leisure areas such as playing courts distributed across the complex. Residents will not have to leave Ciudad Jardí­n to visit the doctor or attend school. This translates into increased quality of life.</p><h4>What is your forecast for 2012, what can we expect to see from your company?</h4><p><strong>TS</strong> If growth stays the same it will be a great year. We have a number of interesting projects planned for 2012. The opening of a new airport will present a whole spectrum of new real estate and tourism opportunities. As long as the oil price continues to rise, Ecuador will register growth across the board.</p><p><strong>EC</strong> Our expectations are to increase our pace of construction to two houses per day, keep the quality standards in our houses high, and be recognized as a company that provides full services in the financing area as well as legal and administrative. To buy the "best house in the market," our customers only need to spend two hours in our offices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What competitive advantages of Sinohydro helped the company win the tender for the Coca Codo Sinclair Dam project?<br></h4><p><strong>CAI RUNGUO</strong> The Coca Codo Sinclair Dam is a very important project for Ecuador, because the country requires more energy to meet the demand of its population. Each year, the government is forced to import electricity from neighboring countries. However, Ecuador has very rich hydro resources, and the government has developed a plan to build hydro power stations and a program to exchange thermal energy for clean energy. For Sinohydro, this was a good opportunity; the company has its own technology and the support of the Export-Import Bank of China. These factors are very important; there are bountiful natural resources in Ecuador, but the country lacks financial capital. Ecuador needs the support of other countries. The Export-Import Bank of China had the initiative to invest in this project, and through this partnership, we have reached an agreement with the authorities, and were able to win the tender.</p><h4>How has Hidropaute's capacity evolved over the years?</h4><p><strong>JUAN LEONARDO ESPINOZA </strong>We are continuing to grow. In 2005, we started the Mazar project, a large dam with a 170-MW capacity. The project was finished in 2010, and brought our total capacity to 1,270 MW. We are also working on another project, called Paute Sopladora, with a capacity of 487 MW. It is currently under construction, and we have three more years to complete it. It is being built by a consortium, including a Chinese company, Gezhouba, and an Ecuadorean company, Fopeca. We expect that energy will begin to flow into the national grid by 2015. We have one more project, named Cardenillo. The final design studies will be complete by March 2013. This project has a capacity of around 500 MW, similar to Sopladora. With that, we will complete the "Paute-Integral" complex that includes four hydroelectric projects and more than 2,200 MW in total capacity.</p><h4>What is the status of the projects currently underway?</h4><p><strong>CR</strong> Work will be ongoing for 66 months, or five and a half years. We have already been building for nearly a year and a half, and we have four years to go. During the past year and a half, we have built roads, campsites, and a number of tunnels. When the tunnel-boring machine (TBM) arrives at its destination, the construction will reach the summit phase. We will be hiring more workers, and we hope that everything will continue as planned. Overall, we are determined to finish the project on time.</p><h4>What are your expectations in terms of increasing generation capacity?</h4><p><strong>JLE</strong> Cardenillo will be quite similar to Sopladora in terms of capacity—about 500 MW. However, Cardenillo will be part of the new age for the electricity sector in Ecuador. By that, I mean that all the projects we are building right now, until 2015 or 2016, are going to end the age of deficit in the sector. When these projects are built, we will begin exporting energy, which is the government's vision. So, from 2016, we will probably start building the second generation of projects, to export energy to our neighbors. Cardenillo is probably going to be built not only thinking of the demand inside Ecuador, but also how much of this energy we can export to Peru, Columbia, Brazil, or Chile. It is part of the new vision led by President Correa.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<subject><![CDATA[The Panama Hat]]></subject>
		<tags><![CDATA[]]></tags>
		<title><![CDATA[Or Is It?]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[or-is-it]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who designs hats for Ecua-Andino and what makes them special?<br></h4><p><strong>ALEJANDRO LECARO</strong> I never went to college or university, but I feel like I have a very special nose for business. When I travel to other countries, I know exactly which model could succeed in which market and honestly, I hate to copy. I look at fashion trends, and I like to improve my own models. In my workshops, I tell my weavers what I want. I'm not a weaver; I just have ideas for shapes. We were the first company to present colored, classic-shaped Panama hats. People said we were crazy. That was four years ago. A year after that, Borsalino also presented similar products, but we have a saying here in Ecuador: he who strikes first, strikes twice. Next year we will produce the first eco-Panama sandals. We will recycle some hats that don't have the quality to be exported and produce sandals. We will present them in Paris in June 2012.</p><h4>What is the source of Homero Ortega's success?</h4><p><strong>ALICIA ORTEGA</strong> Homero Ortega is a manufacturer of straw toquillas, or traditional Ecuadorean hats. This has contributed to the spread of the Panama hat and its positioning in the global context during the last five generations of our family—we are the oldest family in the trade. This is a clear sign of experience and reliability, as well as the quality of our products. Homero Ortega, the founder of the company, has been linked to the production of straw toquillas since childhood. Along with his father, he ventured on the El Cajas route to reach the port of Guayaquil, where they sold hats to the merchants who carried them to Panama. In 1972, Homero Ortega P. &amp; Hijos was established as a limited company, and our success lies in our ability to adapt our designs as a sublime form of popular expression. The Panama hat intertwines the manual dexterity, natural nobility, and cultural wealth of the Ecuadorean people.</p><h4>Where can consumers find Ecua-Andino's products?</h4><p><strong>AL</strong> We attend between 20 and 25 shows in places such as London, Copenhagen, New York, Paris, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Barcelona, and Madrid. We also attended a show this year in Moscow, and we will be there again in February 2013. I always like to achieve things that people don't believe I can. Five years ago people would have told me that Russia was impossible, but when we attended Moscow in August 2011, we went to a fair where 250 companies presented only Winter Collection hats, and there was only one booth of Panama Hats, and it was Ecua-Andino. Now we will be going in February, and the organizers of the show have asked us to do a catwalk of Panama hats. We have also been to Tel-Aviv, Johannesburg, and Dubai.</p><h4>How can the toquilla hat contribute to further promoting Ecuador abroad?</h4><p><strong>AO</strong> The toquilla hat is also known as the "Panama hat," and in this regard we have to keep in mind a historical fact; the construction of the Panama Canal created a great demand for the straw toquilla hat. Because of the qualities of its fiber—lightness and freshness—this garment became an essential element in the clothing of workers for protection from the grueling Caribbean sun. The hat was internationalized from Panama, and people started to call it the "Panama hat," even though its origin is Ecuador. That is something we always stress, and we believe that it is important to promote Ecuadorean culture and tradition through this colorful and unique piece of clothing.</p><h4>How much does the average Panama hat cost?</h4><p><strong>AL</strong> We have hats that go from $20 to $1,000. All of our hats are 100% handmade. The cost depends on the quality of the weaving. The most expensive hat takes 10 to 12 months to finish. We export around 200,000 a year, and sell 12,000 domestically.</p><h4>What is Homero Ortega's vision for the future?</h4><p><strong>AO</strong> In the next five years, we want to keep our leading position in the national toquilla industry by strengthening both the stability and innovation of the company, and providing high-quality products to the most demanding local, regional, and international markets. Innovation and tradition play a significant role in our business strategy, and I always stress the importance of intertwining them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of the mobile telephone sector in Ecuador in 2012?<br></h4><p><strong>JUAN F. GOULU</strong> The year 2012 will present great challenges and opportunities for telecommunications, one of the economy's most dynamic sectors. At Telefónica Ecuador we strive for our customers to rely on state-of-the-art technology and to become a milestone technical brand in favor of our users. We have, thus, pioneered the operation of the HSPA+ network to promote faster mobile connectivity in order to offer companies higher productivity possibilities based on ICT. The national use of the mobile network for voice communication has reached very high penetration levels; this year, the challenge is to increase the penetration of data use. Movistar is prepared for this and, offers the most competitive alternatives in the market.</p><h4>What effects has América Móvil made on the Ecuadorean market?</h4><p><strong>ALFREDO ESCOBAR</strong> Between 2000 and 2011, the mobile telephone penetration rate in Ecuador increased by 104% as a result of enormous investment from companies such as América Móvil and its brand, Claro. We have assigned more than $5 billion over the past five years to the development of telecoms in the country. We can proudly say that we have coverage from Yasuní­ in the east of the country, to Isabella Island in the Galápagos, which is the furthest point in the west. We have coverage that serves 96% of the population with both voice and data services, and in some areas we are the only service provider available because we have decided not to focus only on the big urban sectors, where there is obvious demand and profitability. Instead we have tried to reach towns with less than 2,000 people, who have sometimes been isolated.</p><h4>Which segments do you target in the country?</h4><p><strong>JFG</strong> At Telefónica-Movistar, we seek to offer tailored services for all segments because we believe that telecommunications is essential. It is important to offer solutions that respond to each individual need—sophisticated solutions for big accounts, plans and promotions that reduce prepayment access barriers, and easy payment terms for small and medium companies. To achieve this, we are based upon the group's synergies in 26 countries throughout the world and current investigation and development progress aimed to offer the best global solutions. This includes carrying out research to improve health services, reduce hospitalization costs with permanent mobile monitoring, establish tele-consultations to improve response times, and enable reaching increasingly large audiences. We also work on solutions to connect machines, which is the future of telecommunications. We support all mobile banking developments and are permanently seeking to remain the most state-of-the-art supplier in Ecuador.</p><p><strong>AE</strong> The internet is a great opportunity for every provider in the country. We are committed to introducing a new digital environment in Ecuador. The indices for internet penetration are low, at around 14%. Increasing this figure will be positive for business and for Ecuadorean society as a whole. The most feasible way to make that happen today is to take the first steps into the digital world through mobile phones. Cellphone coverage is nationwide, and smartphone makers are gaining space and lowering their prices, which allows more people to access the internet who didn't have access before or could only access it through traditional means, such as computers. It will thus be very helpful that public policies align with private policies in order to provide greater benefits to society. If smartphones and certain components are the basis for the growth of usage levels, they should be exempt from certain taxes that stop the growth of the adoption curve—at least in some segments. It's important to have a balance and stimulate the companies that develop non-traditional market segments like ours.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends have you observed in the sector in recent years?<br></h4><p><strong>NICOLÁS ESPINOSA </strong>Ecuador has experienced a very important social change in the last decade, and the industry has clearly benefited from that. In the last 10 years, we have seen an increase from 45,000-60,000 vehicles sold annually to 70,000-130,000. Today, Ecuadorean consumers plan for the medium term, because their purchasing power has increased. As an example, we can currently offer credit lines for five, six, and even seven years, when in 1998 such credit lines were available only for periods of up to 24 months. The Ecuadorean population has improved its economic position, and the income per capita is currently around $3,700, as compared to $1,500 a few years ago. The best example to illustrate this development is that the general managers of Ecuadorean companies used to know every client, whereas today there are far too many clients to keep track of. Acquiring a car has become one of the main priorities of the population, and it is a vital step for young people and couples as they start families. Today, there are over 2 million cars in Ecuador, a country of 14 million inhabitants, which means that there is a vehicle for every seven citizens. Ecuadorean consumers are beginning to prioritize price, quality, and services.</p><p><strong>FRANCISCO RESTREPO</strong> In Ecuador, the government's policies are aimed at injecting resources into the economy, which makes the country and the automotive sector more dynamic. Ecuador enjoys a surplus of around $2 billion thanks to oil production, and the country is receiving investments from China for infrastructure. Using this money in the market, the public sector was able to create 200,000 jobs that offer an average monthly salary of $1,000, which demonstrates the growth and dynamics in the economy. Owing to this phenomenon, consumption in Ecuador is very high, which has fueled the negative trade balance and monthly deficit of $500 million. In 2012, we will see a continuation of 2011, when a lot of companies and banks registered excellent results.</p><h4>How has Ayasa's position in the market evolved over the years?</h4><p><strong>NE</strong> Over the past few years, our company has experienced significant growth rates in the sale of both Nissan and Renault cars, two brands we officially represent in Ecuador. In addition, Ayasa is also the official representative of Pirelli, as well as fuel additives-maker Cyclo, which allows the company to enjoy constant growth and the commercialization of exclusive brands. Ayasa was established 49 years ago, and diversification has always played a key role in our business strategy. In this regard, Ayasa is planning to add Renault Trucks to its portfolio. This move will take place in 2012, and we expect to continue broadening our range of products and services, as the company faces the challenges of the market while maintaining a leading position. Due to the government's policy to address the trade balance situation—prioritizing exports and reducing imports—the year 2011 witnessed an agreement to reduce the overall number of imported cars by 10%. For 2012, we are still awaiting the government's analysis to set our expectations and assess the commercial year. Thus far, we have strictly complied with the government's policies, and we will continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, we are heavily focused on improving the quality of our after-sales services, where we see plenty of room for improvement. This segment will be crucial for us as we maintain our position in the market. Our strategy is to use our high-quality products and very attractive prices against the competition.</p><h4>What is Maresa's forecast for 2012?</h4><p><strong>FR</strong> We have been developing the assembly line since 2007, with an initial investment of $7 million and an additional $10 million in equipment. Maresa recognizes that the regulations for strengthening the country's production system will continue, and we are banking on this trend. In 2012, we will experience a transition in which we will work to complement the commercialization of new brands. We expect that in 2013, a number of new assembly projects will come on stream. Generally, a full year is needed before an assembly project is ready to start producing, owing to the time it takes for the appropriate tools to be installed and facilities to be prepared. We expect to consolidate a variety of assembly agreements in 2012, so that in 2013 we will be ready to begin manufacturing. Therefore, 2012 is a transition year because many of our planned assembly projects will be carried out. If the Japanese yen weakens and productive tax policies are reformed, the tax burden will not grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What attracted you to Dubai Internet City (DIC) as an office base?<br></h4><p><strong>EYAD SHIHABI</strong> DIC is a location that gave HP and many other technology companies good reason to establish here. The infrastructure that they created is very flexible, from the buildings to the facilities themselves. More important are the free zone capabilities and the facility that enables us to use a one-stop shop across the board. The legislative support and flexibility make it easy for us to recruit people, in terms of going through immigration and labor concerns. The authorities came up with a model that encouraged businesses to come here and be successful, by recognizing that our success would be their success. We have a joint partnership with DIC that supports us in country-specific programs. It not only made it easy for us to do business here but it works in partnership with us to benefit the whole community.</p><h4>Where do you see the key business opportunities in the industry?</h4><p><strong>ANDREW HURT</strong> There is a race to manage print services. It's a race because most printing within the next five or 10 years will be under some form of management. We are not just managing prints from Xerox machines; we're managing print across more of our competitors' machines as well. That's one area of opportunity. I think there's a big opportunity around environmental sustainability and we have a number of unique solutions in the area. We have a technology called "solid ink." Essentially, it doesn't use cartridges. The waste is set to be solid ink because a fraction is used by laser printers.</p><h4>In a market with an increasingly tech-savvy population, what initiatives do you undertake to keep up with growing expectations?</h4><p><strong>ES</strong> Many local companies have already upgraded their infrastructure and are at the level where they compete with mature companies. Where we are now providing further education is on how they can better utilize their investments to date—how companies can use private clouds in their environment, how service providers install public clouds and deliver a better service,  and how they can capitalize on the mass of information they have. For example, we have new audio technology that can be used by call centers, which allows us to record the tone of a caller's voice, so that a company can search for unhappy customers that called that day and the software will group them by recognizing the tone. We have video technology that allows you to censor footage more efficiently. So where we are focused is in bringing customers to the cloud and helping them to adopt technology more efficiently.</p><h4>Do you think that there's an appetite for green technology in the region?</h4><p><strong>AH</strong> Absolutely. When you're in a country that has one of the largest carbon footprints in the world, clearly there's a conscience that people have around how they, in their organizations, can reduce that carbon footprint. This is one of the technologies they can use. One of the things you do when you assess an organization is see how many devices they've got. What we have found in this part of the world is that there's a very high ratio between the number of devices and the number of employees.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coming year?</h4><p><strong>ES</strong> Our outlook is very positive. The industry has now adapted to the new way of doing business and companies are looking for new business models. We are predicting further investments in cloud computing and information optimization. People are starting to see the power of information and companies that are able to position themselves to offer capabilities are going to benefit. As a citizen and as a consumer, I see a lot of options, and we are going to see significant investments across the region to capitalize on the infrastructure that is in place here.</p><p><strong>AH</strong> Our head office is one of our focuses. We built the infrastructure and built right throughout the crisis. We built infrastructure for the next 20 or 30 years, and the whole philosophy was to provide infrastructure that was scalable, more productive and efficient, and allowed customers to do business with us in an easier way. This is a platform for growth that will be focused on services, service delivery, and after-sales service support for our technology business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the airline's milestones?<br></h4><p><strong>GHAITH AL GHAITH</strong> Since the government announced in March 2008 that it was to launch a low-cost carrier there have been a number of milestones. In June 2008, flydubai announced a historic order for 50 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft at the Farnborough Airshow. To date, we have received 21, with the rest due to be delivered before the end of 2016. Additionally, the aircraft we received in December 2011 was the 7,000th 737 Boeing has delivered, which was a very exciting time for us, and it features a special one-off livery. In terms of operations, June 1, 2009 was a historic day for flydubai, as the vision became reality when our first commercial flight took off to Beirut. In the first 12 months of operations we carried more than 750,000 passengers and expanded our operational route network to 16 destinations. To date, we now have more than 45 operational destinations spanning 28 countries across the GCC, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the Asian subcontinent, and Central and Eastern Europe. Another significant development includes taking a bold step to invest $20 million to bring all of our engineering and maintenance facilities in house in April 2011. This was then followed by the launch of flydubai Cargo on January  1, 2012, making the transportation of goods across the region via Dubai simple, accessible, and affordable.</p><p><strong>SHANE JEFFREE O'HARE</strong> Royal Jet is eight years old, and it was formed by Presidential Flight in Abu Dhabi. It is 50% owned by Presidential Flight and 50% by Abu Dhabi Aviation, which is a publicly listed, government-majority owned company. The operation is fully commercial, and has been profitable since the second year of its operation. Presidential Flight currently operates a number of businesses, including as a Fixed-Base Operator (FSB) and manages a VIP terminal operation at Abu Dhabi International Airport. It operates about 350 flights a month in addition to our own movements. It provides a very important service for VIP aircraft visiting the capital of Abu Dhabi. We operate an aircraft management business that handles private jet aircraft on behalf of our network of individual clients as well as corporate clients. We operate a brokerage business that brokers third-party charters for our clients when our own aircraft cannot service that particular business. We also have a medical evacuation service, which performs on average one mission every day, and we have 60 aircraft mainly used for those operations. This is a very special part of our business. The main part of our business is charter, and we have 11 aircraft in our fleet.</p><h4>What new markets are significant for you?</h4><p><strong>GG</strong> India is a very important market for flydubai. Not only is there a large number of Indian expatriates living in the UAE, the majority of whom visit their home nation regularly, but the UAE is also a popular tourist destination for Indians, and therefore there is a lot of traffic between our two countries. Moreover, flydubai is keen to increase its network in India, and we are working with the relevant authorities to make this happen. Elsewhere, in 2012, we have launched operations to four new cities, Baghdad and Najaf in Iraq, Taif in Saudi Arabia, and the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, Bishkek, and there will be more to come. Bishkek was the 50th destination we started flights to, which is an excellent achievement for us, having launched operations less than three years ago. We have marked many milestones and are delighted to have reached this point.</p><p><strong>SO</strong> We recently opened a hub in Saudi Arabia, which is a larger market than the UAE. We are also generating more business these days in Oman, Kuwait, and Jordan, and in Europe as well. We have set up special relationships in some of these markets, where we are building our market share. Our strategic plan is growth in the Gulf and Middle East region because that is where our main hubs are. There will be significant growth in this area for the foreseeable future. We are seeing now that the UAE growth is starting to bounce back after the global recession, and Abu Dhabi will see around 3% growth in 2012. The current market conditions are very buoyant for us. The Middle East is going to remain very important. We also are seeing the reconstruction of Iraq with many corporations now going into that country to assist with its redevelopment. That is generating a much higher level of growth than we were expecting. Afghanistan is something that is also on our radar, and it is a country to which we fly regularly. If some of the countries settle down over the next 12 months, we will see more stability coming into the growth curve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the core focus of your company's activity in Dubai?<br></h4><p><strong>HUSSEIN WEHBE</strong> Dubai is considered one of the major operations for us. We don't really focus on one certain product but aim to be a one-stop shop, so we focus on a variety of services and solutions for our clients. In addition to the services that we have, we always have the ability to tailor make new services and solutions that will cater to the requirements of our clients. We are now listening to our clients more and more and we never say no. The company takes the client's requirements, studies them, and builds a new service based on that requirement. It can be a spark for a new product that we can introduce to the market, and that all falls under the flexibility that Aramex has at its core. This is what differentiates us from our competitors.</p><p><strong>DAVID ROSS</strong> Since we started here in 1989, international express products have been our key focus area in Dubai and the UAE in general. Our work here is progressing with the introduction of our own direct service aircraft to this market. We now have services to Dubai direct from our Memphis hub, which we started in April 2011 using a brand new Boeing 777F. This aircraft handles everything coming in from North America. We also have a direct link from our hub in China, which connects our Asian business, and then we have flights into Europe via our hub in Paris, and from here into Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore in India. We are very well covered, with 33 flights a week out of Dubai using our own aircraft and another 48 smaller feeder flights that we operate from here to places like Kuwait, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia, as well as commercial lines into the African continent. Dubai is in an excellent location geographically and strategically.</p><h4>From what sectors are you seeing increased demand?</h4><p><strong>HW</strong> Being a total transportations and logistics solutions company, we've seen a lot of demand for most of our services and products. We serve the banking sector, the trading sector, and the industrial sector, and each one requires different services. For example, the banking sector in the UAE focuses more on domestic distribution and credit card deliveries, while the industrial sector focuses more on airfreight import or perhaps land freight distribution around the region. There is demand for all of our services, plus we've also seen great demand for B2C services, such as e-commerce for example. E-commerce has been growing recently in massive numbers. We've seen a lot of requests from SMEs. They've been approaching us to offer them e-commerce solutions. Clients are becoming more demanding. We have a great product called "Shop and Ship." It is an amazing product that targets online shoppers that really offers a total online shopping solution from the US, the UK, and recently from China.</p><p><strong>DR</strong> Naturally, the oil and gas sector makes up a large percentage of our client base. The automotive industry is another major market—you only have to drive down Sheikh Zayed Road to see all of the car showrooms, which make up a large sector of the economy. In electronics, parts are brought in to be modified and then need to be reshipped. Those three sectors are very strong, and they cover pretty much the whole Middle East from here—this is the hub for products from GCC states, especially. Beyond the GCC, Dubai's reach stretches to India and Africa. What is interesting is how successful Dubai has been at diversifying the economy. There are only a very few places like this in the world, such as Singapore.</p><h4>Do you believe that there are any issues that need to be resolved to improve the efficiency of freight transport in Dubai?</h4><p><strong>HW</strong> We get full support from the government of Dubai and governmental institutions such as UAE Customs, which facilitates transactions well. Their support has always been our backbone, so the more support we get from them, the more we can grow. We have excellent relations with them, and they are a part of the reason for our success.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012?</h4><p><strong>DR</strong> There are still great opportunities for investors entering the market here, for both SMEs and large businesses. We will continue to see growth in many areas, and our outlook is very positive. We are always improving our service. That is what keeps our customers competitive in their own markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the factors that have led to the success of your company over its history?<br></h4><p><strong>MOHAMMED K. AL HABTOOR </strong>I think the success of the group is a product of the leadership of the Chairman, my father. When he established the company in 1970, he had no capital—my father borrowed funds to start construction and worked 24 hours a day to arrive at this level. Today, our group is considered one of the largest in the region. The group has survived the initial construction projects and branched out into different business sectors, such as automotive, real estate, hospitality, insurance, and education. Although my father has been operating the company for over 40 years, he still spends all day at the office. He does not believe in relaxation, even now that the company has reached a very comfortable level. Therefore, I believe his time and effort have created the successful company you see today. We are mainly focused on the hospitality, real estate, and automobile segments, which are generally car agencies. The company is also expanding car sales in the UAE; we are seeking new opportunities and agencies throughout the region. Although this activity is in the initial stages, we are working hard. Al Habtoor Group has the right management and marketing team, and it is considered one of the best in the world in terms of selling Mitsubishi products. The hotel and hospitality segment is also performing very well, despite numerous crises over the last 20 years, from the first and second Gulf Wars to the conflict in Afghanistan. Despite the economic crisis, our hotels were operating at very good occupancy levels and a reasonable average rate. Our hotels are better than those in Paris or London; they offer better services and amenities. We still aim to attract the maximum number of tourists, and prices have dropped. This phenomenon is not optimal for us, but it does attract more people. In the next few years we expect to bring these rates back to pre-crisis figures.</p><p><strong>SANJAY MANCHANDA</strong> We were given a defined business plan and were tasked with the objective to implement it. I'm proud to say that two years down the line that we are very much staying on-plan and continue to focus on delivering it. At the same time, as a developer, we have not lost sight of our activity. We have started to look at projects that will enhance our existing communities and other projects that are demand driven. For example, we are significantly expanding our hugely successful Dragon Mart Mall and are very enthusiastic about the fact that a lot of people have shown a keen interest: 80% of the expansion is already leased. Similarly, a number of projects have been launched on Palm Jumeirah, including Palm Views, Palm Residences, and The Pointe, with a healthy response from investors. From our perspective, for the people and the investors to place their trust in us is another sign of significant confidence in our company. We may have had some hiccups, but we have overcome them. We are launching what we believe to be products that people want. We want to fulfill our communities' needs by enhancing and developing them into mature communities—places to live and belong.</p><h4>In Dubai, what were the lessons learned from the economic crisis?</h4><p><strong>MH</strong> We are 80% recovered from the crisis. The remaining 20% will bring us back to a level comparable to 2007 and 2008. Considering all of our businesses, trading is excellent, and the margins are even better than before. The number of car units we sell and luxury brands we offer such as McLaren, Bugatti, and Bentley positions us at number one or two in the market. People continue to purchase from us, and we sold 30% to 40% more Bentleys and Bugattis this year; we are selling every car we receive. In Mitsubishi sales, we are performing better than before. In our schools, we have longer waiting lists. The hotels are full, and construction is busy.</p><h4>What kind of trends have you seen in terms of the demographics of investors?</h4><p><strong>SM</strong> Our buyers have has always been a mixed set of investors. Nakheel is currently developing and delivering what we have been contracted to do. If we have different people from different nationalities and different places having had contracted with us, we are now fulfilling our obligation to give them their houses and apartments.  In our newer developments, we see a lot of interest from Malaysian investors and from Southeast Asian economies, because of the proximity to Dubai and because the Emirate has shown its resilience in difficult times. The Arab Spring has helped us because people are looking for a safe haven, and Dubai continues to live up to its reputation of being just that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you categorize the property market in the UAE when compared to other markets in the region?<br></h4><p><strong>STEVEN J. MORGAN</strong> It is very different from any other market and has been very interesting to watch. The market was fuelled by a 10-year property binge, coupled with huge confidence in the Dubai government. Clearly, supply severely outweighed demand—and even that sparked a boom. Everybody expected to see a correction at some stage, but it came much faster than we had imagined. Although there is oversupply in most sectors, and the downturn has driven property prices down 50% in some cases, we are starting to see slow price increases. For example, the Dubai Marina is almost finished, as well as the Meadows and Springs Community, Arabian Ranches, and the Palm Jumeirah. In the completed projects where residents can live the lifestyle that the development was designed to provide, we see slow price increases in both rentals and sales. I think that it is fair to say that some of the oversupply is sourced from projects that are not as finished. You can't build a master plan for development off the back of one tower.</p><p><strong>ALAN ROBERTSON</strong> Retail is a very interesting and exciting sector. What we have seen here in Dubai, and I believe we will see it in Abu Dhabi, is its tremendous popularity with global brands. Global brands like to be in places like New York, London, Paris and Dubai. Whether it is a Western European, North American, or Asian brand, Dubai is a pretty cool place to have a presence. In that regard, there is very good retail demand. That is continuing, especially as North American and Western European retailers have to look outside their traditional markets for growth because these markets are either over supplied or are not growing due to the poor economic conditions. Brands such as Zara from Spain and Waitrose from the UK are coming to Dubai, and we see that trend continuing. The other trend in Dubai is that over the last 12 months there has been a divergence of performance within each sector, and it is quite noticeable in retail. As the UAE has come out of its economic downturn, the best retail centers have been doing very well, whereas poorer quality schemes have struggled to maintain footfall and are having to consider how to reposition themselves.</p><h4>How have you adjusted your business strategy over the past couple of years to deal with the challenging local environment within the real estate sector?</h4><p><strong>SM</strong> Our business was interesting, because we are mainly focused on the advisory segment of real estate. About 70% of our turnover is from consulting; we are advising our customers on the way back up, in terms of banks that are lending, valuation work, development appraisals, and feasibility studies. We were actually quite cautious and conservative throughout the boom years, and we received a fair amount of criticism in response to this strategy. We were advising banks not to lend 95% loan-to-value, and instead suggesting that the market would correct itself one day. That served us well after the downturn, because people thought back 12 months to our meetings and reports, realizing that they should not have lent 95%. This credibility put us in a good position to tackle and survive the dark days of 2009-2010.</p><p><strong>AR</strong> It has been a difficult period but every cloud has a silver lining and, in our case, we have found that our market share has increased very significantly. Instead of having a small piece of a large cake, we have had a large piece of a smaller cake. We attribute that to a flight to quality, which always comes in difficult times. As a result, the high-quality firms have done well, and the poorer quality ones have found life very difficult, and many have disappeared. That has been a noticeable trend here. The other thing we have done over the last two or three years has been to broaden the base of our business. We are now offering services in the Middle East that we did not previously, such as project management and property management, which are very important parts of the Jones Lang LaSalle business across the world. We did not start delivering these services here until about 18 month ago, and it has proved to be a very good decision. Our business is now broader based and more resilient because we are not so reliant on a small number of service lines. For example, when we acquire an office for a corporate client such as Shell, in other parts of the world we normally also project manage the office fit-out for them, but previously we were not able to do that locally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of your presence in the region and the significance of Dubai in terms of your regional operations?<br></h4><p><strong>WACLAW LUKOWICZ</strong> Siemens has been present in Dubai for over 40 years. Our presence here is geared toward providing better healthcare services to the local population, and this is in line with Siemens Healthcare's strategy. We have been here for a long time, and have a strong commitment to the region. Dubai is an important market for us, as it is a regional hub and serves as our regional headquarters, enabling us to provide a broad range of healthcare solutions catering to the needs of the neighboring countries, including offerings for the high- to low-end markets.</p><p><strong>DR MICHAEL HEUER</strong> We have been active in the Middle East for many years. Via our partners and distributors, we take care of distribution, customer support, and logistics across the region. The organization that supports these distributors across the world is located in Mannheim, and the marketing support, service support, trainers, and applications are directed from there. The extremely good experience we have had with the development of our business in the Middle East region led us in 2011 to change the setup of how we distribute our products here, and how we can become a company that is closer to its distribution partners and customers in the region. We have therefore decided to open an office and management center in Dubai. This center will take over marketing responsibilities, service, support, training, logistics, and quality management, as well as all other necessary activities to be closer to our customers in the region.</p><h4>What major trends have you seen in terms of demand for your projects and services?</h4><p><strong>WL</strong> We cater to a very diverse market in the region, ranging from very developed markets in various parts of the Middle East, where residents have access to the best and latest in medical technology, to less developed markets such as in South Asia which include countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the doctor to population ratio still needs to be determined. In places such as Dubai, which is at the forefront of technological advancements, we see a growing need for increasing accessibility to healthcare, improving coverage, and disease prevention. A young population still exists, and the developed world topics which many European countries and Japan are facing have yet to surface. However, there are specific diseases, such as diabetes, which are more prevalent. Siemens is driving the trend for prevention, and we aim to focus on early detection.</p><p><strong>MH</strong> The strongest demand is for fully automatic central clinical laboratories. What many are looking for are platforms that cover the broadest possible parameter spectrum, in order to consolidate the workload of many different instruments into one central laboratory. We are very pleased with the outcome. We also see that the medical and healthcare systems in hospitals are becoming increasingly interested in adopting point-of-care solutions in order to be closer to their patients.</p><h4>How has the geopolitical situation in the area affected your operations?</h4><p><strong>WL</strong> We have seen a degree of instability in the political situation. However, the UAE has enjoyed clear, absolute stability. I'm very proud of our team because they have continued to service the equipment located in tumultuous areas, demonstrating how being locally-based benefits our customers. Throughout the revolution in Egypt, our teams have worked to support medical facilities. Basic service is needed for the equipment, and if we are to achieve excellence and patient focus, we had to continue our operations. There has been a small amount of hesitance in the private sector, but growth has still been possible.</p><h4>How large will your new base in Jebel Ali be?</h4><p><strong>MH</strong> By 2013 we will have approximately 50 people working in different areas: marketing, marketing support, quality management, safety, training, technical services, IT, and finance. We believe that this is just the beginning because the potential here is great, and customers expect their suppliers to offer them the latest products. There is no compromise here on quality. There are no differences between what we offer in the Middle East and what we offer in the US, Japan, and Western Europe. Customers want to build their own solutions now. The customer indicates his improvement needs, and we discuss together the specifications of the new clinical laboratory, and we build it, first as a concept, then in reality. We call it "Dreamlab." In Abu Dhabi we are currently building one of the largest highly-automated laboratories in the whole region. It is a top-of-the-line laboratory that can be showcased globally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Dubai College?<br></h4><p><strong>PETER HILL</strong> Dubai College was set up by the late Sheikh Rashid Bin Said Al Maktoum, who was the ruler of Dubai. We started in a pair of villas in 1978. We were then gifted this land in an area that was nothing but desert. We started building around 1980 and occupied the first two buildings of the school in 1982. Since then we have developed the school slowly by extending it almost every year. We now have a very comprehensive school with resources probably as good as any other top school in the world. We are a non-profit school, and any surplus that we have at the end of year goes straight back into the school for development and curriculum works. We charge fees that have to be approved by the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA). We have followed a refined and reformed version of the English national curriculum at Key Stage 3 (KS3). In terms of the selection, we have approximately 450 applicants for 132 places in Year 7. Our GCSE results place us in 35th position in terms of all the schools in the UK. In terms of our A-level results we come in around 60th. We are a very high-performing school and are a member of the Head Masters Conference (HMC) for schools in the UK. We also place great importance on co-curricular programs, especially in sports, drama, and music, which we think are very important educationally. Approximately 65% of the student population is British, but we also have 40 other nationalities represented.</p><h4>What do you think makes Dubai's education sector so attractive?</h4><p><strong>FIONA COTTAM</strong> It is the diversity of the population. Such a large percentage of the population is not native, so we are mostly visitors. Yet, people are trying to create their own sense of cultural identity within this community. For the British community, for example, there are a lot of British curriculum schools. It is the same for the Indian community and the American  community. I think it helps for each of us to establish our bases and provide the expertise that we need. This is a unique melting pot of different cultures.</p><h4>According to a recent report by Booz &amp; Co, the private school sector in the Gulf is predicted to grow three fold over the next decade. What do you think the potential for growth is in Dubai?</h4><p><strong>PH</strong> In terms of a market for primary schools, there is, in supply and demand terms, a huge market. What the profit-making schools are concerned about at the moment is that they have limited incentive to establish new schools because of the fee freeze. However, one way around that is when establishing a new school you are not affected by the fee freeze. You can set your own starting fee, within reason, and then you can go on from there. The interesting thing is that there are more franchising schools coming out to the region. We already have Repton School, which is now an established successful school in Dubai. Brighton College also just opened in Abu Dhabi. However, what is interesting at the moment is that they seem to be moving down the road to Abu Dhabi rather than to Dubai. They find the ability to expand in terms of facilitates very much restricted here. As a non-profit school, we rely purely on an annual fee.</p><p>We have a five-year development plan that is not presently being driven by building infrastructure. It is being driven in terms of learning. We just don't have the money to develop any further at the moment—until we are allowed to develop in terms of market forces, we can't go anywhere. The supply and demand is there, but it is not a free market in that way and with our fees.</p><p>One never really knows what inflation is in the UAE; it always seems to be very low, but all I know is that ever since we have had a freeze on our fees, costs have been going up around us, such as for food, maintenance, and energy.</p><p><strong>FC</strong> There are over a 100 private schools in Dubai. We have seen the growth directly as a company, as we opened a brand new school in September 2011. Six months ago, it did not have any students enrolled. The day that it opened it had nearly 1,200. That shows both the desire from parents for high-quality education and also the very transient nature of Dubai. It is developing, from our perspective, as a hub where many families base their children while one part of the partnership perhaps works elsewhere. That is driven not just by transportation systems, but also its closeness in terms of the Far East and yet its proximity to Europe at that halfway point. You can see why it has got the potential to grow even further when you look at how much it has grown in the last five to 10 years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was Dubai chosen as a location for your business school?<br></h4><p><strong>NICHOLAS VAN DER WALT</strong> There are several reasons why we chose Dubai, but the principle reason is that we have selected areas, which are considered major innovation or trade hubs. For example, we opened a campus in San Francisco, which is both an innovation and trade hub. Next, our London campus is based in the world's financial center, as well as, the trade hub of the future. Shanghai is similar to Dubai, in that it has consistently performed as a powerful economy in its region. We seek locations such as Dubai, which enjoys a stable and efficient government with a business-friendly environment and is a key hub in the Middle East. We also looked at the economic performance of other countries in the region, but we felt comfortable with what we were offered in Dubai.</p><p><strong>E</strong><strong>HSAN RAZAVIZADEH</strong> This decision to set up in the MENA region and Dubai in particular was influenced by various personal, cultural, and institutional factors. First of all, we live in a culture in which most of our parents usually push us to become a doctor, engineer, or lawyer. This is our fantasy. When I was studying at Cass, I realized that it was in a very unique position because it has very good links with the City of London. In fact, the Lord Mayor of London is the Chancellor of City University London, of which Cass is a part. There was a constant interaction between the real world finance and banking sectors and the student experience. This is something that was not really happening in this part of the world. I personally thought that we needed something like Cass for the region and for Dubai in particular.</p><h4>How is your faculty formed?</h4><p><strong>NVDW</strong> We have a faculty based in Dubai, but some faculty members will rotate to teach in Boston, London, San Francisco, and Shanghai. We also invite other professors from around the globe to teach  particular courses. For example, we have a top, prize-winning professor from Harvard University that flies to Dubai to teach a course three times a week. Her focus is on consultancy work, including advising several governments in Eastern Europe on their financial structure. This professor is a practitioner, researcher, and consultant at the leading edge of her field, and our students benefit tremendously from this opportunity. We also have a professor who led innovation practice at Motorola, and we have several other professors who are working for the world's top consulting firms. Many professors are interested in teaching at Hult. Many of our past faculty members also decide to come back and teach. Others have set their careers up for a traditional university structure, but have done work in an industry environment and enjoy classroom engagement. The classroom offers a network, potential friendships for life, and the satisfaction of learning and teaching. Professors feel that they are giving back to both their own generation and the next, when students will fulfill their aspirations.</p><p><strong>ER</strong> All of our faculty members teach at Cass in London and fly in to Dubai to meet and teach the students. Most faculty members work across teaching, research, and consultancy. As a result, they are constantly working in industry, gaining real world experience, and bringing this to their teaching. The degree that we give out here is as if you had studied in London with the same program, curriculum, and faculty.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook?</h4><p><strong>NVDW</strong> I think there will be growth through very hard work in the sector; we will implement good marketing strategies and build effective industry relationships. Our challenge is to attract the best faculty that feels at home in both the classroom and the boardroom. We want people who can walk out of the classroom and into the boardroom, maintaining respect in every area of life. This is the primary challenge for us; finding people with PhDs and advanced degrees who are top teachers with very strong industry experience. We take our professors very seriously.</p><p><strong>ER</strong> We are very committed. We have already invested and developed an MBA, which is 100% deliverable in Dubai. This means if you cannot leave your job or family due to cultural reasons or timing, then the Cass EMBA is the right choice for you.  We will continue recruiting high profile students for both our EMBA and MSc programs, and we will be expanding our Executive Education and consulting business according to the region's future demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In the year 2011, total free zone exports were valued at nearly AED172 billion, with an average increase of 24% annually over the last three years. The share of free zone exports and re-exports over Dubai's total exports have consistently averaged around 40% over the last three years since 2009. A difference in the profile between Dubai's direct exports and free zone exports, however, shows that from Dubai the major total exports are gold, jewelry, and precious metals, and for the free zones the top exports, including re-exports, are of machinery, and electronic equipment.</p><h4>How do your foster homegrown talent and encourage young entrepreneurs?</h4><p><strong>ABDUL BASET AL JANAHI</strong> Dubai's story began with SMEs, and it continues on the same path. There is a young population, and I believe that because the city is growing with more sophisticated systems, processes, and support mechanisms, the sector is also set to grow. Previously, it was a "one-size-fits-all" situation in terms of the environment, laws, and regulations, but today these categories have been separated. What is good for a large company may not necessarily work for a small company. To mitigate this issue, we work with the federal and local government to help realign the environment and make it friendlier to SMEs. For the completion of the economic cycle, we help start-ups launch their operations, encourage and network SMEs, and then channel them to the government as they expand. For instance, if they are ready to begin exporting, then this is where the government comes in. Dubai FDI seeks to attract specific foreign investments or request that smaller companies join larger partners.</p><h4>What are the current export levels like with Dubai's key trading partners?</h4><p><strong>SA</strong> In 2011 our total exports were approximately AED431 billion. In 2010, out of total exports, approximately AED355 billion, nearly 40% of direct exports, were to India and 20% to Switzerland, followed closely by Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq, while top re-export partners were India (36%), Iran (17%), Iraq (5%), and Afghanistan. Let us not forget that we are exporting extremely high value gold and jewelry items to India and Switzerland, which accounts for the high percentages. Overall, due to regional proximities and traditional business relationships, we do not see a major shift in our top exporting countries. However, as mentioned earlier, with our thrust toward encouraging companies to export to new markets like Europe, Africa, and the CIS, we hope to see an increase in the share of exports to these countries in the near future.</p><h4>Is there an active entrepreneurial spirit in the local young population?</h4><p><strong>ABJ</strong> The new generation is very enthusiastic. We see many of them, but other young professionals make it on their own. When they need us, they come. We have supported more than 11,000 Emiratis start companies, and we are still in contact with many of them. We help them get access to government contracts, and we have attained close to AED1.2 billion worth of government contracts for them.</p><h4>Which markets are you seeing particular growth in with regard to demand for Dubai's products? What products are fuelling this demand?</h4><p><strong>SA</strong> Apart, from our traditional markets of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, we are seeing potential for good growth in the African and CIS countries for our products. We are fortunate that many among the basket of products from Dubai, are in demand or potentially high growth items in the varied markets as mentioned above. For example, in Tunisia, Congo, Tanzania, South Africa, and most African countries, machinery, electronic, and electrical equipment as well as articles of plastics are in demand. In Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and other CIS countries, apart from the above products, there is fair demand for glass products and base metals. Let us not forget our traditional markets of surrounding countries in the Middle East and Indian sub continent region, where we have a wide range and high volume of processed food and beverages being exported.</p><h4>How do you help start-ups access financing options?</h4><p><strong>ABJ</strong> For start-ups, we finance through a network of banks. For existing businesses, we also work with the banking sector. We come up with initiatives and programs to encourage the banking sector to closely examine how to create a better financing scheme for SMEs. We work to bridge the gap between SMEs and the banking sector. Dubai SME evaluates the activity in the field case by case, and this is one of the factors that helps make banks more aware of the service sector. Today, the service sector is under-supported due to collateral issues. However, we are showing the banks that they are missing an opportunity through providing examples of successful partnerships and the potential of financing these smaller companies.</p><h4>Dubai was hit significantly by the global recession. What lessons were learned from the crisis in this region? To what extent would you say the market is showing signs of recovery?</h4><p><strong>SA</strong> The UAE works closely with many countries both regionally and globally. We are fortunate to have close business ties with the West as well as the East. When the global recession hit, the UAE was one of the last countries to feel the impact due to certain solid fundamentals. During the boom years, having consolidated our traditional sectors of trade and tourism, we naturally sought to diversify into other areas given the interest of global investors. We are proud of our achievements in the real estate sector and nowhere in the world will you be able to see architectural wonders built within such a short period of time as in the UAE. Having said that and with the impact of the recession, along with global market sentiment, since investors decided to be conservative suddenly, we too had to scale back the pace of our diversification, especially into real estate. We used this period between 2008 and now to further strengthen our position as the trade and tourist hub of the Middle East, while also reviewing and restructuring areas for possible improvement in other sectors. We still dream, but also act on our dreams to achieve what few countries have been able to. Market recovery in as much as trade is concerned is evident in the trade figures of Dubai since 2009. In the last three years, our imports rose from AED471 billion to AED658 billion and our total exports increased from AED282 billion to nearly AED431 billion. Year-on-year growth of imports touched 18%, while average year-on-year growth of total exports was nearly 23%. Under the current global economic scenario, we are encouraged by this but we will work harder—the sky is our limit. We are especially appreciative of Dubai's businesses and exporters who continue to show faith in Dubai and the UAE and continue to grow with us.</p><h4>How did the global liquidity crisis impact the SME market?</h4><p><strong>ABJ</strong> SMEs comprise a very unique sector, especially in Dubai. Through our study, we have discovered that SMEs complain about financing, but the majority of them do not need it in this tax-free environment. Most of their profits are either re-injected into the company or channeled to other SMEs in difficult times. We have seen an increase in SMEs and barely noticeable closures. Although new buildings are no longer being built, SMEs have continued their operations because they are flexible and agile. Access to finance is a bit difficult globally, but there are ways. I believe that we have seen important improvements in the market over the past two years. I did not see huge closures, even during the crisis. There is huge interest because of the stability and infrastructure of Dubai. For any business, whether a franchise or a newcomer to the region, we usually emphasize the benefits of starting in Dubai because a strategy that works here can be replicated in the wider region. This is the place to start or launch your product and expose your brand. Dubai SME sees many businesses starting here and we have witnessed their increasing excitement. The excellent infrastructure is beyond compare in the region.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012?</h4><p><strong>SA</strong> The outlook for 2012 is still bright, notwithstanding economic troubles in much of the Western world, which we are confident will be addressed suitably. Our traditional strengths lie in our trade and relations with our neighboring countries, especially the Greater Arab Free Trade Area, which was formed following the adoption of the Agreement to Facilitate and Develop Trade Among Arab Countries. We are looking to significantly increase our efforts to build and enhance our trade relations with these countries. Also, we are encouraging SMEs, many of which produce only for local consumption, to now export regionally with the support of our various export development and promotion initiatives and programs.</p><p>ABJ I believe that the new "Green Economy" initiative launched by His Highness is part of the future. This is an opportunity for new businesses, and I expect entrepreneurs to seize this opportunity to acquire or start companies that utilize sustainable energy and the green economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How viable is Dubai as a regional retail banking center for excellence?<br></h4><p><strong>FARHAD D. IRANI</strong> We have a fair amount of confidence in Dubai's future as a financial and commercial hub. Mashreq has operations outside the UAE as well, and my team and I also look after our operations in Egypt and Qatar. We are slowly looking at our regional operations in India as well—we have offices all over the world on the institutional side, but on the retail side this is what we have. Dubai seems to be a natural center of economic activity and growth for the future. It has become an island of prosperity. It has become the place that is the benchmark for all of the nations and communities to aspire to. I think that with the establishment of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and the creation of all of the investments and promotion is a reflection of a very forward-looking government. And coupled that with rule of law, safety, and security, and that it is a great place to live in terms of comfort, I think you get the picture. There are very few places in the world that reflect this kind of stability. Look at Singapore, for example. In the 1980s and 1990s Singapore grew as a consequence of unrest and uneasiness within its region surrounding. Around 35% of all Singapore banking assets are Indonesian owned, 40% of all property is Malaysian owned, and the Chinese have a major presence as well. It is the island of prosperity and stability in the region. Dubai runs a parallel path as well. Both of these markets and countries have benefitted from leadership that is forward looking and business oriented, and I think the results are here for us to see.</p><p><strong>HUSSAIN AL QEMZI</strong> Dubai is already a logistical international hub with a huge port facility. This is a city that can clear 1,200 containers per hour. We supply and re-export to many nations around us, from companies on our border to East Africa. For example, Somalia has been relying on Dubai for years, and all of its shipments and goods have been coming from Dubai. We also reach Turkmenistan, the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and North Africa. This is an international hub that seeks to consolidate its services. The vision we have is to create a financial presence outside of the Emirate, but that has yet to happen. However, we have done a lot of business in Turkey. Although Noor Islamic Bank is predominantly a corporate, wholesale bank, our activities are determined by our banking partners. We work very closely with Turkish bankers and our relationship allows us to operate together. We have now completed transactions totaling over $2 billion in 18 months; we are raising funds for Turkish financial institutions, and we have many possibilities in the pipeline. This is what we have envisioned, and we aim to duplicate this activity in Southeast Asia or North Africa. This is where we see a lot of interest and potential to grow.</p><h4>How was your bank affected by the global economic crisis?</h4><p><strong>FI</strong> We had to change mindsets in the organization, and remember that in the aftermath of the economic crisis, you can forgive a financial institution for being a little more conservative than otherwise. So we discovered that we had multiple checks with customers, multiple call-backs, and multiple form-filling endeavors. We eliminated 422 processes in six months. Records that were redundant, we just took out. We created a concept called first point resolution (FPR). My target FPR is 85%. The front-end service person getting a complaint from a customer should be able to resolve it there and then 85% of the time.</p><h4>Is there a misconception that Islamic banks are heavily exposed to real estate investments and not as reliable as their conventional counterparts?</h4><p><strong>HQ</strong> I do think these misconceptions exist to a certain degree. Historically, Islamic banks have always looked at asset-based finance, and this is how the model started in the beginning. However, the model of Islamic banks has devolved significantly, and today there are many products that meet almost every need. There is plenty of room for creativity, and the consumer side has already established clear products. The wholesale side of banking still needs improvement, and every transaction involves innovation. Some of our experiences deal with a number of large companies. We sought opportunities to prove that we do not simply want to manage property finances, and we have been able to create a very good structure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After some turbulent trading, are you hopeful that there will be some more interest from companies in floating their shares?<br></h4><p><strong>ESSA KAZIM</strong> Naturally, the primary market is highly correlated to the secondary market, and as we all know the stock markets have been going through unfavorable conditions due to the repercussions of the global economic crisis. Consequently, IPOs have been in a period of slowdown over the last three years. However, we have been engaged in continuous discussions with potential issuers, and we can see an enormous backlog that will flow into the market once conditions are more favorable and business owners realize the possibility to have attractive valuations. According to an independent survey commissioned by the DFM, the majority of respondents from private and family businesses were interested in going public over the next two to three years as they acknowledge the importance of tapping into capital markets to fund their expansion plans and sustain growth. Undoubtedly, taking a private company into the public arena is an essential step in the preparation to meet challenges by embracing international best practices in the company's management, corporate governance, and investor relations.</p><h4>UAE shares are still depressed compared to the boom years that ended in 2008. Will prices return to those levels?</h4><p><strong>JEFF SINGER</strong> Prices reached unrealistically high levels in that period. Much of the foreign money that flowed into the UAE was hoping to take advantage of a revaluation of the dirham against the dollar, which never took place. Many investors were also too optimistic about Dubai's short-term economic prospects. The Emirate's fundamental strengths as a hub for business, finance and trade are not in doubt; unfortunately these investors confused the positive long-term trend with a likelihood of quick profits being always available on the stock market. The environment in Dubai, as in the world as a whole, has changed. I don't believe those high prices are coming back in the near future. I am pleased to say that most of the companies that NASDAQ Dubai is talking to about carrying out an IPO in future are fully aware of that. They are looking forward, not back, and they realize that going public with a realistic valuation is still a very attractive option for them, compared to other ways of raising capital.</p><h4>What new instruments and platforms are being developed to drive the evolution of Dubai's stock exchange?</h4><p><strong>EK</strong> The DFM spares no effort and takes numerous initiatives to lay out the necessary framework for various market enhancements. As part of these efforts we have shifted to a delivery versus payment (DVP) model to embrace international best practices and we have successfully consolidated with NASDAQ Dubai, creating a larger and unified liquidity pool and diversified asset classes through the trading of NASDAQ Dubai securities on the DFM platform. Recently, this drive was reinforced through the trading of Dubai Gold Securities via our platform as well. As for developments in the near future, we are now in the process of introducing new market enhancements including short selling, securities borrowing and lending, and market making. We are confident that these widely recognized developments over the last two years have set the market on the right track for sustainable growth.</p><h4>You have called for a radical revamp of the UAE's capital markets to "create an underpinning for long-term growth." What are your key recommendations?</h4><p><strong>JS</strong> The UAE should consider floating more of its government and quasi-government companies. It has excellent businesses that investors would love to buy. Flotation would raise money for the government, support the corporate governance practices of the companies and therefore their performance, and enable investors to share in their success and diversify their UAE exposure. Such IPOs would show family and smaller companies that the government stands behind the capital market, which will encourage many of them to go public as well. The UAE would also benefit from a relaxation of restrictions on the foreign ownership of its listed companies. This would increase overall investment. Introducing short selling, with stock lending and borrowing, would also be a step forward as it would enable investors to hedge risk and allow investors to stay in the market when the market falls. A central clearing house is also part of a mature framework that sophisticated investors would like to see. Best practice market regulation is also key. Investors like clear and sensible rules that are coherently enforced.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Carlsberg's business evolved in Kazakhstan?<br></h4><p><strong>TUNCAY TEKDEMIR</strong> Our company entered the Kazakhstani market in 1998 under the Ak-Nar label. In that same year, we introduced a new brand, Irbis, to the market. In 1999, the DERBES brand was developed. Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH), an international brewery owned by Carlsberg, and the UK brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle, acquired a stake of Ak-Nar Brewery, and merged the two businesses in 2003. Ak-Nar was renamed DERBES in December 2006. Carlsberg Group has since acquired the Scottish &amp; Newcastle shares, becoming the beneficial owner of BBH assets in Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic States. As a result, DERBES joined the Carlsberg Group in April 2008. DERBES was officially renamed to Carlsberg Kazakhstan in December 2010.</p><h4>Has it provided new export opportunities?</h4><p><strong>TURSEN ALAGUZOV </strong>On the one hand, the Customs Union complicated the situation, as Russian producers forced their expansion into the Kazakhstani market, thus putting our producers in a difficult situation. However, on the other hand the Customs Union simplified the process of launching Kazakhstani products on the Russian market and made Kazakhstani products more attractive. Of course, there is a definite need for support at the governmental level, because the abilities of Russian companies are greater than our own. This is not because Russian companies are more advanced, but simply because the Russian market is larger and the capitalization and financial capacity of Russian companies is higher than that of Kazakhstani companies. It is easier for Russian companies to invest in Kazakhstan and conquer significant market shares. The Customs Union has heavily impacted the food industry. However, it is difficult to determine if this influence is positive or negative. For our company, the customs duties on raw materials imported from outside the Customs Union have increased. However, import prices have fallen, and this has made an extremely positive impact on Kazakhstan's heavily regulated sugar market and led to a significant reduction in prices of around 25%. In addition, we are observing that Kazakhstani producers have become more active.</p><h4>What are Carlsberg Kazakhstan's main marketing tools?</h4><p><strong>TT</strong> Alcohol advertising is not allowed in Kazakhstan; however, we are allowed to advertise non-alcoholic beer. For that we use traditional channels—mostly TV and outdoor advertising. At the same time, more focus has been placed on point-of-sale advertising. We want to illustrate the uniqueness of our product and try to introduce something new to the market. Local consumers are receptive to product appearance in terms of bottle designs and labels. Innovation and regular changes in positioning are also important, but first we have to attract the consumer. Another important aspect is the taste. As everyone has different tastes, we have to have enough variety to provide exactly what the consumer needs. Kazakhstan consumers prefer classic lager; dark beer types, such as porters or ales are not popular here. This is different from Europe, where different sorts of beer are consumed with various foods; we haven't arrived at that point in the Kazakhstani market. Here, the association between beer and food is not that obvious, but hopefully we can expand these marketing tools in the future.</p><h4>Galanz has a 40% market share. Where do you see the toughest competition?</h4><p><strong>TA</strong> Competition in the beverages market is colossal, as in every FMCG segment, whether a company is producing juice or carbonated drinks. Every manufacturer is trying to maximize its presence by investing huge amounts in advertising and promotion. However, everyone is competing in a fairly limited market. Markets in other countries are radically different in terms of product grouping, and Kazakhstani manufacturers are looking for new segments and market niches that haven't been established yet. Laimon Fresh is a good example. It is a soft drink composed entirely of natural ingredients with a unique taste. It has exploded on the market in Russia, and is also rapidly gaining customers in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>For what reasons did your company enter the Kazakhstani market?<br></h4><p><strong>VEYSEL ARTUKARSLAN</strong> We established our company in 2002, and shortly thereafter we started operations in Kazakhstan. We introduced our products and began to sell them on the local market. Kazakhstan was the next step in Ecober's expansion plans, because we saw huge potential in the sector in Central Asia. We also saw that companies from Turkey could sell products easily here. When I visited Kazakhstan, I saw that almost no one could find the products we offer in the country. Many people were using home-based products, unaware of their industrial counterparts, and we saw huge potential in the consumer segment. At first, we attempted to display and showcase our products to people who were unfamiliar with these types of goods. We found that we could only sell our products to large international hotels. However, every operator in the hotel sector now recognizes our products, and we can sell them easily.</p><p><strong>NURLAN MAKHANOV</strong> We were founded in 1802 and began our operations in black powder production. At the beginning of the 19th century, the US economy was booming. In the early stages of its development, the company's founders heavily discussed science, which has been the major driver of the business.</p><p>Early on, we worked to develop sustainable solutions that are healthier and safer for people. When we arrived in Kazakhstan, we felt that the market had matured and we sought to strengthen our position by moving closer to the local business environment and meeting rising demand. We value being close to our customers on a daily basis. DuPont began in the Soviet Union in 1974, as one of the 14 companies registered to provide service to the whole region, and operate from a base in Moscow. In 2006, the management made the decision to open an office in Almaty, in order to utilize the science we developed for customers in emerging markets like Kazakhstan. In 2008, we registered as a legal entity in Almaty. At the stage of becoming a legal entity, we felt closer to our customers.</p><h4>Which of your products are used in the food-processing industry?</h4><p><strong>VA</strong> The majority of these food-processing plants use Ecober glue for packaging. In addition, if they have to clean plastics, they use our chemicals. They sterilize the packaging and the equipment, plus the surrounding area. Moreover, most plants have closed water systems, which require cleaning with our chemicals. Lastly, they use our chemicals to treat their wastewater in order to meet environmental standards. All of the companies operating plants—such as Danone, Efes, and PepsiCo—have to use chemicals to clean for sanitation purposes. If factories do not clean the shipping area, fermentation tank or equipment, they cannot produce. They may have the milk, equipment, and the plant, but without clean equipment, the factory could be shut down or customers could suffer from health problems. The products are small, but very important to a plant.</p><h4>In which segments do you have customers?</h4><p><strong>NM</strong> Our customers come from a number of industries such as oil and gas, agriculture, food, railway, construction, nutrition, building, and communications. We invite our customers to make decisions with us, which makes the supply chain more efficient, and benefits our marketing and technical support. We help our customers, in addition to our suppliers and partners. We work step by step to discover opportunities in the market and we choose to hire people for certain projects. With this strategy we enjoy constant growth. Kazakhstan is the focus for DuPont in the region.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2012?</h4><p><strong>VA</strong> I firmly believe that business will grow in 2012, owing to the launch of a number of new projects. Many people in Kazakhstan have begun to formulate business plans, bearing in mind our products and the benefits of our service. These projects are realistic, and this is very good for Ecober.</p><p><strong>NM</strong> Our plan is further growth, as we want to increase our presence in the region. We have a five-year history, extensive experience, and a number of people doing business on our behalf. In the light of government initiatives, we expect to grow in order to meet new requirements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Kazakhstan compare to the other countries you've worked in?<br></h4><p><strong>MARK FILIMONTSEV</strong> Kazakhstan has certain similarities with Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe. At the same time, there are differences between Russia and Kazakhstan, which I like a lot. There is a rich cultural heritage in Kazakhstan, and it clearly has Asian influences to it, which you do not see so pronounced in Russia, and I enjoy that very much. I am General Manager for Kazakhstan and South Central Asia, which includes three states: Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. I am responsible for four markets, and Kazakhstan is a larger market, selling about 30 billion sticks in terms of volume per year. In 2005, the company expanded its distribution operations in the country, and developed a clear investment plan. Since then, market share has increased to 10%. Our flagship brand is Kent, as we are focusing on our global portfolio. We are number three in the market.</p><p><strong>GIAN LUIGI CERVESATO</strong> In terms of business, Kazakhstan is on the right path, and I believe that the country has a very promising future. In fact, Kazakhstan has become the reference country for Central Asia. The economy remains very commodity dependent, but there are efforts to diversify and establish an industrial network across the nation and attract investors. On a historical scale, 20 years is a very short time; considering the case of Kazakhstan, we see that not many countries have achieved the country's level of development in such a short period of time. In terms of macroeconomics, the management of the country has been fairly wise. We saw how easily the government steered the country out of the global crisis, building reserves during the good times that could be used in more dire situations. Having said that, Kazakhstan is a country on its way to something better. Success in attracting foreign investors is related to regulation, administration, and ease of doing business. The key is to sustain an open dialogue with industry experts while drafting these regulations.</p><h4>How would you describe your growth strategy, provided the peculiarities of the tobacco industry?</h4><p><strong>MF</strong> Our strategy is about growing our global brands, building distribution capabilities, and developing talent. In that way, we have been successful, but still have a long way to go in terms of implementing the strategy. However, our results so far demonstrate that the strategy is working, so we will stick to it. BAT has been active in this market since 1997. Today, it has 14 depots across the country, with more than 500 employees. It imports its products into the country, and its market share is about 10%, so we bring into the country about one-tenth of the total market. Our focus is on the Kent, Dunhill, Vogue, Pall Mall, and Viceroy brands, which are all international. We run our direct store sales operations in Kazakhstan, and this distribution model has delivered results so far.</p><p><strong>GC</strong> We do not focus on sector growth; this is a set and stable market that is declining worldwide. Instead, our strategy is to take market share from our competitors, and we define our success by that rubric, along with profit growth and expanding into other geographies. Across these three points we have been very successful. Considering our position in Kazakhstan, over the last decade our investment range has been significant—$120 million—and the company has experienced accelerated growth over the last five years. We have sustained these investments for two reasons. Firstly, we believe in this country. Secondly, with a market share of 41%-42%, it has become a very significant market for us, and among the most important for JTI worldwide. The next step is to make Kazakhstan a regional hub by preparing our facilities and management for geographical expansion. Today, we have a 50% market share in Kyrgyzstan and 30% in Mongolia. We started a new operation in Tajikistan, and we are about to enter Turkmenistan. JTI entered Uzbekistan at the end of 2010 and our operations so far have been very successful. Our market share is 5% and growing very fast. Our production is based in Kazakhstan and the key expansion of our facilities is targeted at these geographies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you looked to build up your product and service portfolio across Kazakhstan?<br></h4><p><strong>STEVE BROWN</strong> During the property boom, less emphasis was placed on obtaining professional real estate services by either the developers or the banks. The collapse of the banking and property sectors has meant that all parties partake in genuine and stringent assessments of commercial real estate projects from conception to completion and subsequent asset management. Although the market remains slow, the developers that have survived the financial crisis, plus new developers entering the market, now seek a high level of consultancy support such as that provided by Veritas Brown | Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Without wanting to "blow our own trumpet," within the past three years we have established ourselves as the market leaders in the service lines that we provide. We have made great progress with developers who acknowledge our in-house expertise, and as a consequence we are working with the largest players in most sectors across the country, including notable infrastructure development support for the Kashagan project and the largest retail mall development in Almaty. We are also valuing asset portfolios for listed companies and large local corporations across the region.</p><p><strong>GIANLUCA MATTIOLI</strong> We follow our customers' desires, wishes, and needs, and rather than simply leaving the building to them once they move in, we continue to provide services as they operate their businesses. This is our policy—not only in Kazakhstan, but in all the countries in which we work. We have been in this country for 15 years now, and we have always been interested in practical, readily optimized projects. In Atyrau and Aksai, for example, we are building serviced apartments that will address the needs of tenants in the most efficient way possible. This approach is based on the idea that expatriates expect a certain level of comfort in their living space, and we conduct studies to ensure that we attain that standard in our projects. The same applies to our new construction. We did a similar study prior to beginning construction of our new 16-story building, and found that demand still exists. We provide services that no one else does, and once the new building is finished we believe there will be as much demand for space there as in the current one.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the local market over 2012?</h4><p><strong>SB</strong> Restricted by tax consequences and limitations placed on banks directly operating property portfolios, the commercial real estate sector remains largely stifled by many of the banks' inability to foreclose, write-off, or dispose of property-related non-performing loans (NPLs). We have seen an increased demand for development consultancy and valuation services, particularly in the last six months. This is encouraging, not only from the point of view that the industry is seeing a small but tangible revival, but also that developers are seeking professional advice from industry experts. Development activity is slowly increasing, but until the banks legacy property portfolios are resolved the revival will continue at the rate of a trickle. There is certainly room for significant commercial success in Central Asian property development—the question is not if, but when. We foresee modest growth in 2012.</p><p><strong>GM</strong> In general, there are a lot of empty buildings in the market, at prices lower than ours, but we are performing better due to our high quality of service. Because of the over-supplied market, I don't foresee many new projects starting. The only construction projects that are continuing are those financed by the government. There is still not much around compared to four years ago. As far as our operations are concerned, we hope to have our new building in Astana completed in the spring or summer of 2013. We have also presented a new project in Almaty, to be built on a piece of land we own behind our building there. The building will have a maximum of six floors, because Almaty is in a seismically active zone and we are a responsible company. Thankfully, our company is in good condition, but a crisis is a crisis. We are still seeking opportunities, as long as the commitment is long term. The project we finished in 2000 paid back our investment only three or four years ago. We estimate that it will take four-and-a-half years to fill our new 16-floor building.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the performance of your company in recent years?<br></h4><p><strong>AMANGELDY YELGONOV</strong> In 2011, the company grew by 30%. However, in the coming two years we expect growth to be slower as a reflection of the cyclical nature of our business. This is not solely inherent to Kazakhstan; the same occurs in Europe and the US. Our business is not retail, and we do not expect to grow continuously. Road construction is not constant, but repair work is fairly stable. We had plans to participate in a concession project that did not materialize. Instead, this project is being carried out through a public-private partnership (PPP) model. For such projects to be carried out, the appropriate legislation needs to be implemented. Because traffic volumes remain inadequate, we are wary of the risks associated with returns.</p><p><strong>DASTAN URAKOV </strong>We have completed eight or nine state-led projects, a number of which are of national importance, such as a metro station, sports palace, and tennis court. There is interest in building a sports palace in a different region as well. We also started the construction of the Nazarbayev Intellectual School in Astana. Furthermore, MAG is building a car park on Saina Street in Almaty and a series of children's health clinics, and the company frequently constructs roads in free economic zones. Additionally, we have completed the design of a sports complex and two kindergarten schools. MAG has contacted a Saudi Arabian company to form a partnership agreement as part of our strategy to collaborate with enterprises in the Middle East and attract investment to our construction sector.</p><h4>How can the Customs Union increase the traffic volume in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>AY</strong> The Customs Union will increase the traffic volume in the country, but we cannot predict how much to expect. The Western Europe-Western China project is an example of an important initiative to boost Kazakhstan's transit potential. This project also increases the use of concrete in road construction. One of the new projects we are currently involved in is the Astana-Almaty route, a motorway that will run parallel to the high-speed train. This project is slated to start in 2014 or 2015. A 35-kilometer bridge is planned to cross Lake Balkhash, which will reduce the length of the road by 200 kilometers.</p><h4>What are some of MAG's residential development projects?</h4><p><strong>DU</strong> We have three real estate development projects in the pipeline. One is the development of a small suburb with 24 homes. Additionally, we are working on a residential complex, which is at the design stage and will be constructed in the center of Almaty. We are looking into establishing a consortium with Turkish companies for a residential project called "Revival," which would see the construction of 1,000 units. If all goes well, we hope to start building in 2012. Additionally, we are building a shopping and entertainment complex on Rozybakiev Street in Almaty, which will cover an area of 110,000 sqm. We believe that this state-of-the-art complex will compete with the MEGA Center.</p><h4>In which road construction-related segments do you expect movement?</h4><p><strong>AY</strong> The most rapidly developing segments will be in concrete and bridge building. In 2012, new cement plants opened in Kazakhstan; in the coming years we expect more to open, meeting the increased demand for cement.</p><h4>Where do you see demand emerging from in the construction market?</h4><p><strong>DU</strong> We are working to meet existing demands; otherwise our business would be very risky. Currently, the demand in Almaty is there, but growing very slowly. The completed projects are selling gradually. The middle class cannot buy houses, largely because of the lack of favorable funding schemes. Therefore, the majority of construction in the country is associated with the state. Financial institutions have a funding framework that not all developers are willing to comply with.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the size of your production in the dairy sector?<br></h4><p><strong>AIDA SAPARGAZINOVA</strong> The milk and dairy products market is one of the most important segments of the country's food industry and constitutes 16% of the food basket. Milk and dairy products have a huge impact on health and are a historical part of the Kazakhstani diet, thus creating a certain market capacity. At the same time, consumption and production increases about 9% in Kazakhstan every year. The Kazakhstani people prefer domestic dairy products over those imported from Russia. Despite expert forecasts that Kazakhstan's dairy producers will be unable to withstand the onslaught of cheaper Russian products, domestic products are nevertheless still a priority despite the earlier concerns that the Customs Union could ruin the domestic market. Therefore, the main objective of our company is the stable development of dairy production and the establishment of a continuous supply of products made from natural ingredients. FoodMaster is the market leader in the main categories of dairy products, and we intend to further strengthen its market position through continuous innovations in manufacturing, quality products, and impeccable service.</p><p><strong>DAVID MANZINI</strong> Consumers in Kazakhstan are consuming 3 kilograms of modern dairy yogurt per year, compared to Europe, where consumers purchase 28 kilograms. There are two explanations for this: one is education and the other is price. Modern yogurt is 1.5-2 times more expensive. The main reason that processed yogurt is more expensive is because of the raw material, milk. The market is scarce and difficult in Kazakhstan. The price of 1 liter of milk is almost the same price as a liter of gasoline. This forces us to have a very expensive finished product to absorb the cost of the raw material. We conducted some tests to identify the elasticity of consumption if the price was reduced. By reducing the price 20%, we discovered that production could be doubled to meet demand. Kazakhstanis want to eat yogurt and more dairy products; the problem is how we can make it affordable. The local constraints are the lack of milk. We have to work on the fat and protein content of the milk. It remains a big challenge to expand the scale of production in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What issues need to be addressed to realize Kazakhstan's full agriculture potential?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> Some problems, such as raw material shortages and low quality, result in high production costs and reduced production competitiveness, as well as in reduced opportunities for business development. Raw material shortages are exacerbated by seasonal fluctuations, when in winter there is even less material, and the cost is higher. When material shortages occur, companies are forced to outsource part of their production from other countries. This results in price distortions, and the price of milk in Kazakhstan is higher than member countries of the Customs Union and in Europe. Subsidies are needed for raw milk production, especially with regard to small farms and homesteads, and, certainly, for milk processors.</p><h4>How do you present yogurt to the market in terms of fitting it into daily eating habits?</h4><p><strong>DM</strong> Each brand should be established with a certain "moment of consumption." Danactive and Activia are our premiere products. Danactive is designed to boost the immune system in the morning before work or the beginning of activity. We will promote it is a supplement. Activia, on the other hand, is marketed toward women. Women love Activia because it facilitates digestion, thereby reducing weight and bloating. It has enjoyed tremendous success in other countries with both men and women. If you eat and you sit down, you feel the bloating effect. With Activia, digestion is facilitated, thereby removing the bloating feeling. Rastishka yogurt is a product we have promoted as a dessert for children for any meal or snack time. It can cover any moment of consumption. From a brand perspective, we have to work on establishing this. There is a new specific moment of consumption that we are planning to launch in 2012. The life exapectancy of a Kazakhstani is 30% to 40% lower than in Western Europe, and if you observe the physique of men here, you can see that they are overweight, which increases the risk of heart attacks and other cardiac problems. There is a discussion that dairy products extend life expectancy. It is included in our corporate social responsibility program to raise awareness of these issues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends among business and leisure travelers have you observed recently in terms of their origin?<br></h4><p><strong>SCOTT BUTCHE</strong>R Our customer profiles are changing as we move to a more business-style hotel. It is therefore important that our service standards match the desires and expectations of these seasoned travelers. We have, therefore, recently introduced our managing excellence program to ensure that our service delivery is focused on particular areas of the guest experience. This also obviously applies to the leisure traveller as well. When we first opened, the hotel was very popular in the Saudi Arabian, GCC, and Asian markets. Now the UK is our largest source market, with significant numbers also from Germany and the US. We still, however, receive significant numbers from Saudi Arabia, the GCC, and India.</p><p><strong>MOHAMED AWADALLA</strong> At Time Hotels we have a large number of regular guests, especially from Saudi, Kuwait, and Qatar. We run half of our occupancy on a long-term and half on a short-term basis, and since the beginning of 2011 have enjoyed an average 90% occupancy. Overall, 2011 was a very good year for the Dubai hospitality sector, and we saw a lot of business returning, in part due to the Arab Spring. Everything shifted to Dubai, including many tourists—evidenced by a number of Egyptian tour operators moving their operations to Dubai. The Emirate is an ideal pit stop for people from all over the GCC on their way to Europe, and they see Dubai as an essential stop-off location. With numbers climbing over the last year we have naturally considered the possibility of a decrease in guests once the Egyptian market stabilizes, but overall we believe that Dubai is such a strong destination that it will not suffer greatly.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the MICE tourism sector?</h4><p><strong>SB</strong> MICE is an important market segment and we are devoting more of our sales and marketing resources to it to ensure that we gain our fair share. In future, we will be working closely with all parties in this segment.</p><p><strong>MA</strong> The Emirate is the number one exhibition destination in the Middle East, and the segment will continue to attract strong numbers and is a particularly excellent asset for Dubai. Keeping this in mind, a plan is underway by TIME Hotels Management Company for an extension adding three more venues to the profile at flagship property TIME Oak Hotel &amp; Suites located at Tecom Al Barsha. A 400-sqm space has been allocated at the hotel for an extension of meeting rooms with adjustable partitions not only adding additional spaces for corporate business events, but also providing a bigger ballroom area for larger evening gatherings. This extension will cover the demand of MICE business and will enable the hotel to accommodate requests for a bigger space.</p><h4>How does your hotel define itself in terms of the heavy competition in the Emirate?</h4><p><strong>SB</strong> The Park Regis is a very young brand in terms of major hotel groups. We are therefore innovative in our approach to business opportunities. Due to our smaller size and less formal management structure, we are quick to react to business opportunities.</p><p><strong>MA</strong> Being away from the beach strips does not hinder our success; it allows us to cater a different segment of the market. We offer more affordable accommodation. As we do not have a liquor license, our hotels are generally quieter and consequently more appealing to certain segments. Increased competition does not worry us, as we believe that more choice makes Dubai even more attractive. It creates options for travelers both in terms of availability and in price range. Well-trained staff is the key to success, and as long as you have that you will keep getting business. A broad range of hotels offer almost identical facilities — what attracts people to one over another is the service differentiation. We look after our staff so that they can look after our customers. We also have a strict pricing strategy and we stick to it — we don't hold our guests to ransom during busy periods by increasing our prices. This means that we build loyalty and get repeat business because we are trusted and have a good rapport with our guests. Repeat guests are very valuable, because they already know the hotel and what to expect.</p><h4>What has the hospitality sector's experience been like after the offset of the global liquidity crisis? What changes have you seen now that the global economic indicators are improving?</h4><p><strong>SB</strong> The hotel industry is very resilient and I think that there is now more optimism than there has been for a while. Initially with the GFC, there were significant cuts in all forms of expenditures and rates dropped. However, with confidence resuming, rates are on the rise. Investment is being put back into the industry, and this is very positive.</p><p><strong>MA</strong> We had to drop the rates a lot during the crisis, which was very hard for us as the running costs alone in Dubai are extremely high. Rates, staffing costs, maintenance charges—all of these add up, and we did find it difficult to cover costs and create revenue. Prior to the crisis hotels made very large profits and investors became used to extremely high returns, and when the crisis came it was of course a shock. We were lucky because our shareholders understood that it was a period that required endurance, and sure enough we came through that period. Revenues are now up again and we hope that next year we will be able to achieve double-digit growth.</p><h4>How has the apart hotel concept helped to change the accommodation picture for business?</h4><p>MA Our hotel apartments are ideal for business people passing through Dubai for a finite period. Even for those people moving to Dubai on a more permanent basis, we have noticed that, post-crisis, people are hesitant to commit to long-term leases. Our serviced apartments are the perfect compromise as the rate includes all services and necessities, but on a contract with a break clause which allows for comfort without fear of over commitment.</p><h4>Are you hoping to move into other parts of the GCC region?</h4><p>MA We aim to expand from the UAE into the Saudi Arabian market. The Saudi market is huge and the entire industry is eyeing it for expansion, but it is very difficult. You need a very strong local partner, and you have to know how to approach the business. We are ready to move as we have both the resources and the drive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does the JW Marriott Marquis brand fit within the wider Marriott group? Why was now chosen as the right time to bring the brand to the Middle East?<br></h4><p><strong>RUPPRECHT QUEITSCH</strong> JW Marquis is the primary luxury brand for this hotel. The brand is designed for the businessperson who expects everything to work at 100%. However, the hotel is not like a Ritz-Carlton, which usually has a rich environment with original paintings and heavier furniture. The JW Marriott Marquis is more contemporary, with luxury apparent in the service. There are only a handful of Marquis hotels worldwide, but they are usually present as a large hotel in the city center, as well as business and convention hotels. This will be the first Marquis outside the US, and it will be Marriott's largest hotel outside North America. It will be Dubai's largest hotel, and will cater to the business community and the meeting community, which is an added feature of Dubai. The convention sector has picked up a lot of business. Meetings are getting larger, and Dubai is starting to be on the radar of large meeting organizers in pharmaceuticals, the automobile industry, and consultancy. The hotel is targeted to open in 4Q2012, while phase II will open a year or two later. We will be opening much of the banquet, restaurant, and bar outlets at the start, with only the facilities in the second tower to come on later.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy in the region?</h4><p><strong>RUDI S.K. JAGERSBACHER</strong> We opened nine hotels in 2011 and signed a further 18 properties­­—so, despite the challenges faced, it was one of our best years yet. During 2012, we have already established two new hotels in Lebanon and a further hotel in Doha, Qatar, with plans to add to our portfolio in Egypt and UAE. The new Conrad Dubai hotel is a key opening for us this year and will bring an outstanding, luxury property with large conference and function offerings to the heart of the buzzing Sheikh Zayed Road area of the city.</p><h4>What is unique about your space for business and leisure that the hotel is bringing to the market?</h4><p><strong>RQ</strong> Well, for one it is a two-tower inventory with 800 rooms each, meaning we will have 1,600 rooms in total. There are not many hotels where you can house large conventions. For example, we just received a business booking for 700 rooms next year. That is large, and not many hotels can manage such an event all in the same location. We have over 5,000 sqm of banquet facilities, and then we have two ballrooms, the largest being 1,400 sqm with 60-80 meter high ceilings. The hotel will feature nine restaurants and five lounges, a large recreation area, and a large spa. It is important also for the business traveler to relax; today's businessperson is also a leisure traveler, and today's leisure traveler is also a businessperson. People are doing business at the beach, and someone who does business all day may go to the beach in the evening. Tourism is very intermingled, and we cater to both segments.</p><h4>What trends do you foresee in terms of investment?</h4><p><strong>RJ</strong> We see great possibilities for our mid-market brands in a number of markets and from a capital point of view it requires much lower investment. Regarding individual regions, we have enjoyed growth in the UAE as it became something of a safer haven during the recent political turmoil. Currently, Saudi Arabia is our biggest expansion market with 14 hotels in the pipeline and more to come in the future. As previously mentioned, we're also looking forward to the exciting prospect of exploring opportunities in new and existing markets across Africa. I also predict more success for our loyalty program Hilton Honors. Currently standing at 30 million members worldwide, the program is a proven and trusted advantage for us, as guest members make up an increasing percentage of hotel occupancy and, in turn, the same guests are also customers in the individual food and beverage outlets in our hotels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Dubai so attractive as a golfing destination?<br></h4><p><strong>CHRISTOPHER MAY</strong>  Dubai has some of the best golf courses in the world, and every year there are some major tournaments hosted here. These include the DP World Tour Championship and the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, which is in its 24th year and attracts some of the best players in the world. Previous winners of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic have included golfing greats such as Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, and Fred Couples. The golf courses and the quality of service is a big driver, but we can also not forget that there are great hotels, great shopping facilities, and great airlines. As a total package, Dubai is a very attractive golfing destination, proven by the growing numbers of people coming to the region specifically to play golf.</p><h4>What makes racing such an inherent part of the local spirit?</h4><p><strong>FRANK GABRIEL</strong> The history of the Thoroughbred is closely linked to the GCC region by the three original Arabian stallions that helped to develop the breed. All Thoroughbreds trace their lineage to one of these three Arabian stallions; the Godolphin, the Darley, or the Bylery Turk. The Maktoum family, headed by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has a long history in horse racing. This dates to 1967 when Sheikh Mohammed and Sheikh Hamdan attended their first race in Newmarket. That was the seed that has grown to include the success of Dubai Racing Club (DRC).</p><h4>How sustainably can you run a grass golf course in this part of the world?</h4><p><strong>CM</strong> If you go back to the very beginning, desalinated water was used to irrigate the courses. We now use only a very small amount of desalinated water—98% of the water that we use to irrigate is now treated sewage effluent (TSE), and that is something that we worked hard to achieve with Dubai Municipality. It really is the right thing to do, and with population growth we are now able to do that. It has reduced our carbon footprint significantly, and it has reduced the cost of operation also, but it is still a very expensive part of our business, because we use a lot of water. But using TSE is something that is a lot greener, and putting in a new irrigation system will mean that we will use a lot less water.</p><h4>How do the unique environmental challenges here affect how you run the racing calendar?</h4><p><strong>FG</strong> Due to the climate we are limited to racing from November through to March, but this is also to our benefit. This time of year is the perfect window to attract horses from Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, and South America. In 2013 DRC will celebrate the 10th year of the Dubai World Cup Carnival, which is a season of racing that attracts some of the greatest horses in racing. It is 10 race nights, from the first week in January and leading up to the Dubai World Cup, and the carnival annually attracts over 250 horses from 15 different countries training and racing here in Dubai for two to three months. Not only do we attract the horses, but their owners and trainers from all over the world are also staying in Dubai from a few weeks up to three or four months. This is because of the quality of the facilities, the racing, and the prize money, with over $10 million offered during the 10 nights of the Dubai World Cup Carnival. The weather and the quality of our racing combine to create what is the best season for horses and the horsemen. The success of the racing serves to increase the awareness of Dubai and the UAE.</p><h4>What does the future hold?</h4><p><strong>CM</strong> Grass golf courses have been in existence here for just 24 years, and there has been huge development and a huge amount of growth. Yes, there is still a lot of growth to happen, and there have been a lot of new golf courses built in the last five years, but with 50,000 rounds of golf being played in March 2012, the industry is looking strong.</p><p><strong>FG</strong> The goal of the DRC is to maintain the highest standards of racing by attracting some of the world's greatest horses and horsemen to compete in the racing seasons held at Meydan. The success of the DRC goes beyond the success of Dubai World Cup night. We are working to provide entertainment and racing as a sport that will not only attract the current fans that have a love for racing, but also spectators who are looking to experience racing for the first time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your approach to luxury retailing?<br></h4><p><strong>MOHAMMED AR AL FAHIM</strong> When it comes to luxury, a person always wants to feel great about his or her appearance. Looking beautiful and smelling nice is very important. Environment is part of the service, however. You can find cosmetics or perfumes anywhere you like. A customer can have a tea or coffee, but it is different depending on the environment. However, they also expect to receive more in terms of service and feeling, so that it feels worth that price. Now, when it comes to cosmetics and perfume, it is the same thing. We know that our customers expect a different standard of service. However, it is not necessary to pay a little bit extra for that higher service, and this is what we try to maintain. The price of perfumes and cosmetics are all standardized and unified globally. We sell the products at a price and do not charge extra for the higher service and the ambiance of our store. We provide an environment with a lot of space, so that customers can have personal privacy while shopping and feel comfortable to walk around, browse, rest, and so on. It does not feel like going into a busy, crowded convenience store. We merchandise our products through large personalized wall units that create a different feeling from smaller shops elsewhere in Dubai or Europe. Just like Dubai is the hub and destination for luxury, Paris Gallery is the destination for luxury when it comes to this sector of business. Customers know what they get in Paris Gallery. The brands know where to go to present themselves to their customers in the right way, and that is why Dubai is important.</p><p><strong>ABDULMAGIED AHMED SEDDIQI</strong> We have clients from a broad range of demographics, age and nationality because of the wide range of our brand portfolio. Our UAE-based clients are mainly locals and we have many clients who visit us from overseas to buy a certain pieces. In addition we also cater to the mass wave of tourists who visit the UAE throughout the year. We have clients whose grandfather and father used to buy from us, and now generations later, we still have them as clients. With growth and change in any market, the demands and expectations of clients have changed and evolved with time. Today, we also see more watch collectors based in the UAE then a few years ago, and this has been a result of educating the market and bringing in exclusive and unique pieces to the UAE through Ahmed Seddiqi &amp; Sons. With a portfolio of over 50 Swiss watch brands, it is easy for us to cater to the needs of our clients. Of course, we have witnessed the appreciation of complications over the years and this is primarily due to the increase of UAE based watch collectors, many of whom are UAE nationals.</p><h4>How do you plan to expand?</h4><p><strong>MF</strong> We do have a plan for the Middle East and the neighboring countries that are close to the Middle East. We are currently looking at Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Syria. We have plans to expand in the Middle East and outside the region. Our team is also already in Baku, Azerbaijan, trying to work out a business plan. Iraq is interesting to us, but we are waiting. Iraq has very big potential in terms purchasing power, country size, and the need for luxury. Turkey is another possibility. Then, later on, Lebanon and Egypt—when the time comes.</p><p><strong>AS</strong> The company brand has become a destination, and that is enough for us. Dubai is a business center and we are based in Dubai, so all of our main activities are here. Being a family business we want to have our own people running the business, not necessarily the entire operations, but certainly to be on the top and to manage. We now have the capacity for more managers, and we do wish to move more into Abu Dhabi. I believe we should focus on developing here in our own country. You cannot be strong everywhere. We have clients who come from all over the world who know us and come to us. The trust that our clients have bestowed on us over the years is something that we treasure. We have built our reputation over the past 60 years, and achieved this through hard work, honesty, and the excellent service that we offer to our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some defining elements of the bank's strategy under your leadership?<br></h4><p><strong>GURAM ANDRONIKASHVILI </strong>Fortebank was established in 2007 with a focus on retail banking, with consumer retail lending as the main product of the bank. When we bought the bank in 2010, we repositioned it to work in the SME and corporate segment. At that time there were 16 branches throughout Kazakhstan, and so we were able to serve clients throughout the whole country. There was also the banking license and the people who worked here. We did not focus as much on the clients that the bank was serving because they were completely different from the clients we work with now. We now focus on medium to large SMEs and corporates. The bank has grown very quickly in the last two years. From 2010 to 2011, the bank's assets increased from $12 million-$15 million to approximately $250 million. Our loans grew by 80% in 2011 alone. Furthermore, the number of our clients has grown over 100% in percentage terms.</p><p><strong>MICHAEL LOMTADZE</strong> We have very simple vision, "to be the best retail bank in the country." Therefore, our focus is primarily servicing mass-market retail customers. Our general idea is to provide the right customer with the right product through the right channel at the right time. We are developing 360° around the customer, which means we are building our business around customers and integrating customer acquisition, sales, and service channels to provide the best quality service. The speed of service and sales has been an important competitive advantage, which we have been constantly building. Over the past three years, we have developed innovative products. We have introduced the first mass-market credit card in 2008. To date, we have issued more than 1 million credit cards, which put us in the number one position in Kazakhstan, and sixth or seventh in the CIS region. We have also been introducing products such as cash loans, which is a simple product to satisfy the various needs of our customers.</p><h4>What are your expectations from recent changes in the banking law and regulatory structure?</h4><p><strong>GA</strong> Previously, it was fashionable for the central bank and the regulator to be together, then the UK started the fashion of trying to split the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and everywhere else in the world it became fashionable to split the regulator and the monetary policy determinant, and after the crisis it became again fashionable to consolidate them back. We are following the worldwide trend. It is difficult for me to say what it means, but of course it means that the National Bank will be much more closely involved in the oversight and regulation of the banking system, which probably is for the best to ensure that the banking system is stable and that it is more involved in decision making. At the moment, we have not felt the effect of many procedural changes, but, overall, the National Bank having more oversight is probably a better thing for the protection of the banking sector.</p><p><strong>ML</strong> The new banking law combines many policies into a single legislative package. There are important lessons to be learned from the crisis, such as the fact that banks should not lend to the extent they did before and should not be investing outside of Kazakhstan to such a large degree. Moreover, our banks will not be permitted to carry many speculative financial instruments on their balance sheet, as they were doing before. Today, we enjoy a much more transparent system that functions as a manual for the banks as lenders. Banks should refrain from participating in activities such as hedge funds or real estate funds. This is simply too risky. These are the factors that led to the demise of many banks worldwide and in Kazakhstan. The legislation creates limitations on international expansion, and now banks cannot invest more than a certain percentage of their capital outside of the country, which may be temporary. I still believe that Kazakhstan needs to expand its business into bigger markets. This will be good both for business and the country. If we decide to work outside of Kazakhstan, we would like to invest more than the specified 10% of our capital. All drawbacks aside, the laws bring personal responsibility to both management and shareholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the growth of your member portfolio reflect Kazakhstan's economic development?<br></h4><p><strong>DORIS BRADBURY</strong> As the largest and most influential foreign investor association in Kazakhstan, AmCham's membership portfolio becomes more and more diverse year by year. Even during the financial crisis, our membership grew by 20% per year. In terms of national participation, only half the membership is American, and we actively promote the international diversity of our membership. In terms of sectors, the largest representation in AmCham after oil and gas is banking and consumer products, demonstrating the country's affluence. Luxury hotels, airlines, and financial services such as insurance and investment firms are major members, too. Accounting firms and law firms have more business than they can handle at the corporate level.</p><p><strong>ÖMER YALÇINKAYA</strong> KATİAD is the representative of the Turkish business community in Kazakhstan. Turkey was one of the first states to recognize the independence of Kazakhstan. Due to cultural and linguistic ties with the Kazakhstani people, Turkish businessmen were among the first to invest in this country. In our view, Kazakhstan is the most attractive country for investment in the former Soviet Union. Statistical figures support this view. Turkish companies have invested more than $3 billion into Kazakhstan's economy and completed contracting projects with a value of $20 billion so far. Turkish companies mainly operate in the construction, services, and manufacturing industries, which create employment for the local labor force. Turkish companies are employing more than 50,000 Kazakhstani citizens at present. New technologies and know-how brought by Turkish investors are valuable assets for the economy. In addition, the Turkish business community is very dynamic and adaptable to change. Several economic crises were faced in the last two decades, and Turkish companies quickly adopted themselves. Most of them continued to grow their businesses despite hard times in the global economy.</p><h4>In which areas do you think Kazakhstan needs to improve to ensure the continuity of FDI?</h4><p><strong>DB</strong> Rule of law is probably at the top for AmCham members, along with anti-corruption, customs operations, taxation issues, and regional economic integration. If investors have a problem they need to feel that they can turn to the courts; that with legal representation they can receive a fair hearing and obtain a just solution to their problem.</p><p><strong>ÖY</strong> The Kazakhstani government is taking important steps to improve the investment climate of the country. Kazakhstan may attract more foreign investment if the bureaucracy is reduced. China is attracting huge foreign investment as bureaucracy is minimized. For example, the work permit procedures are much more simplified in China. Such measures should not set barriers to investment. Foreign staff should not be perceived as competitors to the local work force. On the contrary, skilled and experienced staff should be seen as an asset for the country and as an opportunity to transfer their skills and knowledge to local employees.</p><h4>What role does your association play in developing the local business environment?</h4><p><strong>DB</strong> AmCham has developed a very strong advocacy voice in recent years that allows us to speak on behalf of our members directly to the Prime Minister. We have specialized working groups composed of CEOs who write policy papers that we present to the Prime Minister and that are then discussed by the Group Chairmen with the relevant ministers. We also organize public conferences with broad attendance by the media on issues such as rule of law and anti-corruption to encourage public discussion of these issues. These conferences involve government ministers and, when they are held in Astana, are broadly attended by the government and diplomatic corps.</p><p><strong>ÖY</strong> KATİAD is playing an important role in introducing new opportunities to its members, conveying their business needs to the relevant authorities, and hence building a bridge between investors and decision makers. It is not only bringing together existing members, but also trying to attract new investors and encourage them to invest in Kazakhstan. In this respect, we are serving as an investment development agency to increase the level of foreign investment in Kazakhstan. We try to develop relationships with other countries' business organizations as well so that their investors benefit from cooperating with the Turkish companies' two decades of experience in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What's the history of the hotel in the city?<br></h4><p><strong>CEM CIRITÇI</strong> We have been here for 13 years. However, we rebranded the hotel and on January 1, 2010 opened our doors as Ramada Plaza Astana. Currently, we are the only Ramada in Kazakhstan. We are a part of the Wyndham Hotel Group, which has more than 7,000 hotels around the world, 900 of which are Ramada hotels. Most of them are in the US and Europe. The group has more than 30 Ramada hotels across Turkey as well.</p><p><strong>GAUKHAR MATKENOVA</strong> The Dostyk Hotel has been operating in the market for 29 years. Its history began in October 1983, when it was decided to open a hotel to accommodate government officials and delegates. While maintaining old traditions and the spirit of history, the Dostyk Hotel found new meaning after the renovation in 2008 through the creation of a model of technological excellence, the development of new facilities, and the implementation of a modern and comfortable interior under the old Dostyk roof.</p><h4>How have the hotel's occupancy rates been?</h4><p><strong>CC</strong> Astana's hospitality industry depends largely on international events and business travellers. MICE tourism is very important in Astana. We see low occupancy levels if there are no international events. However, when there is an event, the capacity of the existing infrastructure sometimes falls short. Having said that, the market depends on international events less and less. In 2011 we did better than 2010. Despite not having big events, our occupancy rate is 36% higher. For food and beverages we are seeing a higher level of demand, including for banqueting and conferences. This shows that something is changing in the city. We also have 80 offices in our building, 95% of which are full now compared to 60% in 2009. In general we have a 40% occupancy rate. We enjoy higher rates than our competitors.</p><p><strong>GM</strong> The occupancy rate is fluctuating nowadays. Of course, there is a clear seasonality factor, including cultural and political events in the city, business activities, and exhibitions. As an average, the occupancy rate of the hotel for recent years has reached 75%, which is a good result in the current market environment.</p><h4>What is the importance of staff training?</h4><p><strong>CC</strong> For us, training is extremely important and only our hotel puts extensive emphasis on it. Not only do we comply with Ramada's international "I am Ramada" training program, we also arrange training particular to our market such as providing our staff with English, Kazakh, and Turkish lessons. We have one training manager, one assistant training manager, and a HR manager who is in charge of staff training. We have training leaders in every department and every week we conduct training for up to seven hours. Our employees are in high demand in the industry, and many of them transfer to other hotels. We also receive hundreds of students as interns. In 2009 we sent 30 of them to our hotel in Antalya for a three-month internship.</p><p><strong>GM</strong> One of the main assets of the hotel is the personnel who work here as a team and always strive for collaboration. This point of our strategy helps us to build a culture with high performance where everyone tends to the same goal: customer satisfaction. This leads not only to the success of the company, but to the success of the team as well. Another beneficial aspect for staff in the hotel industry is training. As time goes by and we face change, learning and acquiring new knowledge is essential. Training programs can help workers keep pace with new trends and changing needs. Mainly, the strength of any HR strategy is based on the creation of a positive working environment where people are motivated to be customer focused, function in a supportive team, and set the principles of integrity, community, and excellence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the idea behind getting into the ship-building industry?<br></h4><p><strong>ÖMER MALAZ</strong> I have always been surrounded by boats­—my family always had boats and I have bought a few myself. After I left university, I worked for our family business. Years after we sold two of the businesses I was directing, I began looking for a new investment. At the time, there was a good example of boat building—Proteksan Turquoise Yachts—that was already building fantastic products in Turkey. I wanted to produce at the same level of quality, but in different sizes. Proteksan Turquoise makes 40-meter plus boats, while we currently build between 17 meters and 40 meters. For two years we did a feasibility study on whether it could be done; whether boats could be built and produced competitively. Once I saw that opportunity, I took it and started Numarine from scratch, and now we are located here in Gebze, near Istanbul. We have a 25,000-sqm indoor production space and we are building between 16 and 20 boats per year of various sizes. Our standard sizes are 55, 68, 78, 102, and 130 feet.</p><p><strong>SONAY GÜNAY</strong> I have been in this business for the last 16 years, and the company was established in 2007. I previously worked for another yacht builder and I discovered at that time that Turkey did not have a brokerage company dealing with yachts over 24 meters, for which different rules and regulations apply. Our aim is to build yachts of over 30 meters for clients from around the world. We evaluate the client's budget and search global shipyards for the right teams to satisfy the buyer. Once we established ourselves, we realized that there was a need for an independent consultant to work between the client and the shipyard. We are a project management and technical consultancy plus a brokerage and charter firm—the bridge between the client and the shipyard.</p><h4>What sets you apart in the competitive global yacht market?</h4><p><strong>ÖM</strong>  We definitely emphasize our design. We are working with some of the best designers in the world, Tommaso Spadolini, Can Yalman, and Umberto Tagliavini. Together they produce what I think is the best in the market at the moment. As newcomers to the market, we have used new technology, working with resin infusion, which results in lighter, stiffer, stronger boats. At end of the day, these are faster and more fuel-efficient.  I always say we are the greener side of a very dirty industry. Our boats are 15% if not 20% more fuel-efficient, and we are about 15% to 20% faster than our competition.</p><p><strong>SG</strong> Yacht building shipyards and regular shipyards are separate things, but in general they are all called builders. There are around 220 shipyards in Turkey, and around 70 of them build yachts between seven and 90 meters in length. We focus on yachts larger than 24 meters. Turkey is lucky in terms of its coastline, yet it is inexperienced in terms of using this resource. We want to educate the population that owning a yacht is much like owning a car. However, having a yacht built is a huge undertaking if you lack experience. We operate between the client and the shipyard and make the process fun for businessmen who are looking to buy yachts. We make our clients' dreams come true.</p><h4>What challenges exist in the luxury yacht sector?</h4><p><strong>ÖM</strong> At the moment, we are building a yacht for a client in Venezuela, one for a client in China, and another one for a client in Brazil, so we are global. The first challenge is the economic condition of the world. The second is the new green movement, which will be very important in the next 15 to 20 years as people become more informed about the environmental impact of boats, yachts, and recycling. All these are going to be major topics in the next 15 years. This isn't driven by the clients, but by incoming regulations.</p><p><strong>SG</strong> I hope that one day we will stop talking about sales by country and begin talking about sales by brands. Our friends at Proteksan Turquoise Yacht produce yachts of the same quality as firms in the Netherlands or Germany, but Turkey has less experience in sales. We want more clients to come and order yachts here and be satisfied. Clients need to realize that when they go to a shipyard and are dissatisfied it does not mean that Turkish boats are generally poor in quality. This can happen in the Netherlands also. We need to know how to market our brands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Autoban developed since you joined the company in 2004?<br></h4><p><strong>EFE AYDAR</strong> Seyhan Özdemir and Sefer Çağlar founded Autoban in 2003, and when I joined the company it was still very small. For one and a half years we focused on small-scale projects. As our work started to get bigger, we began collaborating with corporate brands. Our most important partner was Vakko, which is one of the oldest fashion houses in Istanbul. We worked extremely hard to take advantage of Turkey's growing economy. When we saw that the country was growing, we focused our time and passion on our work. We were in the office seven days a week.</p><h4>What inspired the creation of the NEF brand?</h4><p><strong>ERDEN TİMUR</strong> We saw the need for standardization. You can't have a really good brand if you don't have standardization, and you can't develop your business without standardization. The second gap was design. Developers all over the world really only design the façades and lobbies of their buildings. Yet the product is the place where the customer will spend six and a half hours every day, it is the most expensive product they will ever buy in their lives, and most people will own it for more than 10 years. From a customer point of view, and from my point of view, it should be designed not with regard only to interior design, but with complete product design.</p><h4>What have been some of your favorite projects within Turkey and around the world?</h4><p><strong>EA</strong> In terms of design I like all of them. Emotionally, though, 163 was my first project, and it was the first project that we constructed and the first product we sold. This was the first project for which we received community feedback, and I have an emotional attachment to it because the community really liked it. People here liked it because it was cosmopolitan.</p><h4>What are you working on now?</h4><p><strong>ET</strong> We're constructing an office building that will be the first NEF 5. We won't sell the building; it will be for our portfolio. It will be a landmark building for Istanbul. We're also working on Bebekköy, which is a 68,000 sqm development in Istanbul's Bebek district. The land and existing building once belonged to the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamit, who gave it to the Jesuits. We bought that land and want to restore the buildings as a hotel. We are talking with Aman Resorts, Banyan Tree, Six Senses, and Viceroy. The rest of the 40,000 sqm area we want to donate and open up to Istanbul.</p><h4>What is your company's outlook for the future?</h4><p><strong>EA</strong> We will definitely take on a number of international projects. Today, only one-third of our projects are based abroad; we are usually engaged in six projects in Turkey, and one or two international projects. However, we anticipate the ratio to become more equal in the future, when we will be working very internationally on every continent.</p><p><strong>ET</strong> Our aim is to give back everything that we earn, similar to a non-profit organization. Yes, we are a business, but I do not consider myself the boss. I am a family member who is working for a salary. We don't do profit sharing. We build schools and give them to the Ministry of Education out of the money we earn, because I don't need that kind of money, I only need my salary. So why am I working for that money if I don't need it? My goal is to reach out to 10 million people; that's my goal in life. I don't mean that I want to sell something to 10 million people; I want to help 10 million people. This is part of our aim.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the Turkish pumice mining sector attractive for investors?<br></h4><p><strong>MUSA ERTAÅž</strong> The fact that Turkey has 45% of the world's pumice reserves has greatly enhanced the value of the Turkish mining sector for investors. With an increase in the number of buildings being built, pumice mining is really coming to the fore.</p><h4>How have amended mining regulations in Turkey affected investment?</h4><p><strong>CALVIN MCKEE</strong> The new regulations make it more difficult for companies or investors to acquire mining licenses for "speculation." There are now set timeframes that require companies to prove that legitimate work is taking place to evaluate and advance a property. This is an advantage for companies that are serious about developing new mines in Turkey. There are additional measures that address health, safety, and environmental requirements, and make it more comfortable for international investors to see that Turkey is moving toward international standards in these areas. Although the implementation of the new regulations has not addressed the lack of transparency in the licensing procedures, the most positive outcome of the new mining code, along with various financial incentives put into place by the Turkish government, is that it demonstrates progress.</p><h4>What are your main export markets?</h4><p><strong>ME</strong> We began exports in 2007. We have national distributors in Saudi Arabia, the UK, and the US, and we export pumice and bims blocks to a total of 42 countries. Our export figures and the number of countries we export to increase by the day. Due to the fact that nearly half of all the world's pumice is located in Turkey, our exports are very strong. Pumice is very important for stone washing jeans. That shows how much foreigners are interested in pumice mining in Turkey.</p><h4>What is the significance of Turkey in Alacer Gold's global portfolio?</h4><p><strong>CM</strong> The significance of Turkey is indicated in the company's production statistics. In 2011, approximately 45% of the company's gold production was sourced from a single Turkish mine. We are certainly bullish in terms of further growth within the country, and we continue to add to the resource and reserves at Çöpler. Alacer Gold is actively exploring numerous other properties though joint ventures with several other companies.</p><h4>What role can pumice production play in terms of diversifying Turkish value-added exports and contributing to the Turkish economy overall?</h4><p><strong>ME</strong> The pumice that is extracted from our mines goes through various procedures in our bims block production facilities. It contributes to the Turkish economy in this way. We have also received our National Technical Approval (ITBAK) certificate for our BSB-19 coded product with which we provide heat insulation, thereby ending the need for thermal sheathing. We've begun marketing that product. Now, people don't need to use thermal sheathing when building their structures with average materials. The fact that people are spared unnecessary expenses will contribute greatly to the Turkish economy.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the gold mining industry in Turkey over the medium term?</h4><p><strong>CM</strong> I believe that there will continue to be growth in gold exploration over the next few years. Production will continue at about the same level for the short term, but should begin to grow considerably as more of the large copper and gold projects being explored move into production.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of your products are internationally competitive?<br></h4><p><strong>FADIL DEMİREL</strong> Kardemir is the only rail line producer in Turkey, and among all neighboring countries and the entire Middle East. The Turkish State Railway's (TCDD's) rails are all procured from Kardemir, thereby cutting our country's reliance on imports. Since our first production, we've produced 342,000 tons of rail for TCDD, adding ‚¬200 million to the Turkish economy. In our rail profile mills we produce between 160 mm and 550 mm profiles, making us the sole producer in Turkey and neighboring countries in certain categories. By producing high value-added products, our aim is to contribute to the Turkish economy.</p><h4>What are the main strengths of Turkish steel?</h4><p><strong>NAMIK EKİNCİ</strong> We have a large and growing production capacity. We are 10th among the world's top steel producers and second in Europe. In exports, we hold the seventh position and also became the world leader in the export of reinforcing steel bars. The reason for this success is that we have high-quality products and at the same time can offer very competitive prices, because we're not looking for high profits.</p><h4>What are the most attractive export markets for your company?</h4><p><strong>FD</strong> Our target markets are mainly public and private companies in neighboring countries (Syria, Iran, Iraq), North African countries (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco), Balkan countries, and also now the Brazilian market.</p><p><strong>NE</strong> In three years we will conduct visits to about 30 different countries. Dubai used to be a big importer of Turkish steel, but now with new investments in domestic steel production, demand for Turkish steel has receded and we've sought new markets. We've made trips to Chile, Peru, and Colombia, and we conducted ministerial-level visits and met with importers there. Now, we're looking forward to bringing them to Turkey.</p><h4>After having privatized in 1995, how has Kardemir evolved?</h4><p><strong>FD</strong> After privatization, Kardemir saw rapid growth, having made important investments in innovation, modernization, and other projects, thereby developing its technology base and production capacity. After privatization, Kardemir first built a new steel mill and support energy facilities for the mill, thus changing its steel production process. With this investment, we replaced our Siemens Martin furnaces with Basic Oxygen Converters in 1999. Our annual steel production since privatization went up from 550,000 tons per year to 1 million tons. These new investments have raised our productivity and profit margins.</p><h4>Total Turkish exports were at $134.6 billion last year. What percentage of that did the iron and steel sector contribute?</h4><p><strong>NE</strong> Of that $134.6 billion figure, 11.5% was comprised of steel exports. The steel industry grew by 24% in 2011 over 2010. This year we're aiming to reach an export figure of $17.5 billion, maybe more depending on market conditions. We have been working closely with the Ministry of Economy in placing great emphasis on using domestic raw materials, scrap, iron ore, and alloy products as much as possible so as to reduce our dependency on imports.</p><h4>How much importance does your company place on being environmentally friendly?</h4><p><strong>FD</strong> When producing iron and steel, we carry out improvement work on our existing production facilities, simultaneously carrying out new investments aimed at increasing capacity and product quality. In all projects that aim to increase the performance of our company, we make sure to choose environmentally friendly technologies, and aim to use our resources with as little waste as possible.</p><p><strong>NE</strong> We show great sensitivity to the environment, especially when it comes to carbon emission rates, we are below the European and world average, and we have made big investments so as to counter noxious and hazardous by-products and waste. Many environmentally aware countries place importance on this, to be sure, but we also place great emphasis on this fact, because we are aware that the environment is important in itself, regardless of its benefits to the steel industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How far has Turkcell Superonline come in implementing high-level network infrastructure, and how far do you think you have to go?<br></h4><p><strong>MURAT ERKAN</strong> We are in our fourth year, and have almost reached 30,000 kilometers of fiber optics in Turkey. As a private company, this is amazing. We have reached eight bordering countries. When I started this job, we had a strategy of transforming the Silk Road into the "Fiber Road." In the old days, the Silk Road was a commercial route. Whoever traveled it became increasingly rich. This is now happening to digital highways; they are becoming digital Silk Roads. This is what we are trying to establish, based on Turkey's geographic position. Recently, IDATE, which consults the Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Council on various projects, stated in its "Operators that Lead the World in Fiber Internet" report that Turkcell Superonline has become one of the top-10 global operators of the world. We aim to expand our reach. Accordingly, we have invested in countries in the Middle East, and our Regional Cable Network (RCN) Project will connect Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Jordan, Syria, and Fujairah in the UAE to Turkey. And now we want to reach Europe. Istanbul is becoming an internet capital and exchange hub, and all major internet providers would like to be a part of this infrastructure. In the past, everyone was using submarine cables, but they are not particularly reliable. If something goes wrong, you have to wait at least a month to fully recover services. Yet, with terrestrial lines, such as those from RCN Project Fujairah to Europe, you don't face such problems. We have established an ultra-high capacity 12.8 TB, 7,750-kilometer fiber-optic cable extending from Fujairah to Istanbul, and are continuing to do business with our other neighbors as well.</p><h4>As Turkey's largest independent ADSL provider, how does TurkNet compete with providers backed by large conglomerates?</h4><p><strong>CEM ÇELEBİLER</strong> TurkNet has two foreign private equity backers, and they've been around since 1996. This gives us an edge in a couple of ways; one is that we have focus, so we're purely focused on the telecoms market and on making investments at the right time and in the right way. We're making investments based on each case and on the opportunities in the sector rather than any other parallel agenda. We do a lot of corporate communications—enterprise in addition to residential. We carry a lot of virtual private network (VPN) traffic, such as interoffice traffic for company ordering systems. Dealing with an independent player makes companies feel secure that there is no secondary agenda involved. I think it also lends us credibility, because a lot of conglomerates that have entered this sector over the past couple of years have subsequently left it. They didn't find exactly what they wanted. Since this is the only thing we do, and we've been around since 1996, it is apparent that we are a player that is here to stay. We have a track record of innovation in the sector, and of doing things first. I think that's a matter of focus. When you are only doing one thing, you're able to get things out first and be a faster executor. ICT is a very rapidly changing sector, and this ability to innovate matters.</p><h4>What are some of your company's long-term goals?</h4><p><strong>ME</strong> The telecommunications business itself is an investment business. You cannot stop investing, and that's why we're constantly on the lookout for opportunities. You need to grow organically or inorganically. Two years ago we acquired an alternative operator, called Sabancı Telekom. Recently, we acquired Global Communications. This acquisition enabled Turkcell Superonline to provide services to its customers with more substantial infrastructure, enriching its overall telecoms services, such as cloud computing, data centers, and advanced security solutions. The telecommunications sector is showing signs of consolidation in the next three to five years, which is normal. You cannot have 200 ISP operators in a single country.</p><p><strong>CÇ</strong> When you look at the Istanbul stock exchange (ISE), there are a few companies listed from the ICT sector. The two incumbent companies are listed, but other than that, when you look at comparable markets in Eastern and Western Europe, you see that alternative telecoms operators are also quoted. In Greece, Poland, and France there are some major success stories. Turkey has yet to experience this. We had 40% growth over 2011, and we had close to 60% the year before that. Our projections for this year call for 47% growth. I think 2013 is a realistic date for an IPO.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Doğan Online maintained its position as Turkey's market leader for e-commerce?<br></h4><p><strong>A. YENAL GÖKYILDIRIM</strong> We were one of the first in the market, and that is a big advantage. Another is that we are in almost all internet markets. If you look at our reach, we are almost everywhere, in every industry. Wherever we have entered the market we have become number one or two. From the scale point of view, we have no issues. Of course, there are some niches we need to enter. We have nine companies and 16 brands, so we do a bit of hedging, but we are also quite dominant in certain areas. For example, Hepsiburada.com is the largest e-commerce site in the country, and Messina.com is the number two betting site nationally. Media Net, for digital advertising, is the number one media company in the country with a 40% market share.</p><h4>How has Yemeksepeti been so successful?</h4><p><strong>NEVZAT AYDIN</strong> Our break-even point was in 2005-2006 due to the enormous increase of internet users in Turkey. We found the right product at the right time for people in Turkey—especially in Istanbul. A lot of people are coming to Istanbul and Turkey, and this model works much better in metropolitan areas than rural places. When there are traffic jams, people only have two or three hours to themselves everyday. We work for eight or nine hours, we sleep for eight hours, and traffic takes two to three hours of our lives everyday. People don't want to spend those valuable two or three hours preparing food or washing dishes. We will be talking more and more about delivery in the near future.</p><h4>What trends in digital advertising can you identify?</h4><p><strong>AYG</strong> Technology is helping a lot. More personalized, customized approaches are being refined almost daily. Currently, our tools can support many brands to create an almost personalized advertising space. If we know you are interested in Rolex watches, we can show you Rolex watches next to the magazine you are reading on the internet. On your next visit we can show you where to get that Rolex. The systems are becoming very smart. We can see what you are looking for and direct you to where you can get it.</p><h4>What makes the Turkish e-consumer unique?</h4><p><strong>NA</strong> Turkey is traditionally a very domesticated country, with the housewife cooking and taking care of the family, and the man of the house coming home to eat so the family can eat together. This is changing with more and more women working. Having a hot meal at home everyday is becoming more and more difficult. Eating out is one of the solutions, but so is delivery. When we started in 2001, there were 10 Domino's restaurants in Istanbul, now there are 150. It's not just the big brands like McDonald's and Burger King that deliver any more—all restaurants deliver in Turkey. We do our business in the cross-section of e-commerce and food delivery, two concepts that are constantly growing. We are expecting growth rates of up to 60% in the coming years.</p><h4>What are your most important targeted investments for 2012?</h4><p><strong>AYG</strong> There are a couple. First, Hepsiburada.com is the leading company, and we would like to grow the distance between it and its competitors, so we are investing heavily in those operations in terms of human resources, operations, new offices, and advertising. That is one of our biggest investments. Second, we are investing in new vertical areas to occupy the right fields. For example, this year we opened a home decoration site, Altıncadde.com, and we acquired a home decoration site. Third, we are investing in our technology teams and expanding them.</p><p><strong>NA</strong> We will be everywhere in Turkey. We are in 38 cities already. We were in 23 a year ago, and we plan to be in more than 50 in a year's time. We dominate Turkey—we don't have any competition, so I'm sure that Yemeksepeti.com will be in every city in Turkey one day. Our model is not like Amazon or Turkish home shopping sites such as Markafoni or Hepsiburada. In order to get orders from a city, we have to operate there. We have to have restaurants subscribed there. Right now, when you say "delivery," you hear Yemeksepeti.com. In a couple of years, when you say "food," it will be Yemeksepeti.com.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where did the focus on factoring start?<br></h4><p><strong>HULKİ KARA</strong> Garanti Factoring has a large client base in the commercial, corporate, and SME segments. As of end-2011, we provide services to 3,506 active clients. We meet the needs of our clients through seven regional offices and a corporate portfolio. The first-quarter figures for 2012 have not yet been announced, but our target is to reach double-digit levels in terms of asset size and turnover. We expect the sector's turnover to grow at a rate of around 15%. Our budgeted growth rate this year is 25%, and we strongly believe that we will be able to reach this goal as a result of a new organizational structure and the adoption of an innovative service model.</p><p><strong>BÜLENT ERDOĞAN</strong> I've been in this sector for the past 12 years. Factoring companies were legalized in 1996. I started at Hedef Factoring in 1998, and at that time the sector hadn't yet matured—it was entirely new in Turkey. I started at the lowest rung and climbed up the ladder, learning every detail along the way. I eventually became responsible for the branch network. Our revenue in 2009 was TL550 million. The headquarters were in Ankara, but I was in Istanbul because that's where the biggest share of our market was. After having worked at Hedef for 12 years, I moved on to First Factoring. I've been here for just under a year. I still think factoring isn't done properly in Turkey. There are a lot of factoring companies, but I still think that most of them, maybe around 70%, are not engaging in proper factoring. Our aim is to educate and consult customers about factoring, how it should be done, and what they have to gain from it. We aim to educate our customers while also enabling them to use credit. When marketing to our clients, we explain the advantages of factoring and let them know that if it is used in the right way, factoring can benefit them greatly.</p><h4>What sets you apart in the market from similar factoring offerings?</h4><p><strong>HK</strong> The competition is fairly tough in the factoring segment. To stand out among this competition is to meet the needs of your clients by providing a high-quality service and offering the right set of products and solutions at the right speed. Given the tough competition, the potential of the sector is promising. The penetration rate, which is calculated based on the proportion of the sector's turnover in relation to GDP, is 10% in most European countries. In Turkey, penetration has reached 7%. This figure shows that there is a long way to go in the development of the factoring sector, and innovative companies with a sound financial structure as well as fast service processes will have a competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>BE</strong> We first of all place an emphasis on educating and training our own personnel about factoring, and then transferring this knowledge to our clients, depending on how those clients are prepared to use our services. We always aim to provide the best possible service. We believe that every company we extend credit to is our partner. We look at the situation from the point of view of a partner because our money is also involved in the client's company. That way there's a healthy symbiosis.</p><h4>What are your targets?</h4><p><strong>HK</strong> Although we envisage growth in the sector, I believe that 2012 will be a tough year. The recent and accelerated discussions regarding the new Factoring Law will be positive in terms of the image and development of the sector. Sector players have been making significant efforts to cooperate with the National Factoring Association, and the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) has provided the right support. We hope that the outcome will be in line with the expectations of the sector. The company aims to achieve 25% growth in total turnover and to expand its market share within the SME sector. We also work toward the development of the international factoring business and the expansion of the customer base.</p><p><strong>BE</strong> We aim to increase our revenues further—and in a healthy way—and we're succeeding. First Factoring is in a great place now. We have no problematic credits, and we're aiming to be among the top 10 factoring companies in the next two to three years. We've also trained our personnel in this respect. We're always active and in the field, not just sitting here in our offices. We are organically involved with our client firms. We're also one of the only factoring firms to base the credit we extend on inspections of the companies that our clients work with.</p><h4></h4>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company sought to position itself in Turkey's insurance market?<br></h4><p><strong>LEVENT ÅžİÅžMANOĞLU</strong> In the past eight months, the non-life insurance industry has grown by about 21%, nominally. I say nominally because there was a huge depreciation of the Turkish lira against the euro and the US dollar in 2011, and we saw huge growth in non-life premiums, while life insurance has always grown at a greater rate than the non-life industry. This non-life growth has mainly come from agricultural businesses that have shown great interest in insurance in 2011. Other main growing sectors include the auto and engineering lines of business, followed by cargo lines.</p><p><strong>GÖKHAN GÜRCAN</strong> Acıbadem Sigorta is a unique company due to its organizational and shareholder structure. It is an insurance company operating only in the health, life, and personal accident segments. It is also unique as it is part of the strong Acıbadem Healthcare Group. Despite these positive factors, we have also faced challenges. Over the last few years, we have operated at a loss due to severe price competition. Premium levels were one of the most important indicators of a company's value. However, a company's value is measured by its profitability. In the last half of 2010 and over 2011, the rules of the game have started to change. We have reshaped our pricing, governance, and sales methodology.</p><h4>What is behind growth in the sector?</h4><p><strong>LÅž</strong> Increasing awareness in the agricultural sector has been important. We expect the Turkish economy to grow around 4.5% or 5% in 2012, in real terms. The non-life segment grew at a rate higher than GDP, which made a huge difference. This was due to the low penetration of insurance premiums and insurance policies. Turkey has a big population, but per capita income is only around $10,000. The distribution of income is the main indicator of insurance volume. Any growth in the real economy should not go mainly toward the high-income groups. It should be distributed over the lower and medium classes as well, so that we can achieve a substantial growth level in the insurance business. If we achieve better distribution of our service to the lower-income groups, then we can expect huge growth in both non-life and life insurance premiums.</p><h4>What portion of your portfolio is comprised of large companies?</h4><p><strong>GG</strong> Around 75% of our portfolio is represented by large companies, including banks and other large institutions. In fact, most banks that do not have their own insurance companies use our services. We have a unique company, and we have implemented a corporate efficiency program for our corporate customers. I have made it clear that I do not wish to increase the volume of premiums as it doesn't affect profitability levels. The only thing to do is increase efficiency on our side and on the client's side. Our strategy with large clients is to keep the level of claims under control. If coverage is enlarged, then the client will start to pay more in the future due to the higher levels of claims.</p><h4>The Van earthquake highlighted a lack of home insurance. How can this challenge be tackled?</h4><p><strong>LÅž</strong>  First of all, there is a 30% penetration rate for compulsory earthquake policies for houses, out of the insurable total. Of course, the rate reflects more financed housing, because banks and financial institutions request this insurance. In eastern parts of Turkey, penetration is low, at around 9%, which is far below the average in Turkey. Making insurance obligatory is not the way to increase penetration. It is instead a matter of income distribution. Only when people in that region have a TL25,000 yearly income can we expect them to pay a TL500 annual premium. This is the major issue.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the future?</h4><p><strong>GG</strong> Our target is to be number one in the health branch of the insurance sector. In 2010 the number of provisions totaled 1 million, and so we are quick, thanks to the concentrated nature of our organization. This will allow us to be number one in the upcoming five years. In 2012 we will increase our premium level by 30%, and on the individual policy side we want to take a step forward and double premium levels. We hope to close with TL45 million on that side in 2010, with our target for 2012 set at over TL90 million. In order to create a sustainable company, we need, according to my belief, even more individual policy holders on the books.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what extent can NGOs and INGOs contribute to shaping international issues and meet the needs of society?<br></h4><p><strong>AHMET EYÜP ÖZGÜÇ</strong> It is impossible to overestimate the importance of NGOs and INGOs in addressing international issues. NGOs play a significant role in the making of international policies. NGOs have immensely contributed to sustainable development at the international level. Governmental organizations are not sufficient in shaping international policies, as there are also other factors besides governmental organizations such as NGOs and INGOs. NGOs represent societies as governments do. NGOs are a part of society. Therefore  they can be close to the needs of society, and international policies need to be shaped by the wants and needs of society.</p><p><strong>AKKAN SUVER</strong> This is the century of information, but I foresee that the coming years will be focused on the growth of NGOs. These organizations do not change, whereas governments are constantly shifting and evolving. The Marmara Foundation works in many areas and organizes platforms for an academic council and a think-tank designed for brainstorming. There are many NGOs in Turkey, but they are often geared toward one, simple goal. However, whether we are dealing with women and children's activities or the fight against illness, we take the same stand. There is no other international organization that works in so many different ways in Turkey, and that means that we have gained greater recognition from the UN and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p><h4>What role does social media play in the strategy of the Istanbul World Political Forum (IWPF) to create international political dialogue?</h4><p><strong>AEÖ</strong> Social media plays a crucial role in IWPF's strategy to create international political dialogue. At IWPF 2012, social media was utilized very effectively. In order to homogenously reach international society, we believe that social media is a crucial tool. We believe in the power of social media on politics. The only thing that gathered all the revolutionaries in the streets of Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, Greece, and even the US was social media. Likewise the only thing that governments and dictators cannot stop is social media. At IWPF, we have focused on building a new world this year. We believe that building a new world is not just a duty of politicians; a new world needs to be built by society and the public itself. The most effective way to reach and awaken society is to use social media.</p><h4>How would you characterize the social developments across the different regions of Turkey?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> There are problems in the southeast region of the country, which is underdeveloped. At the Marmara Foundation, we seek to end the difference between the East and West in Turkey. In some areas, such as the hydro industry, there have been immediate developments. For example, in Adıyaman, Urfa, and Gaziantep, we have seen rapid changes. There are people living in very good conditions, but there are still a number of problems. We have political problems and ethnic conflicts, which is a major handicap for the country. If the government works hard, there will be gradual progress and comprehensive changes.</p><h4>What is the significance of IWPF 2012 for Turkey?</h4><p><strong>AEÖ</strong> We live in a dramatically changing world; the old ideologies that have dominated the last century do not provide solutions to the new challenges we face. They are not relevant in the age of global competition, abrupt technological advances, the revolution of the role of women, new environmental threats, and widespread demand for a fairer global order. I believe IWPF 2012 can be the starting point to overcome issues beyond borders.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Turkey in the next five years in terms of its foreign relations?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> The development of my country is very strong economically, but if we grow only in this area, we will face huge problems. If we develop our country, Greece, Romania, Azerbaijan, and Syria will take a share of this wealth. In the age of globalized economies, we are experiencing increased interconnectivity. This is part of my idea to develop together and share the wealth. The idea of Turkey going ahead alone is not sufficient, and collaboration is my ideal.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Turkey for your business?<br></h4><p><strong>METE İKİZ</strong> NBGI was originally established as a private equity (PE) and a venture capital (VC) Fund in London in 1999. The original idea was to establish a small fund of ‚¬100 million with which to make private equity investments in SMEs in the UK market, which was launched in June 2000. The UK Fund was quite successful with its investments, and the dedicated UK team was able to raise a second Fund of £100 million in 2007. The Emerging Europe team was established around five years ago, mainly focusing on Southeastern Europe (SEE). NBGI's Emerging Europe team today manages ‚¬300 million in committed and invested funds. Given the importance of the Turkish market in the SEE region, the Istanbul office was established in 2008. In addition to the Western European strategy, which includes the UK and France, and the Emerging Europe strategy, NBGI also manages a SEE-focused real estate Fund of ‚¬80 million and a technology VC Fund investing only in medical equipment companies in Europe with ‚¬120 million under management. NBGI's funds in total manage ‚¬900 million. We think that Turkey is by far the most important market in the SEE region, owing to its very dynamic and entrepreneurial population of 76 million people. Turkish companies are utilizing this advantage to penetrate into the region—including the Balkans, North Africa, the Middle East, and the former Soviet republics—and Turkey is strategically located as a base. Our strategy is to invest in SMEs and help them become regional powers.</p><p><strong>SELÇUK YORGANCIOĞLU</strong> Turkey is a very important part of our geography and the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia region. We have already established operations in Asia, and now we're seeking to expand further into global emerging markets. With the inclusion of Aureos Capital in the Abraaj Group, we have 150 companies in our portfolio in geographies starting from Latin America, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Central Asia. Currently, we manage over $6 billion in assets, with approximately 350 people on our payroll drawn from 36 nationalities; we are a very diverse group. Turkey is one of our largest countries by GDP, differentiating itself with stability in comparison to the rest of the emerging markets and also Europe. This is a result of a single government implementing a very healthy fiscal and monetary policy in terms of the financial markets, as well as very disciplined political behavior both domestically and internationally. This is the root of the stability we've enjoyed in Turkey. The year 2011 was successful for Abraaj Capital, and we owned five well-established companies in the country. By the beginning of 2012, we were able to exit four of them, and our ability to implement an exit strategy in this market demonstrates the health of the economy and the political system in Turkey. This move also shows that we are able to select the right partners and corporates; we're very pleased. Turkey is located in a very unique location, with access to Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Southern Europe. We expect Turkey's importance to grow even more in the coming years.</p><h4>How will the new Commercial Code help the private equity industry in Turkey?</h4><p><strong>Mİ</strong> Initially, people may be confused because the existing code dates back to 1958, which makes it very outdated for today's fast changing business world. The new one obliges companies to incorporate many new elements, such as having at least two independent board members. This is an extremely different approach for Turkish companies, especially for SMEs that are family owned. Previously, families were making the business decisions in the companies, but now they are obliged under penalty of law to have two independent board members influencing the decision-making process.</p><h4>How would you characterize the appetite for foreign investment in Turkey?</h4><p><strong>SY</strong> The awareness of Turkish companies has increased significantly over the past seven or eight years, and we expect demand for our services to continue growing. Turkey boasts one of the best-regulated markets globally, with a very well-functioning Capital Markets Board and stock exchange, as well as a fast and diligent competition board. These are key for strategic merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) transactions. The banking regulator is very cooperative, and these factors combined make Turkey a safe and easy environment for strategic investors to operate in. This explains the sizeable appetite of foreign investment in Turkey over the past few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the bank adjust its strategy in the wake of the global liquidity crisis?<br></h4><p><strong>GALİP TÖZGE</strong> Of course, looking at the past decade, things have been very dynamic. The circumstances in Turkey were much tougher in 2002 than they are now. What the management board forecasted correctly 10 years ago was the country's potential, declining interest rates, and lower inflation. They changed the whole structure of the bank and the strategy for capturing the potential for growth.</p><p>Today, looking at current circumstances and into the next decade, the vision has not changed. Turkey still has vast potential in terms of the banking industry. I think we will continue to exercise the same strategy to capture growth in our sector over the next decade.</p><p><strong>CARLO VIVALDI</strong> At the end of 2011, the liquidity stress from Europe created a ripple effect in Turkey, which was handled very well by the Central Bank, and the country was protected from external shocks. As soon as the liquidity situation is under control in Europe, the pressure in Turkey will dissipate. We were the first bank in nine months to issue a new syndicated bond on the international market, issuing $500 million in February 2012. Since then, there have been many other international transactions; Akbank rolled over a syndication, and VakıfBank will do the same. We are looking to roll over a $1.2 billion syndication in April 2012.</p><h4>Which segments within Turkey's banking sector have the most potential for growth?</h4><p><strong>GT</strong> If you compare our penetration rates to those in other countries, Turkey's banking sector still has very high growth potential. The total penetration of pension plans in Turkey is almost 1.3% of GNP; in most other benchmark countries it is at least 20%-30%. On the other hand, the mortgage sector has been growing by almost 25% annually. If you take the 2008 crisis into account, the mortgage book in Turkey is now worth 6% of GNP, and mortgages are still an affluent product. There are still low penetration rates in consumer deposits, personal loans, car loans, and banking services for SMEs—a sector with huge potential. Today, the portion of credit going to SMEs is very low, but 94% of companies in Turkey are SMEs. The country is young and very entrepreneurial. New companies are being formed every day. The savings market will also be an important growth area in coming years. In order to have a sustainable banking sector and reduce our current account deficit, an increase in savings is critical. Investment in Turkey is 22% of GNP, but savings is only 12%. That means almost half of investment must be financed by outside resources.</p><h4>As the market leader in Turkey for credit cards, how would you characterize the development of the sector?</h4><p><strong>CV</strong> The credit card business is not one that was born recently; people have been using cards for more than two decades. The inflationary environment of the country in the past triggered the development of payment systems. Buying goods today and paying tomorrow is the essence of credit cards, and that was an advantage during the inflationary period. Today, customer exposure to this product is high, but the risks are lower than in the past. The rates are more stable and enjoy a cap, which is 2.2% per month. In the past, rates were hovering at 5%; but now the market is much more regulated than before.</p><h4>What role does technology play in your growth strategy?</h4><p><strong>GT</strong> Today, two-thirds of Turkish households have internet access at home. There are 31 million Facebook users, 4 million Twitter accounts, and almost 10 million mobile internet users. We are using alternative delivery channels to reach this technology-oriented, high-growth nation. We invest a lot. Akbank spends almost $100 million on the average every year on technology, with new channels, products, and offers.</p><p><strong>CV</strong> The average age of the population is 29 years, and young people are eager to adopt innovations. For Yapı Kredi, the innovative and limitless products are an integral part of our structure. By end-2011, we had launched our new mobile banking program, which boosted our share in that market by more than 20%. We want to be the frontrunner in innovation, but we are not the only player; the market is extremely saturated with internet and mobile users and developers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the aim of your bank's presence in the Turkish market?<br></h4><p><strong>MUZAFFER AKSOY</strong> Our main mission is to finance trade between MENA and Europe, and that is why we are in Turkey. We help Turkish and European exporters, importers, and contractors in the region. If we look at it like a triangle with MENA, Europe, and Turkey, the latter should be within this framework as a trade finance hub. On the other side, the market is offering not only trade finance, but project finance and Islamic finance, or "participation banking" opportunities. ABC has a bank called ABC Islamic Bank, which is active in the sphere of Islamic finance, and we are also active in the Turkish market, particularly working with the participation banks.</p><p><strong>NEZİH AKALAN</strong> It has been almost six years since we inaugurated our representative office in Turkey. We are mainly cooperating with our corresponding Turkish banks in the way that we provide them cash and non-cash financing facilities. On the non-cash side, we confirm their letters of guarantee and letters of credit toward Qatar, the UAE, and Kuwait, which, at the end of the day, reduces the commissions Turkish companies have to pay and enhance their capacity to assume new projects. These transactions currently compose the majority of our business. Doha Bank has become the home bank of all Turkish companies doing business and developing projects in Qatar. We have built up a fruitful relationship over the years of mutual trust. Once Turkish companies opened offices in Qatar, they were able to apply for credit—cash and non-cash—and we rendered them new facilities and services to finance their projects. We signed agreements to pay worker salaries through our branches and internet banking products. Doha Bank is the most advantageous and innovative bank in retail products and in trade finance in Qatar.</p><h4>What is the nature of your relationship with participation banks in Turkey?</h4><p><strong>MA</strong> We already arrange many syndicated facilities for Turkish banks like Bank Asya, Türkiye Finans, and alBaraka. These are the big syndicated facilities together with a few international banks like Standard Chartered and HSBC. These are the big-ticket sizes—we are talking about $200 million to $400 million. Now we are talking through two deals: one for Türkiye Finans, the other for Bank Asya. Most probably in September 2012 we will do a new one for alBaraka, and then the second option is sukuk facilities. The sukuk is a new instrument for the Turkish market, and the government has changed certain regulations that will help us issue a new sukuk. We are expecting to issue one for a participation bank in September 2012. Although we don't have the mandate as yet, I hope to obtain it soon.</p><h4>What are the greatest opportunities Turkey offers to foreign investors?</h4><p><strong>NA</strong> Since Turkey does not have many worldwide brands, we have to work on promoting projects from the country to attract investment. Turkey is an industrial country, where all the sectors are represented, and it can provide a lot of opportunities for Qatari companies. For example, we could promote the establishment of Qatari companies on Turkish soil—there should be designated areas, industrial zones with special emigration policies, and taxation policies. Particularly Qatari or other GCC companies can also produce from here, just to cover their needs or to sell to other countries as well. Turkey is a perfect location because it offers the side sectors needed to develop industrial activity. For example, we can see opportunities in the iron and steel, nutrition industries, mining, and agricultural sectors. We can widely enlarge this list, but for this to happen, we need to offer investors a whole package and there has to be some government promotion as well. The options are there, we have the educated people, plenty of production sources, and developed side sectors for diversified industries. However, we have to be proactive and put them on the table. On the other hand, we can play an important role in the energy distribution channels as a natural bridge between the energy producing countries and the consuming countries like Europe due to Turkey's strategic location on the map. Turkey is luckily located in the middle of the main natural gas and petroleum producer countries in the world, particularly the largest natural gas reserves of the world like Russia, Iran, and Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the company's operations progressed in Mexico?<br></h4><p><strong>CARLOS GOTTFRIED</strong> Potencia Industrial started manufacturing in 1958, incentivized by a state policy promoting national integration and national manufacturing. That was at a time when the government had a plan for Mexico to become an industrial-based economy through strong investment and subsidy programs. My father and his brother, the founding members of the company, made the decision to start manufacturing in their garage. In just a few years, the company expanded and was engaged in vertical integration, from lamination to assembling. From its beginning, Potencia Industrial has shown a deep level of flexibility and creativity driven by the best Mexican electrical engineers at the time, becoming the first company to locally develop a wind turbine in 1974, the "Hummingbird," the world's first direct-drive permanent magnetic generator. The coming together of strong know-how and experience with flexibility, creativity, and commitment has been the key ingredient for our achievements.</p><p><strong>GILBERTO SOUSA</strong> Our operations here are growing considerably. We have increased our market share for instrument transformers to over 25%, almost 30%. We are also introducing new product lines such as recloser units, relays, and various other components. Right now we are competing against the major players in the market such as Siemens, Schneider, and Alstom. We're competing on a global level, and not just in Mexico. The competition is tough and right now we are competing at a higher level than we ever have. Our product range is broader than it has ever been.</p><h4>From which sectors do you receive demand?</h4><p><strong>CG</strong> Traditionally, the company was set up to supply the industrial sector and the OEM market as a compressor, pump, and machinery manufacturer. Para-state companies were some of our main customers until the opening up of the borders, when such clients started to purchase electric motors and generators from abroad. After losing our market quotas in those segments, we decided to expand our customer portfolio. Now we sell to the industrial, oil and gas, and renewable energy sectors.</p><p><strong>GS</strong> We have introduced new product lines in Mexico over the last two or three years, and the demand for these products has grown impressively. It depends not only on the product that we manufacture, but on what the market demands. We sell products to the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), and also to companies for industrial applications. Sales of the recloser, a type of circuit breaker, have grown over 300% in the last two years alone. This is also our first year in metal clad applications. We thought we were going to sell around 200 sections, and we ended up making 350 sections in the last year. We expect to keep on growing. Our growth will see a reduction in our reliance on orders from the CFE. We want to rely more on electro-intensive industries including companies involved in steel, paper, cement, and oil and gas production. We're already in those sectors with our traditional products, such as capacitor banks and filter banks.</p><h4>What is your strategy going forward?</h4><p><strong>CG</strong> Our strategy is to remain in the renewables sector, particularly servicing the wind and hydro turbine segments. We want to expand our penetration in these segments. These markets are still developing and require higher efficiency products, and we have all the capabilities to improve our presence in them.</p><p><strong>GS</strong> We develop products that are custom made for specific applications. We develop products that we believe are the most effective possible for each industry. For example, we have products that go directly into drilling platforms and other similar areas. We always strive to be different from the competition. We want to offer something innovative to the customer that can bring the best results. We are completely customer driven.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why is Mexico a strategic location for your company?<br></h4><p><strong>MIGUEL ÁNGEL ALONSO RUBIO</strong> In terms of renewable energy, Mexico has huge potential. Concerning wind energy, the country has a 71,000-MW plant factor, and the plants installed in the territory register a performance of 20% above the average, which means that Mexico is one of the most attractive countries in the world to produce electricity through wind energy. In terms of solar energy, the average solar radiation reading stands at 5.5 kW per sqm. With these conditions you can easily produce electricity using photovoltaic panels across almost the entire country. Biomass development is also very attractive as well. In Mexico, many crops are cultivated and that produces a high amount of agricultural residue. Frankly, you can produce electricity from these and create a network of small producers and centrals. Hydro energy is also interesting in Mexico, especially if you combine hydro-energy production technology with photovoltaic and wind technology.</p><p><strong>ADRIAN KATZEW CORENSTEIN</strong> Vestas has made an extremely significant investment in computational power estimates. We have one of the largest supercomputers in the world dedicated to simulating weather and wind patterns. We've recently released this technology, so it's state of the art. Basically, it collects variables that can be observed, such as topography, temperature, and pressure, and through the use of an algorithm it simulates the wind as a function of those conditions. We have used that technology in Mexico to see where there is strong potential for wind energy, and we have performed our own assessment on the potential of the market. If we can simulate wind potential and know how much it costs to build a project, then we can actually know how much it costs to generate wind power. Our conclusion is that Mexico holds a vast potential for wind power, well beyond what is currently planned. In the medium to short term, Mexico could install 10 GW to 20 GW that would be cost competitive with other forms of generation.</p><h4>Is Latin America increasing in importance for your companies' global operations?</h4><p><strong>MAR</strong> The opportunities for the development of renewable energies in Latin America are enormous, and particularly in Mexico as a result of its geographical position, weather conditions, and natural resources. The general business environment also complements its attractive renewable energy potential. The government is also promoting this sector, and the consideration of the importance of renewables is starting to get a huge audience in the country. The aim seems to be to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels, and that is equating into superb potential. This company wants to be involved in the development of renewable energies across Latin America.</p><p><strong>AKC</strong> In 2011, the majority of our new growth came from emerging markets, with Latin America playing a very strong role, as well as Asia and India. The two markets that are strategic for us are Brazil and Mexico. Brazil has issued a large number of tenders to purchase different sources of power generation, such as hydro, gas, and wind. Wind has been the technology that has won the largest share, at roughly several gigawatts of power over the past few years, and we expect that trend to continue in Brazil. Mexico has also been an attractive market owing to the Oaxaca projects, with the open season and the self-producer market. There is a different dynamic in Mexico, which is why we're collaborating so much in the sector. In Brazil, there is a mechanism that is perceived to be stable, and that allows for the market to continue in that mode. We have been successful so far because we have a large infrastructure project built in Oaxaca that has the potential to interconnect projects, but there will need to be further investments in infrastructure to interconnect additional megawatts and continue our activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Mexico in your global strategy?<br></h4><p><strong>LUIS ALEJANDRO MORENO</strong> Mexico is the fourth biggest producer of Continental tires. We also produce many other supplies related to the automotive industry. Continental has 164,000 employees worldwide and 15,000 are located in Mexico—almost 10%. In terms of volume, Continental is a leader in the Mexican tire market. We have around 20% market share. Mexico represents the production of 5 million tires annually for our group, and we are fifth in the world in terms of volume.</p><p><strong>DANIEL BENVENUTI</strong> Bridgestone Mexico is very important. It represents around 20% of the company's total business in Latin America. We have five plants in Latin America, and Bridgestone Mexico boasts one of the most productive facilities in the region. We also produce in Costa Rica, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina. At this time, Bridgestone, as a group, is studying different possibilities to add more plants to the mix according to demand in each country. We look forward to increasing our participation not only in the passenger and light truck segments, but also to gain a deeper participation in other segments.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in the industry?</h4><p><strong>LAM</strong> We still have a lot of opportunities regarding labor relationships, because there is a strong union movement in Mexico, which limits us with a buy-low contract from the 1930s. We need to modernize the relationship with our unions. Another challenge is the import of products of doubtful quality, or from origins that don't have transparent economies. Local governments are using resources to subsidize their production, creating unbalanced competition worldwide. We, as the Rubber Chamber of Mexico, are putting a lot of information in the hands of the authorities in order to receive protection. We don't want to close the market, but we want fair competition. The third challenge for us is a little bit shocking—we receive a lot of second-hand tires. It's unacceptable and dangerous for the health of people using the products and in terms of the environment. It's also creating mafias, because the tires are not entering the market in a formal way. There is a quota of legal used tires imported into Mexico. There aren't really any regulations, there are just quotas. Used tires entering the market legally in Mexico are waste. This is the main issue we attack.</p><p><strong>DB</strong> At the beginning of 2011 commodities and raw materials prices increased drastically. For example, synthetic and natural rubber prices increased by 60%. And, of course, as a consequence of that, tire prices also increased. We are constantly trying to reduce our production costs, but in such a situation we are not left with much choice.</p><h4>What are the main products your company supplies?</h4><p><strong>LA</strong><strong></strong><strong>M</strong> We produce air bags, tachometers, radios, brake systems, electric bands for power transmissions, and hoses for various uses such as air conditioning. There are some German car brands that are 35% made by Continental. We have a great portfolio now, and manufacture parts for Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Worldwide, our product range is so important that we can build large portions of a car. In Mexico we are supplying parts for every car manufacturer operating here, such as Ford and Volkswagen.</p><h4>Bridgestone's plant in Cuernavaca was recently commended for its energy saving practices. What makes it unique?</h4><p><strong>DB</strong> Our main target is to permanently reduce costs and waste. For that reason we decided to start with the substitution of lamps. Normally, we use 400 W lamps that consume a lot of energy. We then decided to replace them with new energy-saving lamps, which drastically reduced our energy consumption. In addition, we have installed solar panels that help in production activities as well as in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. All of these environmentally friendly actions are aimed not only at reducing the negative effect of our production on the environment, but also at positively affecting our productivity while reducing costs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize your presence in the local market?<br></h4><p><strong>JUAN CARLOS MARROQUÍN</strong> We have pioneered many new development models in Mexico, as well as several network partnerships and programs, showing our strong commitment to this country. Because of its geographic location, connectivity with its neighbors and positive demographics, Mexico is a strategic market for Nestlé as well as for any global company that wants to expand its presence in the Americas. Also, the political and economic stability of the country are two crucial elements that make Mexico attractive for our company.</p><p><strong>PEDRO PADIERNA</strong> We have been present in the country for more than 100 years. We began with the Pepsi beverage and later we began to acquire many kinds of businesses. We also bought food companies, such as Sabritas and Doritos. We cover a great number of brands—from soft drinks to water, and from snacks to nutritious products. We are present in every corner of Mexico.</p><h4>What level of investment is Nestlé looking to make in Mexico, and what areas will receive the most attention?</h4><p><strong>JCM</strong> We maintain very high investment rates in order to remain competitive in the market. Nestlé Mexico is presently known as the best company in the food and beverage sector, and is recognized as a leading company in nutrition, health, and wellness. Competitiveness is a crucial factor for the development of every business, and we focus strongly on the competitiveness of our products. We want to maintain our leadership in the sectors we are involved in, and we can do this by investing in technology, improving industrial processes, and reducing the environmental impact of our production.</p><h4>What has PepsiCo done in order to transform its portfolio in Mexico?</h4><p><strong>PP</strong> Over the years, we have worked in many different areas. For example, we have substantially reduced the amount of sodium in our products. We studied the size of a grain of salt and how that affected the flavor. You need only 30% salt to deliver a taste boost. We have created micro graining technology that allows us to use less salt, but maintain the same taste. We are also using more and more baked products. We have stopped using trans-fats completely. Instead, some positive additives to our foods include fiber and fruit.</p><h4>What are some of your objectives in Mexico?</h4><p><strong>JCM</strong> The first objective is to increase Nestlé's global business, which means that we should generate a sustainable organic growth rate between 5% and 6% annually. We can achieve this through our strategic development plan that focuses on improving our brand penetration and talent pool. We are also very interested in rural development because it is related to our business. Therefore, the second target is to improve general production capabilities and increase the quality of our agribusiness activities. The third target is to be perceived by the consumer as a world leader in nutrition. Our last goal is to address sustainability concerns in all areas of our agribusiness processes.</p><p><strong>PP</strong> The first program that we implemented was with corn. Corn as a commodity had a stable price, but its quality was unpredictable. We were forced to take whatever corn was available. So we decided to select a community in Guadalajara. We wanted to propose the same basis with hybrid seeds and a technical package. This community had the idea of growing corn, but didn't know how to do it. They had no access to credit, but through intermediaries they received microfinancing. The program has been a tremendous success. Growth rates have risen from 2.5 tons per hectare to approximately six tons per hectare. We have 240 growers, and they have become almost like a cooperative.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors do you see driving demand for polyethylene in Mexico, and what type of increase do you expect in the short term?<br></h4><p><strong>ROBERT BISCHOFF</strong> Generally when GDP grows by 2% or 3%, demand for polyethylene grows 1.5 times more. GDP growth and per capita income are the main drivers, because the key applications for such products are related to everyday objects; almost every single piece of packaging is made of polyethylene. If people have more money they will buy more products. These are the key drivers of plastics. Considering the economics of Mexico, we foresee an average annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%. That is an important level of growth.</p><h4>Do you think Mexico's petrochemical sector has a competitive advantage over other Latin American countries?</h4><p><strong>RAíšL BAZ HARVILL</strong> It used to be that oil and gas were coupled in terms of price, but with the advent of technology enabling the release of shale gas, they have become more independent. Here in Mexico, we have an excess production of ethane. Ethane that isn't used for the production of petrochemicals is turned into natural gas for domestic use. The result is that the price of natural ethane is equal to the price of natural gas, which is around $3.5 per million BTU. We have a very competitive base compared to someone who has a naphtha cracker and is paying around $16 per million BTU.</p><h4>How important is the Ethylene XXI project in terms of Braskem Idesa's overall operations?</h4><p><strong>RB</strong> This is the largest petrochemical industrial project in the Americas in the past two decades; by far the largest project the company has ever undertaken. We have participated in larger, integrated complexes in Brazil, but they were built in two separate stages. In the past, to have 1.2 million tons of production, we had to start with half of that capacity and then wait eight to 10 years until the market grew to implement the second stage. To have one line and one single project producing this much is clearly our largest endeavor, and represents a very important investment for Braksem Idesa and for Mexico.</p><h4>What would you propose to improve the sector's performance?</h4><p><strong>RBH</strong> PEMEX supplies the overwhelming majority of raw materials for the petrochemical industry, and PEMEX Petroquí­mica, which produces those materials, has not significantly expanded in the last few years. In the past 11 years, its only new projects have been a polyethylene plant in Morelos and a styrene plant in La Cangrejera, which is scheduled to open in early 2012. In the meantime it has shut other plants down, and so the source of raw materials is not there. That's the problem.</p><h4>What are the end uses of the low-density and high-density polyethylene you produce?</h4><p><strong>RB</strong> Low-density polyethylene is generally produced as a film, composing any flexible bag imaginable. High-density polyethylene is also used for flexible bags. For example, supermarket shopping bags are made of high-density plastics, but it is more commonly used in rigid packaging, like yogurt containers and piping applications (excluding PVC). You cannot differentiate the two by sight; the differentiation is determined by the final application.</p><h4>What are Grupo Petroquí­mico Beta's goals for the future?</h4><p><strong>RBH</strong> There's going to be an expansion of ethylene oxide production by PEMEX, and we want to make the most of that. We have the capability to manufacture from commodities to specialties. When it comes to raw materials, you have to use them or lose them. Our plan is to buy as much ethylene oxide as possible so as to be able to manufacture specialties in the market. We are a very research-oriented company with an excellent R&amp;D laboratory—one of the best in Mexico—and we dedicate 4% of annual revenue to R&amp;D. We've been awarded several grants from Conacyt. All of our plant managers are required to have an R&amp;D background, so we can go from the lab to full-scale production in seven days. That's usually not easy. Our objective is to ultimately become the major player in the specialty field in Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Mexico represent for your global operations?<br></h4><p><strong>RÉAL GERVAIS</strong> Bombardier Mexico became a very important link in our company's supply chain, and we are now providing parts for almost every product line. For example, we are manufacturing the electrical harness for almost all of our business and commercial aircraft. Electrical harness manufacturing has now become the center of excellence for our operations in Mexico. We are also supplying components for a number of other product lines.</p><p><strong>FRÉDÉRIC GARCÍA</strong> Mexico is a strategic country for EADS. For five years, we have been working toward our 2020 strategy outside of Europe, and the key countries are emerging nations. Mexico is one of these up-and-coming economies. We are selling all the products of the EADS group, and the main drivers of the company are increasing job creation, sourcing, and investing in manufacturing. In this regard, Airbus and Eurocopter are the parts of the business that have the most potential for growth.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the aerospace industry in the country?</h4><p><strong>RG</strong> The aerospace industry in Mexico has shown incredible growth in the past years. According to the Mexican Federation of the Aerospace Industry (FEMIA) and the Secretariat of Economy, the aerospace industry exported $3.4 billion in 2010 and $4.5 billion in 2011, which represents  growth of more than 25%. This parameter shows that it is highly likely the industry will continue to develop and attract other aerospace companies to the country. An industry of this caliber takes a long time to develop and requires partnerships with governments. An international company such as Bombardier has to make large investments in technology, training, and research, as well as manufacturing facilities. When Bombardier establishes itself in other countries, it values the commitment of the government in terms of infrastructure, certification, and training, which are the essential pillars of the aerospace industry. Bombardier Aerospace honors a long-term commitment in Mexico. We recently announced a new investment of $50 million to manufacture the aft fuselage for the new Global 7000 and 8000 business jets at our Querétaro facility. In a few months, we will start the construction of our fourth building for this program, and the new work package will generate 400 jobs. These jobs will add to the existing 1,800-person workforce already in place at the site.</p><h4>What competitive advantages does Mexico offer as a manufacturing base?</h4><p><strong>FG</strong> Mexico is a large market for Airbus, Eurocopter, Astrium, and Cassidian. In the coming 10-15 years, we estimate the size of the market will reach approximately ‚¬12 billion. There is definitely potential, and the market is very interesting for us. On the manufacturing side, the advantage is that we are in the US dollar zone. This is very important for EADS; the aeronautics sector operates in dollars, not euros. We manufacture in euros and sell in dollars. The issue of the euro-dollar conversion was very severe in 2008 and 2009. The CEO of EADS used to say that every time the dollar loses $0.10 against the euro, the company loses ‚¬1 billion per its EBIT. One thing that has become very important for EADS is to overcome this euro-dollar issue. There are several ways, and one is to increase our sourcing and manufacturing in dollar zones. There is no direct link between dollars and pesos, but analyzing the trends over the past few years, there is a strong correlation between the value of the Mexican and US currencies. In fact, 80% of Mexican exports are destined for the US. We could consider that to a certain point Mexico is a dollar country. Another advantage is that Mexico is in close proximity to the US, the main aeronautical and defense market in the world. The third advantage is the well-trained, productive manpower in Mexico. These have been the three main factors for EADS.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sectors are driving the demand for your services?<br></h4><p><strong>ALEJANDRO REYNAL</strong> In Mexico, the majority of business comes from the telecommunications and finance sectors, and we are aiming to diversify our offering. We have acquired clients in the airline sector that use our technology extensively, and the company has entered agreements with energy and consumer product companies.</p><p><strong>CARLOS FUNES </strong>The top consumers of IT services are the financial and government sectors. In Latin America and North America, governments are strong consumers, and so a great share of our income comes from these segments. Other important sectors are the actual software companies, as well as companies involved in IT, telecommunications, manufacturing, commerce, and consumer goods.</p><h4>What does Atento offer beyond call center services?</h4><p><strong>AR</strong> We follow one trend, which is the use of multi-channeled platforms. We are not only servicing the customer in voice terms but also online or in-store. In this way, we can concentrate on the interactions between our personnel and the customer. Atento aims to provide a unique view to our clients, whether it is a telecommunications company or a financial services company. Another trend we are following is the product service offer. We have started to concentrate on back office operations, which don't require voice services. When you call the mobile company or a bank, those are front office transactions. At times, there are transactions that happen beyond those initial conversations, and this is our back office. Atento is entering the market of less non-voice transactions in the back office.</p><h4>You've started applying a new business model called One Softtek. What impact has it had on your operational model?</h4><p><strong>CF</strong> The One Softtek model means always delivering the same degree of service to every client. No matter what part of the world they might be, they can always rely on the same level of service and the same experience wherever they are. This is a model that has made a tremendous impact, and we've reached economies of scale. If we have an expert in collaboration technology servicing the US, we place them in the Application Development group to replicate this knowledge in other countries. We continue to have vertical segmentation in countries, but our delivery model turned global. We have application development, application management, and information management practices going to different countries in the roll out, mainly Mexico and the US.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in Latin America and globally for the future of the company?</h4><p><strong>AR</strong> Globally, I feel we have a lot of room to grow. We want to be perceived as the most admired company within our sector—admired by our employees, clients, shareholders, and society. This seems simple, but we want to achieve what we promise to our clients, respect our employees, and treat them with fairness, meet the financial targets of our shareholders, and continue to generate employment for society. Besides this vision, we want to continue to have profitable growth, which means entering new markets and business segments and expanding our product portfolio.</p><p><strong>CF</strong> Today, software is a vital part of any industry. Our main focus will be the applications market; we are going to focus on systems and software. We will go much deeper in each industry segment, and not necessarily go into infrastructure. Instead, the company is working to remain in the applications market. The challenge for Softtek in Mexico and Latin America is to move from being a supplier that knows about systems, to one that understands the client best. We see tremendous market potential, and our challenge in the region is to have the capability to develop people and ensure that we can replicate these models throughout the Latin America region. We firmly believe that the company must evolve from IT to business technology, a great opportunity for Softtek, Mexico, and the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the air transport system in Mexico?<br></h4><p><strong>ADOLFO CASTRO RIVAS</strong> I think that the air transportation system in Mexico is very strong in terms of infrastructure and the services offered to passengers. The only problem I can identify in the whole system is how expensive the fares are for domestic travel. The number of domestic passengers in Mexico is very low if you take into account the size of the Mexican population and compare these figures to other Latin American countries. Normally, it is 2.2% more expensive to fly internationally than domestically, but in Mexico you can easily pay $600 for a two-hour domestic flight, while in other countries you pay at least 40% less. Concerning the strengths of the Mexican air transportation system, the most relevant point is the quality of services in the airports. Our airports serve 77 million passengers per year. This figure is very low compared to Chicago's O'Hare Airport for example, which serves 66.5 million passengers per year, or Atlanta International Airport, which serves 72 million. High prices are certainly one of the main obstacles to increasing traffic.</p><p><strong>HÉCTOR VELÁZQUEZ Y CORONA</strong> The airport infrastructure is extremely developed in Mexico. Mexico has almost 60 airports throughout the country. The majority of Mexico's airports are managed by private companies, such as Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) and Aeropuertos del Sureste (ASUR). However, AICM belongs to the Mexican government. Our level of technology is very high, and we receive strong support from the government in order to modernize the infrastructure and attract more visitors. At the same time, private companies that manage airports are constantly investing in new technology to improve the quality of the services provided to customers. Compared to other countries, our aerospace sector is still young.</p><h4>What incentives should be implemented to improve the air transportation industry?</h4><p><strong>ACR</strong> I think that stronger competition in the market could have a positive effect on prices. It should be discussed, as an option, to stop protecting local airlines over international ones. This is a practice that the government has been promoting for many years. I think that if the regulatory system in the air transportation field were revised, it would stimulate competition by allowing new international participants into the market. In addition to that, public tourism entities should promote domestic tourism, given the enormous domestic market that exists in Mexico. The first rule of stimulating the development of a niche market is to create an environment that allows supply and demand to grow. With current airfares, however, this is not going to happen in the short term.</p><p><strong>HVC</strong> We have to heavily invest in technology. I strongly believe that the government should create new legal frameworks and incentive schemes to promote technological development. The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) has directed a large number of investments toward technology, and we will continue to invest in innovations promoted by the government.</p><h4>How do you see the system developing over the next few years?</h4><p><strong>ACR</strong> We have to bear in mind that the air transportation sector was liberalized in 2005 with the sale of Mexicana by the government. Since then, we have seen several new participants enter the market and an increase in the total passenger volume, thanks to lower pricing resulting from stronger competition. My expectation is that this situation will change in the medium term and the decrease in airfares will be beneficial in stimulating demand for domestic and international travel, as has happened in the last 10 years in the US, Europe, and Brazil.</p><p><strong>HVC</strong> My expectation is that the air transportation system will continue to grow, due to the fact that transportation, logistics, and other related services drive Mexico's economic development. The government is making an effort to modernize all aspects of our infrastructure—air, road, and sea. Mexico has deep economic relations with the US, and an integrated transport system will increase our exports. We occupy a strategic position, and a modern transport system will definitely help consolidate Mexico as an international transportation hub.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has private sector participation changed the rail industry?<br></h4><p><strong>ROGELIO VÉLEZ</strong> Radically. The industry was privatized in 1997, and Ferromex was the second line to receive a concession. We obtained the Pací­fico Norte, and it was our opportunity to transform the company. We paid just $540 million for the concession, which represents 8,000 kilometers of rail network. The line has five gateways into the US, operates four different ports on the Pacific coast, and two very important ports on the Gulf of Mexico. We have capitalized on these strengths, and currently we cover more than 80% of the country's industrial activity.</p><p><strong>JOSÉ ZOZAYA</strong> The Mexican, US, and Canadian economies have made NAFTA successful thanks to the participation of the private sector. Private investors are the ones who are really implementing and perfecting the rules that the governments negotiated. When businesses negotiate for legislation it's because the market is already asking for it, because we—the businessmen—know what the worldwide market wants. In the case of KCSM, since entering into this concession, we have accomplished everything we have here due to our own investment in technology, maintenance, new equipment, and training employees, which has enabled us to build a very efficient network; the only one operating in both the US and Mexico.</p><h4>Which sectors represent the highest growth for Ferromex's operations?</h4><p><strong>RV</strong> The one sector that represents the greatest potential is agriculture; it represents 30% of our sales. We move the most important crops in Mexico. It is an industry that has grown significantly over the past 10 years. Another segment is automotive, which represented just 5% of our sales seven years ago, and currently represents over 10%. A third segment is intermodal or container traffic. Over the last two years alone, this sector has registered the most important annual growth, representing 25% to 30% of all trade volume. The automotive industry demands on-time service. It forces us to give priority to automotive shipments, and we have been able to compete versus the other transport modes, in terms of cost and service.</p><h4>To what do you attribute Kansas City Southern's 24% revenue increase in 3Q2011 internationally, and how did your Mexican operation contribute to these results?</h4><p><strong>JZ</strong> The global economy has been improving, and the Mexican industrial sector has been improving in terms of efficiency. The worldwide economy has become more competitive, and Mexico has become much more competitive. Since the crisis of 2009, Mexico has been able to capture more foreign investment, because we are recognized as a country that has the capability to produce more and produce better products at a good price and with good quality. The Mexican automobile industry has been doing much better; we serve the automotive industry, and that has increased our volumes. Also, grain, steel, minerals, petrochemicals, and, of course, intermodal transport are all on the up.</p><h4>How does your company address environmental concerns?</h4><p><strong>RV</strong> The year 2011 was the most important in terms of capital investment, worth $330 million, which included the 44 locomotives we purchased in 4Q2011. We needed more power and we needed it to be efficient in terms of mileage and in order to meet environmental concerns. These models are the most environmentally friendly locomotives. The mileage we get from them is also the best in the industry. We have improved our efficiency with the addition of 82 new locomotives. Our customers rely on this power, and it has greatly improved our services.</p><p><strong>JZ</strong> I think it is important for a railroad company to show that it cares for the environment. Using green locomotives benefits us in different ways; they are cleaner and require less fuel and lubrication, the engines deteriorate less quickly, and there is less waste. Everything about them is better for the company and the community. We will continue working on that initiative. We also have an internal initiative to conserve fuel; we try to use fuel as efficiently as possible every day.</p><h4>What is the role of Ferromex in Mexico's export economy?</h4><p><strong>RV</strong> The external economy is part of our potential. We hold five gateways to the US and work broadly with the country, where we see opportunities to develop international business. Our international operations represent around 38% of Ferromex's volumes, whereas at the beginning they represented only 22%.</p><h4>What measures could improve rail transport in and out of Mexico?</h4><p><strong>JZ</strong> The US and Mexico are working very diligently to create new regulations and streamline customs. A plan is in place to expedite the crossing of goods through the border, and to ensure that this checkpoint only exists to prevent illegal goods from crossing. That agreement will allow for the pre-clearance of some goods, which will significantly reduce time spent at the border.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Mexico mean for your company?<br></h4><p><strong>THIERRY GONNET</strong> Compared with other emerging markets, Mexico is the most important for Adecco. We have more sales and more return on sales than in any other emerging country where we operate.</p><p><strong>MONICA FLORES BARRAGÁN</strong> I think we have many advantages, beginning with our location. We are in the center of the continent, and there are a variety of communication and transport systems that make our market readily available in terms of logistics, oil, deployment of services, and products. In addition to that, we have many natural resources that are attractive for investment and tourism. We are politically stable, and our economy is one of the most fortified in the world. But most importantly, we are talented. We have a lot of people with knowledge, ability, and competence. We have a demographic bonus, which is a huge advantage, especially for European companies, and companies from the US and Canada where the population is aging. In Mexico, we are not yet facing this challenge. We are prepared and are playing a key strategic role in a globalized world.</p><h4>How has the 2009 Social Security Law impacted Adecco and the labor market in Mexico?</h4><p><strong>TG</strong> Since 2009, this law has been regulating formal companies. Many of these companies were ready for the legislation before it was passed, and therefore saw no significant change. It was a positive step; now the government can explain the regulations and encourage businesses to follow them. However, the illegal companies are still operating in the same way. The current government has made all the correct moves and proposed the best labor laws, contributing to the flexibility of social security and how it is applied to part-time jobs. Unfortunately, not much has changed.</p><h4>According to a 2010 labor report, 41.1% of the economically active population are women. What role do women play in the economy's development?</h4><p><strong>MFB</strong> We face the same challenges here as in any country. Half of the population at universities are women, and the issue is that there are still stereotypes that make it difficult to improve their participation in companies. However, there are scenarios that you wouldn't have believed 10 years ago. We have women running the most important companies in Mexico, and with regard to results, there's a very important magazine that ranks the 500 most influential Mexican companies and shows that organizations run by women had consistently better results during the most recent global economic crises. Women have talent, and it has been proven. At ManpowerGroup, we don't face that problem internally—our staff is 70% female. We understand how life and work are for women. However, the real challenge is to accommodate minorities in the workforce, such as people with disabilities, different sexual preferences, religions, and ethnicities. If we can integrate these groups and be very diverse, then it will make us more innovative and competent. The problem isn't gender, it is talent. If we still see gender as an issue, we are wasting our time.</p><h4>What are Adecco's competitive advantages?</h4><p><strong>TG</strong> We work with good companies that offer our candidates competitive salaries. When we visit our client companies, we ensure that they offer an adequate salary and respect policies of non-discrimination; otherwise, we do not work with them. Adecco has very strict codes of conduct, and in this way we are very transparent.</p><h4>What sectors are driving the demand for your services?</h4><p><strong>MFB</strong> We take on any companies in any sector in any region. We don't have a niche. We have employees in agriculture, in services, in manufacturing, in the financial sector, and in construction; the demand of our services is not privative to a specific industry sector. We don't just focus on the sector, we focus on the talent.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your client base?<br></h4><p><strong>VALDEMAR GONZÁLEZ RODRÍGUEZ</strong> We have several accredited distributors throughout the country. They distribute our products directly and they also develop different kinds of construction projects directly demanded by a client using our materials. Moreover, we sell directly to major construction companies or to government enterprises such as Infonavit.</p><h4>What are your fields of expertise?</h4><p><strong>ALEJANDRO F. CALZADA PRATS</strong> Around 70% of our projects are in road building, and the other 30% are in marine construction. Of that 30%, two-thirds consists of dredging projects, deepening ports and harbors, and the remainder is wet infrastructure, including marina and harbor construction. We plan to maintain our existing road-building business, but dredging is our most profitable sector, and we wish to expand those operations. We currently own a fleet of nine dredgers, which we want to expand to 12 or 13 in 2012.</p><h4>How would you characterize the competition in the building materials market?</h4><p><strong>VGR</strong> Many people believe that it is very easy to put a new product into the Mexican market, but that is not the case. We mostly compete with five big manufacturers from Mexico and from abroad, making this market very busy and hard to survive in. Fortunately, we have a strong presence in the north of the country and a very good reputation, which makes it easier to compete with other companies.</p><p><strong>ACP</strong> It's a very tough market. In every bid we compete against 20 to 30 companies, Mexican and international. Maybe 15% of companies participating in these bids are foreign, mainly Spanish, including Aldesa and Isolux Corsán. They used to bid only on large projects, but now they go for projects of all sizes.</p><h4>How important are innovative practices in the creation of your products?</h4><p><strong>VGR</strong> We have eight people constantly reviewing market trends and developing new products in concert with these trends. In addition, Bexel is currently investing in new equipment and in the recovery of raw materials that can be developed for commercial uses. The R&amp;D department is the key element of our expansion strategy, and thanks to its work we are able to launch new products in the market. Our products have received acclaim due to the strong efforts made by our R&amp;D department in analyzing customer needs, recovering raw materials, and developing suitable products for the market.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the state of infrastructure development in Mexico?</h4><p><strong>ACP</strong> Mexico has been building a large number of major highways and roads over the past 10 or 15 years, and expanding the existing ones. Recently, Mexico began a very ambitious program for the restoration of existing roads, which is very positive because it doesn't make a lot of sense to build new projects if the existing ones are not being maintained. The country also needs airports and seaports. That sector has not been touched much in the last 15 years, but currently a number of major ports such as Manzanillo and Altamira are being expanded.</p><h4>What products are registering the greatest demand in Mexico?</h4><p><strong>VGR</strong> The product that developers are demanding most is "Azulejero Solución Total," which is an adhesive for porcelain. This product is the leading solution in the market thanks to its durability and functionality. It is receiving a strong acceptance in the market and it could be considered as our top-of-the-range product. In addition, our different stucco products are performing very well due to the fact that our products are very strong insulators and make a difference in the market.</p><h4>What changes do you foresee in the construction sector in Mexico?</h4><p><strong>ACP</strong> We need a better financial system for the private sector, and better support from the banking sector in terms of loans. Right now, competing with foreign companies that have access to cheaper money is putting us at a disadvantage. Mexico needs a lot of infrastructure, and given that the Mexican government is the main promoter of infrastructure construction, as long as our company has been in business we have never had a problem with the government honoring its contracts, which is very valuable in a developing economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sectors does Cancún Center recognize as key fields to boost the overall number of annual events?<br></h4><p><strong>JAVIER GÁMEZ BAUTISTA</strong> Nowadays, about 70% of our congresses are medical events, and we would definitely like to boost the number of scientific congresses at Cancún Center in the near future. For example, we will be hosting the Primatology Congress very soon, in which experts will unite to talk about the latest scientific advancements in the field. Hosting congresses is like winning the right to organize the Olympic Games or the World Cup; it takes years of hard work, and the concessions are granted years in advance. Our concept citywide is very innovative within the sector, and it means that the whole city is involved in hosting conferences, congresses, and conventions. For that reason, we created Cancún Alliance, Meetings and Conventions to boost future vision and teamwork to position Mexico and the city within the top meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) destinations. Overall, there are about 45 companies—hotels, entertainment centers, and restaurants—involved in this alliance, supporting economically the bids to host international events, and working together to promote Cancún as a business tourism destination. Also, I would like to emphasize the negative stigma the name Cancún carries when talking about hosting scientific and medical events, as it is a luxury and distracting destination for participants. For that reason, we are implementing different measures to change this perception.</p><h4>When you're bidding for major events, you're competing against other cities around the world. What does Monterrey bring to the table?</h4><p><strong>GONZALO ESCAMEZ SADA</strong> We emphasize the cultural aspects of Mexico, which are very attractive for business tourism. We also have the necessary infrastructure for these events in terms of connectivity, airports and roads. We boast a wide selection of associated hotels and a very professional team. Our board members are constantly working toward developing Cintermex as a global corporation in order to increase revenues, reduce costs, and make wise investments. Cintermex is also very flexible; we have an exhibition area and the right suppliers to service the business tourism industry. Our team has been with the organization for many years, and is experienced in staging events. The board members require professionalism measured by our counterparts in the US. Our accountability is measured by our success, and we do whatever it takes to meet our customers' deadlines. We deliver a fast and reliable service, which has solidified our excellent reputation in the business community worldwide.</p><h4>What's the overall potential for MICE tourism in your city?</h4><p><strong>JGB</strong> There is huge potential in MICE tourism, for Mexico is one of the top 10 touristic destinations. We should work toward matching both fields, as it offers clear future benefits. Currently, Cancún hosts 30% of Mexico's MICE tourism, and I believe there is plenty of room to grow in the near future because such conferences and meetings are mostly held in hotels, and in Cancún you can find some of the best hotel chains in the world, which have top MICE facilities and are currently hosting events almost daily. Having said that, I think we should work toward hosting more international exhibitions in Cancún. Such events tend to be held in industrial cities, or cities close to big industrial markets with good transport connections, whereas touristic cities do not tend to be top destinations in this field.</p><p><strong>GES</strong> I strongly believe that Monterrey is the best choice for business tourism in Mexico. We don't have any beaches or pyramids, but in the business category we are well positioned. Cintermex in Monterrey is dynamic in terms of expanding the size of its facilities and taking on new projects. Our motivation stems from being a non-profit organization that would rather invest than turn a profit. Apart from advertising, we are investing $50 million in our new projects. Our organization participates with the Mexican government and the tourism sector to promote business tourism. We intend to help the country conduct more business, and as a non-profit organization, it is our social responsibility to the community to attract better events to  Monterrey.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe ExxonMobil's relationship with PEMEX?<br></h4><p><strong>JAIME BUITRAGO</strong> ExxonMobil is one of PEMEX's top purchasers of crude and one of its top suppliers of refined products, such as gasoline. The refineries ExxonMobil has in the Gulf of Mexico are ideally suited to handle the types of crude that Mexico produces in the most efficient way, benefiting consumers in Mexico. Also, PEMEX uses ExxonMobil technologies for the refineries in Mexico. Several of our technologies, such as those applied in the production of low sulfur diesel, have environmental benefits for Mexico, and enable PEMEX to fulfill environmental regulations. On the upstream front, we only have non-commercial technical collaboration agreements.</p><h4>What level of activity is ExxonMobil developing in the downstream sector in Mexico?</h4><p><strong>PABLO CONRAD</strong> We have been in this market for over 125 years, mostly through our brands in the lubricants business and the chemicals portfolio. In the lubricants business, we have a heritage of working with the ESSO and Mobil brands. After the recent merger of our two companies, we consolidated our efforts mostly in the Mobil brand. In Mexico, we have about 250 employees running our operation and we have three facilities. We have offices here in Mexico City, where we run our ventures office and chemicals management. We also have a terminal in the port of Tuxpan, in the state of Veracruz, supplying chemicals to the rest of the country, and a lubricant plant in Mexico City.</p><h4>What is the key to a good relationship between national and international oil companies?</h4><p><strong>JB</strong> National oil companies, such as PEMEX, and international companies, such as ExxonMobil, face common challenges and often share common goals. We would like to develop a long-term relationship with PEMEX based on these commonalities. This is something crucial in an industry such as ours that is volatile and high risk. Relations between national and international companies have to be structured in a way that both the investor and the resource owner feel like they are in a win-win situation, and where they are able to work together to achieve a positive outcome, leveraging the strengths of each company.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the lubricants market?</h4><p><strong>PC</strong> This is a highly competitive market. Many of the major companies are present in this market as well. The market has been growing and there are some fundamentals supporting that growth. First of all, there is the commodity-based economy. Commodities like minerals are boosting production and exports. We have a strong position in those segments of the economy. Manufacturing is very strong in this market. Whenever automotive production goes up, demand for lubricants increases. We have accompanied that kind of growth. The market grew at a rate of close to 2% in 2011. ExxonMobil is growing approximately above that rate in Mexico.</p><h4>How would you describe the differences between the regulatory framework in Mexico compared to other Latin American countries?</h4><p><strong>JB</strong> Basically, Mexico is the only country in Latin America—for that matter anywhere in the world—where the national oil company does not have the flexibility to enter into joint ventures with operators to develop domestic resources. Joint ventures are used by companies everywhere to explore, develop, and produce hydrocarbons in projects that are both capital intensive and high risk. Deepwater projects are an excellent example. Joint ventures allow companies to optimize their portfolio, manage risks, and as a result, new resources are discovered and production levels are maximized. This enables the resource owners to expand their economies and invest more in social problems as a result.</p><h4>How is ExxonMobil working with the authorities to lower dependence on the US market?</h4><p><strong>PC</strong> Mexico is facing a high increase in energy demand driven by population growth and economic development. ExxonMobil is supporting efforts in the country to provide affordable energy solutions to boost that economic growth and lower dependence on foreign markets. In the downstream part of the business, we can support industries by improving their productivity and providing high-end products from the chemicals and lubricants side. We can enhance the output of industries, improving their productivity in a reliable way, and be mindful of their sustainability goals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the funds industry and the growth of the asset management sector in Mexico?<br></h4><p><strong>HÉCTOR MADERO </strong>For the past 10 to 15 years the asset management sector has been growing at about 15% annually. Penetration is still quite low compared to our GDP and that of other countries. Mexican assets represent about 9% of GDP. We currently have about 1.5 million mutual accounts in our industry, and it has been growing. We still expect the sector to grow around 18% for the next five years. It's gaining momentum.</p><h4>What kind of energy projects is Navix financing?</h4><p><strong>GONZALO GIL WHITE</strong> We cover almost the entire scope of oil field service projects. Historically, most of our energy practice has involved financing the working capital requirements for oil field services companies. Gradually, we expanded the scope of coverage of the energy sector to include contractors and sub-contractors of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), which is the state-owned power utility company.  The legal framework that governs both types of services contracts is virtually identical and the methodology that we employ to evaluate and monitor performance risk is 100% transferable from one sector to the other.</p><h4>Where do you see the most room for growth?</h4><p><strong>HM</strong> At this stage, more sophisticated products that diversify our portfolio and bring higher returns to our customers will still take time to catch up in the market. Rates are very low today, and Mexican yields on government instruments are still high compared to other countries. Many clients have little motivation to move out of fixed-income assets at this time, but it's gradually changing. We are starting to see an appetite for new products. We were the first company to bring US equity products to the Mexican market when it was opened. We were also the first company to introduce US dollar debt funds. We also hired an outside international manager for some of our funds. We have been innovating in terms of products.</p><p><strong>GW</strong> We view the energy sector as the most dynamic in terms of financing, and this is the reason why we have—through the FISE facility—a dedicated program targeting the working and growth capital requirements of energy sector participants. We also have a robust underwriting practice for government contractors, in sectors such as health care, communications and transportation, information systems, and civil works. Furthermore, Navix has become one of the largest lenders in certain sectors of the consumer finance industry, such as payroll discount. In this area, Navix evaluates static pools of loans and creates structures that are consistent with rating agency guidelines for AAA-rated transactions. We are in the process of making our first private securitization of consumer loans, and the terms of the transaction will enable us to recover 100% of our principal, with no subordinated component and over 1,000 bps of spread.</p><h4>What's your vision for the future?</h4><p><strong>HM</strong> We will continue to grow and double the size of our business in the next couple of years. We are focused on major areas: attracting more customers, advising them on intelligent investments, and encouraging them to invest in more diverse products. We like to call ourselves the "Merrill Lynch" of Mexico. We have 86 branches, and I think it could be easily doubled. We manage about $6.5 billion in mutual funds. Our total assets are about $20 billion.</p><p><strong>GW</strong> I think that from a macro perspective one of the positive aspects in Mexico is that we have very healthy public finances. The lessons we learned from previous crises have brought sound and efficient economic policies. This is the principal ingredient in creating confidence for capital investments in the country and for a significant inflow of foreign investment. The country's strategic geographical position near the biggest market in the world—the US—is also a logistical advantage for many industries. We also have a very strong advantage in terms of labor, with low costs, a highly qualified workforce, and a very strong internal market. Mexico is a great place to invest thanks to its very sound legal framework and extremely high-quality human capital, making it a market with tremendous opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the status of the cement production facilities you are presently installing?</h4><p><strong>HASAN YALÇINKAYA</strong> As with any big project, there are difficulties to overcome, but we are on track. The EPC contract for the plant's construction was awarded to CTIEC (PRC) and Mitsubishi Corporation (Japan). The participation in the project of representatives of the countries occupying the second and third places in the global economy gives us added confidence. In addition, the plant's main production equipment will be purchased from leading manufacturers in Germany and other EU countries. Such a combination of technical competence and know-how, as well as traditions of quality, efficiency, and sustainability, plus R&amp;D and the best practices of Europe and Asia would seem to promise excellent results. The contract became effective on May 13, 2011, and set target dates for early cement production and full-scale production in May 2013 and mid-September 2013, respectively. Although most of the processing equipment will be supplied from Europe, and the engineering and construction will be done by Chinese and Turkish companies, we are planning to use a considerable amount of local expertise in the construction of the plant. We are currently in the process of preparing and establishing an operation plan in order to be ready to operate when the plant is completed.</p><h4>What are the main services BASF Caspian currently offers?</h4><p><strong>ÜMIT N. BAÅžDAÅž</strong> We provide high-quality chemical products to all construction fields. The company produces a range of construction chemicals in admixture and construction systems such as concrete admixtures, tile adhesives, joints and wide-joint grouts, repair materials, waterproofing systems, epoxy and polyurethane flooring systems, undercoats and primers, dry additives, and shake floor hardeners. Ucrete, the toughest flooring product among them, offers a 20-year guarantee. BASF's portfolio ranges from chemicals, plastics, and agricultural products, to construction chemical products for the oil and gas sector. I would also like to add that BASF Caspian is the leading company in the production of concrete additives in Azerbaijan. Glenium, a final generation concrete admixture, has recently been used in all the high-rise buildings of Baku, such as DIA's Flame Towers, SOCAR Tower, and the SOFAZ Tower projects.</p><h4>How is the company working to ensure the quality of cement production from its new facilities?</h4><p><strong>HY</strong> In developing plans for our project, we designed the plant to be fully automatic, which will enable us to control all stages of the production chain and collect important data to maintain the highest standards possible. We believe that people make quality, and we will be conducting extensive training courses for all our employees. Therefore, we are investing heavily in infrastructure and human capital. For the time being we have 44 employees, but once the plant becomes a reality and all the departments of the company are established, we plan to employ around 350 people.</p><h4>What investment and development plans are you working on in the medium to long term?</h4><p><strong>ÜB</strong> BASF has recently developed a global 2020 vision; the company's sales in emerging markets such as Azerbaijan have almost tripled in the last 10 years and they currently represent one-third of the company's overall sales. By 2020 BASF expects that sales in emerging countries will represent up to 45% of global sales activities. BASF plans capital expenditures of around $30 billion to $35 billion in emerging markets, and such a trend would bring investments to Azerbaijan as well as other emerging markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main strengths as an active participant in the local IT sector?<br></h4><p><strong>ZAUR MAMMADZADE</strong> The most important strength I'd say is our people, and we have been working over the last few years toward this target. We have a very strong team of professionals in our company; they are very young and ambitious. Their ambition is something that has driven the company's growth over the years. ULTRA is also willing to grow and we have a clear understanding of what we are, what we do, and where we want to get. Therefore, we understand the market we are working in, we know the companies, the products, and also how to implement the best strategies. Having become a leading company in the region has also contributed to the development of ULTRA.</p><p><strong>CEYHUN QULIYEV</strong> Caspel is one of the largest integrator companies in Azerbaijan, providing a full range of IT and telecommunications solutions. The company provides solutions for data transmission, software development, delivery, and the maintenance of advanced equipment from leading IT equipment producers and software developers. Caspel started operating in 1997 and a few years later, in 2005, we underwent a rebranding exercise in order to take the company forward. At present, we run our own fiber-optic network, and we provide the most effective project solutions to our customers through the use of the latest technology and the substantial experience of Caspel's key personnel. In that regard, I would like to note that when we first started, there were some 35 staff, whereas now there are around 200.</p><h4>How have your partnership agreements evolved?</h4><p><strong>ZM</strong> Our company started as a distribution company, supplying components to its customers. Intel Corporation is the worldwide leader in supplying components. Therefore, we started to collaborate with it and from the beginning we pumped out good volumes for Intel. The company authorized us to be its official partner here in Azerbaijan. After Intel, ULTRA has managed to get over 30 different contracts from vendors such as Hewlett Packard, Microsoft, Cisco, and others.</p><p><strong>CQ</strong> Caspel's activities are focused on four areas; integration, supply and solutions, service center support, and our help desk. We currently have 38 different partnerships with companies such as HP, Microsoft, Dell, Hitachi, Oracle, 3M, Legrand, Iskratel, Siemens, ZyXEL, and IBM, with which we work very closely. Our main aim is to provide global solutions to complex projects, and Caspel is taking advantage of the knowledge and products of such brands. At the same time, we provide a full range of services for these international companies in Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the IT sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><strong>ZM</strong> ICT is a major sector in order to diversify Azerbaijan's economy. I see stable growth and important investments in the sector in the near future. For example, 2012 is an important year for the sector with the launch of Azerbaijan's first satellite, the Europe-Persia Express Gateway, as well as other initiatives. It is said that incomes from the ICT sector in Azerbaijan in 2020 will be the same as the oil and gas sector, and by 2030 it will be even bigger. Our government has a strong understanding of how the ICT sector will be growing in Azerbaijan, and we, as a key player in this sector, will be contributing to that. I think Azerbaijan has already become a regional hub in the ICT sector.</p><p><strong>CQ</strong> Azerbaijan's ICT sector is flourishing in the region. It is a politically stable country, the government's policies are in the right direction, and many different companies are driving the growth of the sector, which is actually developing along with the country's economy. In the near future we will see many Azerbaijani enterprises going abroad, especially to former Soviet republics and CIS countries. In that regard, Caspel does not exclude such a possibility either. We think the natural flow of the market and the sector will drive our operations in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the establishment of AzSigorta, and how has the market evolved since the company's inception?<br></h4><p><strong>ELKHAN R. HASHIMOV</strong> The dynamic development of the insurance sector in Azerbaijan was a key factor behind the establishment of AzSigorta. After independence, many fields in Azerbaijan's economy started to grow, and people's welfare began growing with the development of the economy. People thus require a mechanism to protect their belongings. The most reliable of these methods is an insurance mechanism, which has passed the test of history. Today, as a universal insurance company, AzSigorta, which was established in November 2006, is interested in all areas of the market, meaning that we operate in the direction of insuring the health of individual clients, automobile and real estate interests, and the business interests of our corporate clients. Giving moral and material support to our clients during tough times is important for us. We offer 32 types of insurance services, meeting the requirements of our individual and corporate clients. For these services we have a financial and professional base. As any field evolves over time, so does the insurance market and new needs emerge. And as in many developed companies, our personnel are also working on developing new innovative insurance products and introducing these products to the market.</p><h4>How has the merger between MBASK and AXA strengthened the position of the company in the Azerbaijani insurance market?</h4><p><strong>YAVUZ ÖLKEN</strong> AXA and MBASK are delighted with the course of action taken since the merger. In fact, we are already working on a long-term strategy in the country, and AXA is looking to expand its services into neighboring countries as well. It has been a very successful partnership; AXA has transferred almost all of the industry's best practices to this emerging market, supported by AXA Sigorta Turkey, and has established an agent network across the country, implemented IT services within the company, and shifted the business strategy toward a more customer-centered organization. Those are the key factors. The staff here has been very supportive, engaging with the company at all times. Also, the brand AXA MBASK has been warmly welcomed, and we have had a lot of customers coming in response to our extensive branding and marketing campaign. Thanks to its experience in Azerbaijan, AXA is now looking to invest and expand its activities to neighboring countries if we see an opportunity and AXA would like to use the best practices from the Azerbaijani market in those countries.</p><h4>How will recent changes in Azerbaijan's insurance laws and the increase of compulsory lines impact the sector?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> The government plays a key role in the development of any sector, and insurance is not an exception. The new legislation on compulsory insurance will bring growth and development to the insurance sector. The Azerbaijani insurance market is still young, and the new laws will positively impact the sector's activity and our company as well. Increasing the customer base and creating an insurance culture throughout the country will benefit all parties involved in the game. As a result of such developments, we expect to see strong growth in 2012.</p><p><strong>YÖ</strong> In Azerbaijan, the penetration of insurance is very much linked to the central bank's insurance policy. Voluntary insurance is very limited in terms of the retail business. The new law is a very important step toward opening more doors in the retail business and raising insurance awareness, and it will generate opportunities for insurance companies to grow quickly. At the same time, the companies involved in the sector have to understand that there will be competition, of course, but it will be competition for quality services, rather than between us. It is time for the insurers to educate the market on how to use policies. That will help to drive the penetration up, and I am convinced that with the right tools the insurance market can produce 10 times more than what it is currently producing. Nowadays, the regulatory system is very strict in terms of solvency, companies' financial structure, and their capital. However, we need to invest in business intelligence and professionalize the sector with well-trained agents, and also make an investment in technology, because in the future the law will oblige insurers to record their policies in real-time in the database of the national bureau. At the moment, the majority of policies in the sector are sold and written by hand. That needs to change immediately by using IT as leverage.</p><h4>In which areas do you face the most competition?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> There is strong competition in the automobile, property, and health insurance fields. These fields are of great interest to the population. To beat the competition, we pay special attention to the quality of the services we offer. In this respect, our personnel attend seminars and training sessions in European and Asian countries at well-known insurance and reinsurance companies. We also conduct internal business process monitoring and customer satisfaction surveys.</p><h4>The insurance market has experienced strong growth over 2011, and AXA MBASK has also been on a growth curve. How is your company working to increase its penetration rate in the market?</h4><p><strong>YÖ</strong> The growth the sector has experienced is important, but it differs in life and non-life. If you exclude life premiums, the real growth of the sector is 23%. AXA MBASK has grown 62% within that segment. We have made AZN10.8 million, and our company is one of the leading companies in motor and property insurance. In order to increase our penetration in the market, we are heavily investing in a distribution network. Face-to-face relationships are key to achieving a higher penetration rate in the market. Also, we have a partnership with Unibank through which to provide our insurance products. At the same time, we are extending our activities in the corporate segment, targeting SMEs. However, our main focus will always be individuals. We expect to see the income level of the local population increase even more in the next few years, and that will help people to acquire insurance policies.</p><h4>What specialties define the Azerbaijani customer?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> As in other countries, an important factor for our customers when applying for insurance services is the quality of the product and its support. Today we can say with confidence that medical insurance is the field with the highest demand.</p><p><strong>YÖ</strong> Azerbaijani people want reputable brands, and they are price sensitive, like most people. They also like to maintain constant contact with the insurance company's representatives, as they like quick resolutions to challenges. If services are rendered slowly, it is easy to lose reputation in the market.</p><h4>What goals has your company set for the next few years?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> Our main targets are to improve the quality of our services on a regular basis, develop and introduce new products to our customers, meet daily requirements by conducting market research, and increase customer satisfaction. We want to maintain our position as a market leader in 2012.</p><p><strong>YÖ</strong> We have a strategic plan that will run until 2015 and by that time we would like to double our premiums. We are also looking to achieve a market share of around 10%. At the same time, we are targeting an expansion in the number of agents in Azerbaijan, and we would like to have between 75 and 80 agents in our network. AXA MBASK wants to attract the largest number of individuals; we want to achieve plenty of insurance policies and plenty of clients. For that reason, AXA MBASK is going to focus very much on retail business. There are opportunities for all the players to grow quickly, but we need to use the right tools to take advantage of these opportunities. AXA MBASK has grown over 60% in 2011 and we aim to keep growing in the following years at a rate of around 30%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the landmark achievements of your bank?<br></h4><p><strong>ALI JAM</strong>  I acquired the bank at the end of 2003. At the time we had one office and around 13 people were employed. The development of the country was so strong I couldn't keep myself out of the current, and it is that current that has brought us to where we are today. Starting at the beginning of 2004, we began developing the core strategies that would drive the bank's penetration of Azerbaijani society. Back then we focused on the retail business and proceeded to expand the number of branches in the country. Currently, Royal Bank has 32 branches and nine sub-branches. In addition, we now have 630 employees. Over the last few years, we have been growing at a faster pace than Azerbaijan's GDP: 207% in 2007, 179% in 2008, 89% in 2009, and then due to the crisis in the banking sector we focused on consolidating our achievements. Royal Bank's assets are close to $250 million, its deposits are at about $100 million, and its portfolio is around $120 million. Fortunately, the economic policies implemented by both President Ilham Aliyev and his team—as well as the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBAR)—have been very successful and have protected our banks from the crisis, keeping them on their feet.</p><p><strong>FARID AKHUNDOV</strong> We are very pleased that after five years of full operations we have reached the goals set forth in our first business strategy. We have built the bank both as an institution and as a brand. Pasha Bank now has a name, operation, image, and reputation as well as a capable and young workforce. Our brand is rightly associated with steadfast financial stability, transparent operations, and quality of service. Pasha Bank has become a strong player in the corporate banking sector. We are active in treasury operations and building our securities portfolio, taking into consideration the importance of the securities market for Azerbaijan's future growth. Another of Pasha Bank's achievements during this period has been our geographic expansion—we have come to realize the great opportunities other markets offer. Thus, in September 2011 we opened our representative office in Georgia, while preparatory work for the opening of our office in Switzerland is in full swing. Another reason for going regional is to support our customers' expansion strategy in neighbouring countries. We have done a lot, but there's a lot of work ahead to gain the capacity to tap opportunities inside and outside Azerbaijan.</p><h4>What are your views on the state of development in the banking sector in Azerbaijan?</h4><p><strong>AJ</strong> Thanks to CBAR's guidance, Azerbaijani banks are now in a much better position than their regional counterparts. Azerbaijan, as a young country with a young banking sector, has a lot to learn from its fellow bankers in the West and the Middle East. In order to achieve this, Royal Bank opened a new bank in Dubai called Royal Investment Bank in 2011. It is an independent entity that allows us to gain more experience from the banking sector in the Middle East and expand our vision to North Africa as well. It is important for us to think regionally rather than locally.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the bond market?</h4><p><strong>FA</strong> We observed positive moves in terms of bonds and corporate ratings in 2011. We see Pasha Bank as a market maker and as a liquidity provider in the security market. In 2010 we issued a few corporate bonds with financial companies as well as with leaders of industrial sectors operating in Azerbaijan. Our activities in the corporate bond market have intensified in 2011. However, it was very crucial to educate the market and to let businesses understand bond-related issues better. For this reason we realized a wide-scale education project in cooperation with the State Committee for Securities. We have financed the publication of books on capital markets and the stock exchange, published in local media articles by experts in these fields. Our main aim in bonds issuing will be cooperation with the companies that have reached a satisfactory level of transparency in the their operations and possess clear development strategies. Properly audited financials are an essential prerequisite as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of your company?<br></h4><p><strong>RAMIL ALIYEV</strong> The idea was to protect the environment and save the ecological balance, as well as to research appropriate solutions to environmental challenges, as has become the crucial issue all over the world. Basically, we identify proper solutions for environmental issues and work toward reducing them. The State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), in the frame of its duties and responsibilities, has pointed out the importance of inviting foreign investors and creating modern ventures. As a result, in 2006 Ekol Engineering Services was established by its two shareholders: SOCAR, with a 51% share, and Lancer Services, with a 49% share. In a short amount of time the company has proved itself as a successful entity in the environmental sphere. After the President's announcement that 2010 would be the "Year of Ecology", there was an increase in the number of environmental projects implemented.</p><p><strong>ILHAM BABAYEV</strong> A branch office was opened in Azerbaijan in September 2007. The main activities of the company are the drilling of oil and gas wells, well work-over repairs, services for well drilling, enhancement technologies application, prospecting, exploration, and so forth. All of our activities in onshore oil and gas fields are based on state-of-the-art technology.</p><h4>What are some of the key environmental challenges Azerbaijan is facing, and how does your company seek to provide solutions?</h4><p><strong>RA</strong> The environment is one of the most crucial issues in the world and Azerbaijan in the 21st century. For more than 160 years Azerbaijan has been a significant country for oil production. Despite such a long tradition in the oil and gas sector, environmental protection issues have remained unsolved. In one of the country's biggest environmental catastrophes, 33,000 hectares of land were contaminated on the Absheron peninsula as a result of non-stop oil and gas operations, resulting in the land becoming unfit for use and the formation of hundreds of artificial lakes. In September 2006, the President decreed a new ecological position in the country through a program known as the "Complex Works Plan for the Improvement of Azerbaijan's Position 2006-2010". In the framework of this important state document all appropriate organizations as well as SOCAR began the realization of required projects, and for the last four years a large number of environmental issues have been solved. In 2006 the treatment of oil-contaminated lands was a main point of activity for SOCAR, and as a result of that Ekol Engineering Services became an operational company to successfully perform the aforementioned activities. The key environmental challenge that Azerbaijan is facing at present is oil-contaminated lands, and as a solution we consider it important to provide treatment to these lands and establish green areas in rehabilitated regions.</p><h4>What is the potential for cooperation between Azerbaijan and oil and gas producers in the Gulf?</h4><p><strong>IB</strong> Being part of the Islamic world and sharing the progressive heritage and spiritual values of Islamic civilization, Azerbaijan, since recovering its independence, has attached great importance to developing relations with the Islamic countries of the world in general and those of the Gulf states in particular. In addition, this interest in closer ties has been fully reciprocated by states in the Gulf. Oil and gas producers there have experience in using innovating technology in the drilling of oil and gas wells, and this has worked in favor of Azerbaijan in the context of oil and gas sector cooperation, and this close relationship is set to continue.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to expand your activities outside of Azerbaijan?</h4><p><strong>RA</strong> Ekol Engineering Services keeps in focus the establishment and development of foreign relationships and constantly looks to expand its activity outside of the country. We have already created wide cooperation and business relations with a number of companies in a variety of places from Uzbekistan to Germany and Switzerland, and several other companies from around the world. We have also created business relations with foreign companies acting in Azerbaijan, namely BP Exploration, which is operating in the Caspian Sea, and AA services (AAS), a Dutch company that won a tender announced by BP for waste management provision services. In this regard, a joint venture was established entitled AAS-Ekol. This company currently implements waste management projects for BP and Total.</p><h4>Do you see the potential for Azerbaijan to become a more significant hub for oil and gas exports from other CIS countries?</h4><p><strong>IB</strong> Together with strong government policy and the current rate of development in the oil and gas sector, Azerbaijan is set to play a leading role among the CIS countries.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the company and the Azerbaijani oil and gas sector in 2011?</h4><p><strong>RA</strong> My outlook for the future of the company is very progressive, because since we were established we have always moved towards the continuous development of foreign business relations, increasing the material and technical base, and improving our operational potential by involving highly specialized employees. As an operating company of SOCAR, we will continue to implement our global mission of improving the country's ecological position and succeed in reducing the negative environmental impact on human health, both inside and outside of Azerbaijan</p><p><strong>IB</strong> Our company works with the Azgerneft and Surakhani operating companies, and we took part in the Global Energy and SOCAR tenders. Aside from this we work with contractors such as Halliburton, Azeri-MI, and Gatewall. In this context we use the latest technologies for the exploitation of oil and gas wells. The future of the sector will be built using state-of-the-art technology, and I fully expect the sector to continue its strong performance throughout 2011.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did your company come about?<br></h4><p><strong>ZAUR MAMMADZADE</strong> We started off in 1999, mainly distributing PCs. Around that time we began working with Intel, distributing its central processing units such as Pentium. Our business picked up after the Intel deal, and we then began to integrate computers. To integrate computers spare parts are required, and so we began to work closely with multinational companies that produced PC components and we imported their products into Azerbaijan. After about five years we started our own production and registered our trademark, Nexus, which stands for "Next with us." We produce laptops, servers, notebooks, and PC accessories. It's been a very successful project and business is still growing rapidly. We now supply laptops and computers to schools and universities in Azerbaijan. We're no longer just a distribution company, but at the same time we are system integrators and provide software solutions. On the software front we partnered with Microsoft, with which we have different contracts for software distribution in our market. We are also partners with Oracle for business intelligence databases. As well, we provide solutions for the banking sector, for insurance companies, for e-government, health care, education, and so forth. We consider ourselves as a wide range IT-solutions company in Azerbaijan.</p><p><strong>RASSIM IBRAHIMOV </strong>The company started off with four partners who came together to form the company in 1991, right after independence. They were software programmers, and their major product was the software programs that they developed. Their customers showed interest in hardware products as well, and the company started providing hardware. System integration became a core business for our company, and we became a multi-business company in retail, systems integration, corporate sales, distribution, and assembly. Our PC is the first Azerbaijani-branded PC, and it was first released in 2003. Ours was the first, and now other brands have also appeared in the market.</p><h4>What makes Azerbaijan attractive to investment in the IT sector?</h4><p><strong>ZM</strong> Politically it's open, pragmatic, and stable. Geographically it's very central between Europe and Asia. Legally it's good too because Azerbaijan has a good business environment for foreign investors. IT is a sector that is developing very rapidly. Furthermore, the government has stated that it wants to invest money from the oil and gas sector into developing industries like IT. The IT market is growing by at least 30% year-on-year. I've been in this business 11 years, and every aspect of the sector has always been on the up, from revenues to the number of projects on the go, the amount of development, and the level of integration both domestically and internationally.</p><h4>The government has put a lot of emphasis on the IT sector, and it's become a major growth driver for the economy. Have you felt the effect of this on your own business?</h4><p><strong>RI</strong> Yes. The government's policy has been "to convert black gold into the gold of knowledge". Naturally, IT has been a major component of that strategy, and the e-government project is a big part of that. We're involved in a number of projects, too. We supplied some equipment to various projects through resellers. We have direct distributor contracts with the biggest companies in the world, like HP, Microsoft, Toshiba, Samsung, and the like. Most of these companies now have a local presence in Baku and we cooperate closely with them. Additionally, together with Microsoft, we've performed a localization of Windows XP into the Azerbaijani language.</p><h4>What potential does Azerbaijan have to attract foreign investors into its IT sector?</h4><p><strong>ZM</strong> The country's stable political situation, along with its booming economy and growing GDP are attractive to investors. The IT sector, like many other sectors, has good potential. We currently live in quite a unique situation, where old regulation structures are changing and the implementation of IT solutions is a key target for the government. The country itself has good financial capabilities to purchase and implement new technologies and solutions. The government has also fostered good relations with multinational companies that are willing to invest here. There is a good investment environment, and that is thanks to a willing government and strong laws and regulations.</p><h4>How do you see the IT market developing in Azerbaijan over the medium term?</h4><p><strong>RI</strong> I think the market will be the same as any European market or that of the US. The right strategy is to focus on creating good infrastructure for the whole country, and IT is a fundamental part of that. When you have good infrastructure then the whole economy and the whole country benefit. Broadband access and fiber optic networks have to be developed in Azerbaijan as internet speeds need to be increased. We're on the right track, though.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the story behind the establishment of Khazar University?</h4><p><strong>HAMLET ISHAKHANLI </strong>I was teaching and performing research in various countries before Azerbaijan achieved independence. At the same time I was looking to develop an educational institution, and took inspiration from universities I saw in the West. So, when I came back to Azerbaijan I started a campaign to raise awareness about the need to develop the country's education system. It was not an easy task. It was at this time that I decided to establish this university, shortly before independence, in order to develop a new model with no ties that would bind it to the broken systems of the past. This new system included an American-style, student-centered credit-earning system in order to give students more flexibility. Another important aim was trying to establish an international environment in terms of students and professors. We also wanted to develop university-industry relations, something that was lacking during Soviet times. We received backing from the government of the time, and Khazar University was thus established.</p><h4>How has the university developed in the number of programs it offers?</h4><p><strong>JOHN RYDER</strong> The curriculum is changing, and there are a number of reasons for this. One of the reasons is external factors, with the Ministry of Education ruling that private universities are no longer able to give degrees in medicine or law. We had very good medicine and law faculties, but unfortunately had to stop accepting first year students. We are, however, creating new programs, and at the undergraduate level we have launched a psychology program that has become very popular. We also have new degree programs preparing secondary level teachers in history, science, and other subjects. Electronic engineering is another new program, and we are now working on developing a biomedical engineering research lab with the aim of launching a program in that field. The strongest faculty is probably the School of Economics and Management, and this enables the close relationship between Khazar University and the business world. I believe that universities have a role to play in the social development of countries, yet the rhetoric universities often use is to the contrary. This is one aspect of Khazar that sets it apart from other educational institutions in that we see ourselves as having a responsibility to contribute to social development in Azerbaijan. For example we are currently engaged in a program to train people in project management, and this was mostly funded by BP.</p><h4>Has the education system in Azerbaijan developed in accordance with your expectations over the last 20 years?</h4><p><strong>HI</strong> We can certainly see development in the education system: there has been a lot of positive change, and Azerbaijan's universities are now on par with the Bologna Process and European Credit Transfer System. Many new textbooks have been published and international partnership programs have been initiated, including the Erasmus student exchange program for three higher learning institutions, including Khazar University. However, it has not developed totally according to my expectations. In particular, my idea was that competition amongst private universities would drive the development of quality; however, many private universities have followed in the footsteps of state universities in terms of poor operating standards. But a few of them are looking for real quality and are research-orientated, and this is positive. The same situation exists in Russia, Kazakhstan, and other places.</p><h4>How does the university raise finances?</h4><p><strong>JR</strong>  We are basically tuition-fee driven. We do not have any foundations supplying us with funds. We are now starting the process of a more Western-style development in terms of working closer with alumni, and more extensive fund-raising through a capital campaign and other activities. We are, of course, in an environment where there is no tradition of alumni networking or fund-raising, so the development of such a system will be slow.</p><h4>What is Khazar University's growth strategy?</h4><p><strong>HI</strong>  It is important that the university has a good number of international programs, such as exchange, research, and training programs. The first partnership programs we developed were with US universities such as UCLA, Harvard, and Princeton. Khazar was successful at fundraising, and for this reason we were effective in establishing these early partnerships. We then shifted our focus to Europe, and took advantage of special European-funded programs on offer aimed at developing former Soviet universities. Through those programs we developed student support and quality assurance systems. Part of our philosophy is that institutional development is as important as curricular development. Over the last few years we have been interested in Far Eastern countries such as Malaysia, Japan, China, and South Korea, in which we have established student exchange, research, and faculty programs. It is fantastic progress for a university of our size and stage of development, but is still not enough. However, we are a leading institution in Azerbaijan, and will continue to be so.</p><h4>What has been done to build connections with other universities internationally?</h4><p><strong>JR</strong>  The university has been very outward looking since it began. UCLA assisted with early curriculum development. We have many agreements with universities that create opportunities for students. We have made an agreement with a Japanese university, and will send several students there to study. We also have an agreement with a Norwegian university. We have students coming from the Netherlands and the US, as well as other countries. I also believe that Khazar is a good place for universities that have programs with interest in Iran, as we have good relations with the Iranian embassy here, and it supports our Farsi language and Persian history programs. It is difficult to predict the success of a program, and there have been some surprises in that sense.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How well developed are Cargolux's operations in Azerbaijan?<br></h4><p>Baku is centrally placed between Asia and Europe, and the development of Baku airport has come about rapidly. The development of this cargo terminal is exceptional too. It's the biggest and best in the entire region, including all the CIS states and even Turkey. The storage facilities are perfect, built to handle any kind of cargo, and it is a smaller copy of the facilities in Luxemburg. Baku has truly become a regional hub in cargo transport. The runway in Baku airport features a system that enables very low visibility landings. No other country in the whole area has this—not even Moscow or Istanbul. So we as Cargolux are very happy with our operations here. It's a hub that feeds western Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Iraq, among other countries.</p><h4>Which sectors do you primarily serve?</h4><p>NARGIZ HAYATOVA At the beginning of our operations we mainly served the oil and gas sectors. However, we are now advancing and becoming involved in a more diverse range of sectors. As we offer the widest range of cargo services, we are able to cater for all industrial sectors that are time sensitive and demand special attention. This includes cargo from sectors such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, banking, and luxury goods.</p><h4>What are the most prevalent cargo types being imported into Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Bİ Mainly equipment for the oil and gas industry, originally for the big oil pipelines like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and the Shah Deniz project, which are finished or nearing completion. There are always new projects coming out; one is a new gas pipeline passing through Kars and Erzurum in Turkey, another is the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway. But in the long term, more diversification is needed in the economy. One day the crude oil will run out, and Azerbaijan needs to produce, manufacture, and export things other than oil and gas.</p><h4>During the recent global economic crisis, did you notice any fall off in demand? What strategies did you implement to maintain market share and further improve business?</h4><p>NH The global economic crisis hit our market with a delay of three to four months compared to the rest of the world. By taking into account that most business in Azerbaijan is based on projects, which are tendered in the market, the main players managed to maintain the same level of activity throughout the downturn.</p><p>However, local SMEs were definitely affected and we did notice a fall off in demand for airfreight services. We did our utmost to accommodate our customers' requests in order to secure tonnage and revenues with a clear focus on regaining profitable operations.</p><h4>How is the customs situation in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Bİ In our first year here, customs regulations and rules were virtually non-existent. Now we know what is what, how much of what kind of product is taxed, and what the import regulations are. A new method in use, which we have just started using in Azerbaijan as well, is consolidated cargo, whereby high-density cargo and volume cargo are mixed together and space is bought from airlines under a single airway bill. The consolidators are then able to make better profits.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the airfreight market in Azerbaijan in 2011 and beyond?</h4><p>NH Azerbaijan has one of the fastest growing economies in the region in terms of airfreight demand. The advantage of the geographical position of Azerbaijan makes Baku the main airfreight hub for the Caspian and Central Asian region. Our outlook for the airfreight market is very positive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the Azerbaijani construction market so unique?<br></h4><p><strong>AZAD IBRAHIMOV </strong>Azerbaijan is moving closer to European standards in terms of construction. Our aim is to reach European standards in the construction of buildings, and protect Azerbaijani architecture. Therefore, we would like to merge modern technologies in the construction sector with a certain leaning towards Azerbaijan's architectural heritage.</p><p><strong>RAHIM SULTANOV</strong> We deal with a huge variety of clients with different tastes. However, most of them prefer a classical style. Buildings constructed by Caspian Service feature exclusive materials, including Azerbaijani pit-run stone. This is a component with which we have had much success, and it fits superbly with the city's classic architecture and works in harmony with the older buildings. We really do take into account the smallest details, working to create comfortable layouts for our apartments and public areas, with a diversity of choice and high-quality construction.</p><h4>What do you believe are some of the major challenges facing the construction sector?</h4><p><strong>AI</strong> Of course, in every area, there are some challenges. The global economic crisis also affected Azerbaijan. However, we are considered trustworthy; we always keep our promises, and deliver our orders on time. These days it is hard to sell apartments because home loan interest rates are so high. They should be reduced a little more. Now the government is taking care of the issue, talking with the Central Bank and trying to make it easier for people to buy their own homes.</p><p><strong>RS</strong> The government doesn't have much influence on this sector of the economy, as it is mostly private companies operating in this field. There are some problems with high interest rates on bank credit and short credit repayment tenors on mortgage or home loans. That is the major challenge that needs to be overcome. Therefore, if the government takes some measures to regulate this program, it will considerably revive the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the effects of privatization on your bank? Has there been a new wave of competition within the Iranian banking industry as a result?<br></h4><p><strong>JAHROMI</strong> The very first impact of privatization was a significant increase in the productivity and efficiency of the bank as well as the interest that the bank received. We have been released from complicated government regulations and the bank is now making all decisions through its board and assembly. This has affected the speed of decision making and consequently the satisfaction of our customers and clients. We have developed a five-year strategy plan for the bank to know what to do in corporate banking, where we are planning to reach in international banking, our direction in private banking, and also in e-banking. The strategy plan covers all these areas. We have focused on the expansion of very exclusive services and plan to increase our share of the banking market in Iran so that we can even surpass our biggest rival in the next five years. Bank Saderat of Iran (BSI) consists of 30 independent provincial banks. In the future, we aim to preserve this structure as it facilitates decision-making and through this structure we are able to respond to the different needs of different provinces. Yet, we also have plans to increase the cost-effectiveness of this structure.</p><p><strong>TAGHI</strong> <strong>NATTAJ</strong> Considering the huge potential for banking in Iran and also the huge number of customers, competition isn't really the issue for now. Also, the older the bank, the greater the trust, prestige, and value the bank has in the eyes of customers and the public. When you've been around 20 years and have 7 million customers, this induces trust and confidence.</p><p>One of the reasons for Bank Mehr's success has been our ability to look to the future. I've been at Mehr for eight years now, and I know that even before that there was always a vision among the board members and upper management. EFQM is one of the models we are following to give us the best possible direction and to make our management model as efficient as possible. But we are also practicing other standards and strategies, not because it's compulsory or a requirement set by the Central Bank of Iran, but because we want to apply the latest strategies that are applied in banks around the world. This is part of Bank Mehr's vision, and it's a part of our desire to always look to the future. We believe this is something that distinguishes us from other institutions, something that has enabled us to survive and prosper over 20 years.</p><p><strong>AFZALI</strong> I think full privatization will be very positive for Post Bank. It is a good process for all financial institutions because I think that the levels of efficiency and productivity we can achieve are more than for state institutions. I think undergoing this process will be very useful for productivity. As you know we had a policy shift with the change in Article 44 of the Constitution. Post Bank is one of the banks that had to be privatized, and we are now a private bank. Around 25% of this bank is held by the Adalet Investment Company. Future share parcels will be offered to the private sector in 2010 and 2011, and this will mean that Post Bank will become fully privatized.</p><h4>Is Iran an under-banked country? What sort of means are you using to increase your deposit base, and which groups are you targeting?</h4><p><strong>JAHROMI</strong> We are focusing on e-banking more. By using electronic banking we can reduce costs. We have reduced our branches by 200 in the last year and by a half since starting privatization. We have it in mind to reduce these numbers even further and focus on e-banking and virtual business.</p><p>Given Iran's young population, the rate of population growth, and BSI's reputation and history, we have even more people interested in opening accounts. We currently have 34 million accounts. We have given out 15 million debit and credit cards to these account holders. As the trend is increasing, we have plans to increase from 15 million debit and credit cards to 20 million by the end of this Iranian year (1389).</p><p><strong>TAGHI NATTAJ</strong> This depends on the needs of the customers and also which socio-economic strata they belong to. We don't target a particular segment of society—we offer different plans, products, and services to suit different needs. Right now we have 7 million customers. The first category is families. We don't really expect savings from individuals below the age of 30. We expect those savings to come from parents. Above 30 is where individuals begin to have their own independent finances and can have their own savings. From there on they will be consumers. For the first category, families, we have different kinds of savings accounts enabling parents to invest in their children's future security. Later on, their children can benefit from these savings. For the second category, we offer loans to attract their savings into fixed-deposit or other types of accounts. We offer short- and long-term commercial loans for both individuals and companies.</p><p><strong>AFZALI</strong> We have a very good system for promotion and education in this area. When we are going to open a branch in a village, we launch a local promotion to introduce our services and the advantages of working with us to the people living in these areas. We use television advertisements, brochures, and pamphlets to explain to the public what our services are. But I think the education level of our people, even those living in rural areas, is high. Some of them ask for internet facilities from us. Traditional banking services such as the opening of accounts and payment services are simple to provide and are very popular. In our targets, providing these services is an ongoing program. Because of the infrastructure in rural areas, it is not hard to give these services to them. If the rural areas have internet facilities, they can use these services. We have core banking in these areas and giving these kinds of services is not very difficult.</p><h4>What are your policies with regards to credits and loans?</h4><p><strong>JAHROMI</strong> We finance projects in two ways: we directly collaborate in implementing projects or we give financial facilities to those interested in starting their own projects. Currently, we have six holding companies and through these holding companies we start projects. We mainly collaborate in projects that have fast returns on investment. Depending on the speed of the return of the investment we have been involved in projects in the petrochemicals, gas, steel, rail, electricity, and mining sectors, and even in the commercial sector.</p><p>We already have a lot of good investments in big projects, and we are also working extensively with SMEs. It is natural that given our vast resources we will be more efficient than other Iranian banks. And given the large number of branches of BSI, even in small cities and villages, people will refer to the bank and naturally the bank will respond to their needs.</p><p><strong>TAGHI NATTAJ</strong> Around 60% of our resources go to offering loans to individuals, and 20% of our resources are invested in the stock market. The rest goes into real estate.</p><p><strong>AFZALI</strong> Microfinance is one aspect of retail banking in terms of lending. We are not the only provider of microfinance in Iran, but we are the biggest. Microfinance is one aspect of retail banking. At first we focus on microfinance in terms of lending. Then we focus on small customers and their deposits. We focus in these terms on retail banking. We have a rule in Post Bank: all of the deposits should be mobilized for rural areas. All of the deposits we mobilize from rural areas are provided back as loans to facilitate rural development. People living in Iran's rural areas do not hesitate from taking advantage of the credit products we offer. Most of them are using these facilities to improve their farming activities, such as buying animals to increase the family income, or buying farming implements and machinery like cars or tractors—equipment that makes farming activities easier.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What process do you use to assess the suitability of a candidate?<br></h4><p><strong>RÉMY DE CAZALET</strong> I ask all my consultants to meet at least 20 candidates a week. When we meet a candidate, we help them think about the next step in their professional careers. In the UK 80% of recruitment is outsourced. In Turkey it is only around 2% to 5%. For these reasons we have to be more focused on the client here. Companies must understand we are here to help them. After initial communication we provide consultation on their requirements. Sometimes they want a candidate with huge experience, but don't want to pay for it. We then advise them on their options by educating them about the market. We target people who are not looking for a job through head hunting, people who are passively looking for a job through our database, and people who are actively looking through newspapers and websites in which our positions are advertised. We filter candidates through CV analysis, telephone, and face-to-face communication to produce a shortlist. Contract negotiations follow and post-hire monitoring lasts up to year. This makes sure the candidate and the client are happy. We measure our success on both of these results. Our success rate has been around 80% in Turkey.</p><p><strong>YASİN ALTUNKAYA</strong> We apply an eight-step methodology entitled "the art of identifying talent". During initial discussions, we advise company representatives on the areas in which they are lacking talent and present a suitable forward strategy. When the project begins, the company will brief us on its specific needs. Related to that discussion we identify the profile required together and start the search. We identify appropriate targets. Then we begin interviews and assess candidates through various stages from both their perspective and an employer's. It takes roughly 10 to 12 weeks to place a manager.</p><h4>How did you see the global economic crisis impact Turkey, and which sectors have been increasingly hiring since?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong> Turkey exited the crisis before its European neighbors and this is partly attributable to the shifting of the business focus to Asia. We have since seen the energy sector pushing a lot; retail is exploding and construction is also seeing another boom. There are a lot of retail design companies that are looking for foreign designers, and this represents a huge opportunity too.</p><p><strong>YA</strong> We passed through 2009 quite well. We saw a 20% decrease in our business, yet in general the market decreased around 45%. Since the crisis, the finance sector has been very active. Finance-related companies are trying to find the right employees who can carry these companies forward. For the upcoming years the supply chain will be increasingly important. Also, the HR function will become increasingly popular as companies learn about the importance of their employees as assets.</p><h4>What challenges exist in the Turkish HR sector in terms of finding the right person for a job?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong>  I think we can find highly suitable candidates for all positions in Turkey. Turks are increasingly seeking education abroad and bringing these skills back to the country. Due to its population, Turkey can meet any kind of demand.</p><p><strong>YA</strong> The history of the business world in Turkey goes back to the 1950s. This challenge is related to the learning curve. We still see companies struggling to understand what their real assets are. In any economy around the world, the main assets are capital, natural resources, and human resources. Turkish companies do not pay enough attention to the human resources factor. For these reasons we can often see people in the wrong jobs, as their skills have not been assessed sufficiently.</p><h4>What regulation changes would you like to see in Turkish labor laws?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong>  We are waiting for new laws on temporary workers, and we are in social dialogue with the government to support this issue. With our colleagues from other recruitment companies, we have tried to explain the advantage of this new regulation. Unemployment is around 15% here and we truly believe that if we can apply a solid legal framework to the temporary workforce it would reduce the unemployment rate.</p><p><strong>YA</strong> There are gaps in the laws regulating the temporary workforce. As a board member of the Private Employment Bureau Association, we have been actively involved in lobbying and prepared a draft law that has been largely misinterpreted by the media. Our draft law was based on the German model. It will probably be passed as soon as there are increasing reforms aimed at EU harmonization. Turkey will need this law in the upcoming five years. The challenge here is to convince the media that it represents a huge opportunity for the Turkish economy.</p><h4>In what ways have you assisted foreign companies in Turkey with their HR needs?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong> We recently supported H&amp;M in coming to Turkey to open its first stores. We placed around 20 managers. We have worked in retail with French companies Decathlon, Leroy Merlin, and Peugeot. We are also working with DIA, part of the Carrefour group. Turkey is a market where it is getting more and more complicated to find suitable candidates despite the large population. It is difficult to find people with experience in multinational companies. We have to help companies find the right people from this pool, and our international and local experience is crucial in this process.</p><p><strong>YA</strong> We don't just do business in Turkey but also in the surrounding region. We are currently engaged in four projects in Kazakhstan, two in Russia, and in 2010 we did a project in Japan. We are a highly diverse company. We are engaged in bringing foreigners to Turkey, though this is a small operation in comparison to our activities in sending senior Turkish managers abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You became the Chairman of Deva Holding in 2006 and its CEO in 2008 during a time of great change. How has the company's strategy been refined, and what are your long-term targets?</h4><p><strong>PHILIPP HAAS </strong>My long-term targets are to develop Deva even further as one of the leading Turkish pharmaceutical companies. In a very crowded market our share is 5.5% on a volume basis. We are a dynamic company that is bringing a lot of new products to the market every year. My other target is to become a world generics player. We built brand new state-of-the-art facilities that have been fully operational since 2009 after an investment of more than $100 million.</p><h4>How significant is Turkey within GlaxoSmithKline's global operations?</h4><p><strong>YİĞİT GÜRÇAY</strong> Like many companies in the pharmaceutical industry and elsewhere, we are going through a difficult phase in the US and European markets. Emerging markets are generally seen as the source of growth in the world. For GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Turkey is currently one of the biggest operations in the emerging markets. We expect significant growth from the Turkish market for the next 5-10 years. For GSK, Turkey is a key market and one in which we plan to invest.</p><h4>What is going to be the focus of your companies' R&amp;D facilities in the coming years?</h4><p><strong>PH</strong> We are one of the few companies with oncology capabilities already, but we are also planning a large R&amp;D project for new oncology products worth some TL60 million. The new facility will be one of the most modern facilities in the world. We are also just months away from launching a new range of inhaler products. Respiratory care is a key growth area for us besides the provision of oncology-related products. The needs of the respiratory care segment are growing in Turkey and worldwide. These are two key areas for us and they have helped shape our R&amp;D strategy, which we believe will lower Turkey's need to import pharmaceutical products.</p><p><strong>YG</strong> GSK is among the leading research based pharmaceutical companies both in drugs and vaccines. Our R&amp;D operation to develop innovative, efficient drugs and vaccines to improve the quality of life is a basic part of GSK. The classical pharmaceutical model has focused primarily on blockbusters. However, GSK has recently reshaped that strategy. Looking to the future, GSK will still have some blockbusters, but our focus will also be on having a diversified portfolio. We are trying to establish a portfolio, not depending on blockbuster drugs, but rather much more balanced in terms of diverse categories. These may be much smaller, even niche categories, but it is important for us to explore the unaddressed needs of patients. Increased scrutiny of the pharmaceutical industry in recent years has meant that the amount of work being done on new molecules is increasing in a major way, but fewer products are coming through the pipeline. A more diversified portfolio will allow us to balance risk on the business side and create more benefits for patients.</p><p>I'm glad to say that GSK's approach to R&amp;D is already starting to bear fruit in the shape of a very strong and rich pipeline. By the end of 2010 we had 30 important R&amp;D programs at Phase 3, 20 of them new molecules or vaccines. Within the next two years there will be 15 more drug and vaccine programs at Phase 3.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the generics market in Turkey and internationally?</h4><p><strong>PH</strong> The important trend we have seen in the Turkish market, as well as internationally, has been that of generic substitution. In Turkey, the market penetration rate of generic label medical products is only about 50%, while in the US it is 90%. As we see more patents expiring, more doors will open up for the expansion of the generic pharmaceutical industry.</p><p><strong>YG</strong> For one we can count on the GSK emerging market structure, in which we have a number of global partners for the generics business, like Dr. Reddy's Pharmaceutical Company, Aurobindo from India, and Aspen Pharma from South Africa. We also have a number of local activities. For example, in Argentina a local generics company has been acquired. The same applies for Mexico, where a major dermatology company has been acquired. There are some imminent projects in which GSK is looking for options to expand the generics business. If you put this together with GSK's infrastructure and our emerging market capabilities, we have a strong competitive advantage.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the sector and the pharmaceuticals market in general?</h4><p><strong>PH</strong> I am very pleased with our performance, especially in terms of our position in the market. I am also very pleased with the re-structuring we have carried out at Deva Holding. We have positioned our company in a way that will ensure that we prevail in the market in the future. We are looking especially for long-term sustainability and long-term growth. I believe that over the last few years we have built the foundation on which we can carry the company forward to a bright future.</p><p><strong>YG</strong> GSK has secured double-digit growth in Turkey over the last few years, although 2010 was an exception due to pricing pressure. This factor had a major impact on many companies, particularly innovative ones. Following a growth phase from 2007 to 2009, 2010 was flat for us in terms of value turnover despite the fact that volumes have grown strongly. Looking forward it will be a balance between volume and price. We expect continued volume growth and hope to see controlled price reductions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the state of the non-life insurance sector in Turkey?<br></h4><p><strong>MİNE AYHAN</strong> There are 55 insurance companies operating in Turkey, offering pension, life, non-life, health, and other kinds of insurance. There are also 14,000 agencies and intermediaries, both tied agencies and multi-mandates. Tied agencies are exclusive agencies. We also have brokers, around 45 of them. The top five are the global ones. Around 65% of all premium production is via agencies, 10-15% from banks, and 10-15% from brokers, but the dominant distribution channel is agencies. The motor business dominates, even though it's loss making. The non-motor business, especially property policies for industrial risks, is the most attractive for insurance companies now. Everybody's going for that sector to balance the loss-making motor business.</p><p><strong>LEVENT ÅžİÅžMANOĞLU</strong> The insurance market has been growing by around 20% nominally over the last six or seven years. In real terms this represents more than 8% growth every year. It is expected to increase by 15% or more, nominally, in 2011 and in the upcoming years. The predicted rate of inflation is 5-7%, meaning that real growth will be around 8-10% annually. This is mainly due to new construction projects. In that respect, engineering insurance lines are growing faster than all other lines now. Transport projects are also growing very quickly, and so the total industry will experience a nice growth rate in these two lines. After developments in these areas are complete, other growth lines will be brought into the picture, such as fire, liability, and employer liability insurance. Another area where we see growth is in professional indemnity policies for doctors, architects, lawyers, and accountants. We expect this area to grow very rapidly in the coming three to five years.</p><h4>The sector as a whole in Turkey made a loss in 2010 even though penetration rates increased. Considering this, do you feel premiums are rationally priced?</h4><p><strong>MA</strong> The quality of the risks determines the premium rates. When we consider the quality of the risks involved in Turkey, the premiums come across as too low, perhaps by 5% to 10%. Because of the low margins of companies, especially after 2007, they have tried to cut costs, and safety measures are the first thing a lot of companies cut back on when trying to reduce costs. But that in turn means that our premiums will have to be higher and we will have to charge these companies more. So when we consider all that, when we consider that the risks are not good, the premiums seem low. If the risks were better, these premium prices would be fine. But as you say, the sector as a whole made a loss in 2010, and that means premiums are low.</p><h4>What has been the impact of regulatory changes in the Turkish insurance industry?</h4><p><strong>LÅž</strong> The insurance sector didn't have specific regulatory laws in Turkey until 2007. The new requirements, which are very contemporary, have helped to develop the market. Life and pension companies are under the strict control of the regulatory authorities. The insurance business is audited regularly. The companies have their own internal audit and control departments and build their own risk management systems. We are entering a new era in the insurance business and are more cautious. As well, in terms of asset and risk management we pay more attention to external effects.</p><h4>In what lines do you see the most potential for growth and profitability?</h4><p><strong>MA</strong> The property business, some engineering lines, and some package policies for SMEs look attractive. Many banks are offering specialized products for SMEs. Many don't require insurance, but we try and target them anyway, and the competition is fierce at that level. Various individual lines are also important for us. However, after the crisis, many companies cut back on costs, and that had a negative effect on the insurance sector.</p><h4>Motor insurance in Turkey has been growing in size, but losing money across the board. Do you feel there should be a change in the premium structure?</h4><p><strong>LÅž</strong> Nowadays we feel some changes are afoot because of the losses over 2010. Naturally, the motor lines will continue to increase. We have some 14 million insurable houses in Turkey. Around 3.2 million of those houses have compulsory earthquake insurance. For all other types of policies, such as fire and theft, the total industry has 2.5 million policies. We find the penetration rate is very low and so we should look for a higher level of penetration in these retail lines of business. In motor lines this is not the case. Total motor damage policies are around 3.5 million. If you look at the portfolio of registered vehicles—14 million—half of them are younger than a decade old. The penetration rate is 50% and data is provided by a central database that was founded by the Association of Insurance Companies. Each company reports to this database on a daily basis by electronic transfer, showing all types of claims. The online central database, called Tramer, gives access to everyone through the web. For example, if there is a potential new customer, it will show the history of his or her last insurer and the types of claims made so that I can adjust my price accordingly. This does not exist on continental Europe.</p><h4>What's your forecast for the Turkish economy?</h4><p><strong>MA</strong> I think the economy will grow at a stable rate in 2011. I expect a nominal growth of 10-15% in the insurance industry, so factoring in inflation, real growth will come to anything between 5% and 10%, although it is very unlikely that it will grow by 10%. Life and pension providers might be able to paint a more optimistic picture as they are happier than us in general.</p><p><strong>LÅž</strong> According to the government's three-year development plan announced in September 2010, it was planning to close 2010 with a 6.8 % growth rate. The growth rate was actually 8.9%. It also expected a real-term growth rate of 5-6% yearly, followed by an inflation rate of 5-7% yearly. The main problem of growth in Turkey is related to the current account deficit, which is around 7% of GDP. The government is in a position to choose between the unemployment rate, which is around 10-11%, and the current account deficit, which helps economic growth. This current account deficit is widened mainly due to investment goods and Turkish energy needs—petroleum specifically. The country should find a solution to its petroleum needs domestically and lower its energy imports. Another challenge Turkey faces is its young population, with a high proportion between 10 and 18 years old. The average age of 29 years will increase quickly to 36-40 very quickly, and so Turkey must ensure that these younger people can find stable jobs for the long term. This means new investments to create new jobs. Foreign investment will be very welcome. In 2010, foreign investment was almost ‚¬8 billion and is expected to reach ‚¬10 billion in 2011.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the Istanbul Chamber of Industries top 500 companies list, your company jumped 207 spots in 2010. What is the behind this quick growth?</h4><p><strong>ORHAN TURAN</strong> We export insulation material heavily to 50 countries around the world. We mainly sell to the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, Romania, Greece, Ukraine, and Russia, but we also export to the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium. However, during 2009, while the insulation sector grew by 10%, we succeeded in growing by 34%. I have seen many crises over my time in business, and this allowed me to manage the company through this challenging business period.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the growth of your company from a family run start-up to a holding with 11 companies?</h4><p><strong>OZAN ZİYLAN</strong> First of all, we are mainly a sales-oriented company. That means our customer has priority. We take care of our customers and we do it knowing that if we don't take care of them then somebody else will. Also, we invest in our business. We were very small when we started, but we invested what we earned from all of these businesses into this business again. Because of that, the company has grown.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Turkey's overall export potential?</h4><p><strong>OT</strong> The government has a target for 2023 to export $500 billion from Turkey. I believe we can do this. The last seven years has seen approximately 7% growth. GDP is growing very fast because the Turkish people are very young. Approximately 65% are under the age of 35. We are now working on a road map of how to achieve this target of $500 billion. I am confident because over the last decade we have learned a lot about production, marketing, innovation, and distribution channels. I believe in the next 10 years we will be one of the most important economies, along with India, China,  Russia, and Brazil.</p><h4>What new markets are you looking at?</h4><p><strong>OZ</strong> Export markets are important for us, but we don't forget the Turkish market. Concerning other markets, we are successful in the near European countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and Macedonia. In 2005, we started becoming successful in the Middle East as well, in countries such as Iran, Syria, and Egypt.</p><p>In 2005 and 2006, positive foreign policy initiatives from the government began to improve relations with our Middle Eastern neighbors, and this has increased the potential of those markets dramatically. Also, other important markets include Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, since we share a similar language and culture. Additionally, we have been looking at Latin America more and more recently, and I have been surprised at how well we are received by our clients there. We have dealerships in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, as well as an office in Chile.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to achieve your goal of becoming a global company?</h4><p><strong>OT</strong> Our philosophy is to work hard to become a global company. I fully believe if you want to be successful, first of all you have to work. I am always working, sometimes until midnight or 2:00 am. I like to work, because I'm not only working for myself; I am working for Turkey, and my friends and dealers. I want to push growth because I see the potential.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of MLS?</h4><p><strong>OZ</strong> First of all, we have plans to increase our presence in our operating sectors. We would like to add more products to our spare parts range. The export market is also very significant for our future, and we currently serve 38 countries other than Turkey, and target to increase that to 100 countries. We have some significant expectations for the Africa region, and hope to expand our operations in Latin America and the Middle East. We are also looking into the industrial construction sector, and this is an important target for the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways does your chamber assist its members?<br></h4><p><strong>RAHÅžAN CEBE </strong>Put simply, we are the voice of American business in Turkey. We try to improve American business operations in Turkey. We help them press their interests with the Turkish government, and stay focused on their priorities. That's our job.</p><p><strong>JONATHAN BEARD</strong> We have a comprehensive databank. When somebody is looking for a partner, we can bring up 15 possibilities. We travel all around the country and tell the chairman of the chambers of commerce and industry that their members may be members of our chamber and utilize our resources. Our networking events are also a significant opportunity to build relations. For example, the Lord Mayor of the City of London was one of our guests. Any one of our members can use these opportunities to meet people at the highest levels.</p><h4>What are the main challenges to further increasing trade levels between the country you represent and Turkey?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong> We'd like to see much stronger protection for intellectual property (IP) rights; that's one of our priorities. We believe in strong brands, and although this government has made some positive changes, we'd like greater clarity regarding IP as a strategic and not a tactical concern. We're glad to see a robust dialogue regarding GM foods—this issue will only become more pressing with time. But our number one priority now is IP.</p><p><strong>JB</strong> The obstacle for British companies investing in Turkey is not Turkey. It is British companies' lack of knowledge about Turkey. They don't know how to exactly and efficiently look around for dynamic business partners. Look at the number of British businesses in the Gulf region, in Greece, and Singapore, and then look at the number of British businesses in Turkey. Then, look at other countries. There is failure in Greece, overflow in Singapore, and disastrous events of over-investment without solid foundations in the Gulf. None of that applies here in Turkey.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in trade?</h4><p><strong>RC</strong> Energy is big at the moment. Real estate is also strong, as are financial services and tourism. We are a young organization, just six years old, but growing. During my term as Chairwoman, we've increased our membership by 30%. The future looks bright.</p><p><strong>JB</strong> The multinationals are here in force. They occupy positions at the top of each sector they are in. HSBC and Vodafone are among the top companies in Turkey. BP and Shell are among the top oil companies, Aviva is amongst the top insurance companies—and these are all British firms. We see that these multinationals have come in very strong. They don't come in because of Turkey alone, but because they are huge multinational institutions. Their agenda is different. When we come down, we see a big empty area. There are many SMEs that form part of the larger industrial picture. It is vital that we create more awareness amongst SMEs. There is an opportunity for Britain to be as strong as any trading and investment partner in Turkey. We shall help to develop this at our chamber.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After the Soviet Union collapsed, peoples' lifestyles changed. What trends have you observed in the population's expectations in real estate?<br></h4><p><strong>DASTAN URAKOV</strong> Since the Soviet Union collapsed, a lot changed in consumer demands. Back then 6 sqm was allocated per head in residential projects. We started our minimum square meter per head from 12. We are also dealing with economy class, business class, and elite class housing, and of course since the crisis elite class is not in high demand, and that is why our company has focused on middle class projects.</p><h4>Astana, Almaty, Aktau, and Atyrau all vary in their real estate prospects. What are the opportunities for development in Aktau and Atyrau?</h4><p><strong>MATTHEW BOND</strong> The markets are not very different from one another. They're at different stages in their evolution and they have slightly different supply characteristics. Atyrau and Aktau are very interesting as they're fast growth areas. They've been very resilient to the crisis because they're essentially oil-backed. Oil prices have supported activity there. I think Atyrau and Aktau are two areas where there is significant opportunity on the residential and hotel side, in the retail and office sectors, really in just about all sectors except perhaps the resort sector.</p><h4>As the market picks up, which sectors are acting as engines for growth in the construction sector?</h4><p><strong>DU</strong> The population growth rate in Kazakhstan, especially in Almaty, is around 5%. Additionally, the commercial sector is buying office space as it wants to accumulate assets. This is leading to high sales in the residential and commercial areas in the private sector.</p><h4>What is the state of the class A and B office space market in Almaty?</h4><p><strong>MB</strong> We as a company produce what we consider to be international A-class office space, and that's quite different from the local A-class grade. There is only around 80,000 sqm of international A-class space available, all of which has been developed by us. Occupancy in the remaining A and B offices is around 70% to 75%, so it's recovering.</p><h4>You have stated that you are looking into attracting investors from the Arab world. How are you looking into taking your expertise abroad?</h4><p><strong>DU</strong> Because MAG has good experience and employs best practice standards in Kazakhstan, we are looking at inviting investors from abroad to work with us. At the same time we are trying to establish a first step in Saudi Arabia via joint ventures with local businesses to use our experience in projects to structure our investment plan, construction, and procedures. In Kazakhstan we work with a design company called Waterman, which makes designs for trade centers, and we are also working with French companies to benefit from their international experience.</p><h4>What opportunities will the future hold for the sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>MB</strong> There are many opportunities within the residential sector, and when combined with destination creation, like Chimbulak, we are creating real places to be. Chimbulak is a unique place; it's so close to the city. Medeo could also be a very interesting place for a potential development. Kapchagai Lake is another option, and there's some activity there already. Within a four-hour flight from Almaty you have access to about 1.3 billion people. Sure, there's a limited number of people who have got the right spending power, but even if it's only a small fraction, it's still quite a sizable market. The pure population numbers within this sort of radius are quite interesting. This allows us to solve the perennial problem of a small population in Kazakhstan in terms of investment opportunities. To create a destination is something that is not to be taken lightly. We are changing perceptions, campaigning, and raising international exposure and awareness.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of your company in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>HAISSAM CHRAITEH</strong> Sanofi has had a long history in Central Asia present for more than two decades through representative offices. In 2009 we altered our operations in Kazakhstan from a representative-office-based setup to a local pharmaceutical company. Sanofi-Aventis was the first originator company to make this change in the pharmaceutical sector. We fully act as a local distributing company to wholesalers in the country. This step was encouraged by the government's recent decisions related to further healthcare development in the country. Sanofi and Aventis merged in 2005, though the products of both firms already had an established presence in the market. Sanofi is bringing in innovative medicines related to oncology, diabetes, cardiovascular, and internal diseases medicines for the effective treatment of Kazakhstani patients.</p><p><strong>ARMAN LUKMANOV</strong> Our company was established in 2004 by Canadian and Kazakhstani partners to provide medical services to oil and gas companies in the Kzylorda region. Since then the business has expanded to the mining industry in central Kazakhstan. Later on a major stake in the company was sold to British company Abermed. After Abermed came to Kazanada as a shareholder, Kazanada opened a facility in western Kazakhstan specializing in offshore medical services. Two years ago International SOS of Dubai acquired Abermed, and has become our major shareholder. Kazanada serves local companies and foreign companies from Russia and China. We provide services to the local market and serve Kazakhstani nationals and foreigners who use local medical standards, so we mostly employ Kazakhstani doctors. At the moment we are working in seven regions. In Astana we have 10 people working in our headquarters, while the rest of our team of 200 is spread across Kazakhstan, providing healthcare services in remote areas. We provide medical clinics, ambulances, doctors, paramedics, medicines, and other medical services in remote sites. Also, in some regions, we organize occupational health centers to perform medical checkups for corporate clients. The first clinic we opened was in Atyrau because of the huge demand. According to Kazakhstani law all employees need to have a medical checkup once a year in ordinary local clinics. It is difficult to perform thousands of checkups at local public clinics where there are already many local patients. Hence, at our clinics we work only with corporate clients for their check-up needs.</p><h4>What strengths has the company brought to research in the country?</h4><p><strong>HC</strong> We have a lot of local activities in terms of medical research in different fields. In addition, we also prepare the market for new drugs in the fields of oncology and cardiology. We are quite active through regional interaction and clinical trials with hospitals and local operators. There is a government program called "100 Clinics and 100 Schools", and this is going to be significant for business. The Ministry of Health has announced that an additional $3 billion will be spent on the healthcare sector by 2015. This amount doesn't only cover expenditures and medicines, but also medical infrastructure and equipment. It is an ambitious program, and will include the hiring and training of new nurses and medical staff. Since 2008 Sanofi in Kazakhstan initiated medical awards for the best research in various medical areas contributing to the development of science in the country.</p><h4>How would you define the main challenges you face in your area of operations?</h4><p><strong>AL</strong> Kazakhstan is a huge country with a small population. Our projects are located very far from city centers, sometimes up to 200 kilometers away. Even if we have vehicles, the transport infrastructure network does not work to our advantage. In very remote projects we use helicopters for transport. However, in general we work with 4WD ambulances. If a patient has minor issues, we do it locally. If not, we need to transport the patient to the nearest stationary clinic, and to do so we have our own specially equipped ambulance fleet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tell us about your decision to enter the factoring sector. What growth potential did you see there?<br></h4><p><strong>EMİN HİTAY</strong> In 2009 the factoring sector was $30 billion in size, in 2010 it was $50 billion, and it is expected to become a $100 billion by 2014. I decided to invest in factoring because SMEs are encountering difficulties in working with banks and turning their receivables into cash quickly. I saw a lot of potential and thought that the market growth would continue in this sector. That's why we ventured into this field. I'm very happy with the business at the moment.</p><h4>How did the global financial crisis affect Turkey?</h4><p><strong>SELÇUK YORGANCIOĞLU</strong> I think Turkey came out stronger from the crisis due to two reasons. One reason is that Turkey has a single-party government that can make decisions and execute them with ease. The other reason is that the regulatory bodies have been strengthened, such as the Capital Markets Board (CMB), the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), the energy regulator, the competition board, and the Banking Regulation and Supervisory Board (BRSA), which should get a lot of credit for pushing banks in the right direction during the recent crisis. These institutions are of the same quality as regulators in Western countries. As a result of strong single-party government, a well-functioning regulatory system, healthy banks, and awareness in the retail and corporate industry, Turkey has survived the crisis better than other countries in the region. Another thing to add is that Turkey isn't highly leveraged, especially compared to other countries in Europe, particularly southern Europe. Also, Turkish corporates and retailers are used to doing business with their own cash, and traditionally there's far less reliance on banking capital. That meant that companies have managed to get through the crisis without any major corporate defaults. In the last 20 years, education has improved significantly, wealth accumulation has grown, and Turkey has begun benefiting from its geographical position between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Until 10 years ago our business relations with the Middle East were very minimal, and that's changed significantly. Turkey has also become closer to the EU, at least commercially and economically. I think that has to continue and we should continue to strive for full EU membership.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your transaction with Intralot of Greece?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> In 2002 we won a bid to take over the Spor Toto betting organization in Turkey, It only had pari-mutuel games with $17 million in annual revenues at the time. Our consortium evolved as Inteltek A.Åž. following the winning of the privatization tender and we created Iddaa, which is the first  "fixed-odds betting" platform in Turkey. We then partnered with a Greek company called Intralot that had experience in fixed-odds betting. In partnership with Intralot we had big success with Iddaa in Turkey and our revenues in the first year, 2004, were $164 million, while the second year's revenues jumped to $985 million. We then decided to sell our 20% share in Inteltek to Intralot for $80 million.</p><p>Around the same time we established Bilyoner.com, which is an online betting platform on which people can bet Iddaa online, buy lottery tickets, and bet on horse racing. In 2010, Inteltek posted revenues of $2.5 billion. I still own a 20% share in Bilyoner.com, and it has been a spectacular success story. A lot of people look at this transaction as a model.</p><h4>Can you tell us a bit about your hospital investment, Acıbadem?</h4><p><strong>SY</strong> Health care is a growth market, and Turkey is a pioneer in the region due to the quality of its doctors and nurses. We figured Turkey would be a good hub to begin with. When you look at health care here, though, it seems disorganized and it's difficult to find companies that have good corporate governance and financial discipline. Looking across the whole region, we identified Acıbadem as the right candidate for us. It has good corporate governance and financial discipline. When we went in with Acıbadem it had six hospitals. By the end of 2010 it had 11 hospitals and eight polyclinics, with two more due to open in 2011. It was able to invest during the crisis and expand its business. We're currently negotiating some more add-on opportunities. The good thing about health care is, like I said, inelastic demand. As long as you provide the right kind of quality, you sell whatever you produce.</p><h4>You obviously saw great potential in the IT sector. Where do you see that sector going today?</h4><p><strong>EH</strong> There are now about 30 million internet users in Turkey. Turks use it mainly as a source of information, shopping, email, and social media. There are a lot of internet companies, but most of them are copies of international peers. That's the trend worldwide.</p><h4>How important is Turkey for Abraaj Capital?</h4><p><strong>SY</strong> Very important due to its size. It's the second largest economy in our portfolio after India. It's also the longest established democracy in our region with a very stable market. Our investor base likes seeing the blend of Turkey, Egypt, India, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, and the UAE. The interaction between these countries continues, and Turkey plays a key role in this interaction and regional integration. Turkey will keep getting more and more important.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the Turkish fund industry, and how will it mature?<br></h4><p><strong>DR. GÜRMAN TEVFİK</strong> In Turkey there are two different types of mutual funds: one is set up for pension purposes, the other is structured for investment purposes. One can be promoted by pension companies, the other only by banks and brokerage firms. This means the regulatory environment is different than in the US and Europe. Pension funds are a new subject in Turkey, and the third pillar pension system only got started in late 2003. In Turkey, the first pillar system was common before. It's like the social security system in the US, which is also a first pillar system. In Turkey, the total volume of the third pillar pension system's fund assets reached TL13 billion. The first pillar system isn't deemed adequate for pension needs, that's why the third pillar system was brought in. In Turkey there is also second pillar, a few companies have it, including our mother company İş Bank. Our second pillar pension fund owns 46% of the bank's shares, and so our employees are also stakeholders in the company via this pension system.  The third pillar is now getting a lot of attention. There are 2.4 million people in the third pillar and it's growing fast.</p><p><strong>DİDEM GORDON</strong> Time will tell. Currently, around 80% of Turkish mutual funds are in money market funds. Over 75% of household wealth is in deposits in the financial system. This implies that there isn't a very long-term investment horizon. However, with the start of the private pension funds in 2003, there is hope. Now, the private pensions system, even though it is voluntary, has reached about TL12.4 billion, and it is growing every year in terms of net asset flows and also in terms of performance. I think this started to bring about a longer investment horizon; a critical turning point, I think. I expect a similar trend, longer-term investment, and more sophisticated product distribution in the mutual funds sector. I think if economic stability is preserved, more than half of our mutual funds should be in non-money market funds in five years from now. I am not saying that the money market funds are not going to be one of the big instruments in the market. However, I think other products, such as equity products, balanced funds, asset allocation funds, hedge funds, and other products will grow at a higher rate than money market products in the coming years. This will change the Turkish capital markets scene a bit. Currently, over 60% of the free float in the stock exchange is owned by foreign institutions. The remaining percentage is mostly Turkish individuals. Our sector, the fund industry, has a very small share. However, when we analyze developed markets and some of our developing neighbors in Europe, we see that local institutional investors started to get a higher share of equity investments in their local markets. This is bound to happen in Turkey, too. When it does, it will reduce the vulnerability of our capital markets and economy to foreign capital inflows.</p><h4>Do you anticipate that Turkey's credit rating will be investment grade anytime soon?</h4><p><strong>GT</strong> If we look at the combined current account and budget deficits for the US it comes to 12.4% of GDP. In Greece it is 11.9%, in the UK 10.7%, Spain 10.5%, and Turkey 9.8%. But when you look at S&amp;P ratings the US is AAA-, Greece is BB-, and Turkey BB. Spain's rating is AA. Spain's 10-year bond yield is 5.28%, and in Turkey it is 5.11%. And yet Spain gets an AA rating, while Turkey gets a BB rating. It is hard to understand why ratings agencies don't reflect these figures. According to the market, Turkey's bonds should be investment grade. It should be at least single A. I suppose the main issue here is politics.</p><h4>What is your view of the regulatory framework for asset management in Turkey, and do you anticipate changes in the near future?</h4><p><strong>DG</strong> Yes I do, actually. As the Vice-Chairman of the Turkish Institutional Investment Managers Association, and head of the regulatory framework committee, I am actively involved in efforts to develop the fund business in Turkey. As representatives of the industry, we work on various proposals in respect to current regulation and fiscal policies governing institutional investors in Turkey. Our target is to bring our regulatory framework in parallel with those of developed markets, such as UCIT practices. We expect regulatory changes sometime in the second half of 2011. The Turkish Capital Markets Board is quite proactive and supports the industry with a vision to grow the capital markets. I believe we have come a long way, and we are close to reaching best practices in terms of industry structure and regulatory framework as well as the taxation of collective investment instruments. I am hoping that this will start taking place in 2011.</p><h4>Is the corporate bond market in Turkey beginning to show signs of a resurgence?</h4><p><strong>GT</strong> The corporate bond legislation is very old. In the past no corporation wanted to issue corporate bonds. Also, corporate bonds had a disadvantage vis-í -vis government bonds due to taxation. There was an income tax of between 15% and 35% for any individual who wanted to invest in corporate bonds. Meanwhile, government bondholders were exempt from tax. No companies were able to handle the high interest rates and the taxation. Now, in a low-inflation environment and with low interest rates and also with equal taxation for both government and corporate bonds the situation is fair for corporate bonds.</p><h4>Do you feel that Turkey is still vulnerable to the risks of so-called "hot money"?</h4><p><strong>DG</strong> I think most emerging economies are subject to this risk, especially those with above average growth rates such as Turkey. The FDI into Turkey has been quite strong in recent years, which is very positive. Turkey has managed to be a less vulnerable country over the past eight years in terms of economic development and infrastructural reforms. The portfolio investments into Turkey, naturally, are affected by global market conditions as well as country specific performance. Turkey, running a current account deficit and influenced by high petroleum prices, can be influenced negatively by the outflow of portfolio investments regardless of the reasons for the outflow.</p><p>This is, again, why we should grow the institutional investor base to make our capital markets less fragile. But if you look at the investment risk of Turkey compared to some developing markets, and even some European markets, I think we are in a significantly better position to attract foreign portfolio investments, even though they are likely to slow down over the short term. A continuing focus on economic stability, creating employment, and new reforms in social security and the pension system should help Turkey positively differentiate itself from other emerging markets and become less vulnerable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your bank's main activities in Turkey?<br></h4><p><strong>NEZİH AKALAN</strong> We inaugurated the Turkey Representative Office in December 2006. We are trying to generate more in the trade finance business for Doha Bank Qatar, so our main activity is letters of guarantee. By advising Turkish construction companies on their bid-bond letters of guarantee, we are helping them to increase their capacity to participate in tenders for Qatari projects. Also, once they are in Qatar for a project, they can get credit directly from Doha Bank rather than a Turkish bank. This is a huge advantage for Turkish companies because it means that only one bank will be involved in the guarantee transaction. This reduces their commission fees by at least half.</p><p><strong>ANDREAS SCHRÖTER</strong> Today's main focus is to accompany and to finance Turkey's modernization process with a special focus on energy, infrastructure, diversified industries, and financial institutions. Based on the intensity of Turkish-German business relations we have supported German and Turkish companies in financing their projects and investments for some 20 years. In combining our regional capabilities with our global sector and distribution expertise, we are able to support the Turkish economy to finance local major projects abroad and the German economy in its endeavors to invest in Turkey either via direct investments and projects, or to support exports.</p><p><strong>ÅžEBNEM TÜRKAY</strong> We are a one-branch operation established in 1983 primarily for the purpose of promoting trade between Turkey and Pakistan. The idea behind setting up this branch was for Pakistan to have a representative office in Turkey so that the two countries could promote trade via a bank that could facilitate it. We are working with medium to large Turkish corporations that are not only trading with Pakistani firms, but also in other countries where Habib Bank has operations. We are present in 25 other countries, and are especially strong in Asia and Africa. These countries are usually difficult to operate in, so we think we have a niche market where we can add value for our clients. We have a commercial banking license in order to collect deposits, but because we are not a retail bank this activity is rather small. We mainly provide Turkish and foreign currency loans for trade financing purposes to local corporations, and these loans usually have a one-year tenor. We do short-term business and also provide letters of guarantee to contractors and letters of credit for the importation of goods and services from different countries where we are present. It is traditional trade finance banking for corporate clients.</p><h4>How would you assess the trade and investment relationship between Turkey and your bank's home country?</h4><p><strong>NA</strong> The relationship between Turkey and Qatar is flourishing and developing quickly. Turkish construction companies, in particular, have a very strong presence in Qatar. Twenty of the top 100 construction companies in the world are Turkish, so this is an important sector for the country. TAV Construction is building the New Doha International Airport together with Taisei, a Japanese company. This is a $6 billion project. Tekfen is developing the $700 million North Road Project. The Islamic Museum and the Qatar National Convention Center were built by Baytur Construction. STFA Group is also involved in port construction. The major Turkish construction companies are in Qatar and they are performing well, which will bring new projects. There is also the potential for Qatar to invest in Turkish projects. Qatar just increased its LNG production to 77 million tons per annum, which yields a huge surplus in current account terms. It has a strong ability to invest not only domestically, but also internationally. In 2010 its outgoing FDI was $22 billion. Turkey needs to find ways of getting a share of these investments.</p><p><strong>AS</strong> Turkey and Germany not only have strong ties historically—after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and World War I, Germany supported Turkey on the military side—they also for a long time are very close trade and investment partners, dealing in large volumes. In terms of tourism, the south of Turkey is a major destination for Germans, which inspired Fraport—the operator of Frankfurt Airport—to step in and operate Antalya Airport. Last but not least there is a substantial number of Turkish people that have moved to Germany and established a large community and built successful businesses in Germany.</p><p><strong>ÅžT</strong> The trade relationship between Turkey and Pakistan is still very small, though it used to be much smaller back in 1983, around $50 million. It is now around $750 million. The share we have of that trade is around 20%, which is not bad considering there are many other banks locally that can operate in Pakistan.</p><h4>What sectors in Turkey have the most potential to attract this FDI?</h4><p><strong>NA</strong> We see interest from Qatari and Gulf companies in Turkish real estate, such as land, hotels, and shopping malls. However, Turkey needs to develop new projects to attract investment. One project that I have suggested is a free industrial zone for Qatar.</p><p>Qatar wants to develop its non-oil and gas industries, but it often lacks land, by-industries, raw materials, and human capital. Turkey, on the other hand, has a large and diverse industrial base. We could develop special immigration and tax policies, as well as other special laws, so that Qatari companies could utilize this productive capacity for their own investments. If they have excess production, they can export or sell to Turkey. Both sides would benefit.</p><h4>Turkey's sovereign credit rating has improved recently. What are the best indicators of the strength of the banking sector?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> With a capital adequacy ratio of 19.3%, being the highest rate among major emerging market countries, the local banking system is very well capitalized and highly liquid. This is evidenced by the sector's loan/asset ratio of 47.1% and loan/deposit ratio of 80%. It has a widespread deposit base that actually increased by around 10% in 2009 and 2010 due to increased FX deposits by households. Similarly, the sector's total capital rose by 26% and it recorded $12.1 billion of net income, although we do not expect the continuation of such high income levels. The ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) remained at manageable levels of 5.3% in December 2009 (0.9% after reserve allocation), implying an increase from 3.6% in 2007. In any case, the sector is not exposed to the international capital markets, as syndication and securitization borrowings account for less than 10% of total liabilities.</p><h4>Are there any issues regarding regulations hindering trade between Turkey and Pakistan?</h4><p><strong>ÅžT</strong> Pakistan is still a closed economy, and so the transfer of foreign currency is subject to permission from the State Bank of Pakistan, whereas in Turkey these issues have been dealt with and it is an open economy. Has this been stopping the countries from dealing with each other? I don't think so, but then of course it may have an effect in terms of arranging the tenor of transactions or finding the necessary funds. I think rather than the regulations it is the perception of Pakistan that has been a factor in slowing down trade between the two countries. Pakistan has been full of political ups and downs, and security has been an issue for some contractors who are working there, or on the trade side you need to do a lot of groundwork before finalizing a transaction. These factors have slowed down business, but Turkish business people have gone through that now and that way of business has been learned. There is also an increased effort at the governmental level to improve the trade and investment relations between the two countries. That's why I think there are better prospects going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What challenges and opportunities has Kazakhstan's geography presented to your operations?<br></h4><p><strong>BO HALLBERG </strong>Kazakhstan is huge, with a lot of cities. It is very important that you really work in the regions, and try to find your customers. We often travel to Uralsk, about 300 kilometers away, to meet with several clients and show them what the brand is. That has been the main challenge here.</p><p><strong>HENRIK APPELBOM</strong> The size of the country is a challenge in every respect, and we have to plan our resources accordingly. At the same time it is an opportunity. Most of our potential customers are far away. It is difficult for us to access remote corners of the country. We have to adapt to countless business climates. We cannot just duplicate foreign practices in Kazakhstan. We need to have a local approach, and this condition has given us invaluable local knowledge.</p><h4>How would you describe your customer portfolio?</h4><p><strong>BH</strong> Clients are very interested, but they are also very much focused on the price. They focus on the price and do not look at what this truck is going to give them over its life cycle. We have a small network and we can support our clients, but there are some brands that do not even have dealerships. Our clients are companies that run long-haulage operations, but we have also other customers in the form of chains selling various products that they want to transport around the country. We also have customers in the construction sector, and we have sold some buses.</p><p><strong>HA</strong> Our main clients have been from the international transport sector, but lately more and more business is coming from the mining and oil and gas sectors. We work with local companies as well as foreign ones operating in Kazakhstan. Today, most customers who buy our products are somehow related to import-export or natural resources. If you look at the natural resources industry, trucks and machines are just one part of the production line. Our machinery takes extracted materials from point A to B. Through blood, sweat, and tears we have managed to gain many customers in this line of work.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the truck market in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>BH</strong> Western trucks still only represent a small percentage of the market when compared to Chinese trucks. We bring in our trucks from Europe. With our factory in Russia, and the enactment of the Customs Union, it will be easier for us to import trucks, opening up new opportunities. As far as manufacturing is concerned in Kazakhstan, I think that the market has to grow first.</p><p><strong>HA</strong> Volvo has by far the biggest number of Western trucks running in Kazakhstan. The crisis hit the industry hard, and demand all but stopped in 2008, with around 50% of trucks standing still. This also affected the service segment adversely. In 2010 we delivered 145 trucks. In 2009 we delivered 60, and the year before that only two. In 2011 we are looking to grow by a further 100%. At the beginning of 2008, I looked at the competition and saw the opportunity to set the foundations for growth. It afforded us the time to build up our organizational structure, and I knew that we wouldn't be missing out on any huge deals, as there really were none to be made. We focused on customers with their own funding, which were generally from extractive industries. Pre-crisis and mid-crisis, most demand came from the extractive industries. After the economy began to pick up, we started to see more demand for refrigerated trucks. The advent of the Customs Union has reinforced Kazakhstan's geographical advantage in trade, as it is now easier to bring in goods to the Russian market from China through Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Kazakhstan a strong market for logistics?<br></h4><p><strong>YAKUP TUGHRA</strong> This is a growing economy. There are lots of foreign investments and positive hopes for the future. There are two main reasons behind this. The first is the strong government support we are seeing for different industries. I have met with many government officials that I have found helpful and supportive. They also encourage foreign international companies to be involved in the development of this country. This is a very good sign. The second reason is that this country is very rich in terms of minerals and natural resources. It makes sense to come here. There are opportunities for work and development in various sectors. We as a logistics company act as a bridge, and can assist all kinds of clients in many ways. If an upstream oil company sets up operations here, it will need high-tech equipment from many different sources. We therefore offer the best package, as we will do whatever it takes to facilitate operations through innovative solutions.</p><h4>What business opportunities led Move One to launch its operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>SEAN KOSA</strong> Move One first launched its Central Asian operations in Uzbekistan in 2002 as a subcontractor to UPS for shipments to US forces in Afghanistan. Later on, the company followed the market and moved to Kyrgyzstan when military shipments to Afghanistan were rerouted through Manas. As the volume of military cargo gradually decreased in Uzbekistan, the company started to shift focus to relocation services for the expatriate community in the region, making Kazakhstan an obvious market. During that time we also opened up offices in Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, which gave us strategic office locations in all the key countries in the region. What was first established as a representative office in Almaty has now grown into a full-time team of moving and cargo professionals, providing service to key sectors such as oil and gas and mining in Astana and across the Caspian states. Move One's entry into the market brought much needed life and competition to the region, as prior to our entry into the local market the only comparable service provider held a regional monopoly. Although the company has grown to work alongside major global relocation companies, its strength and specialty remains its ability to service remote places. We have made a point of blending our skill in tackling rugged and challenging environments with unmatched personal service. Although Move One engages directly with a company's HR department, the services offered are always specifically tailored to the individual needs of the assignee moving to Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What trends have you observed in trade volumes from Kazakhstan to other CIS countries in the region?</h4><p><strong>YT</strong> Kazakhstan is very well located in terms of connecting Russia, China, Central Asia, and the Caspian Sea region to one another. If a cargo load is brought from one of the said locations to Kazakhstan, it can then be moved all over the world. It is a huge landmass, and it has an important function as our hub due to its proximity to all these regions. From here we can reach other countries easily.</p><h4>What sort of issues do you believe need to be addressed to improve the efficiency of freight transport into and out of Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>SK</strong> Although Kazakhstan is far ahead of the other Central Asian nations in this respect, the infrastructure still leaves a lot to be desired. In regards to road connections to the ports and cargo terminals, there is a long way to go developmentally. Having said that, one of Move One's greatest strengths is in managing the type of issues inherent to emerging market locations. The basic key is having the knowledge base of expert local staff and applying up-to-the-minute international service standards. We do see signs of progress though, such as earlier in 2011 when state-owned national Russian logistics company TransContainer purchased a majority share of Keden Trans Service, the company that operates Kazakhstan's cargo terminals. With the new capital investment that this will represent, the heavily used terminals should be able to put much-needed upgrades in place to make operations more efficient, with the intention of boosting traffic between Central Asia and Europe. The results have yet to be seen, but this does look like a step in the right direction.</p><h4>What opportunities does Kazakhstan's transport sector still hold for foreign investors?</h4><p><strong>YT</strong> Agility has the largest warehouses in the Middle East and Turkey. However, in Kazakhstan, there is not a lot of cold storage with temperature-controlled facilities for food products. For foreign investors, that might be a good niche to look at. Also, for overland transportation, refrigerated trucks are a good target. I am also expecting to see an increase in poultry and livestock projects, and these could be good areas for a foreign investor to look at too. Kazakhstan presents opportunities for companies of all sizes. In terms of industry, production will continue to increase. Kazakhstan is also the best location for marketing products to the region. Furthermore, it has all the necessary means of transportation. Kazakhstan is upgrading much of its logistics infrastructure. Everywhere one looks there are new facilities being developed. It really is a good place for the investor.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2011?</h4><p><strong>SK</strong> Our outlook is overall very positive. Each year, Move One enjoys steady growth in Kazakhstan, and as we move toward our fifth year here we still see huge potential in gaining market share via new customers and broadening the scope of our services. Along with its reputation as a world player in the natural resource sector, Kazakhstan's participation in hosting the OSCE Summit and Asian Games has raised its international profile. This has gone a long way to show the world that it is an attractive destination for investment and new business opportunities. With our strong track record, and fresh approach, we believe that the sky is the limit in Kazakhstan for Move One.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate your company's contribution to upgrading the current grid in Kazakhstan?<br></h4><p><strong>MARLEN ISKAKOVA</strong> Alstom has worked extensively with KEGOC to upgrade the Kazakhstani grid. Alstom has been well known for its grid products throughout Kazakhstan after participating in the KEGOC sub-station modernization tender in 2003. Our experience is based on the delivery of high-voltage equipment financed by a combination of the EBRD and the World Bank, and that project was completed in 2006. During the execution of the first sub-station modernization project, KEGOC announced its intentions to build the first and second overhead lines of 500 kV to transport energy from the north to the south of Kazakhstan. Once again, international banks have been financing this project, and Alstom has been one of the suppliers for that project. There was also another project launched in 2006-2007 in west Kazakhstan for the delivery and construction of 500-kV overhead lines from Kostanay to Aktobe. Western Kazakhstan was supplied mainly from Russia, and KEGOC's idea was to connect the two regions using overhead lines within Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What role do you see for ABB in the unification of Kazakhstan's power grid?</h4><p><strong>ALTAY TOIGANBAYEV</strong> We are in a position to bring leading technology to Kazakhstan's power grid. This is very important because the Kazakhstani network is very outdated. It was built in the mid-1960s and 1970s. The government is currently undertaking a step-by-step modernization of the network, and also building new sub-stations. In that regard, we completed three substations for the Asian Games in Almaty, including the Chimbulak sub-station with gas-insulated switchgear (GIS)—perfect for the high altitude that the sub-station operates at. The government is building new sub-stations because the population is growing, and this is driving demand, and we see this as a natural development. On the other hand, we also offer energy-saving systems, such as variable speed drives and packages for wind power. Wind power has become a hot topic here in Astana. There is plenty of wind-generating potential in this country, and projects are already being developed to harness it.</p><h4>How do you think the increase in demand for power should be met, and what opportunities are there in this field?</h4><p><strong>MI</strong> Coal is an important resource and there should be more investment in its utilization in the near future. There are plans to build a nuclear station on Lake Balkhash. There is also a lot of potential in hydropower plants, and there are a few in eastern Kazakhstan already. The first step is to invest in and modernize the existing infrastructure, and then to build additional power plants. There exists a lot of opportunity for foreign investors in the future development of the sector, and our target is to win as many project bids as possible, in line with our capacity.</p><h4>What is your relationship with your clients from the different sectors?</h4><p><strong>AT</strong> Oil and gas customers are very specific. It's an interesting sector to work in, and the buying patterns of these customers reflect that they are very tough people to please. They have strict terms and conditions and strong safety rules they must adhere to. On the other hand, they are very rewarding customers because they need high-quality equipment, reliability, and functionality. ABB is able to deliver these qualities to its clients. As a result, here in Kazakhstan we have quite a bit of an edge over our competition, because local companies are not as strong in that sense. If you look at the mining sector, it's dominated mostly by local companies. Some of them are very large companies, which is a Soviet-era legacy. We are currently working on a project with Kazakhmys to deliver a gearless mill drive. It will be the biggest in the world. To give you a sense of the size of this project, it will consist of four segments, each one weighing 220 tons that will form a huge mill to crush ore.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the Kazakhstani banking sector?<br></h4><p><strong>ANVAR G. SAIDANOV</strong> I think the financial sector came through the crisis successfully, mostly due to the support of the government. This was not just through capital injections to the major banks, but also through government programs to support SMEs, the real estate sector, and agriculture. However, there is still a lot to be done. One of the major challenges for 2011 is the quality of the loan portfolio. To clean loan portfolios is crucial, and not so easy, because many clients and borrowers are still in a difficult situation. The restructuring of loans to these clients will be the major policy of a number of the big banks. On the other hand, in terms of liquidity, our banking sector is in a pretty comfortable position, even though it's mostly short-term liquidity.</p><p><strong>NINA A. ZHUSSUPOVA</strong> The bank's growth reflects Kazakhstan's evolution because the two have been implicitly intertwined. Kazakhstan declared its independence shortly after the bank's inception and we supported the government in effecting the transition from a central command economy to a more diversified market system. For example, we acted as consultants on the privatization of the oil and gas, processing, telecoms, transport, and energy sectors between 1996 and 1997. We have consistently promoted the economy's growth over the years through lending to businesses of various sizes and in numerous sectors, which has in turn supported our own development.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the government's response to the global financial crisis?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> By 2010, the external debt of three main banks was restructured, namely that of BTA, Alliance, and Temir Bank. After this restructuring process the whole banking sector felt a sense of relief. BTA is one of the three or four biggest banks in Kazakhstan, and all eyes were on the debt restructuring process, from the government, to the market, to creditors, international investors, everyone.</p><p>The approach chosen by the government and Samruk-Kazyna proved to be right. After the restructuring process, which was in accordance with international standards, BTA has emerged as a bank compliant with financial regulations and has maintained its client base.</p><p><strong>NZ</strong> The crisis had global implications. In Kazakhstan, given that we do not have developed capital markets, the government's actions were focused on the banking sector because it is the key to the financial system. If you look at the funding of Kazakhstani banks in general, it is based on short-term domestic funds and long-term wholesale international banking.</p><p>When Kazakhstani banks faced difficulties, first in getting new finance internationally, the role of the provider of long-term funding was taken over by the government. This long-term funding came from the government, and in general we can divide this funding into two parts: firstly, deposits coming from state-owned companies, and secondly, funding coming from the government's stabilization programs. I don't think it is correct to say that the government supported the banking sector. The banks in this situation played an intermediary role, and the government's support was transferred to the non-oil and gas sectors of the economy.</p><h4>What's your outlook for economic development in 2011?</h4><p><strong>AS</strong> I think the general macroeconomic situation is more or less favorable, and when we look at commodity price trends—be it metal prices or oil prices—it all looks good for Kazakhstan. GDP will experience growth, maybe less than in 2010, but it is still expected to be around 4-5%, as estimated by the National Bank. Because of the global oil price, the tenge will strengthen against the dollar. Road Map 2020 will continue to support SMEs, especially manufacturing and export-oriented businesses. The government will focus a lot on infrastructure in the coming years, since Kazakhstan is at the crossroads of trade routes and major economic powers, between Europe, Russia, and China. Our Customs Union with Belarus and Russia will very much influence how our local production will develop in the coming years, as will the continued growth and involvement of China.</p><h4>Are you expecting to see consolidation in the country's banking sector?</h4><p><strong>NZ</strong> Currently, the big banks command the lion's share of the sector. There are certain positives to be gained from absorption and association, and competitive advantages can be earned. I can say, however, that I don't see any particular movement in the sector toward significant consolidation at this time. I believe natural driving factors will reveal themselves over time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Nurbank planning to achieve its goal of increasing the number of its SME and retail clients?</h4><p><strong>RAUAN DAUKENOV</strong> Our portfolio consists of 60% corporate and 40% SME and retail clients. Our main goal is to diversify our portfolio and increase our ratio of SME clients by 50%. It is a challenge, but one that we believe we can achieve. We are going to introduce new products such as trade and treasury financing. We are also going to pursue a strategy of increasing the number of our branches and outlets.</p><h4>How has the non-performing loan (NPL) portfolio of banks improved in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>YERZHAN SHAIKENOV</strong> In March, we had KZT177 billion worth of bad loans, whereas that is now down to KZT109 billion. We did some accounting triggers, writing some of the loans off the balance sheet, because that kind of cleaning is necessary, and you can't just rely on restructuring. Some KZT15 billion was collected from bad loans during 2010. Kazakhstan is a huge country, more than five times the size of France, but with a small population, just one-fifth of Turkey's. The same principals don't work in this country. Our government understands the situation and seeks to help through infrastructure projects, like building new roads and railways. This has brought in foreign investment, especially Chinese. Companies from China are building oil refineries in western Kazakhstan, and these kinds of large-scale projects have also helped SMEs. Temirbank is a medium-sized bank and most of our customers are SMEs and retail customers; we don't have big corporations on our accounts. Those kinds of large-scale investments into infrastructural projects help us a lot as a bank, because most of our customers are contractors or sub-contractors on these kinds of projects. Therefore, this has helped to reduce the number of NPLs we are seeing.</p><h4>How do you see the investment climate in Kazakhstan over the medium term? Which sectors will be attracting investment?</h4><p><strong>RD</strong> I believe that the investment climate will be quite stable. The government is trying to do everything it can to try to bring new investors into the country. The government will continue to encourage the drive to diversify through innovation and new technology, and is supporting investors to further these aims. We expect an increasing number of new investors. It could be in industries from pharmaceuticals and chemicals to agriculture and beyond. Nurbank will embrace this change and move into 2011 offering new, innovative solutions to its customers.</p><h4>What strategies are you employing to carry you forward into the next five years?</h4><p><strong>YS</strong> We will not drastically change our strategy and will remain a retail bank. We don't want to rush ahead and compete with banks like Kazkommertsbank, BTA, Halyk, or the foreign banks. We want to stick to the market that we know. We have considerable experience and knowledge accumulation, and we have learned from our past mistakes. For example, we have already changed all our lending products and are marketing them now. We understand that foreign borrowing is not the solution to solving shortages in liquidity, and so we are now working on our deposit sites. We've improved a lot. Early in 2010 we had only KZT19 billion in retail deposits, and as of January 1, 2011 we have KZT32 billion. That's 80% to 90% growth, which is the highest in the market. But it's not enough. People should understand that our financial position is much stronger than those banks that didn't do anything with their balance sheets.</p><h4>What is your expectation for the development of e-banking in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>RD</strong> Unfortunately, in Kazakhstan most people do not use the internet. We expect that the take up of internet usage will improve every year. We supply credit cards to all of our customers, and have a Visa financing program. We already cover Kazakhstan in terms of its regions, but one of our strategies now is to expand our coverage to smaller economic centers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of Kazakhstan's significance in the region?</h4><p><strong>TK</strong> We view Kazakhstan as a hub for our Central Asian franchise. It's clearly the biggest economy in the region. It's also by far the most liberalized in terms of its economic policies, its legislation, and its position in the global economy. Kazakhstan has strong potential for continued growth, underpinned by its large mineral and oil and gas endowment, educated population, and political stability.</p><p><strong>AM</strong> It is very important. We are committed to Kazakhstan. We did not close our office during the crisis. We kept it in the same shape it was prior to the global downturn. One characteristic that makes Renaissance Capital special is that it is the first bank to focus on emerging markets, and provided Kazakhstan's geographical location and resource base it becomes clearer how important this country is for Renaissance Capital. Kazakhstan can become the crossroads and center of economic trade between Russia and China. We are also seeing an increasing flow of business between Kazakhstan and Africa, and there is an increasing number of  Kazakhstani clients asking us to bring them opportunities in Africa.</p><p><strong>EA</strong> The expertise here is growing on the lending side rather than on the securities side, whereas in Russia there is a lack of expertise on the lending side. This presents a big advantage, especially when coupled with Kazakhstan's proactive regulatory regime. The market here is much healthier than it is in Russia. The problem is that we do not have the scale. That is the big challenge for Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What are the main trends you've observed in investment banking in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>TK</strong> Kazakhstan is a very attractive market for investment banking, and there are a number of big international names present. Several large Kazakhstani companies are listed in London, such as KazMunayGas, Kazakhmys, and ENRC. These companies focus largely on the mineral and oil and gas sectors, but once again we see promise for companies from other sectors. This creates a very positive backdrop for investment banking in the country. We believe we are well entrenched in the domestic marketplace, and our value-added is well known to local corporate and quasi-sovereign institutions. This awareness has developed over the years, and the market has matured in terms of its understanding.</p><p><strong>AM</strong> The crisis had a strong impact on Kazakhstan, especially on investment banking. During the crisis it was quite difficult to attract investors to Kazakhstani companies. Now we are seeing a tremendous change. We are going back to an environment where Kazakhstan is seen as a very interesting market. There is the interest and appetite to access international markets. The only thing missing is a liquid, efficient, and active stock market. There is a large pension system that is investing in government bonds. This needs to move to investments in the corporate sector. In Poland, for instance, the pension funds were allowed to invest in the stock exchange, and this helped create one of the best capital markets in Central Europe. This might set an example for Kazakhstan. That is what should be the next step.</p><p><strong>EA</strong> The Kazakhstani equity strategy is not really popular because the market is very illiquid. If you look at the market, even foreign majors are privately owned companies, not public companies. In this regard, our exposure is primarily to the debt of the top Kazakhstani banks. At present we consider this a good strategy for comparative reasons, and we are very comfortable with credit. Around 90% of our exposure is in fixed income securities.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the coming years?</h4><p><strong>TK</strong> Reasonably favorable. Throughout the crisis we have remained positive on Kazakhstan because we believe the fundamental aspects of a strong economy are already in place. Kazakhstan has a low level of public debt, along with strong reserves and moderate inflation, with a good outlook for the currency. So overall, we're optimistic about Kazakhstan's economy, and J.P. Morgan wouldn't be here if it wasn't. We were the only investment bank to set up a local office at the height of the global financial crisis. We didn't just want to come here for a year, we wanted to be here for the long term, and we're ready to continue supporting the Kazakhstani market in the future.</p><p><strong>AM</strong> From an investment banking point of view, compared to 2010, things look better. In Kazakhstan, like any other country, we are exposed to external shocks. For this reason Kazakhstan itself is doing very well. I see a sound and healthy business environment. This, however, does not necessarily mean that this will translate into a prosperous investment-banking environment. We had a good start in 2011. Kazakhstan will naturally be perceived as a commodities country. In 20 years this might change, but for investor circles that is the bottom line.</p><p><strong>EA</strong> The buyers of the future will be coming to the commodities market. It is what we call "junior companies" that we are trying to focus on, and that is our specialization. On the private equity side we are focusing on the emerging middle class. In general we see that the extractive industries will continue to make Kazakhstanis consumers rather than producers. From that point of view, our focus is primarily on consumption. Also, we are looking for different ancillary services for the insurance market to meet the demand coming from the medical sector. This will be one of our focus areas going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the level of development in the local insurance sector?<br></h4><p><strong>TU</strong> Although it has been 20 years since independence, the insurance market remains in its initial stages of development, especially in comparison with the banks, which have developed greatly over the same period. The premium income to GDP ratio is still small, at around 1%. In Russia the same metric is 3%, for Eastern European countries it is 5%-7%, while in Western European countries it comes in at around 10%.</p><p><strong>ZK</strong> The insurance sector has only been appropriately legislated for 10-15 years. During these 10-15 years we have seen positive development. Despite the crisis and the decline in the banking sector, the insurance sector grew healthily, especially from 2004 to 2008. In 2010 we experienced 60% growth in non-life, and 10% growth in life insurance. The trigger for the insurance market was of course the government's introduction of compulsory insurance coverage for corporations. This was a real driver in the development of the industry here. Among the new regulations was compulsory employee coverage insurance, so that if something happens at work your employer will be covered. There is also compulsory driver liability insurance. However, the insurance sector is still in its initial stages of development, but it's promising, and the legislation has been prompt and much better than in other CIS countries. Our regulatory agencies and financial authorities did well to make the law clear, and now they're gathering knowledge from foreign experiences with the aim of amending the legislation further. As an industry, we're all learning together and trying to help each other move forward. I personally believe the market will develop quite soon, much faster than the banking sector or any other sector in the economy.</p><h4>How did the global financial crisis affect the insurance sector?</h4><p><strong>TU</strong> In 2008-2009 two or three serious players in the compulsory insurance industry went under because it turned out that many of the policies they issued were false. The money just went into the pockets of private agents, and the companies went bankrupt as a result. This had a very negative impact on the industry as a whole. After that, the FSA stepped in with new, tighter regulations. First off, agency fees were restricted to 10%. Before that there  were no limits. Secondly, since 2009, we have had a central data system in which each company has to enter information on all issued policies and insurance claims. Thirdly, in 2010, it was decided that policies should be issued from the system. On top of that, from January 1, 2011 we have had to issue one standardized blank form, printed by the National Bank. Finally, the police can also check the authenticity of policies from the central data system. The next stage isto add all the information on voluntary insurance into the same system over the next two or three years.</p><p><strong>ZK</strong> When Allianz comes into a country it focuses on basic insurance. In this way Allianz established distribution channels, and introduced corporate governance principals. We looked very seriously at our branch network, and the quality of our employees. Cost and human resources were the two main factors that made it work for us. The trick is to find the optimal model in which clients' needs are satisfied, while our shareholders remain confident that they made a good investment. At Allianz the operations in various countries are benchmarked so that the successful are contrasted with the less successful, thereby allowing us to identify good investments. So far, I believe we're meeting the expectations of our shareholders. We undertook a huge task in restructuring our entire business process, halting retail development as the demand for individual products waned.</p><h4><br>What is your outlook for the future of the sector?</h4><p><strong>TU</strong> There is massive potential here. The corporate sector is still not fully covered, and middle-size corporate entities are not covered. We have a population of around 16 million, and yet very few individuals are insured in any category. So, if we can create this demand in the next couple of years, the insurance industry could generate huge premiums. Thanks to tougher regulations, the trust the public has in the insurance industry should also increase. Our company's target is to be in the top five within the next 10 years. We also expect to see more international players in Kazakhstan in the upcoming years.</p><p><strong>ZK</strong> It's a market full of potential. It's not just the inherent economic potential that's strong; the established regulatory and legal platform is also in superb shape. The government is investing heavily in industrial development, which is the essential market for insurance companies. Of course, investors are waiting to see if the new rules and regulations will stay unchanged in the long term. When it comes to partnerships with other companies, we think it would be great for the market. There are now a lot of smaller insurance companies that are potential targets for foreign investors. Allianz is also growing, and if we grow further we might consider acquiring other smaller successful companies in the market.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the bank been involved in the country's development since independence, and what are some of the highlights from the work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Kazakhstan?</h4><p><strong>GUANGHUI LI </strong>The ADB commenced operations in Kazakhstan when the country became a member state in 1994. The ADB's operations in Kazakhstan involve both public and private sector operations. For public sector operations, since 1994 up to June 2010, cumulative total public sector loan commitments amounted to $2 billion, covering 17 loan-financed projects in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and communications, water supply, sanitation, and irrigation. In recent years, ADB public lending has been mainly focused on the areas of road transportation, SME development, budget support for the government's anti-crisis plan, energy efficiency, and renewable energy development. The ADB's private sector operations in Kazakhstan began in 2006, and they have historically focused on the banking sector, with five private sector financing arrangements to the amount of $375 million. For the time being, the ADB's private sector financing prospects are concentrated on infrastructure projects.</p><h4>The Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) has a mission of forging integration. In what areas would you say most cooperation is taking place?</h4><p><strong>IGOR FINOGENOV</strong> The EDB is unique in its mission to facilitate economic integration. I would like to note that governments and businesses of all our member states support the integration processes. There is a robust economic approach behind such support for integration. Based on the needs of the member states, the EDB focuses on electric power, transport infrastructure, agro-industrial complex, high-tech and innovative sectors, and projects implemented through public-private partnership, as the development of these infrastructures has the most effect on our development of the economy at large.</p><h4>The state program 2010-2014 envisages the diversification of the economy through accelerated industrialization. How has the ADB specifically looked into aligning its efforts with the government's program?</h4><p><strong>GL</strong> The ADB's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) will be aligned with Kazakhstan's Strategy 2020 and the new Five-Year Development Plan, focusing on industrialization and innovation. The CPS is being conceived with the goal of helping Kazakhstan to move beyond middle-income country status. Hence, a strong public-private partnership angle will be forged. This will be synergized with the ADB's and the government's sub-regional (CAREC) activities to foster a "walk nationally and think regionally" concept. It will build on the ADB's past experiences in the country and focus on areas where we have comparative advantages and can contribute to achieving the outcomes envisaged in the government's plans.</p><h4>Do you have strategies to develop trade among your member states that will eventually contribute to the expansion of the Customs Union?</h4><p><strong>IF</strong> The creation of the Customs Union was a breakthrough in the integration processes. It will result in positive changes in business, and we would like to facilitate these positive processes. We have observed an intensification of trade and investment activities taking place between members of the Customs Union, and that the number of applications for financing trans-border transactions is increasing. This is easily explained because the Customs Union reduces administrative barriers to transactions, and the EDB is working to further limit the effects of borders through its activities. We have a program to finance trade operations. We also have a program to support SMEs. For these we work with the commercial banks of our member states. The reduction of customs barriers provides a good impetus for the development of trade and support of SMEs in trans-border areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Standard Chartered play as far as services are concerned?</h4><p><strong>PIK YEE FOONG</strong> Standard Chartered has been present globally for more than 150 years. In the Middle East, where we have been for 90 years, we have a strong workforce of over 85,000 staff of 16 different nationalities in this region. We are also very committed to the region, and our brand promise is a very bold one "Here for good." That speaks of our commitment to the place. Our commitment here and our competitive advantage is really a fact of combining international expertise and experience with local knowledge. It is about bringing that back to the local environment.</p><h4>What is the perception of HSBC in the Lebanese market?</h4><p><strong>FRANÇOIS-PASCAL DE MARICOURT</strong> It is a bank that has been here for a long time. Customers know that it is a stable bank that is safe and secure. Also, it is a bank that can bring international creditability to its clients. I think the international profile of HSBC is something that is really important and makes it unique in the market.</p><h4>What potential is there for growth in the SME segment?</h4><p><strong>PYF</strong> Lebanon is largely an SME market—around 90% of companies here are SMEs. Lebanon is made up of entrepreneurs, and this is reflected in the history of the country. For that reason, we are also an SME-oriented bank and work to support SMEs. We have green environment programs, special reserve requirements, relief programs for lending to certain SME sectors, and so on. All of these are very powerful forms of assistance for SMEs.</p><h4>What is the strength of the Lebanese banking sector and what does it mean for an international company to do business here?</h4><p><strong>FM</strong> Local banks are quite strong and there is a good level of liquidity. For us, as an international company, business is focused on connectivity and the difference we can make for our clients. We have some clients that come to meet us in markets abroad, and we can help in the formulation of plans using our network. The advantage of HSBC is that it can bring best practices to this market and products that might otherwise not be developed for a market like Lebanon.</p><h4>What is your overall vision for the future?</h4><p><strong>PYF</strong> Standard Chartered here in Lebanon is well positioned to grow. Our strategy here is informed by our brand promise. I am very positive about the outlook and the growth of our business here over the medium term, but I want Standard Chartered to be recognized not just for performance. We have three pillars that I would like Standard Chartered to be recognized for. The first is to be recognized in terms of our knowledge and expertise in delivering the right kinds of products and services to our clients, and to help them grow internationally. The second is about Standard Chartered being a force for good in the community. And the third pillar is really about our staff—it is about investing in our staff and being a force for good for them.</p><p><strong>FM</strong> I am quite positive on Lebanon and the financial sector because I feel they have a very strong correlation. We need to operate in a financially stable environment. We can see strong progress liquidity wise. In 2011 we have seen a slowdown in the economy, but we will most likely recover quickly and this will benefit the finance sector. HSBC, as the leading international bank in Lebanon, will benefit from these niche markets and will be able to bring benefits to its clients for years to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Port of Beirut developed as a regional hub?</h4><p><strong>GEORGES T. KURBAN</strong> The port's importance in the Eastern Mediterranean is established because of its strategic location and the facilities it offers. It was the first part of the container terminal, as its natural water depth is ideal. At the time, the shipping industry was growing, as were the ships themselves, and they needed deep water. The only port that could offer this was Beirut. This is why international carriers switched to Beirut. Our company came here for that reason, in addition to the fact that our roots are in Lebanon and so it was a natural move for us to be here and to select Beirut as the regional hub. It is a very good thing for the Port of Beirut to play an important role on the international shipping map.</p><p><strong>CHADI T. HOUKAYEM</strong> Lebanon played an important and leading role since the early ages with its geographical location offering a major advantage. The Lebanese market is unique and has maintained growth despite challenging years when the country has experienced war, political unrest as well as global economic crises. More stability in the country would allow additional growth. Lebanon has been an appealing destination for many global carriers, some of whom are using Beirut Port as a transshipment port for surrounding countries. The abundance of carriers servicing Beirut Port has made the market highly competitive.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p><strong>GK</strong> As a family-owned company, there is a certain dedication that you may not have in a public company. We have a double quality: we are the agent of the vessels and the line, and at the same time we have the mentality of the owners. We care about the interests of the line and the interests of the customer.</p><p><strong>CH</strong> Maersk Line started operations in Lebanon in 1996. A dedicated Maersk Lebanon office was established after six years in 2002. Its first representation was only for Maersk Sealand, until in 2005 Safmarine was joined under the same agency roof. Following the P&amp;O Nedlloyd acquisition in 2005, Maersk Lebanon relocated to Pasteur Street in 2006, representing Maersk Line and Safmarine. Since then, Maersk Lebanon has increased its market share and has maintained y-o-y growth. The Maersk Line product strength for the local Lebanese market is a weekly dedicated feeder connecting Beirut to Port Said as well as direct products to Beirut from the Far East and Europe. Our various products allow Beirut to be directly and efficiently connected to the largest container shipping network available in the market today.</p><h4>What significance do environmental concerns hold for your company?</h4><p><strong>GK</strong> The trend today is to go into eco-containers, eco-ships, and faster load systems. All the new ship builders in South Korea and Asia are building eco-friendly ships. We have equipped our ships with electronically controlled engines, improved hydrodynamics, and waste recycling. We have also developed 130,000 eco-containers with bamboo flooring, low energy reefers, and light steel containers. In all, CMA CGM's efforts have reduced CO2 emissions by 35% since 2005.</p><p><strong>CH</strong> As a global company efficiency is important for Maersk Line. Apart from continuously adjusting to market needs and customers' requirement to maintain our leading role, Maersk Line is committed to help protecting the environment. For Maersk Line, protecting the environment is a question of constant care—in the way we use resources, optimize operations, and handle waste. Operating vessels in an environmentally sound manner requires a balanced and sustainable approach to long-term economic growth. This means seeking solutions that help protect and sustain the environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company developed over the years?</h4><p><strong>MICHEL DE BUSTROS</strong> Chí¢teau Kefraya began operations prior to 1951 planting vineyards, not as a winery, which it later became in 1979. At that time we had such quantities of grape that we decided to move into winemaking. It was a small winery until today, where we produce 2 million bottles per year. During 2010 we hit a problem—the temperature was too hot, almost 44°C, and this badly affected our white grape crops. We are, however, proud to say that our wine is produced using only Kefraya grapes, and we do not bring in any external produce. We have all qualities of wine, including white, rosé, and red, as well as a delicate wine named Lacrima d'Oro, and a cognac brandy called Nectar.</p><p><strong>ZAFER E. CHAOUI</strong> When I became the chairman of Chí¢teau Ksara the country had just exited a period of civil war. My target has been to modernize and invest in all necessary equipment as well as in the grapes that we brought in from Europe. We invested to make Chí¢teau Ksara a piece of art. It is now a very modern facility and boasts the best equipment in the world.</p><h4>What are your main export markets?</h4><p><strong>MB</strong> We initially began targeting France, and that country remains the number one market for us. We are proud to be successful there as France is a large producer in itself. Little by little our export destinations have developed to include countries such as Australia, Brazil, and Japan. We are now exporting to a total of 40 countries on five continents. Many things have contributed to making Kefraya wine appreciated and well known globally. In 1997 Robert Parker wrote an article entitled "An Amazing Accomplishment in Lebanon" in Wine Advocate magazine. Now, those who come to visit Kefraya will find that we are a modern winery with state-of-the-art equipment and the know-how to exploit our tourism potential.</p><p><strong>ZC</strong> We produce around 2.7 million bottles a year. We export 40% and sell the rest locally. We are constantly sold out in white and rosé wines. We cover up to one-third of local production, and, for the moment, we see no need to expand further. The total production of Lebanon is around 8 million bottles per annum, and what cannot be sold locally is easily exported. Indeed, we export to over 30 countries. Our neighboring exports go to Syria and Jordan. We also export to European countries such as France and the UK as well as to the US, where we have three distributors.</p><h4>What types of grape are you using for viticulture?</h4><p><strong>MB</strong> The grape that we produce in the highest quantity is Syrah. We also produce Chardonnay and Viognier for white wine, and Tempranillo for red. Around 15 years ago we also began planting Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvedre, and Carignan, and we are just beginning to harvest those.</p><h4>What range of wines do you offer, and which are the most popular for export?</h4><p><strong>ZC</strong> Roughly 60% of our wine production is red, 20% is white, and a further 20% is rosé. In red wines we have normal red, superior red, and chí¢teau products. At the top of our range is "Le Souverain." This is a wine that we produced for the 150th anniversary of Chí¢teau Ksara in 2007. Our most popular export wine is "Reserve du Couvent," which is a superior red wine.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Air France-KLM has recently gone through a change of strategy to compete with short-haul carriers. How is this shift progressing?</h4><p><strong>FREDERIC GOSSOT</strong> Actually, it is not really a change of strategy, but something Air France needed to do to adapt to evolving markets and to benefit from potential traffic in the French provinces. We will launch regional bases in France starting with Marseille in October of 2011. In Marseille we are going to offer direct flights to more destinations in France and throughout Europe and the Mediterranean area. These regional bases will cut down on the rotation of aircraft, with cabin crews based in the provinces, and this will allow Air France to offer new possibilities at a lower cost.</p><h4>What are your most popular destinations? Is this factor very much dependent on the type of client?</h4><p><strong>NICOLAS MESZAROS</strong> Our pilots can fly anywhere, and our operational certificates allow for this. The destination depends on the client. We have flown around the Middle East and Europe, even to Hong Kong. Our purpose is to offer our clients all the comforts they desire. For example, there are no direct flights to Dalaman in Turkey, and so the only way to get there directly is by private jet. If a client has a business meeting in Riyadh and wants to return to Beirut the same day, this would be impossible without a private jet. Our clients include celebrities, businessmen, and executives that travel for both business and pleasure. For example, Mikhail Gorbachev was one of our clients, and we took him back to Moscow. Placido Domingo was another famous passenger, and we have hosted many politicians.</p><h4>What steps should be taken to raise the visibility of Lebanon as a destination?</h4><p><strong>FG</strong> Lebanon should make itself better known because it is often portrayed negatively in news headlines. Like any country, it needs to carry out a lot of marketing to promote its tourism industry. It is really a question of investment and marketing.</p><h4>Current plans from the government target increasing the capacity of Rafic Hariri International Airport from 6 million to 18 million passengers per year. Do you see the potential for Beirut to become a regional aviation hub?</h4><p><strong>NM</strong> Beirut can be an aviation hub as it is very centrally located for all flights that move toward Asia from Europe. The airport is quite attractive and there is not a lot of traffic. You don't have any time slot issues. The airport needs maintenance facilities, as there are only three in Beirut, and it should be open for more investment and growth. In other countries around the region there are more facilities for the sector on offer.</p><h4>Lebanese culture has close ties to France. How are you hoping to see more Lebanese travellers heading to France?</h4><p><strong>FG</strong> There is a very strong historical bond between France and Lebanon, so I would say there is already a natural flow between the two countries. However, France is a very rich country in terms of culture and of course Paris is not the only place to go. We really hope that a broader range of flights will help the Lebanese discover new parts of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>
